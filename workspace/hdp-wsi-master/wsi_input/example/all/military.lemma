The report prepared by the chief military headquarters in north Caucasus concluded that the Mi-26 helicopter was shot down one week ago by a portable missile .  
In his report an American military scholar concluded that the US military strategy in Iraq is based on a " flawed " logic because it is pursuing two mutually independent goals of changing Iraq 's regime and doing it " quickly and at a low cost . "  
" This week , the entire world was shocked and angry , and the position of America 's moral leadership was damaged because of the terrible pictures of a small number of our US military personal abusing Iraqi prisoners , " Clark said , responding on behalf of the Democrats to Bush 's weekly radio address .  
Kerry , a Vietnam veteran with shining military exploits , is able to be selected as the Democratic presidential nominee , mainly because he is recognized as the candidate with the greatest chance to challenge Bush on the issue of national security .  
Guangzhou Military Region is using test beds as the vanguard to lead its advance .  It is using its focus on difficult points and attacking key problems to promote all-around progress .  It is gradually making S &amp; T training for troops standardized and scientific , and it has seen clear improvements in the quality of unit military training and in the level of combat power of its units .  
At the same time the new Russian military doctrine has conferred on the Russian armed forces the functions of defending the state constitution , and striking at the illegal activities of extremist organizations , organized crime , and terrorism ; the original military doctrine laid down that such tasks should be undertaken by Interior Ministry troops .  
He also severely denounced some countries for putting regional organizations above the UN Security Council or even bypassing the UN Security Council to carry out military intervention in a sovereign country , pointing out that such practice has " severely damaged the existing international collective security mechanism , and the consequences are extremely dangerous . "  
At present , we must further straighten the guiding thought in science and technological training of troops , conscientiously do a good job of making plans , set hierarchies rationally , handle the relationship between common and individual characteristics correctly , as well as strengthen planning guidance and training management .  We must vigorously promote drumming up enthusiasm , promote seeking real results , and promote training solid skills , thereby truly make raising combat effectiveness of military units the objective and result of science and technology training of troops .  
Nowadays , with networks playing a growing role in the political , military , financial , communications , electric power , medical and health , and other fields , hackers ' sabotage activities are becoming increasingly rampant to pose a serious threat to economic order , social stability , and national security .  
His deeds have reflected the mental outlook of the party 's theoretical workers in the new period and provided profound enlightenment and beneficial lessons for conducting ideological and political work in various military units .  
Yu Yongbo pointed out : Unremittingly attaching importance to the weapon of theory and enabling officers and soldiers of the whole army to have a deep understanding in Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought , especially Deng Xiaoping Theory , are the fundamental task and basic project in improving ideological and political work of various military units in the new period .  
The circular states : Personnel departments at all levels should provide preferential policies to meet the personnel needs of state-owned large and medium-sized key enterprises that conform to the state industrial policy , the units that undertake the state 's key construction and scientific research projects for the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , the agriculture , water conservancy , energy , transportation , and telecommunications units that the state strengthens on a priority basis , the units of the pillar industries , and the national defense and military units .  
The " Program on Building Headquarters " upholds the guidance of Mao Zedong Military Thought , Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on army building during the new period , and a series of Jiang Zemin 's important expositions on army building ; is based on the military strategic principle in the new period ; and adopts the principle of building a quality army and strengthening the army with science and technology , thereby making a unified standard for comprehensive construction of our army 's headquarters .  
Ever since the convocation of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , in particular , all the comrades working on the scientific and technological front for national defense and weaponry development have firmly implemented the strategy established by the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission on strengthening the army through science and technology , successfully adapted themselves to the world 's development trend of high technologies and changes in the world 's military field , gone all out to make the country strong , and have attained new achievements of world interest .  
During the theoretical study , the central study teams of the party committees at all levels of the Navy elaborated the major realistic issues in the Navy 's modernization program and preparations for military struggles to more than 100 specific topics for study and practice .  Focused on these topics , they guided the reading , investigations , research , exchanges , and application of the leading cadres at all levels .  
With Chairman Jiang Zemin 's important expositions and the major policy decisions as the guide , the Navy party committee shared the work among its standing committee members .  Through the activities of inspecting and guiding work at the grassroots units , going to sea on the vessels , working and living with the rank and file , and having heart-to-heart talks with them , the party committee introduced more than 30 theoretical research topics , which included political building , military training , equipment scientific research , and logistics supply for Navy building in the new period .  
We must persist in treating war tasks as our ultimate tasks and firmly establish the thought of " doing military construction for future wars . "  In the construction of headquarters , we must truly put the emphasis on winning local wars under the condition of modern technology , especially high technology .  We must strive to improve our military 's ability in planning and directing military construction as well as in organizing and directing troops in fighting .  
They must conform to the requirements of the " Guidelines " and the directives of Party committees , chief officers and higher-level headquarters .  They must strengthen their planning , leadership , urgency and checks and ensure that construction in all aspects is implemented .  They must lay a firm foundation for improving our military 's ability in defense and fighting under modern situations and for striving to promote the transcentury development of the construction of military modernization .  
In line with the current situation and tasks as well as the ideological reality of officers and men , by encouraging officers and men to study , analyze , and discuss theories and to compare and examine themselves with positive examples , this unit has drawn up measures to conduct rectification and correction and concentrated on enhancing officers and men 's sense of responsibility and mission in preparing for military combat with high standards and high quality .  
When washing hands before meals , the crew had to put their hands in the medicinal liquid prescribed by the military doctors .  They had to put their dirty clothes in a tightly enclosed plastic bags lest their smell should spread .  
Deputy Zhang Miansheng , an instructor of a certain unit of Guangzhou Military Region , fully agreed with what deputy Zhu Wenquan said : " Whether it is military exercises , or the fight against flood in 1998 , they expressed the interests of the state and people ; ours is an invincible iron army that dares to fight tough battles , is skilled in ferocious fighting , and fears no bloodshed or sacrifice . "  
The important speech given by President Jiang at the Plenary Session of the PLA Representative Troops fully affirms the achievements made by the military and armed police troops and raises clear requirements for comprehensively promoting the construction of military modernization .  The speech emphasizes that the military must further clearly understand the historical mission it shoulders and provide firm and strong assurance of security for protecting the country 's sovereignty , unity and security , for protecting the people 's labor under peaceful conditions and for reform , opening up and the construction of socialist modernization .  
Only our Party has these important responsibilities .  Our military is the people 's military under the resolute leadership of the Party . Whether or not the military 's Party organizations are firm and strong , whether or not they can become firm fighting forces and whether or not they can play the role of the " Three Representations " are significant to whether or not we can solve the 2 historical tasks , " winning wars " and " not changing the military 's nature . "  
It is widely known that , in both wartime and the peaceful period of construction , our military 's writers and artists have from beginning to end considered themselves the Party 's literary and artistic fighters .  They have always been brave in plunging themselves into the life of fiery struggles and created their works with great enthusiasm .  They have played a very important role in inspiring and encouraging the military 's morale and in improving troops ' fighting power .  
They have made glorious achievements and formed an excellent tradition for the military 's work in the literary and artistic field .  The facts prove that only by being closely associated with the great revolutionary struggles and with people 's putting theories into practice can the military 's work in the literary and artistic field make great achievements and establish its proper social position .  
If our military 's writers and artists can achieve these , they can obtain the rich source material contained in various new and typical aspects of society , reflect the real spirit of the times accurately and in a lively manner , and create highly concise , perfect and successful works with clear characteristics of the times .  
Particularly in the new historical period , our military is implementing a new period of military strategies and principles in a positive way , moving along the road of quality construction and of making the military strong with science and technology , and striving to complete two historical tasks of " winning wars " and " not changing the military 's quality . "  Deep changes are taking place in various aspects of military construction and new people , new events and new trends worthy of being recorded with letters of gold have emerged in large numbers .  
Similarly , if today 's new and promising actors and actresses with potential can not find opportunities to exercise or display themselves , it would be difficult for them to spring up , become outstanding successors of the military 's rank of actors and actresses and truly become pillars of the military 's work in the literary and artistic field .  
Facing the coming new century , how can the military 's literature and art be accepted by society , go out to foreign countries and develop into the future with its own unique aesthetic form ?  This is a new task faced by each of our military workers in the literary and artistic field .  
So , improving the quality of creative works and offering a larger quantity of excellent works involving producers ' great efforts is the most important task among important tasks of the military 's literary and artistic work in the future period .  
In recent years , the military 's literary and artistic workers have been conforming to the spirit of President Jiang 's directive that the military 's construction of spiritual civilization must take the lead in the whole society .  Through assiduous efforts , they have created a large group of literary and artistic works loved by troops ' rank and file and the people .  
A few of them do not even want to become close to or understand the lives of the rank and file .  Some of our military 's literary and artistic workers do go into the lives of rank and file , but they mostly gain just a superficial understanding through cursory observation .  
In general , in literary and artistic creativity , the military must continue to carry forth a major theme while advocating diversification .  The military must encourage and support literary and artistic workers to go deep into troops ' lives and into the lives of the rank and file , to create excellent works reflecting the spirit of our times and encouraging the rank and file to go all out to make progress , and to provide more and better spiritual food for the broad number of commanders and soldiers .  
In the group study of the " three stresses " education , Party committee groups and leading cadres received deep Marxist theoretical education ; some prominent problems in the aspects of Party characteristics and Party working styles were touched and solved ; the Party 's excellent traditions and working styles were carried forth ; Party committee groups ' cohesiveness and fighting power were strengthened ; and people 's confidence in building socialism with Chinese characteristics and in the transcentury development of our military 's construction was strengthened .  
Guizhou used to have a relatively weak industrial foundation ; thanks to the construction and readjustment of remote regions away from coastal areas over the past more than 30 years , a military industrial system has been established in Guizhou , with the three major bases of aviation , space flight , and electronics as its main body .  Today , these three major bases have become an important force in Guizhou 's economic development .  
Introducing able personnel from other parts of the country is , no doubt , a major channel ; yet it is more practical and more economical to arouse the potentialities of existing scientific and technological personnel inside the region .  Besides , the large-scale development of the western region has also provided a rare historical opportunity for the able personnel in the military industry to attain greater accomplishments in their career .  
Third , we should bring into full play the roles of the existing assets stock of the military industry in the western region , vigorously push forward the readjustment and the strategic restructuring of both the industrial structure and capability of the western region , take the initiative to incorporate the military industry into the economy of the western region , and step up the work of extricating enterprises from their difficulties as well as the establishment of a modern enterprise system .  
As far as military strategy was concerned , the United States had adopted a new set of operational methods for high-technology limited warfare following the end of the cold war , but NATO 's operational methods and command systems had not departed completely from the operational approach designed for the prospect of fighting big battles with the Soviet Union . Therefore , there was a lack of coordination between them in the operations .  
The United States led NATO to conduct military intervention in the ethnic dispute inside the FRY and to openly support the " Kosovo Liberation Army , " a terrorist and splittist organization .  This created a bad precedent in supporting national splittism and terrorist activities in the domain of international relations .  The national splittist forces in some countries and international terrorists saw their chance and started provoking and making trouble .  
[ Li Dingfan ] In the new century , the CNNC 's entire line of thinking on development is to further cut the new development path of " integrating military and civilian production , developing nuclear energy power generation , readjusting the structure , giving prominence to efficiency , strengthening management , and invigorating the nuclear industry with science and technology . "  
do a good job in diverting redundant workers to other jobs and increasing efficiency with reduced staff ; put it in a prominent place to improve efficiency ; and establish a new-type small and efficient nuclear technology industrial system based on the integration of military and civilian production .  
In his speech , Yu Yongbo , member of the Central Military Commission , and director of the General Political Department , demanded all levels of the military to strengthen ideological and political work , teach the military-turned-cadres to consolidate the concept of taking in the interests of the whole into account , fully understanding the difficulties of local governments and the units that take in the demobilized army officers , and supporting the economic construction and various reforms of the state by practical deeds .  
He said : The friendly cooperative relations between the two armies of Russia and China in the fields of national defense and military affairs have been developed on the basis of strategic cooperative partnership of good neighborliness and friendliness and mutual beneficial cooperation between the two countries .  
2 .  All sides point out that in line with the agreement on confidence-building in the military field in border areas signed by the five countries in Shanghai in 1996 and the agreement on mutual troop reduction in border areas they signed in Moscow in 1997 , the five countries have established for the first time a zone of mutual trust in their common border stretching over more than 7,000 kilometers , where military activities are transparent , predictable , and controllable .  
Defense ministers of the five countries exchanged views on the issues of implementing the consensus reached by heads of the five countries , summarizing the situation in executing the agreements on confidence-building in the military sphere and on the mutual reduction of the armed forces in the border areas , strengthening the trustful cooperation in military , political , and security spheres among the five countries , and opposing the national separatism , the religious extremism , and the international terrorism .  After reaching a broad agreement on these issues , they issued a joint communique .  
The one-man camouflage smoke launcher and assembled false target that they developed and improved won a third-class prize for military scientific and technological progress .  
By 2005 the CSSIC will have formed a military industrial scientific research and production system based on adequate maintenance and supplies and a relatively complete S &amp; T innovation system and a good operation mechanism , under which the CSSIC 's shipbuilding capacity will have been expanded to 2.2-million tonnes ; 60 percent of exported boats and ships will have used home-made equipment ; five to eight brand-name products with a sales volume amounting to over 1-billion yuan will have been developed ;  
This article criticizes that the US advantages in the economic , political , military , and cultural fields are rapidly growing into a burden .  They have created tensions among old friends , weakened the US appeal to supporters , and made the United States face the danger of losing friends .  And this kind of friendly relationship is a " priceless treasure " accumulated over several decades .  
As a result , with the help of our troops in northern Manchuria , which attacked the enemy forces across the Linjiang three times , our troops in southern Manchuria successfully guarded Linjiang in four battles .  Subsequently , we successfully launched the spring and summer offensive and , as a result , our military situation in northeast China changed from strategic defense to strategic offense .  
We should , via this centralized positive education and regular education , try to insure that each Party member can , aiming at winning modern wars in the future as required , be self-motivated to learn and use science and technology , love the army and learn military skills , acquire solid mastery of skills and contribute to national defense reinforcement and to army improvement of combat effectiveness ;  
For medium-sized and small enterprises , we have tried to gradually develop them into professional and special enterprises characterized by being " focused , excellent , unique , and modern " by helping them increase profits and make up losses , and realize investment diversity through adopting such policies as separating the production of military and civilian products , and make full use of merger for the bankrupt , and turning debt to equity .  
In the military reform conducted in Russia in the past few years , the size of various arms and services has been cut by a big margin , but the strategic missile troops alone have been strengthened and they have absorbed the military aerospace troops and the missile space defense troops .  Russia 's strength for launching nuclear attacks and for reconnaissance , early warning and resistance have been strengthened .  
This is the marked difference between reserve forces and active military units .  To counter this , first political commissars of reserve forces must , when doing ideological and political work , embrace an advanced consciousness and must be fast in making judgement , in transmitting instructions , in giving feedback signals , and in tracking the results .  This is the only way to succeed .  
Only if the problems of each system , each subject and each battle line are solved in a deep and detailed manner and if our fighting capacities are strengthened , only then can the entire army be propelled to prepare for military battles on a deeper and more solid basis and the army can honor the sacred mission assigned by the Party and state at any time .  
But over the years , Lee Teng-hui [ Li Denghui ] has repeatedly provoked the " one China " principle , kept trying to solicit foreigners ' support , and hugely increased military spending for armament development .  Since the 1990 ' s , the national defense spending has grown by an average of 6.94 percent , with over $ 12-billion actual budget per year .  Over $ 40-billion has also been invested in purchasing weaponry , in a vain bid to " resist reunification with force " , which is , in reality , an idle dream .  
As Taiwan Island is a narrow and small area , its military targets are relatively concentrated .  Moreover , Taiwan is close to the mainland , these relatively concentrated targets , in time of war , are susceptible to attacks from all directions and in various forms , and will be destroyed very quickly .  It is difficult to conserve the strength for the second attack and decisive battle .  
While urging the international community to exchange experiences , both positive and negative , in promoting and protecting the rights and interests of ethnic minority groups in accordance with the principle of equal treatment , sincere cooperation , and mutual respects , China opposes the practice of exercising armed intervention against other countries by using the nationality issue as a pretext and relying on military superiority and also resolutely opposes the act of carrying out separatist activities under the pretense of safeguarding the rights and interests of ethnic minority groups . 
The barbaric bombing of Yugoslavia by the US-led NATO forces over 78 days from March to June 1999 pushed hegemonism to a new level that is even more dangerous , threatening , and hypocritical .  That is , a new stage in which , in the name of preventing a humanitarian disaster , they have tied human rights diplomacy and military aggression even more tightly together , and a new stage in which hypocrisy and brutality are combined even more shamelessly .  
Just as our Army building is entering the new millenium , the Central Military Commission has promulgated the Essentials for Reform and Development of Military Universities and Schools , describing a grand blueprint regarding the reforms and development of our military universities and schools at the beginning of the 21st century , and setting forth the preconditions for the prosperous development of military education in the future .  It is a project of fundamental significance to the long-term flourishing of the national defense effort and to the military 's development .  
The " Program " has put forward the overall objective and subordinate objectives for the educational reform and development of military academies in the coming decade , clearly defined the guiding ideology and the development principle for the work , drawn the outline of an educational system in military academies which enjoys the special characteristics of our army , and has put forward a series of mutually supporting and mutually dovetailing major reform measures .  
For this purpose , a " key construction project of military academies " will be activated , under which support will be given to the development of selected key areas with concentrated forces : Within 10 years ' time , about 10 military academies and a number of branches of learning are expected to reach or approach the advanced national level , among which some are expected to reach or approach the advanced international level ;  
and we should take earnest steps to strengthen leadership over the ideological and political building in military academies , give priority to selecting highly capable cadres to form the leading bodies of military academies , and see to it that the school-running work can keep to its correct orientation and that the able personnel we bring up are all politically qualified .  
and the United States is constantly mired in scandals of infringing upon human rights in other countries , and marked by numerous notorious records of its engagement in unjust military aggressions everywhere and disregarding the established principles of international law .  
Relying on its super economic and technological strength while possessing a huge nuclear arsenal , an individual military power has vigorously developed the national missile defense system in an attempt to seek absolute security of its own .  
On this globe we live , if rich countries become richer and poor countries become poorer , if one side continues to accumulate wealth and the poverty of the other side aggravates , if some big powers interfere in internal affairs of other countries everywhere and practice hegemony and power politics by relying on their powerful economy , science and technology and military strength , and if many developing countries can not take part in international affairs on an equal footing and receive unfair treatment or even groundless humiliation , the world will not have peace and development .  
Nowadays , professional national defense communications support service units in Xiamen are known to local army units and civilians as " strong and efficient support service teams out of the military establishment " that are " movable , available , and quick at fixing problems . "  
The teaching methods of the American military , besides the conventional military academy , also extend to continuing education universities , local branch academies , learning by mail , off-post paid study , continuing education technical institutes , and many other methods .  It is regulated that all military bases at the company level , or having over 750 soldiers , must establish a " troop training center " , be responsible for setting up an academy , and assist officers and soldiers to study at local academies .  
After that , Japan set its sight on the objectives of becoming a political power and a military power .  It has attempted to use its powerful economic , scientific , and technological strength to speed up the development of its military strength in order to exercise greater clout in global affairs , particularly in the Asian political arena .  
After the Cold War , peace and development have become major topics that are of common concern to peoples of all nations in the world .  In this situation , Japan has not made more contributions to world peace and development , but has instead used all its armed might to indulge in wars of aggression , expanded its armament without restraint , and attempted to elevate its international status and political and economic interests as a military power .  This obviously runs counter to the historical trend .  
By means of virtual reality , we can transform the future into the present as the direct subject of thinking and achieve the " seamless linkage " between the past , the present , and the future in the realm of thinking .  This brings the mode of thinking more in sync with the systematic , comprehensive , and multidimensional characteristics of military thinking .  
Using network resources and conducting research on the question of launching a people 's war on the net are of strong practical significance in making good preparations for military struggle .  In addition , they are also of profound and far-reaching historical significance in developing the strategic ideology of launching people 's war .  
Our military 's scientific and technical strength lags fairly far behind that of the western armed forces , therefore , the scientific and technological resources in the masses of people will be the essential supplement and effective support for our military to win a victory under inferior conditions during a high-tech war .  
Wei Ziqing ( researcher and member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering ) : The use of satellite navigation is extremely widespread , from outer space to the land and sea , and from military and economic activities to our human and social lives , it reaches every trade and industry , e.g . , space navigation , determining satellite orbits , space surveys and mapping , weapons guidance , traffic and transportation , agriculture , forestry , and mining , geodetic surveys , and rescue and disaster relief , etc . 
The spatial data infrastructure is the key to building the digitized battlefield .  There is a great deal of intricate and complex battlespace data related to military operations , but the primary spatial data includes geodetic references , digital orthographic projection maps , digital elevation models , and digital topographic maps , etc .  
Over a long period of time , our military academies have integrated basic education with professional training .  As a result , our military academies have been vacillating between building a solid foundation for their students and meeting the need of students ' first job after their graduation .  This practice has made it difficult to enhance students ' quality and achieve economic performance of scale .  
The authorized sizes of our military academies are rather irrational .  It is necessary to make great efforts to enhance students ' scientific and cultural foundation as well as their ability in commanding and management .  We should run well the National Defense University , which aims at cultivating senior commanders who participate in the joint training program for officers of the three forces .  
Over the past years , our military junior colleges have provided different training programs for commanding skill and technical skill .  Military academies at the intermediate level have offered different programs for their students in accordance with their professional specialties , for example , military affairs , political affairs , logical affairs , and general staff .  Officers from artillery , armament , engineering , and communications branches have had to learn at different schools to acquire the skill for commanding a particular military branch and the skill for commanding joint operations .  
We should concentrate our manpower as well as financial and material resources on building a group of high-ranking academies and universities that have clear-cut military characteristics .  We should give priority to supporting a group of academic departments and laboratories that have utmost bearing on future wars .  These academic departments and laboratories will play a role as an initiator and demonstrator for all military academies .  
In upholding the new thinking of running schools with an open-minded spirit , we should make the following efforts : We should gear education of military academies toward society , dovetail it with the state 's higher education , learn from the reform experiences gained by local universities , extensively carry out cooperative exchanges , rely on the solid strength of local colleges and universities , and cultivate military officers through joint efforts made by military and civil sectors .  
They should make joint efforts in running schools and in tackling key technical problems .  We should enable military schools gear toward the world by gradually expanding their exchanges and cooperation with their foreign counterparts .  We should make bold efforts in learning and borrowing advanced ideas and useful experiences from foreign military academies by exchanging students and conducting scientific research cooperation with them .  
The reflection of knowledge economy and innovative ability in military domain can be seen in the emergence of intellectual weaponry , informationized warfare , and military units that are equipped with digitized equipment .  This is a fact , which proves that the first and earliest application of advanced and new science and technology is in the battlefield .  Therefore , the innovation of military knowledge , the innovation of military science and technology , and the innovation of strategy and operational method are necessary for defeating the enemy and winning the victory .  
In order to deepen the teaching reform , we should strive to achieve this goal : We should cultivate personnel who are qualified politically and ideologically , who have a top-notch military quality , who have a solid foundation in science and culture , who have a profound understanding of professional skill , who have a rather strong innovative ability , and who have a fine physical and mental quality .  
Chen Xiaojin : Over the past 20 years since reform and opening up , in accordance with a series of important instructions issued by Comrade Deng Xiaoping , including " China-made vessels should fight into the international market , " China 's shipbuilding industry has adhered to export as its orientation ; has forged ahead with pioneering efforts ; has realized such a strategic transformation from " building vessels for military use in the main " to " turning vessels for military use into vessels for civil use and building vessels for civil use in the main " ;  
The fundamental task of the ideological and political construction in military academies and universities in the new situation is , on the basis of winning wars and opposing corruption , to insure constructing high-quality military academies and universities in the correct direction and to insure realizing the purpose of cultivating high-quality talented military people .  
On the one hand , the ideological and political construction should push forward military academies and universities to further emancipate their thinking , change their perceptions , face modernization , face the world , face the future , catch up with the world trend of scientific and technological advances , of military revolution and of educational advances , create famous brands and struggle to be first class .  
In the process of ideological and political construction , we must take improving ideological and political qualities as the first task in cultivating high-quality talented military people ; meanwhile , we should insure students are competent in such aspects as science and culture , professional military skills , physical abilities and psychological qualities .  
At present , our military 's political and ideological work is facing many new problems like how to correctly understand and appropriately handle the relationship of honoring modern educational laws versus bringing to full play our military 's political advantages , teaching scientific and cultural knowledge versus cultivating military people 's ideological and political qualities and stimulating an academic and research atmosphere versus maintaining high ideological unity .  
As in-depth changes in the military fields in the world are caused by the development of modern science and technology , especially high technology , the scientific and technological content of army building and modern warfare has been increased to an unprecedentedly high level .  This has put ever higher demands on the scientific and cultural qualities of our officers and men .  
As far as the present situation is concerned , making full preparations for military combat ( jun shi dou zheng ) is the most realistic and urgent strategic mission for the whole army .  This will have a bearing not only on the realization of the great cause of reunifying the motherland but on whether our army will be able to have the strategic initiative in hand in the future .  
The proliferation of information technology and the trend toward global economic and technological unification have further heightened the speed of technological propagation .  This has moved forward our starting point , skipping certain developmental stages , and providing innumerable opportunities for realizing generation crossing developments in military construction .  
To ensure uniformity with the task of preparing for a military struggle , informationization should be matched with the technical level of troop equipment .  The aim of informationization development of China 's army must keep the world military development in large reference , based on the possible developments in future warfare , particularly the possible operational opponents that might be faced .  We must find exact positions in accordance with the integration of the required and possible , evaluating whether they fit with the highest criteria of future war for integration .  
We need both an overall objective for the entire military and focused practical missions for all military branches and theater troops , confirming different separate goals , remembering not to blindly push for expediency , or go into grandiose projects .  
Instructions , requirements , and working plans from superiors are transmitted through computers , entrusted tasks and work arrangements for the lower levels are received and processed by computers , work implementation progress reports and proposals are also submitted through computer systems , and electronic mail is gradually replacing official documents and the telephone .  Network mechanisms have become an indispensable unified operating method for integrating the American military .  
The present training revolution in the American military is primarily embodied in the use of information , simulation , network , and artificial intelligence technology , and the methods and process in changing training have enabled the troops to receive " full physical and mental " training in simulating the " combined man and machine environment " of real combat .  Before engaging in real fire exercises the troops are already prepared with a fair amount of practice in operational skills , even using simulation to train for weapons systems that have yet to become operational .  
On the basis that an all level network will gradually become familiar with office , strategic , and technical exercises , we should strengthen the joint communications connections of the information networks of all military branches , taking the theater level as the base unit .  In particular we should pay attention to applying computer network technology and satellite technology , gradually expanding the three branches joint network training avenues by forming into one entity the training among combat , support , and logistics systems among the various military branches .  
At present , the most pressing is to cultivate a unified military and technological database to develop talent , and timely extension of investigation of military strong points and survey of large military areas , constructing precise military-use digital mapping .  Thus we will lay a fine foundation for network troop training and operational simulation .  
The regiment commander took his staff officers in charge of training to the company where they set up a group to tackle training bottlenecks with regard to the new equipment .  The group was formed by three platoon leaders , who had just been assigned to the company by a military academy , as well as some of the company 's backbone training personnel known for better education .  After working hard for two months , the group compiled a user-friendly training program and some teaching materials complete with detailed contents and scientific standards .  
We should carry out and implement the Program from the heightened perspective of strategy and the overall situation , should understand at a profound level the important significance of emphasizing the construction of command automation for accelerating our military 's modernization construction and for winning high-tech wars , should strengthen our sense of mission and sense of urgency , should conscientiously follow the principle that local interests are subordinate to overall interests and current interests are subordinate to future interests , and should improve the construction 's overall effectiveness and benefit .  
We have taken the complementary paths of pre-study and modeling , import and self-development , scientific research and production , military products and civil products , and scientific and technological development and nurturing of human talent for scientific research units being brought into the marketplace in order to implement high starting points for development and a name brand strategy and advance into the " open " market seeking new points for profit increase .  
If we combine requirements and possibilities in our considerations , we discover that our army and those of developed Western countries show remarkable differences .  Our army 's equipment development has been carried out in a larger context , ensuring that economic development is the center , and has developed under an increasingly constrained situation .  National conditions , military conditions , and the requirements of the " three steps forward " strategy have all determined that our army must pursue equipment development in strides .  
Operations under high-tech conditions are the combined operations of all the military branches ; and in adapting correspondingly , equipment support can only be planned overall after going through the three branches ' joint support , and only then will there be a rational distribution of resources , organizational chaos be overcome , waste of materials and equipment be overcome , work procedures be simplified , and non-support consumption be lessened , fully putting into play the capability of existing resources .  
In line with a civilian market having abundant technology and products that are suited to the requirements of military equipment , many civilian-use technologies such as electronics technology , information technology , production technology , and materials technologies , all of which have developed rapidly , our army has instituted several " joint logistics reforms " and logistics reforms with " socialized support " as the main content , thus decreasing the burden and lengthening the strides forward .  
From this , our army 's development , based on support , has proceeded only on a shrunken scale , weakening the military 's function in managing society ; the larger development trend has already gradually realized self-support capabilities integrated with socialized support .  
In the face of the " Taiwan independence " forces that are running wild and an adverse international current against China in particular , we must pay close attention to making preparations for a military struggle , keep increasing our defense capacity , do our utmost to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland and to safeguard our state sovereignty and the interests of the people , and ensure that our armed forces are capable of fighting and winning when the motherland and the people need them .  
In the United States , debates revolving round the NMD program are turning hotter , and voices of opposition to it getting louder , in the military and academic circles .  In their public comments , many " celebrities " and knowledgeable personages in society have noted that technically this program has its inherent flaws and poses national security and political dangers .  
We must regard the study and implementation of this important thinking a fundamental approach to and a long-term strategic mission for enhancing party organizations ' cohesion and combat strength , for ensuring the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces , and for accomplishing the two historical tasks of " winning the war " and " preventing degeneration . "  We must make unremitting efforts to study and implement this important thinking so as to improve party building in the armed forces and raise the standards of military construction in all areas .  
The General Staff , Political , and Logistics Departments and major military units held party committee and standing committee meetings on numerous occasions to study and grasp the important thinking .  The principal leaders of these departments and units were personally involved in the mobilization efforts and took the lead in discussing their personal experience and in attending lectures .  
In the course of studying the " three represents , " party committees of the armed forces and armed police units at and above the army level felt that party committees and leading cadres not only should act as model practitioners of the " three represents " but they should also shoulder the responsibility of guiding the party committees of subordinate military units in meeting the " three represents " requirements and advance party building in the military units in an all-round way .  
In recent years , the Chinese military has greatly improved war readiness , training , routine work , living conditions , and other infrastructure conditions .  Basic construction in operational command at the army corps level organs , in war readiness duty , and in automatic network centers has taken initial shape , reached a relatively advanced level , thus providing excellent conditions and effective guarantees for leading organs to practice effective organization , command , and routine management over the troop units .  
We should put special stress on the scientific and technological projects that are of crucial strategic , fundamental , and key significance to our national defense and to our military modernization development , should accelerate our measures for solving key problems in these projects , should make painstaking effort and should work in an independent and innovative manner .  
This division also collected information on a topology of rivers , lakes , bridges , and important military sites , tactical diagrams , and other software systems , totaling more than 100 sets .  Using on-line confrontation and other methods , they probed cross-river , aerial , and railway transportation exercise ; loading of landing craft ; as well as resisting and attacking enemy forces , and accumulated a host of material and laboratory data for mobile combat .  
First , the final document avoids a grim aspect of the current international security situation in order to achieve unanimity in consultations .  In recent years , military factors have increased in international relations , with some military groups being expanded and strengthened .  
This is an important measure that the General Department of Politics took to carry out and implement Chairman Jiang 's important directive on improving the purposefulness , efficiency and creativeness of the military 's ideological and political work , and it is a lively and vivid textbook for the military to deeply promote the ideological and ethic education .  
It is one of our military 's excellent traditions in ideological and political work to help the broad number of officials and soldiers to strengthen their conviction , mold their sentiment and inspire their fighting spirit by singing revolutionary songs .  
In the new situation of reform and opening-up and developing a socialist market economy , when the historic topic of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " lies ahead , it is both the earnest expectation of the Party and the masses and the objective requirement for implementing our military 's sacred mission to strengthen the military 's ideological and morality construction and to cultivate revolutionary military professions with the " Four Haves " .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " firmly takes hold of this critical topic , retells in artistic form that officials and soldiers like to hear and see the brilliant history in which the people 's military united to struggle under the Party 's leadership , reflects the fundamental moral requirements for revolutionary military professionals in the new phase and displays the vigorous and progressive spiritual outlook of modern military professionals , having developed a new thinking on reforming the military 's ideological and political education .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " including not only the booming and forceful songs for marching drills but also the cordial and moving songs for expressing one 's feelings and the lively and impassioned songs for collectively singing in a sing-and-response style , displays through many forms the spiritual outlook and the plain but heartfelt feelings that are unique in our military officials and soldiers .  The words and music of these songs directly relate to the lives of grassroots officials and soldiers and are concise , easily understood , musical and easily disseminated .  
Adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership over the military , improving the competitiveness of winning high-tech wars in the future , loving and devoting oneself to the motherland , making painstaking efforts , officials and soldiers being friendly and loving each other , and maintaining the revolutionary moral integrity and so on are all critical issues that Chairman Jiang has been paying close attention to and has repeatedly laid stress on in recent years .  
By learning and singing these songs , we aim to strengthen the spiritual backbone of revolutionary military professionals , to improve the moral quality of the broad number of officials and soldiers , and to enable them to receive education , to purify their spiritual world , mold their attitude and improve their conscientiousness through aesthetic educational activities conducted in a way that influences their environment .  
All troops should associate singing these songs with ideological and political education , enthusiastically respond to Chairman Jiang 's call that " the military 's civilization construction should proceed at the forefront of the whole society " , make effort to become exemplary figures who put into practice , and enthusiastically spread this advanced ideology and culture .  
We should sing aloud the " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " to enable these songs that are revolutionary , advanced , healthy and progressive to echo in military camps , to enrich our lives , to inspire our spirit , to serve our strengthening and accelerating our military 's fighting strength , to serve our strengthening and improving ideological and political work , and to serve our constructing a socialist spiritual civilization .  
The group of songs reflects the basic ethical demands on the revolutionary military personnel in the new period and is the vivid teaching material to enhance the troop units ' ideological and political building .  
Conscientious organization of the singing of these songs by military personnel is of major significance to nurture high ethical standards for officers and men , to carry forward the excellent tradition and style of the people 's army , to build an excellent image for a powerful and civilized army , and to promote reform of ideological and political education .  
The rich ideological content of those songs realizes the spirit of Chairman Jiang 's major instructions on enhancing the Army 's ideological and political education , warmly eulogizes the nature and purposes of the people 's army and the glorious chapters of unity and struggle under the Party leadership , and displays the spiritual outlook of the vigorous and high-fighting spirit contemporary military personnel .  Songs are varied in style .  
The circular also called on various units to make good use of the compact discs distributed by the General Political Department to teach the singing of those songs , to organize literary and artistic workers to go deep among the troops to help train key cadres , to provide guidance for officers and men in learning to sing , and to bring about the singing of the songs to uplift the ethical standards of military personnel resonate in all barracks via organizing singing contest , holding evening parties , closed circuit television , and cable television .  
The entire army turned righteous indignation into the concrete action of undergoing scientific and technological military training in protest of the flagrant use of guided missile by the US-led Nato to attack our embassy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
In line with their sacred missions and tasks , officers and men adhered to high standards and strove to set first-class standard .  They comprehensively improved their ideological and political quality ; quality of military professionalism ;  
scientific , technological , and cultural quality ; and physical and mental quality .  All these also reflected an important trend in the implementation of the conference spirit by all units : The units closely integrated theory with practice , and always focused on major issues such as direction and strategy , so as to earnestly strengthen ideological and political work , and actively promote military modernization .  
Located in border and coastal areas , Dandong city has many chemical plants .  To step up preparations for military struggles and prevent sudden environmental pollution incidents , the Dandong city government and the army units stationed there gathered materials relevant to the urban unclear and chemical plants attacked during the Gulf War and Kosovo War and drew up a meticulous and thorough emergency plan .  
Strengthening the Party 's and the military 's aims should be taken as the basic requirement for such study programs as Party committees ' central groups , the Party 's life , theoretical learning programs for cadres and ideological education periodically held in the military .  We should devote unswerving , profound and permanent efforts , brand it and root it through periodic and repeated and effectively find answers from the bottom of their heart for the questions of " Why did we join the Party ?  What do we work for ?  
As far as the military is concerned , a very important aspect in adhering to the Party 's basic line is to implement of the strategy of building up the military in quality and to consistently conform to the combat strength standard , with comprehensively strengthening the military 's combat force and making sufficient preparations for winning high-tech wars in the future as both the starting point and the end-result of all our work .  
In leading our army 's modernization , Comrade Jiang Zemin is applying Mao Zedong 's military thinking and Deng Xiaoping 's army-building thinking for the new period while adopting some new practices .  He has put forward the task of " ideological and political education " which is of great importance and epochal significance , emphasized the necessity to put ideological and political education above all else in the army , discussed in many ways how to strengthen ideological and political education , and advanced a series of important thinking .  
Upholding the party 's absolute leadership over the army is always a main subject of our army 's ideological and political education .  After they join the army , the most important education service members receive is " military spirit " .  In the final analysis , when troop units hold lectures , publish blackboard newspapers , show motion pictures , stress traditions , and organize visits to sacred places of revolution , all such activities are closely linked to " the gun obeying the party " .  
Everywhere , from South China Sea outposts to northern borders , from east coasts to snowy plateau , headquarters offices , grass-roots companies and other units have done a great deal of arduous and meticulous ideological education work , focusing on " forever unchanged military spirit " .  Some generals personally give political lectures .  
Faced with the new situation where science and technology are developing rapidly and high technology is being applied extensively in the military field , our army should train a large number of new-type military personnel who are militarily and politically competent and who have acquired good command of modern scientific and cultural knowledge .  This is the key for our army to gain the initiative in future military struggles and shoulder the historical missions entrusted by the party and the people .  
The general goal of relying on regular higher education to train military cadres is , in line with the principle of formulating overall plans , making steady progress , and ensuring quality , to adopt various measures to encourage and attract students of regular schools of higher learning to work in the military after graduation and to establish systems and formulate and improve policies and rules to gradually increase the number of students selected to receive the training and improve the training quality so to secure stable and reliable sources of high-quality personnel for the military .  
By 2010 , military specialized technical cadres competent for both military and civilian services should basically be trained mainly by regular schools of higher learning , and a proper number of graduates from regular schools of higher learning should be selected to fill command posts , so that the knowledge structure and scientific and cultural levels of military cadres can be improved fundamentally and a military personnel training system compatible with China 's national conditions and our army 's characteristics can take shape .  
and for regular schools of higher learning to recruit regular senior high school graduates who are excellent both in character and learning in line with the directional enrollment plans of relevant state and military departments , make sure that they receive necessary military and political training while completing their college courses , and assign them to work in the military according to what they are trained for .  
Relevant State Council departments and provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments are responsible for giving guidance to their subordinate regular schools of higher learning designated to train cadres for the military .  
Units at the military region level will establish offices composed of various functional departments to take charge of the training of reserve military officers .  Major duties of the offices are to organize and guide their subordinate units to select and train students of regular schools of higher learning , provide military and political training , and examine and recruit these students .  
Provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments and relevant State Council departments should clarify the responsibilities of their subordinate functional departments and strengthen guidance for their subordinate regular schools of higher learning to train high-quality personnel for the military .  
We should combine that basis with the thinking of officers and men , carry out psychological adjustment education , provide guidance to officers and men to cultivate lofty ideals , for good mentality , for living well , and to help lay a solid ideological foundation for training " four haves " military personnel .  
The city has developed , in a selected and planned manner , more than 130 projects that can manufacture products both for military and civilian purposes .  To meet the need of military maneuvers , the city has repeatedly made such a conversion in an effort to turn sci-tech achievements into combat capability .  Now a total of 16 high-tech industrial enterprises are able to manufacture military articles to meet various needs at short notice .  
In the meantime , to meet the need of military combat readiness in the new period , they have integrated wartime and peacetime work , coordinated military and civilian affairs , and worked out an overall plan on building regional battlegrounds in cooperation with the troops stationed in the relevant region , by focusing on port , communication , and ship building .  
China 's funds for national defense construction are all used for protecting state security and territorial integrity .  China keeps the army in condition but will not engage in unjust military ventures .  The limited military expenditures are used to raise the living standard of officers and soldiers and improve weapons and equipment .  
This important policy decision contains a scientific summing-up of our army 's practice in qualified personnel cultivation in last several decades , a creative exploration of a way to attain the grand objective of cross-century development in our army 's modernization , and a farsightedness which has a bearing on whether or not our army can march in the front ranks of the world military development in the future .  
He said that our army 's cadre ranks must be developed in an allaround way and up-to-standard ideologically and politically and in terms of scientific and educational level , military occupational specialty , and physical and mental conditions , and they must have a good overall quality .  
After a certain number of years ' efforts , the army 's technical cadres with specialties of both military and civilian applicability will be cultivated mainly through regular higher education , some outstanding regular college graduates will fill the commander 's position of the army 's grass-roots units , and around 40 percent of the army 's annual cadre replenishment will be those trained through regular higher education .  
A constant flow of vast numbers of high-quality personnel with modern science and general knowledge into the army will further optimize the knowledge structure and greatly raise the scientific and cultural level of military cadre ranks , and will provide a strong knowledge , science and technology backing for army building .  
Cultivating military cadres with the assistance of civilian colleges and universities is an inevitable choice made to adapt to the world 's military development trends , to the " Two fundamental changes " in our military construction and to the needs for " winning wars " in the future .  It is a practical step in carrying out and implementing the essence of Chairman Jiang 's directives .  
Judging from the craft 's own characteristics , they can be used for powerful surprise attacks in a short period from its good mobility , easy concealment nature , accurate firing power and strong antipersonnel force .  Therefore , Taiwan 's military considers those crafts as an important component part in fighting at coastal waters .  
In a new historic stage , the construction of the ranks of cadres faces many new cases and new problems , among which is the conspicuous contradiction of the scientific and technological qualities in the ranks of cadres failing to conform to the requirements for constructing our military modernization and for winning regional wars under high-tech conditions .  
We should take a strategic view of being responsible for the future of our military construction .  We should devote efforts to doing well the work of cultivating , using and improving college-graduate cadres .  We should change our thinking , make reasonable arrangements , and create the conditions so that they , in military construction , can make great achievements that are worthy of this great epoch .  
Among these innovations , the solar-energy chargers for three kinds of practical storage batteries that are easy to carry , can be carried in vehicles and are movable were developed by the military transportation and traffic section that took the lead in the whole army in using solar energy batteries to replace the charge of batteries with electricity .  They were developed in line with the characteristics that they are used for air force vehicles and for supporting purpose .  The development has resolved the major difficulties in providing support for air force vehicles for many years .  
With an aim of ensuring " victory during the fight " , these achievements were completed in line with the existing equipment and future tasks .  They demonstrated not only strong support capacity during the troops ' routine flight training but also outstandingly supported major military operations such as war tactics drill in the Western region and national grand military parade in the capital .  
Firepower warfare has lasted a long period in the history of modern wars .  As people have entered into the period of high technologies , brand new contents and characteristics have been added to firepower warfare .  The long-range , accurate , highly efficient , and rapid reaction natures of firepower call for profound changes in the military 's principles and types and methods of fighting , and also set new tests and demands on a country 's war preparations and building of armed forces .  
In local war , one strictly selects military and non-military targets and employs the most accurate and " humane " attack .  This tactic itself shows the political nature and purpose of war , but more and more economic targets of the other side with war potential will be included in targets for attack by firepower .  
Even more serious , the " ABM Treaty " is built on the basis of the theory of relative security ; it brought about relative balance of US and Soviet nuclear offensive and defensive forces through " mutually assured destruction " and prevented either side from carrying out a preemptive nuclear strike , while the US NMD is aimed at achieving its unilateral absolute military superiority and absolute security .  
In the light of glorious achievements attained in military logistical building and reform in the past decade , leaders from the logistics departments of major military units and the Armed Police Corps as well as experts and scholars from some universities and institutes had an in-depth discussion .  Their discussion focused on the epochal background for Chairman Jiang to give major expositions on logistical work , and characteristics and guiding position of his theory .  
Participants unanimously held that Chairman Jiang viewed military logistical building in a new era from the angle of time and strategy , applied Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's ideology on military logistical building , scientifically analyzed new contradictions and problems in logistical work under a new situation , and guided the military to great progress in logistical adjustment and reform by integrating theory with reality .  As a result , the level of our logistical building has been raised markedly and a new trail for military logistical building with a Chinese characteristic has been blazed .  
Evolving around the main theme of " strong support " , the meeting put forward concrete measures for carrying out Chairman Jiang 's expositions on logistical work in terms of fundamental targets , key links , and major methods , making suggestions for military logistical building and reform .  
We should adjust the military 's logistical structure in a scientific manner based on the principle of being qualified , combination , and high efficiency , perfect the support system , strengthen mobile support forces , and enhance the strategic support function .  
In his speech , Wang Ke pointed out that Chairman Jiang 's major expositions on logistical work , which closely evolve around the national and military conditions and address such basic questions as what logistics should be built and how to develop logistics , represent a new development of Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's military logistical ideology , a scientific summary of logistical work 's features and patterns under a new situation , and a powerful ideological weapon and an action guidebook for military logistical modernization in a new era .  
Today the international political situation is becoming multi-polarized and revolutionary innovations have emerged in international military sectors .  Our military bases its fundamental preparation for military struggle in winning local wars under the conditions of modern technology , especially high tech conditions .  The priority of military production is changing from quantity to quality and labor-based to technology-based methods .  
We should depend on ourselves and be innovative .  We should try to make significant breakthroughs in strategic , fundamental and crucial sectors and should devote great efforts to accelerating measures for transforming achievements in scientific research into combat strength and productive forces .  These are urgent and significant issues confronting the colleges and universities of our military .  
In accordance with such a regulation that " the Hong Kong Garrison shall inform in advance the Hong Kong SAR Government before conducting training , exercises , or other military activities as well as activities concerning the public interests in the Hong Kong SAR " , the garrison has informed in a timely fashion the SAR Government or published in advance a public notice in the SAR Government Gazette in accordance with the provisions of the Hong Kong law before conducting an outdoor live-fire shooting exercise .  
An absolute majority of the social organizations or people in Hong Kong have supported or cherished the garrison in a variety of ways ; have agreed that the Hong Kong Garrison is entitled in accordance with the law to all rights , interests , or exemptions as demanded by its duties ; and have shown full understanding for the training , exercises , or other military activities held by the garrison in line with its defense duties .  
Specifically , it is necessary to achieve actual effects in correcting the guiding ideology for work and overcoming the formalism , in enhancing the unit 's level of training the military with science and technology , in strengthening the ideological and political building of the unit , and in resolving the hot and difficult issues which have confounded the grass-roots level over a long period of time .  
For instance , after the Central Military Commission decided the military troops " should not be involved in doing business " but " live on royal food " , the military cut down the real estate scale and stopped its real estate business .  In this situation , how should the military implement an effective administration and prevent its assets from flowing away ?  
Training for our army 's mechanized troops has entered a new phase because we have inspected our science-and-technology military training achievements in a " stage " of war that resembled modern war , and departed from previous " playacting " exercises that were based on wishful thinking .  
First , national independence and liberation of the people had to be achieved - - this was the biggest liberation of the productive force and required opposition of the imperialist and feudal military forces as well as unification of the petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie classes to establish a broad , united revolutionary battlefront .  
When the soldiers ran down the hill , they were already wet and exhausted .  As soon as the exercise ended , cadres of the company promptly exhorted the soldiers that the new equipment training was aimed at testing the comprehensive military quality of soldiers .  They said that even though they had four-wheeled armored vehicles , they still needed to train their two legs , and that only when the strong skills were maintained and new skills were not weak could they realize a new leap in combat strength .  
Amid a wave of criticisms , Tang Yao-ming , chief of the general staff of the Taiwan military , had no choice but to hold an urgent news conference on 7 July . Using fallacious reasoning , he claimed : The so-called " fighting a decisive battle offshore " is very different in meaning from " fighting an offshore decisive battle " .  
Therefore , the unit , relying on its own efforts in the face of these difficulties , took the initiative in carrying out coordinated training with a transportation regiment of the military region , a helicopter wing , and a naval test base under the support of the military region 's relevant department .  For the first time in the entire armed forces , it conducted a long-distance three-dimensional maneuver for its troops by four transportation methods - - " sea routes , air links , railways , and highways " .  The maneuver was a success .  
The general drilling site commander , with a sun-tanned face , declared : This combat drill indicates that , as a number of effective methods of scientific and technological troops training have been converted into combat strength , our army has made substantial progress in rapid barrier-breaking landing , operations to hit strongly built enemy targets , operations to counter precision strikes , camouflage of important military facilities , electronic countermeasure , and computer network protection .  
For instance , there are many outstanding or top-notch people of great academic attainments in society who have attained a high level in scientific research and professional skills , but military units can not enlist them because of their age and physical conditions ; in such a case , we can adopt a measure for employment under contract so that we can use their knowledge , technology , and other intellectual resources and that they can provide services for us in a certain way and at a definite time .  2 .  
The most visible intention was the new Taiwan leader 's public putting forward the military strategic concept of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " in an attempt to turn defensive into offensive and to issue a military threat to the mainland .  
But due to Russia 's stiff resistance , the United States dares not make the plunge outright and is compelled to constantly enhance political , economic , military , and diplomatic relations with Ukraine and with other neighboring countries of Russia and to realize its strategic purposes gradually through " contacts " and in a " trot-like " manner .  
In addition to infiltrating Russia 's neighboring countries , the United States has also accelerated the pace of developing diplomatic and military cooperation relations with Mongolia in a " leapfrog " fashion in an attempt to take advantage of the unique strategic position of Mongolia and to place " an outpost " between China and Russia to monitor and control the movements of China and Russia and to deter Russia from the south and to carry out " peaceful evolution " against China from the north .  
Meanwhile , military lawyers , as political workers , should consider the ultimate goal of their legal services as one of serving the armed forces ' political and ideological construction and increasing the relevancy and effectiveness of ideological and political work in the new period while performing their professional duties .  
Like their civilian counterparts , the legal affairs that military lawyers have to handle involve those relevant to criminal , civil , economic , administrative , maritime , and financial laws , and so they must be totally familiar with the laws and regulations of the country so that they can properly handle the legal affairs in the armed forces and legal affairs that involve both military and civilian departments ;  
Only when military lawyers are fully familiar with the country 's laws and regulations as well as military regulations and rules and understand the spirit of their legislation can they provide military leaders and organizations at different levels with proper legal advice , differentiate competent and incompetent servicemen , differentiate lawful and unlawful behaviors , and help servicemen perform their duties more competently .  
The college conforms to its motto of " dedication , strictness , struggling for might , and being realistic " and creatively promotes education using the name of the " blue Project " , with its theme of loving battleships , loving islands and loving the sea .  This education has reinforced ideals and conviction , the sense of the military soul and the spirit of dedication .  This is compared to rooting " three pillars " so that students will become revolutionary military professionals loyal to the Party and to the people .  
On a military training base in the northern frontier where the winds were strong and grasses were robust , a combined real-troop and live-ammunition military exercise engaging in various arms of the services turned the vast grassland into a spectacular painting of a battlefield .  
In addition to making great efforts to strengthen ideological and political construction , all military colleges and universities should face modernization , face the world and face the future .  All military colleges and universities should be motivated to update their concepts of education , further update curricular content and methodology , continuously add new aspects to existing theories , knowledge , technology and tactics , and form a curriculum oriented toward the 21st century .  
Through reform , all the military 's colleges and universities should enable our military 's colleges and universities to catch up with the world 's technological progress , military revolution and trends in educational development with respect to educational concepts , infrastructure , curricular and research capabilities , and academic levels .  All military colleges and universities should create famous brands , try to be members of the first class , and make greater contributions to cultivating and supplying talented military professionals of high quality .  
It is a major political advantage of our Party and state.Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech is not only a powerful ideological weapon to strengthen ideological and political construction in the military , but also the fundamental strategy for devoting efforts to doing well the positive " Three Stresses " education in grassroots organizations and for correctly handling the relationship between the education and work .  
Long fed up with noise caused by flight training of US military planes , some 5,500 Japanese citizens living near Kadena Air Base in Okinawa angrily filed a suit in Okinawa Prefecture Court on 27 March this year accusing the Japanese Government of an " illegal act " in allowing US forces to set up military bases in residential areas , calling on US forces to immediately cease night flights , and demanding 6 billion Japanese yen in reparation to victims .  
On this foundation , the Guangzhou military area artillery group continues to deepen the trial .  They expanded the " rapid reaction " system to a digital system that is command motor agile , correspondent network convenient , message current , reconnoiter measure diversity , which brings about the entirely digital automation from reconnoiter goal , message handle and assistant determination to the whole process of shooting .  
In the face of air threat under the modern high-tech conditions , the most practical issues lying before the air defense forces in making sound preparations for the military struggle are to create a new theory of operation , new contents of training , new methods of training , and a new ground antiaircraft operational command system by centering on " winning " the future war with anti-air raid as its main aspect so as to meet the needs of future anti-air raid operations .  
Dependents of military cadres are a special occupational group .  Realizing the objective of " people having jobs and jobs being profitable " depends first on favorable policies and second on personal quality .  The latter is more important .  
This sub-section has taken the lead in conducting this new method of joint tri-service transportation under modern operational conditions in the whole army to meet the needs of future military struggles since the formal initiation of the combined service system .  
During recent years , they " sharpened " themselves with the tasks of dealing with the priorities and difficulties in information operations and electronic countermeasures , established more than 20 tasks to tackle difficult problems in science-technology military training , including acquiring new knowledge , mastering new equipment , studying new military tactics and training high-quality personnel .  Through taking specific measures such as fixing the training content , measures , levels , and steps , they institutionalized and standardized science-technology military training .  
The regiment successively built a comprehensive military tactics training ground which integrated the strategy of railway loading and unloading tactics , shooting with light weapons , and positional defense training , and a military officer training center with all functions , built a language teaching room and a simulation training room , introduced a simulation training system with electronic countermeasures and provided a good service guarantee and technical support for reforming the training methods and studying operational methods .  
This regiment was equipped with certain advanced anti-tank self-propelled guns and anti-tank missiles , but some battalions and companies failed to concentrate their main energies on the development and application of the property of the new equipment and the mastery of weapons in hand .  Instead , they put a lot of financial , material and human resources into learning English and microcomputer technology , and making multi-media software .  All battalions and companies of this regiment reported more than 30 science-technology military training achievements to the regiment in a year .  
They sought high-level and large projects , blindly scaled " heights " , and hankered for large projects and " modern methods " .  Some units focused their thinking on making achievements and exploring new spheres and neglected the mastery of existing equipment .  As a result , science-technology military training deviated from the track .  
The thinking of persisting in the " three represents " under the new historical conditions has clearly defined the political direction , political standard , and political requirement for the building of our military ; and is of an extremely important and far-reaching significance to strengthening the party 's ideological leadership , political leadership , and organizational leadership over the military , and to ensuring that our military can forever march forward under the banner of the party and can always retain the nature and the aim of a people 's military .  
We must make bold explorations , and have the courage to carry out implementation in such aspects as the policy system , the organizational mechanism , incentive measures , and means for ensuring a sufficient logistical supply , and constantly enhance the vigor of the military work .  In our innovation of the methods of operation , methods of training , and methods of management , we should set our eyes on improving the quality of our military ;  
and guide the vast numbers of our officers and men to establish a correct outlook on the world , life , and values so that they can always retain the true political color of revolutionary military men .  Third , we should keep to the correct direction , and never waver in upholding the principle that the party should command the gun .  To strengthen the ideological and political building in line with the requirement of " three represents " , the heart of the issue is to uphold the party 's absolute leadership over the military ;  
The grand military review in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the founding of China , and the successful taking over of defense affairs of Macao by the PLA Macao Garrison troops demonstrated to the whole world the fine qualities and new image of a mighty army , a cultivated army and a triumphant army .  
The state security and the people 's interests lie in building up a powerful , modernized , standardized and revolutionary army , in fully preparing for military struggles in the new stage and in winning possible future high-tech regional wars .  
During the combined " circum-Pacific " military exercises staged in June and July , the United States took the lead in conducting a one-week humanitarian rescue operation code-named " Strong Angel " .  Their idea is : If two neighboring nations resort to arms , a third nation ( and its allies ) will send naval forces and marine corps to prevent the war from escalating and thus ensure regional " stability " .  They will also send food , tents , and other necessities of life to the invaded nation .  
A Japanese reporter said in the Tokyo Shimbun that the circum-Pacific military exercise in which the United States plays a leading role was designed to enhance the technological level of naval vessels in a decisive battle , but its nature has changed a great deal " .  " The recent military exercises are a part of the ' non-war military operations ' strategy drawn up by the US Army " .  
The implication is that the US army will take part in military actions not relating to wars staged in all places throughout the world .  These actions serve as an important complement to the strategy by which the US army has won two massive regional wars .  The action comprises keeping peace , achieving peace through mandatory measures , humanitarian assistance , rescue operations at home and abroad , providing disaster relief , and fighting terrorism and narcotics .  
In the 1999 Kosovo war , the United States further turned " humanitarian assistance " into a pretext for interfering in the internal affairs of a sovereign state , raising the " non-war military operation " to a strategic level .  
Sometimes maybe only units of a certain armed service are needed , but usually combined forces including active units and reserve forces are needed " .  " In the meantime , the skills and resources provided by multinational forces , regional organizations , international bodies , non-government organizations , voluntary organizations , and private organizations should be adequately made use of , if possible " , to ensure that the US army 's " non-war military operation " will achieve the intended objective .  
The training exercise command center on board the vessel , which had been jointly set up by the units of the state organs or military units concerned , had found out or tackled problems through coordination ; had revised in a timely fashion both the measures and steps for the wartime emergency mobilization and requisition of civilian vessels ; and had built a faster and highly efficient operational mechanism during the training exercise .  
Due to people 's being tired of and paying less attention to the conventional battle with firepower , confusion has emerged in military theory and the study of military theory on fighting with firepower has seriously lagged behind .  The situation will influence our judgment and selection in the types of a future war and affect our understanding and policy-making in the structure and building of the armed forces .  
Fighting with firepower has lasted a long period in the history of modern wars .  When people have entered into the period of high technologies , brand new contents and characteristics have added to fighting with firepower .  The long-range , accurate , highly efficient and rapid reaction natures of firepower call for profound changes in the military 's principle , types and methods of fighting , and also set new tests and demands on a country 's war preparations and building of armed forces .  
A limited war is to strictly select military and non-military targets and employ the most accurate and " humane " attack .  The tactics itself shows the political nature and purpose of war , but more and more economic targets of the other side with war potential will be included in targets for attack by firepower .  
Relevant military and civilian personnel generally think that frequent exercises not only have rigorously trained the front-support contingent participating in sea battles , but also have strengthened the military-government and military-people relationships in coastal regions and raised the national defense awareness of the masses in these regions .  
At the close of the century , the US accelerated the development of its National Missile Defense ( NMD ) plan , all in the name of defense .  However , the true nature of the plan is to destroy the existing global strategic balance , and to seek to establish a kind of absolute military advantage in both attack and defense .  
The General Department of Politics proposed the education 's objective , composed of four aspects , including " strengthening ideals and convictions , putting into full play exemplary models , improving the atmosphere of the grassroots units and fortifying the role of Party organizations " .  This objective embodies the fundamental requirements of the " three represents " imposed on the Party 's basic-level organizations and its members throughout the military .  
However , when noticing the actual strength and the military movements of the United States , people tend to overlook the fact that the strategic goal of the United States does not simply lie in its pursuit of a military and economic dominance , or in the need for acquiring a guarantee for its national security interests .  Rather , the strategic goal of the United States has another ultimate value , that is , it wishes to " mold " the future world according to its own ideal design .  
The US strategy of human rights and values that we are talking about here is not simply a " soft " power , because it actually interacts with the strong superiority of the United States in the scientific and technological as well as economic fields , and also interacts with the active military presence of the United States in regions concerned .  
In view of the some 100 specialties that had emerged under the new structure , the " leading members " of the brigade 's party committee focused their attention on a " combined capability " which proved to be a key link in the generation of fighting capacity , and issued a " written pledge " : Vying with one another to become " an expert in making a combined use of weapons " in studies , research , training , appraisals , and military exercises .  
The party 's central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core not only consistently upholds Deng Xiaoping Theory and holds high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , but has also enriched and developed Deng Xiaoping Theory in combination with the new conditions and new experience in the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnical policy , military , diplomatic , united front , and party building fields , and added new contents to scientific system of Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
The most fundamental requirement of these is the explicitly stated task for doing ideological and political construction well at military schools in the new situation .  That is : based on " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " , we should ensure the correct direction to build up high-quality military academies and ensure the objective of fostering high-quality military professionals is realized .  
To make it simple , that is to " ensure the correct direction and to produce skilled students " .  This task is based on basic requirements and the historical mission that Chairman Jiang imposed on military schools for ideological and political construction in the new stage .  
It also means and is most crucial to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , adhere to the absolute leadership of the Party , comprehensively implement both the Party 's guiding principle on education and the Central Military Commission 's requirements on running military schools , and maintain the original nature of these schools . " producing skilled students " means to foster high-quality military professionals with a comprehensive training in moral , academic , military and physical aspects and with superior qualities in all other aspects .  
Global interests and responsibilities are the theoretical textbook carefully cooked up by the United States in order to pursue global hegemony , build a geopolitical framework with the Eurasian continent as the main body , and achieve its unipolar strategic goal .  Guided by this strategic goal , the new vision emphasizes joint or combined operations when taking military action , in order to maintain military superiority and create a favorable environment for the United States ;  
The gaining of all-round superiority in Joint Vision is drawn up in light of three changes .  First .  In the wake of the development of transport , telecommunications , and information technology , the trend of economic globalization has markedly speeded up , with the result that US interests and the international environment are closely linked , and this demands that the US military take military action in other regions of the world in joint ( combined ) form ;  
The main aim of Joint Vision in proposing " mutual compatibility " is focused on independent combat by the US military overseas or joint action with allied ( multinational ) units .  
Currently we should put our efforts into in-depth understanding of the specific meaning of preparations for the military struggle in the new period , clarifying the possible specific operational tasks and operational modes we might carry out , and completing training and training the troops to elite status .  
Applying all kinds of advanced simulation equipment and methods ; simulating an almost real combat situation ; putting trainees onto a lively , specific , complex and changing modernized battlefield ; creating a rich battlefield environment ; and allowing the trainees to train in technology , tactics , strategy , and command in a near-real combat situation ; this is the necessary trend for military training development in all nations of the world , and is also the resting place for China 's science and technology to train the troops .  
Base-oriented training is the main mode for functional training .  Possessing the unique characteristics of even more real battlefield simulation , even more normalized organization and implementation , even more scientific training evaluation , and even clearer training results , this mode has already become the development trend in global military training , and is the training mode that must be selected for the Chinese army 's " battlefield " and " market " changes .  
Especially when we face the corrosion and influence of false ideas prevailing in society , constant adjustments in the relationships of public interests and the urgent task of preparing for military struggles , we should find an answer to and resolve the historical issues of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " and should have new and more demanding standards for implementation of the " program " and for the strengthening of grassroots construction .  
Enterprises or local labor and social security departments should help military cadres ' families who were laid off because their enterprises gone bankrupt or suspended production .  Enterprises or local labor and social security departments should follow relevant policies and regulations to protect their basic livelihood condition .  Meanwhile , they should provide them with free professional guidance at least once in a year and free employment recommendation three times a year .  
For military cadres ' families who can not find employment for reasons other than personal one , labor and social security departments can allow them to pay , on a voluntary basis , basic pension insurance fees in accordance with a ratio based on local average wage .  Their pension insurance records can be kept at local employment service organizations .  In addition , they can enjoy exemption or reduction of various management fees .  
With only three years of effort , a common automotive technician has become a " missile expert " The road that Xu Guangfeng has covered is but a detailed embodiment of the pioneering spirit with which officers and soldiers of our military have been trying hard to realize the " two fundamental changes " . 
Under the new international and internal situations , whether or not the Chinese armed forces can keep pace with the military developments in various parts of the world , can win the high-tech wars that might occur in the future , and maintain the character , true color and work style of the people 's armed forces rest primarily with the construction of party organizations in the armed forces ; and also with the mental state , work style , discipline , organization , fighting capabilities and leadership of party organizations in the armed forces .  
Following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the Chinese armed forces ' guiding thought for construction underwent a strategic change .  We have reduced the number of personnel , substantially restructured our sizes , drawn up a strategic policy for military affairs in the new period , and achieved the " two fundamental changes " .  The successes we have achieved have attracted worldwide attention .  
During the process of deepening reforms , we must not waver in upholding all the basic rules governing the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces - - such as the rules on the division of military leaders ' responsibilities and the establishment of political leaders and political bodies in the armed forces - - or rules that the supreme leadership and commanding authority belong to the collective leadership of the party Central Committee , the Central Military Commission , and party committees ( party branches ) .  
Japanese-US joint military exercises have seen great changes in content , form and scale in recent years .  Their advance combat planning has been perfected and their combat capability and level of coordination have been further improved .  The trend of the two sides joining forces in military intervention in the security affairs of the Asia-Pacific region and in the handling of the surrounding situation is becoming more obvious , and this is bound to become a new destabilizing factor in security of the Asia-Pacific region .  
After the cold war ended , the U.S . military 's traditional opponent has gone out of existence .  Driven by its strategic need to assert sole hegemony over the globe with its " new cold-war thinking " and its narrow interest in expanding the increasingly shrinking survival space for military forces , the U.S . military has always been concocting a virtual opponent .  
Third , complexity and uncertainty is constantly growing in the international security environment .  Along with economic globalization , the current rapid development of modern information technology , and the deepening of the new military revolution , both conventional and unconventional security problems have come to the front at the same time ; and the security environment of many countries , especially developing countries , has become more severe and more vulnerable .  
Blair has pointed out at US hearings on numerous occasions that the west Pacific situation does not make one optimistic , and the US forces in the Pacific must therefore be prepared for the worst , and one of the most elementary steps they should take is to deploy cruise missiles on Guam , so that US military response in the west Pacific can be faster and more effective .  
However , the understanding of Klauswitz on purpose and means of war is obscure .  He maintained that there were varied means to achieving a political purpose in war ; however , only combats were " real military actions " , and everything had to be submitted to the highest law of resolving problems by use of weapons " , which finally moved toward the " theory that weapons alone decide the outcome of war " .  
In the local wars that are likely to take place in the future , our military must fully take into consideration the combat power of our military and the demand of a set strategic goal , and strive to achieve the goal of " winning " at a relatively small price when it comes to making a choice regarding the pattern of a firepower combat at the strategic level .  
The creation of military-oriented literary and artistic works that we require means to reflect the mainstream of military life and to keep a lively and vivid record of this great age and the military 's modernization construction instead of generally reflecting the trivial issues in daily life in military camps .  
This requires that creators of literary and artistic works should persistently focus on realistic topics when choosing between historical and realistic ones , and focus on military-oriented topics when choosing between military-oriented topics and non-military ones .  These creators should be enthusiastically concerned about the great process of military construction , firmly take the pulse of life in military camps , and make our excellent spiritual products the satisfactory guide in creating literary and artistic works .  
This requires that we , through profound and solid good work in the grassroots and in close association with the military 's reality , carry out the detailed implementation of the requirement of the " three represents " through a comprehensive improvement of the military 's fighting strength .  Only in this way can we lay down a solid foundation for our military to win modern wars based on technology , especially high technology .  
We should focus on current work assignment and future development all at the same time .  We should ensure that our military talents are equipped with one specialty and many supporting skills and that they are capable of performing alternative work assignments and have a basis for future development .  While focusing on cultivating military talents by using all the facilities and resources the armed forces have , we should also be good at encouraging other sectors to run institutions of higher learning .  
The method of citing examples as a proof and the functional method are both scientific methods for studying a problem .  If we can comprehensively use various advanced methods for the studies of social sciences and natural sciences , then we certainly will have more innovative and advanced elements in our research .  We can avoid the tendency of " paying more attention to the studies of military arts than to the scientific and technology foundation " .  
Meanwhile , we should ensure that military talented personnel have a general understanding of literature , history , philosophy , economy , mathematics , science , engineering , chemistry , biology , and other aspects of knowledge .  With such a background as well as with hard work in practical fields , these people can be all-round persons who can comprehensively utilize various fields of modern knowledge and are equipped with command , professional , and other skills all at the same time .  
The Beijing Military Representatives Bureau has cooperated with five national defense departments of five provinces and cities in northern China , as well as local colleges , universities and scientific research institutes in establishing regional cooperative relations with multiple layers and professions and formed a new pattern of developing military products and scientific research by leaps and bounds .  
The new leading body of the Beijing Military Representatives Bureau conducted in-depth investigation and held a " forum on weaponry development " in late August with the participation of leaders and relevant experts from the offices of science , technology and industry for national defense , in five provinces and cities in northern China , all military enterprises , and military representatives offices stationed in various enterprises and jointly discussed plans with them on scientific research and development of military products .  
Beyond controversy , electronic warfare , military deception , operation secrecy , and psychological warfare are the typical " soft " methods of attack .  And real object destruction is a goal of firepower warfare , in which adjusted firepower weapons are used to hit the enemy 's command posts , command control centers , intelligence centers , and other key places .  
The reason is that if a military attack fails to produce the desired result , especially if casualties of US troops are incurred , it will have a big negative effect on Vice President Al Gore 's quest for the presidency .  On the other hand , the American public has accepted Saddam as the " tyrant " who must be severely punished .  If no action is taken , the Clinton administration will appear weak , which is also not conducive to the creation of an image of authority for Gore .  
Since the beginning of the new stage , especially since the 14th National Party Congress , and facing the complex international situation and profound social change , our military can live through all tests with ideological and political education serving as an important guarantee .  
These changes will exert an extensive , profound and comprehensive influence on the military 's thinking , and challenge ideological and political education in fundamental and temporal ways .  
The " Decision " by the party committee of the PLA General Staff Headquarters pointed out : With a strong sense of dedication to the revolutionary cause and a highly developed sense of political responsibility , Comrade Liu Yixin has brought up large numbers of outstanding talents for the modernization building of our army , and has achieved fruitful results in teaching and scientific research ; and his devotion to the military academic and educational undertaking has set an example for us .  
We should learn from his innovative spirit of " winning the war " and boldly scaling new heights , with which he has developed a strong awareness for guarding against future mishaps , for promoting the country 's scientific and technological development , and for making innovations ; strived to seize commanding heights in the fields of military theories as well as scientific and technological development ; and has achieved tangible results in comprehensively enhancing the ability of our army to " win the war " .  
Party committees at all levels must uphold a strong sense of being responsible for the party 's cause and the military 's construction , think of the future , make long-term plans , devote prolonged effort , and be responsible to generations to come even if they themselves are only in the position for one term .  Party committees at all levels must devote meticulous , long lasting , and permanent effort to building up the foundation and to daily implementation so as to realize overall improvement through overall consolidation and pursue comprehensive implementation through comprehensive progress .  
In the broad sense , saving oneself means to save your side 's material and mental strength , specifically including your side 's land , people , and actual political , military , and economic strength , as well as the nation 's or people 's will to resist , etc . , i.e . , what is commonly known as overall national strength .  
Through military training , students have enhanced concept of national defense and sense of organization and discipline , raised their ideological and political consciousness , received education on patriotism and collectivism , promoted their all-round development of morality , intelligence , and physique , and laid down a firm ideological and political foundation for becoming a generation of new people with lofty ideals , moral integrity , education and a sense of discipline .  Military training of students has cultivated high quality reserve people for national defense .  
Chen Mingduan demanded that through the forum , all units popularize the experience and practice of advanced units in light of actual conditions and fully strengthen the building of grass-roots party branches of provincial military district units , so as to push forward the implementation of various tasks .  Chen pointed out the need to step up grass-roots party branch building ; properly select cadres and form leading bodies ; enhance training in the military and political quality of party branch members ; implement well party rules and regulations ;  
have built an omnidirectional stationary civil telecommunications network in light of needs of economic construction and market ; and have built an optical-fiber telecommunications network linking up some rural villages or small towns .  Thus in staging military exercises ;  
As to making our civil air defense project construction more efficient , the government and military sectors need to make the building of underground bomb shelters a key part of urban construction , insisting on " mostly construction " .  We need to set growth rates in line with local realities to build a number of underground bomb shelters and integrated peacetime-wartime projects suited to new tactical and technical needs .  
The regulations fullyreflect the great importance that the CMC and headquarters have attached to the development of military colleges , and their concern and care for their teaching staff .  The regulations certainly will play a positive part in enabling the armed forces to bring in outstanding personnel , retaining the mainstay teachers , stabilizing their ranks , and improving the system of establishing specialized and technical positions , and strengthening college construction in all respects .  
They have shown their spirit of persistent struggle and demonstrated excellent sports techniques and displayed the lofty morality of sports .  They have shown the Chinese nation 's outlook of being inspired , struggling for progress , and being vigorous and enthusiastic .  They have contributed to the promotion and development of the Olympic spirit and greatly inspired all ethnic groups of people throughout the country and officers and soldiers throughout the military , who are marching into the new century with their chins up .  
They should learn their lofty passion of fighting for the motherland , their fighting will for struggling persistently and their spiritual attainment of continuous pursuit .  Officers and soldiers throughout the military and the armed police forces should , as the athletes have done , work hard in training , make unswerving efforts , be brave in struggling for " gold medals " in their own posts , and accomplish more magnificent achievements for the People 's Republic of China .  
The military and citizens of the entire country have employed the important words of General Secretary Jiang Zemin to unify their thinking , with each blazing patriotic heart being transformed into a concrete action for supporting and sacrificing to national defense modernization .  
Over the last two years , the scientific and technological military training has brought about profound changes in the guiding principle , contents , means and methods of military training , as well as in military tactics ; and has played an important role in enhancing the troops ' ability of winning in future high-tech war .  
" Let 's see who has won the most awards of reform success and who has scored the highest mark in scientific and technological knowledge contest " .  This was the earlier criterion of some units for appraising and selected advanced units and individuals in scientific and technological military training .  
During the course of scientific and technological military training , more and more commanders and fighters are seeking truth and practical results , emphasizing applicability , wholeness , and actual combat application , and improving their real ability of winning in future high-tech war .  
The Guangzhou Military Region has adopted strict measures to correct once and for all the formalism practiced by some units during scientific and technological military training .  It has issued the following clear and definite instructions : All reform achievements concerning operations must be repeatedly tested in a realistic battlefield environment with actual troops , actual equipment and live ammunition ; to ensure truthfulness , stability and reliability of an achievement , the commanders and technicians who take part in testing it should be charged with clear and definite responsibility ;  
The efforts to seek truth and practical results have made each and every flower of reform in the scientific and technological military training bear the fruit of enhancing the troops ' ability of " winning in war " .  Some difficult questions concerning fighting under high-tech conditions have been effectively solved .  
In guiding the scientific and technological military training of troop units , the Guangzhou Military Region has closely integrated learning new knowledge with studying and mastering new equipment , new skills and new tactics , incorporated them into specific technical and tactical subjects , and turn them into applied training courses which combine knowledge with skill .  In this way , it has had feasible training methods and appraisal criteria and made battlefield application of high-tech knowledge a required course which must be tested .  
Military units have been supplied with some new equipment now .  To make the equipment combat effective , leaders at all levels should first make theoretical breakthroughs , master the operational theories and detailed rules for examining the new equipment , and lead the military units to complete basic training and explore new experience .  
In order for command posts to become more efficient in organization and command in field operations , our department has made new trials .  We have designated pilot units for improving command in field operations , explored command equipment , optimized command groups , made command materials , improved command methods , developed command software , and trained command personnel .  This has made command organs combat effective ahead of the military units .  
To meet the requirement for " being armed in two aspects " , members of party committees at all levels have continuously intensified their study .  However , in both the range and quality of their study and the conversion and application of the study results , they still fall short of the demand for " winning the war " .  More conspicuous are the inadequate study of military theories and military high-tech knowledge and the lack of versatile personnel .  
He regarded political work as the lifeline of Army building and conscientiously organized units to study the resolution of the Gutian Conference and the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention . He promoted democracy in the three main fields , inspired the political consciousness of officers and men , worked hard to raise the military and political quality of the units , and educated them to forever preserve the true colors and fighting style of a people 's Army .  
The training quality will directly affect the implementation of work related to combat readiness .  In giving training guidance , this department persisted in guiding the equipment training practice with scientific and technological achievements , and chanted the slogan of " conducting training with science and technology and doing everything for the sake of winning the battle " during the training .  It also probed into the law governing military training with science and technology in order to seek development in equipment training .  
In view of the " shortcomings " and weak points in the building of equipment department , this department vigorously carried out , organized , and directed the training while selecting personnel and grasping professional basic training .  It also cultivated equipment commanders at all levels who have military theoretical accomplishment and macro decision-making awareness , and raised the organizational and planning ability of equipment organs .  
A military simulation system of the current advanced international level in the form of an online exercise technological platform has been manufactured after six years of development jointly carried out by dozens of the whole army 's academies and schools and scientific research units .  
Fu Quanyou gave a speech after watching the achievement-exchanges in online drill till its finish .  He said , at this crucial juncture when our army 's modernization drive is advancing toward the 21st century , President Jiang Zemin noted with great foresight : " Using computer technology to carry out simulated training is a prominent characteristic of military training in the developed countries .  
The " opinion " also proposes explicit requirements on solutions to many realistic problems in ideological and political construction throughout military academies and universities .  These five documents were formulated in accordance with the " Opinion " on the basis of extensive investigation and study , sufficient solicitation of opinions from every field and repeated study and proof .  They are targeted and practical .  
Practice has fully demonstrated that Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking of revitalizing the military through science and technology is wise and correct .  Practice has sufficiently proven that troop training in science and technology is the fundamental way for improving our military 's ability in winning high-tech wars .  Practice has eloquently shown that revitalizing the military through science and technology and troop training in science and technology are of vital importance for the overall situation of our military 's modernization construction .  
These heroic units have demonstrated their new graceful bearing in operating new equipment and applying new technology in scientific and technological military training .  
All the achievements in military theory research presented this time deal with major practical questions concerning preparation for military struggle and furthering of scientific and technological military training , with focus on key and difficult questions concerning combined-arms joint operations , air assault and air defense .  They are the result of thorough exploration of the characteristics and law of fighting and scientific and technological military training under the high-tech conditions .  They serve specific purposes , and they are highly directive and feasible , reflecting the latest achievements made by the PLA in military theory research .  
An online long-distance teaching was demonstrated , with main classrooms at the University of Science and Technology for National Defense and branch classrooms at the University of Science and Engineering . The online teaching is adapted to the educational trend of the information era ; and it is an advanced teaching method and a new way to realize independent studies , share resources and train high-quality military personnel .  
The PLA 's success in carrying out the activities of exchanging successful experience of scientific and technological military training will yield an important effect on furthering the scientific and technological military training .  The participants in the activities included the leaders in charge of training and education of major participating units ; the leaders of the air force , naval fleets and second artillery bases under various military regions ;  
By observing the on-the-spot demonstration , exchanging experience and conducting research and study , they have enhanced their understanding of the strategic significance of scientific and technological military training , and they have also added a new motive force to scientific and technological military training .  The scientific and technological military training achievements on display have shown a new direction for military training .  The efforts to sum up and exchange the experience and practices of scientific and technological military training have led us to a new concept for scientific and technological military training .  
The long-standing logistics support pattern , under which the three armed forces had their individual systems and under which barriers existed between different departments and between different regions , was replaced by a joint logistics system , with military regions serving as a foundation .  As a result , logistics support has been put in place in a timely manner , supplies have never been suspended , none have ever been left out or under-supplied , and logistics resources have been reasonably distributed and effectively utilized .  
To better prepare for military struggles , all the company 's officers and men have focused their attention on the magic of science and technology .  With the assistance of their superiors and scientific research departments , they have worked hard and searched for countermeasures to overcome problems , and ultimately developed the simulated ship-based missile launch platform .  This has solved missile launchers ' difficulty in taking aim and launching missiles because of the disturbance by winds and waves while working on the sea , and formulated a complete set of methods for combat and training .  
With the growing high-tech content in modern armaments , there are increasingly high requirements on our armed forces ' officers and soldiers in connection with scientific and cultural knowledge and military technological qualities .  
Therefore , we must scientifically design and plan the work of personnel training in a strategic manner , on the basis of the conditions of our country and our armed forces and objective requirements of future warfare , in an effort to substantially improve the quality of our armed forces ' military personnel quickly and to develop large numbers of high-quality military personnel ready to be used at critical moments .  
The great development of the industrial revolution early in this century made the organization of the military move away from the traditional model of having the infantry ( cavalry ) forces as the dominant forces , with the structure of the military coming to encompass such elements as artillery , armed , engineering , air defense , and naval forces ; the availability and quantities of the new services and arms of the military , characterized by high technological contents , became important indicators of the level of modernization and combat effectiveness of the military .  
Before joining the war in Korea , our armed forces already had artillery , armored , and engineering units , but such units accounted for an extremely small portion of the military as a whole , with the force structure model based on the dominant position of infantry forces remaining unchanged .  
It was because of the recognition of this point that the CPC Central Committee and Central Military Commission timely showed their determination , organizing and strengthening air force , naval and technical army units on the basis of carrying out fighting and force construction simultaneously , and thus achieved the change from a undiversified military into a composite military , thereby greatly improving our armed forces ' force structure and capability for coordinated operations and providing the equipment and technological foundation for prevailing over a strong enemy .  
Guangzhou Military Area Command devoted firm and resolute effort to formulating fighting strength and logistic supply abilities on the basis of military units as a whole .  This measure focused on the crucial point in the current construction of fighting strength throughout the military .  It is of great significance for preparing for military struggles according to higher standards and quality criteria .  
The flames of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea disappeared nearly 50 years ago .  Unprecedented changes have taken place in the international political structure and the world military arena .  However , the valuable experience gained from this war cuts through space-time , exceeds national boundaries , and becomes an extensive and precious historical textbook .  
After viewing the experimental demonstration on management of computer network security conducted by the PLA Security Committee at the Jinan Military Region and after hearing the experiences introduced by various military units , Deputy Chief of General Staff Qian Shugen emphasized that ensuring the network security is by no means a simple issue of security , but is an essential mission to prepare for " winning the war . "  He added that ensuring the network security is a key guarantee for winning the future wars , and therefore maintaining secret means " winning the wars . "  
Designated as the " blue army " in a combined tactical training base , a certain armored brigade of the Beijing Military Region has conducted confrontation exercises with several " red army " divisions and brigades in succession , thus playing an important role in inspecting the military region 's achievements in training with science and technology and raising the quality of the training .  
In accordance with the requirements laid down in its five-year program , the division 's party committee has divided fighting capacity building into four major aspects , namely , political work , military work , logistical support , and equipment and technical support ; has tackled bottlenecks which prevent new-type equipment from turning into all-round fighting capacity by focusing on key and thorny issues ; and has laid a solid foundation step by step .  
It is notable that while continuing to deepen bilateral military alliances with Japan , Australia , and the ROK , the United States is restoring and developing military ties with countries such as Thailand , the Philippines , Vietnam , and Singapore through a variety of military cooperation forms , such as gaining the right to use military facilities , agreements on military unit visits , joint military exercises , and so on , thereby markedly expanding its military presence in non-alliance countries and further increasing its military capability for intervening in Asia-Pacific affairs .  
With regard to strengthening mutual trust and cooperation in the military sphere , although Sergeyev 's visit has avoided another storm arising in bilateral military cooperation ties on account of the espionage affair , the hard ice that has long formed between the two countries can hardly undergo a complete thaw in one or two visits , and " a still more difficult path lies ahead . "  
Since our army 's network and website building is still at such a primary stage as network personnel handling military issues and the majority of our army 's qualified personnel are still of technical support in nature and have yet to extensively develop or apply the existing hardware or software system in terms of functions and in light of operational decision , command , and tactic , faced with the fast advent of information warfare and network warfare , our army should make further efforts to carry out follow-up research ; explore countermeasures ; 
and so on , and should devote more efforts to changing structure of qualified network personnel and training qualified military personnel for fighting a battle on an information network , including qualified command and control personnel at both intermediate and senior levels , qualified personnel who can operate , organize , or manage an information network system , and qualified scientific and technological personnel or groups of personnel who can operate an information network at a higher level so as to bring about such transformation as qualified military personnel operating a network .  
The equipment for the mass defense of military units is in the main complete with quality reaching a good standard .  The preventive capability by specialized anti-chemical warfare units and the overall preventive capability of the Army , the Navy , the Air Force and the Second Artillery Corps have all been significantly improved .  The military units ' fighting capability under the threat of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons has been significantly strengthened .  
We should lay stress on solving urgent subjects in the protection against chemical warfare in main battles and further improve military theory on anti-chemical warfare .  We should gradually establish a scientific and effective research system and provide theoretical guidance for training military units with science and technology and the development of anti-chemical warfare .  
During the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea in the early 1950s , Chinese military personnel had to fight against poison gas .  To meet the need of such an extremely severe situation , China 's anti-chemical scientific research institute , which was still being organized and established then , urgently began to develop the most needed poison-detecting equipment .  The curtain was then raised on the development of anti-chemical equipment for our armed forces .  
Our military personnel also had to rely on domestically made gas masks .  As far as this aspect is concerned , our armed forces now have a series of advanced protective equipment , which is suitable to the physiological feature of all ethnic groups in China and which meets various operational needs .  In addition , China also has a group of world-renowned experts on poison protection .  
At present , our military units have composite decontamination equipment , multifunctional and rapid decontamination equipment , and one-man decontamination equipment , thus forming a complete equipment system .  Such a system , which is comprehensive in function and in technical means , can do a good job in decontaminating the pollution caused by nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons .  Our military units can enter an area contaminated by nuclear and chemical pollution to carry out decontamination work .  
The whole military and armed police forces have meticulously been carrying out and implementing Chairman Jiang 's " five-sentence " general requirement , and grassroots construction has been consistently strengthened and developed in a healthy manner of comprehensive progress and overall improvement .  From this implementation and construction have emerged a large number of advanced examples with outstanding achievements and moving deeds .  
In the 1990 ' s , after the end of the cold war , under international disarmament pressure and opposition from peace forces in Japan , Japan instituted the guideline of " reducing armaments on the one hand while improving the quality on the other " in its military building , and worked to build modern armed forces of " the right scale and ample quality . "  
The current national security concept was put forward by Clinton in 1993 .  Clinton held that as the United States holds obvious military strength and military technology superiority over any other potential rivals , it is completely possible to effectively respond to certain crises and to deal with uncertain factors anytime in the future .  
It has been proved through practice that the military school activities for young people developed in elementary schools and junior middle schools and the military training activities developed in high schools and universities are effective means for conducting national defense education for the youngsters ; therefore , the activities have won common recognition from the students , parents , schools , and society .  
The draft has dedicated an entire chapter to the issue of national defense education for society , and formed stipulations respectively on the formats and demands for developing national defense education by state organs , enterprise units , social groups , committees for city residents , and committees for residents in rural areas ; and the formats and demands of conducting national defense education on militia and people on reserve duty by relevant military organs .  
It has also listed " enlisting graduates from an ordinary higher learning institution for military service " as a principal channel for recruiting officers and has further clarified or standardized the two other channels for recruiting officers , namely , " appointing office cadres as officers " and " recruiting professional , technological , or other types of personnel from outside the armed forces as officers . "  
Even when China is developed and powerful in the future , China 's military capability will always be defensive in nature and be limited to satisfying the minimum security requirement of being able to defend the country 's sovereignty , territorial integrity , and legitimate interests .  
Therefore , they should accord to the requirements for specialized knowledge and skills of cadres , choose correct majors and courses and scientifically arrange their curricular activities .  They should diligently study what is needed in their jobs , what is needed for their working positions and they should pay special attention to learning high-tech knowledge and military skills that are urgently needed for winning wars in the future in an effort to strengthen their abilities to lead soldiers in fighting modern wars .  
Issuing and implementing the " armament regulation " will play a positive and important role in profoundly carrying out the strategic military principles in the new period , reinforcing the centralized leadership in the armament work , standardizing the operating mechanism in armament work and establishing and completing the legal system of armament work .  
We should base its implementation on winning modern regional wars , particularly high-tech regional wars , and closely center its implementation on preparing for future military struggles .  We should take needs as the drive , regard technology as the boost , and consider systems as the insurance .  We should strictly carry out the principles , procedures and methods stipulated in the " armament regulation , " comprehensively complete every task in armament construction , reinforce the quality of our military construction and strengthen the military through science and technology .  
Since the cold war , Japan has been more active in pursuing its diplomatic line in seeking to become a world political power ; in military affairs , therefore , it has gradually changed its relatively passive and inward-looking military strategy and army building guidelines of the cold war period , in order to shake off Japan 's international image as a country with imbalance of economic , political , and military status , in a bid to play a greater role in a multipolar world .  
Despite the past 50 years and especially the last 10 since the end of the Cold War , the international environment the US faces has undergone tremendous changes but the " support system " the US established and runs has not changed .  Post-Cold War economic and military conflicts between the US and European Union have not caused any bilateral or multilateral damage .  
Based on the Law of Officers on Active Service in the People 's Republic of China , by implementing systems of officer selection from ordinary universities and colleges , promoting outstanding soldiers and graduates through military academies , the practices have broadened the selection resources of military officers through both channels of internal promotion : military training and external recruitment from ordinary schools of high learning .  In this way , the basic qualities of prospective officers have a sound basis .  
Facing the challenges of the global military revolution and the rapid development of science and technology , only by incessant knowledge refreshment and quality enhancements can officers meet the requirements of winning future high-technology wars .  
With the curtain of the 21st century slowly opening , the incoming tide of economic globalization is surging into every corner of the world .  Economic globalization is sure to have widespread and profound effects on tomorrow 's world , including the economic , social , cultural , and military spheres .  
The new century has only just begun , and with the surging tide of economic globalization , the new arms race about which people are continually concerned is exhibiting a growing momentum which is difficult to check .  It is not easy to be optimistic about the prospects for arms control .  This has cast a dark shadow over the world 's military security .  
To make these means and methods be specific , systematic , and scientific , we must give full consideration to the characteristics of military personnel and the feasibility of these means and methods under current conditions .  We must handle correctly the relationship between " theme " and " variety , " and we must uphold the relationship between the special nature of the Armed Forces and the borrowing of successful local experiences .  Efforts toward structural innovations must move forward along the correct path .  
When moving close to the missile launching front , temporary military airfield , and armored targets of the enemy , the squad immediately made use of the wireless communication equipment to report rapidly and accurately to the commanding headquarters in the rear area .  
Because the United States has become increasingly dependent on satellite support for conducting its political , economic , military , and diplomatic affairs in the past 50 years or so , it feels the pressing need to protect its vested interests in space .  
Starting in the late 1980 ' s and the early 1990 ' s , the US military has stepped up studies and practice in joint training , carried out exploration in the structure , content , order , rules , and means of joint training , and gradually formed a complete set of joint training structures with marked characteristics .  
The US military 's joint training is guided by national security strategy and military strategy and based on joint operations theory ; it strives to gradually make the armed forces into a flexible integrated joint force through carrying out joint training based on requirements , to facilitate the completion of multinational , joint , and multi-institutional missions in wartime or non-wartime military actions , and first of all to be prepared to deal with a large-scale and preemptive regional conflict .  
In order to meet the needs of future combined operations , the US military emphasized that more joint or combined exercises should be organized in future , and in particular the proportion of political military exercises should be increased .  
Political military exercises are a new type of training which the US military has added in recent years ; these can be either joint or combined , and the main characteristic is that many departments take part in such exercises and the grades are high ; apart from the military , relevant academic institutions and government departments concerned also participate .  
For this reason , the US military has assigned the units concerned the task of carrying out extensive legislative investigation and studies and of setting to work to implement the issues that need defining in the leadership structure , theoretical setup , and the relevant rules and regulations involved in joint training , and will continue to produce a series of regulatory documents to ensure that joint training proceeds in a regular and orderly way .  
Look !  In the cyber warfare drill room of the training center of the brigade , a " nuclear warfare " broke out on the screen .  The " blue army " took advantage of its strong military force to give a sudden nuclear attack against the " red army , " thus bringing myriad changes to the battlefield .  
In recent years , following its sustained economic growth , India has become more eager to have its position as a big country recognized .  Therefore , it has continuously increased its national defense budget ( The 2000-2001 national defense budget increased by as much as 28.2 percent . ) and strengthened its military strength in quantity and quality .  
Some Western capitalist countries are trying to bring the process of historical development in the world onto the path they design by making use of the increasingly frequent and close international relations and exchanges and by making use of their political , economic , scientific , technological , and military advantages .  
While failing to achieve their purpose , they began to change their strategies .  While maintaining their economic , political , and military pressure , they shifted the focus onto making ideological infiltration against the socialist countries and took this as an important means of pursuing their " peaceful evolution " strategy .  
Such infiltration is not limited to the ideological and cultural fields , but has also be extended to the economic , political , military , scientific , and technological fields .  In their exchanges with us , they also brought ideological things along with them .  
Leaders and institutions at all levels should strengthen their contact with administrative departments in civilian governments at all levels , properly handle cases in which economic construction projects involve military facilities , crack down on conduct which results in damage to military facilities , and make positive contributions to protecting military facilities and maintaining national security .  
Japan recently published its " Medium-term Reorganization and Equipment Plan for the Defense Force for 2001-2005 . "  It is not difficult to see from this that , to fit in with its strategic goal of becoming a major political power , Japan is now making efforts to develop in the direction of becoming a strong military power , and will build the Japanese Self-defense Force into a new defense force with stronger capability , faster reaction , and more capable of dealing with " peripheral events . "  
The military , as an armed group responsible for carrying out special political tasks , should not only be ready to physically fight in battlefields to complete urgent , difficult , dangerous and heavy tasks given by the Party and the people , but also live through various tests and make mental and physical contributions to the reform and construction .  
The military should reinforce Party-building in the military according to the requirements of the " three represents " and strengthen ideological and political construction in light of the assurance of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption . "  The military should be ready for military struggles with the military strategic principle in the new period as the guideline , profoundly study characteristics and rules regarding not only the military administration in the new situation but also high-tech regional wars , improve leadership skills and devote efforts to solid implementation .  
All in all , to continuously accelerate reform and construction in the military and fulfill the sacred mission , the military must vigorously promote the spirit of emancipating their thinking and seeking truth from facts , the spirit of closely following the development of the era and innovating courageously , the spirit of unswervingly marching forward despite difficulties , the spirit of struggling with painstaking efforts and pursuing effectiveness , and the spirit of disregarding personal fame and interests , being unselfish and dedicating oneself .  
should firmly grasp and successfully conduct training of units of various services or arms in a coordinated way , in such a background as launching joint operations , and by firmly focusing on the needs of a military struggle in the future ; should step up research and training by integrating firepower warfare with information warfare ; should make redoubled efforts to explore coordinated combat command methods or fighting methods in a complicated electromagnetic environment ;  
The spirit of marching forward despite difficulties and advancing with an indomitable will is the precious spiritual wealth made by the Party and the military through prolonged revolutionary and construction practices as well as the embodiment of the positive spiritual state of both Party members and revolutionary military professionals .  
Therefore , the military is facing considerable arduous tasks and many obvious difficulties : the military construction and development lack sufficient funds and their weaponry and armament are still yet to be modernized ; the military also faces great changes in its historical , social and objective environments ; the quality of military professionals is far from meeting the requirements for the modernization construction ;  
As students of military academies , we shoulder the historic mission of relying on science and technology to build a strong army and accelerate the modernization of our army 's armament and equipment .  We must more consciously strengthen our cultivation of Marxist theories and scientific spirit , arm ourselves with modern scientific knowledge , and exert to spread the fruits of socialist spiritual and cultural progress .  We must never allow fallacies of " Falungong " to contaminate our sacred school campuses .  
Since hostile forces and saboteurs at home and abroad seize every opportunity and try by hook or by crook to steal China 's political , military , economic , cultural , and educational intelligence , cases of leakage of secrets are frequent and startling , posing a serious threat to the information security of the party , the state , and the military .  
These leaders and institutions should make full use of every modern news media to propagate the grand prospects of our military modernization project in an effort to attract more outstanding scientific and technological specialists who must be patriotic and determined to strengthen the motherland so that these talented individuals can achieve merit in their military careers .  
In short , every division of the armed forces should like the Party Committee of the Air Force emancipate their thinking , update their conceptions and promote a reformative and innovative spirit by launching as many competitive policies and measures as possible so that the military will really become a " warm land " attracting the majority of China 's excellent scientific and technological specialists .  
These provisions on the basis of reviewing our militarys experiences in information security and confidentiality in the new situation and learning positive practices from foreign countries and foreign military forces not only provide explicit requirements on some crucial issues , but also systematically specify the basic principle , duty and authorization , preventative measures and administrative procedures regarding information security and confidentiality .  These provisions are the fundamental basis for further strengthening the work of information security and confidentiality throughout the military as a whole .  
Leaders and Party commissions at all levels should pay greater attention to the construction of ranks of high-quality military professionals , set up and complete a mechanism of cultivating , attracting , using and encouraging these professionals , and strive to build up a contingent of high-quality military professionals within a reasonable structure , a sufficiently large number of these people and a scientific configuration .  These people should provide a powerful personnel and intellectual guarantee for satisfactory preparation for the military struggle in the new period and thus accelerate military modernization construction .  
Strongly aware of future dangers , allowing no opportunities to slip , and seizing every minute , we will fulfill our work in all aspects , strive for a leap in China 's military modernization in the new century , and comprehensively enhance the armed forces ' defensive combat capability under modern technological conditions , particular high-tech conditions , so as to better perform the sacred mission entrusted by the party and the people .  
On 20 April 2000 , Japan 's House of Representatives approved " Amendment to the Law on Formation of Defense Agency " and decided to set up several new research posts in the Defense Agency , including those for research on nuclear weapons , biological weapons research , and other special weapons as well .  It also decided to set up a research forum for nonmilitary experts on medical science and military science .  
Second , the US military may plan to use Guam as an experimental site for US nuclear submarines in the new century .  For instance , a submarine 's deep-water communications and data image transmission and the suitability of undersea launching of missiles under new fighting conditions can all be tested at the base in Guam .  
It was reported that the circulation line of US nuclear attack submarine has the problem of metal embrittlement and so it has been criticized by the people .  If nuclear submarines are reinforced in Japan , local people are expected to show objections .  Therefore , Guam has become the best choice of the US military .  
Since Iraq recovered its domestic and some of its international air routes , more than 40 foreign planes have flown to Baghdad carrying ranking government officials and humanitarian materials , including even some US political figures , and the " no-fly zone " set up by the United States and Britain in fact exists only in name ; the United States has felt all the more that it " has no face at all " and seeks to demonstrate its powerful military strength and Gulf presence by bombing Iraq .  
Through the long-term revolution and construction , our Party and military have been adhering to their lofty ambitions despite miseries .  They have upheld their great righteousness despite dangers and difficulties and have continuously maintained their mighty strength to unite and fight .  An important part of this is that countless Party members and revolutionary military professionals have been indifferent to personal interests and fame as if they were tasteless boiled water while regarding their careers as being as weighty as a mountain .  
Countless Party members and revolutionary military professionals would dedicate everything in them to liberating the Chinese nation , bringing happiness to the people and revitalizing the country .  The reform , opening up and the development of the socialist market economy have added enormous vitality and historical progress to our construction of material and spiritual civilizations .  
The reporter has learned that these units that were evaluated as tops in training have several clear features : Their major military and political officers are all outstanding commanders , having top overall comprehensive quality , and very strong command and control training ability .  
They have achieved marked S &amp; T troop training results , sharply cultivating high-quality military talent , daring to reform and innovate , adhering to scientific objectivity , reforming training content , improving training methods , and creating innovative training means , to have made a prominent contribution to the in-depth development of S &amp; T troop training throughout the PLA .  
" Small , remote , scattered and directly administered " military units work in such posts as telecom , piloting , scientific and technological studies and logistics supply , and carry out such tasks as fighting , training , military duties and logistics supply .  Most of these units call for high technological levels , shouldering important responsibilities , work in crucial posts , and play a vital role in grassroots construction .  These units are also a difficult issue to handle in grassroots construction .  
To satisfactorily answer and solve the historical topics of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " in the new situation , our military must construct all grassroots units including " small , remote , scattered and directly administered " units into strong fighting groups .  
The Russian President , foreign minister , defense minister , and many other political and military leaders have recently pointed out in speeches or articles that the key factor determining international security in the new century is to maintain strategic stability , and the basis of this strategic stability is the ABM Treaty signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1972 .  
The starting point of this assumption ( namely , guarding against the threat of missile attacks ) of the United States failed to convince Germany . A considerably large number of personages from the military and political circles believed that this is not reasonable .  Because during the Cold War period , the threat of the nuclear arsenal of the Soviet Union to West Europe was many , many times bigger than it is now , did not the East-West balanced posture based on nuclear deterrent ensure the security of Germany ?  
In just three weeks after President Bush entered the White House , he was anxious to increase military spending again .  The objective is to make the United States , which presently holds the largest store of nuclear weapons and the world 's most advanced and strongest standing military , always capable of maintaining its absolute military dominance , as well as further distance itself from all other major countries ' military capacity and consolidating the US position as the world 's " only superpower " .  
During the Clinton years , as the US economy was steadily strong , and salary increases for the non-military sector rose faster than did the military 's , making the military less attractive .  This made many talented people reluctant to serve in the armed forces , and various armed forces personnel in key positions to decide against making it a career .  This affected the overall quality of the US armed forces .  
These Interim Procedures were formulated to meet this urgent need taking the national and military situation at the present development stage into consideration so that these procedures are in harmony with national economic and social development , military construction and the direction in which procedures on resettling retired military cadres will develop .  
The Interim Procedures are more all-compassing , standardized and reasonable than the previous procedures , but since each national and military reform must advance step by step , the establishment and completion of the socialist market economy takes time and the Interim Procedures should be implemented in an enthusiastic , reliable and gradual manner .  It is impossible to thoroughly resolve all contradictions and problems at once that have arise since the implementation of reform and opening up .  
Party committees , political institutions and leaders at all levels should profoundly and satisfactorily do this ideological and political work , guiding retired cadres to think from a strategic perspective of the reforming , dynamic and stable overall situation of the country and the military construction .  
The majority of retired military cadres should maintain and carry forward the excellent traditions of our military , conscientiously be considerate of difficulties faced by governments at all levels , align personal interests with overall ones , embrace and support reform in ones behavior and make new contributions to strengthening the country and revitalizing the Chinese nation .  
After the cold war , when the balance of power tipped toward the West , the United States went one step farther in politicizing the above-mentioned concept of human rights , using military , economic and technological power as a shield and scheming to put respect for human dignity in an unassailable position , making it the starting point and final resting place of peace and development .  The United States imposed her own standard of human rights on all the nations of the world , and changed the human rights question into a political tool for hegemony .  
Firm ideals and convictions are the ideological basis of assuring our revolutionary military professionals are politically qualified and maintaining their essential qualities and the spiritual backbone and resources for these professionals to live through tests , overcome difficulties and make achievements in their careers .  
In promoting the campaign to learn from Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun in the new century , young military professionals must keep our military 's fundamental duty firmly in mind , vigorously promote and develop the " five-point spirits " of struggling with persistent efforts , create endurable ideological styles and acquire competent qualities for " winning wars " through completing ordinary tasks in grassroots construction , through hard work and hardship and through tests of life or death .  
The third generation leadership group with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has the vision and leadership skill to handle various complex situations , face various risks and resolve various difficulties .  This leadership group , which has won sincere support and admiration of the whole Party , the entire military and all ethnic groups of the country , is the loyal , reliable , diligent and promising successor of the cause of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Our military is an armed group for carrying out revolutionary political tasks .  This group should consistently uphold and support the reform , align its interests to the overall interests of national economic construction and serve this construction .  This group should also satisfactorily fulfill its sacred duty of protecting national security and maintaining social stability .  
To continuously advance military construction and reform , fulfill the sacred mission placed on the shoulders of our military , we must carry forward the spirit of emancipating thinking and seeking truth from facts , the spirit of keeping up with the times and courageously innovating , the spirit of marching forward despite difficulties and advancing with an indomitable will , the spirit of struggling with painstaking efforts and pursuing effectiveness and the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career .  
Cadres should consistently educate themselves on Marxist theory , Party members ' ideals and convictions and the excellent traditions of our Party and military .  Cadres should utilize a wartime work style , revolutionary spirit and be fully dedicated to their career to inspire themselves .  As long as they can , they will be struggling for the interests of the Party , the country and the people wholeheartedly and carrying out our military 's sacred mission , as dictated by the times , to the highest standards and to the highest level of quality .  
Under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the CMC with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , the whole army persisted in being guided by Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on army building in the new period and Chairman Jiang Zemin 's series of important expositions on army building , and implemented in depth the military strategic guidelines for the new era ; closely centering on the two historic topics of " winning when fighting " and " not degenerating , " we achieved very great success in vigorously enhancing overall construction centered on modernization .  
Ideological and political building has been further enhanced , preparations for military struggle have been thorough and sound , notable success has been achieved in national defense scientific research and armament modernization , all-round backup capability has been markedly strengthened , and there has been a very big improvement in the army 's all-round combat capability in hi-tech conditions .  
As China is a large country , with an uneven distribution of demobilized military cadres and regional differences in economic development , governments at all levels may face new issues and new problems in carrying out and implementing interim procedures .  This requires we pay attention to the fundamental interests of the Party and the country , correctly handle the relationship between regions and the overall situation , work in a creative manner and ensure solid implementation of every resettlement policy .  
In addition , local governments at all levels must ensure the formulated , detailed rules are beneficial to implementing interim procedures , reinforcing national defense and military construction , appropriately resettling demobilized military cadres , and boosting economic and social development .  
Military cadres at divisional and regimental rank , as the crucial and important motors of military construction , have lived through tests as leaders , accumulated rich experiences in being leaders .  They are loyal to the Party , have a strong sense of professionalism and responsibility , and possess a high , comprehensive quality : of theory , of innovation and discipline .  
I propose that military units stationed in western China should be authorized to take special preferential measures for retaining and attracting useful personnel .  There should be stronger leadership over the programs by which military and civilian authorities will support each other and work together in promoting the construction of a civil society ; and the military should support local economic construction projects with its advantages in terms of personnel , technical , and information .  
Just as the three old military groups " China Returnees Union " , " Sino-Japanese Friendship Association of Veterans " and " Association of Citizen Non-Fighting Soldiers " said in their declaration , this problematic textbook " seeks to nurture people just like those who created an enormous harm on the people of Asia some 55 years ago . "  This type of reactionary education directly influences the future developmental direction of Japan .  
Deputy Chen Jinbiao noted : Under the present new historical conditions , to judge whether the building of party organizations in the military has been reinforced , our ultimate criterion is to see whether the coherent force and the fighting capacity of the party organizations at all levels have been reinforced ; and whether the role of party committees as a leading core , the role of party branches as a powerful fighting force , and the exemplary vanguard role of party members have all been brought into full play .  
Deputies Zhao Yuexin and Liu Jiujun from the basic level indicated : To uphold the party 's absolute leadership over the military , both the senior cadres of our military and the party members at the basic level of the military must take the lead in establishing a sound image for party members , so that the vast members of officers and men can see from the conducts of party members the future and hope of our party , our country , and our military ; and can therefore consciously answer the calls of the party .  
As early as when the clarion call for military training through science and technology was sounded at the " Liaoyang centralized training program , " Chairman Jiang noted that military training through science and technology is an important measure for adapting the military to the trend of worldwide military development , this training was advancing in the correct direction and we should devote consistent and unswerving efforts to this training .  
High-quality military professionals need to be cultivated through military training through science and technology , military professionals need to master high-tech armament through this training , the highly efficient personnel quota system needs to be tested and completed through this training , and advanced military theories need to be innovated and developed through this training .  
With a comprehensive and dialectical understanding of these principles , leaders will not forget to be scientific and pursue effectiveness , take initiatives to use the standard of winning wars and scientific standards to examine and measure every campaign that is aimed at reform and innovation in the process of military training through science and technology and ensure that these campaigns are scientific , feasible and able to live through the test of practice .  
In addition , these leaders should pay attention to following scientific rules , and should not stop at existing theories and understandings when considering the objective reality but rather , in light of the need for winning wars , courageously explore unknown fields , deepen military training through science and technology by means of continuous reform and innovation , and make achievements in this process .  
Therefore , for party organizations at all levels of our army , a most essential and most direct task in their implementation of " three represents " is to conscientiously implement the strategy of reinforcing the army and invigorating military training through science and technology , a strategy that has been put forward by the Central Military Commission ; strive to meet high standards in enhancing the fighting capacity of the troops ; pay close attention to training the troops through science and technology ;  
Since atat present and for a certain present and in a given period of the future , our country will continuously focus on the economic construction , it is impossible for our country to substantially increase its investment in the military spending while the military faces complex and arduous tasks in the military modernization construction which does require an increased of the investment in the military spending .  The contradiction between the affordable practicality of and the need for demanded mmilitary spending will exist for a long time .  
Our military 's current budget-making method was based on the planned economy .  It is true that this method has played a positive role in ensuringassuring the all aspects of military in every construction , but this method has such problems , such as being too general in contents , not being transparent and being too weak to bein binding .  
All Tthese reform all conform to the objective rules of the military 's economic administration under the socialist market economy , and meet the requirements of the national financial reform .  The implementation of these measures will substantially improve the scientific nature of the military spending budget administration and more fullyer allow the military spending budget-making to work as a macro-adjustment and control in our military modernization construction .  
Party committees at all levels should use Chairman Jiang 's important directives on the financial work and the decision made by the Central Military Commission to unite thinking .  They should , from the strategic perspective of the overall situation , clearly understand the great significance of the the military 's budget-making reform , understand relevant policies and regulations , hold the correct attitude towards a possible adjustment of regional interests , and implement the decision made by Chairman Jiang and the Central Military Commission in a resolute and solid manner .  
It is necessary to use the rich knowledge , human resources , and advantages of the scientific and technological strength of military institutions and scientific research institutes to further support science and technology and qualified personnel as well as strive to provide intellectual and personnel support for the great development of the western region .  
In view of the need for developing military science research in the new century , the " regulations " summarize and draw on the successful experience of our army in military science research , emphasize the need to focus military science research on defense construction , army building , and preparations for military struggles in the new situation , conduct perspective study on the issue of winning a local war under the conditions of modern technology , especially high technology , and thus provide powerful theoretical support for the military 's modernization drive .  
Although the " 17 August Communique limits the quality and quantity of weapons and notes that sales will be reduced , leading to " a final resolution " , this is based on the principle that Communist China will adopt a " peaceful solution " to the Taiwan issue .  If this basis is shaken or nonexistent , the United States will have sufficient reason to sell weapons to Taiwan according to the cross-strait military balance and Taiwan 's need .  
Therefore , our military 's attitude toward the recent international focus of topics on Aegis frigates is of a very low key , thinking the heated debate of this topic will not help Taiwan obtain the Aegis frigates .  Furthermore , the Ministry of National Defense indirectly expressed its hope that the domestic military media will lighten the report on this issue .  
We should unite comprehensive efforts from both the military and colleges and universities , give priority to cultivating senior specialists , and cultivate and mold ranks of commanders with comprehensive abilities , contingents of staff with strategic ideas , groups of technological specialists and a larger number of coaches with " capabilities in the four aspects " .  We should focus on improving their abilities in project planning , organizing , administering and teaching .  We should rely on new military professionals of high quality for boosting development of military training through science and technology at deeper levels .  
The majority of military scientific research workers should adapt themselves to the general development trend of the global military revolution , consistently carry forward our military 's excellent valuable resources , enthusiastically learn advanced experiences from foreign military forces and make greater contributions to bringing further prosperity and development to our military science and to boosting national defense and military modernization construction .  
In recent years , leaders of the missile brigade , in order to meet the requirements of future war , have worked hard to master military skills , winning the reputation as the " bellwethers " in scientific and technical drills .  
The leading body invited military technology experts to teach its members the military space technology , guided missile precision control and guide , automatic commanding technology , and other frontier military knowledge of the contemporary world .  Members of the leading body went deep into the training fields and launching pads to carry out technical practices and scientific and technological research , and to guide troops in completing a number of projects on scientific and technical drills .  
Article One These " Regulations " has been formulated in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Law of National Defense , in light of the needs of a future military struggle , and with a view to further developing the Chinese People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) ' s military scientific research cause ; stepping up military theory building ; and raising the armed forces ' fighting capacity .  
Insofar as basic tasks are concerned , military scientific research aims at exploring the law of war , the law of directing a war , as well as the law of national defense building and army building and at offering scientific and theoretical guidance for checking a war ; winning a war , or furthering national defense building and army building .  
( 2 ) Implementing a military strategic principle for the new period ; meeting the requirements of " fighting and winning " and " remaining unchanged in nature " ; facing a modernization drive , the world , and the future ; further developing military practice ; and serving national defense building , army building , and a military struggle .  
( 3 ) Proceeding from the realities in the country and in the armed forces ; drawing upon beneficial experiences from foreign forces ; emancipating the mind ; seeking truth from facts ; boldly furthering explorations ; bravely blazing new trails ; comprehensively adopting modern scientific methods or means ; and developing a military theory with Chinese characteristics .  
After receiving the application from the leader of a topic group , a military scientific research management department of an individual unit may make a plan for appraising , testing , or accepting the relevant research results before sending personnel to do the work and shall submit in a timely fashion a report to a military scientific research management department at a higher level after deeming a research topic suitable for listing in a military scientific research plan for a unit at a higher level .  
Article 36 All units shall support mass activities of military scientific research ; urge or encourage personnel with research capabilities to conduct military scientific research in light of their work ; train or foster backbone personnel for academic research ; or make things convenient or create conditions for the personnel concerned to conduct research .  
Article 37 All units shall do a good job in selecting , assigning , training , or appointing military scientific research personnel ; introduce or refine an incentive mechanism ; give full scope to enthusiasm or creativity on the part of research personnel ; and work hard to build a high-quality contingent of military scientific research personnel , including both full-time and part-time personnel , who are known for political integrity , professional proficiency , a rigorous style , and a rational structure .  
While entering into the new historical era , Chairman Jiang showed great foresight and stood on the high altitude of strategy and overall situation to have put forth the general requirements of five phrases of " being up to standard in politics , perfect in mastering military skills , excellent in work styles , highly disciplined , and effective in safeguard " , which has clearly pointed out the forward direction for strengthening the all-round grass-roots building .  
In conducting major military exercises , combating floods of three rivers and going to the rescue hurriedly in 1998 , holding the grand military parade of the century , marching into Hong Kong and Macao and stationing there to perform defensive duties , our army has demonstrated its spiritual outlook of being courageous , indomitable , and invincible and the good image of being a mighty and civilized army .  
It is necessary to firmly establish the idea of strengthening grass-roots units by science and technology and prospering grass-roots units by talented people .  While improving the ideological and political , military professional , and physical and psychological qualities , efforts should be made to improve their scientific and technological quality .  
Military exercises have been held without interruption .  What is different is that these military exercises have not been conducted in the areas sensitive to Taiwan and have been announced , as were before , by Beijing 's official authorities in a low key through the sensational Hong Kong media .  
Chi Haotian fully affirmed the achievements made by military units and armed police units in participating in and supporting the development of the west .  He emphasized the necessity of gaining a thorough understanding of the strategic policy-decision made by the party Central Committee and CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin and of earnestly strengthening the sense of mission in participating in and supporting the development of the west .  
Currently people generally believe that information security and the task of keeping information confidential is no longer an issue of simply maintaining secrecy , let alone an issue of pure technology .  It is instead a major strategic topic that has to do with national security , economic development , social stability and the success and failure of military struggles .  
Today , as the world moves toward globalization , and more and more nations are resolving international disputes through international institutions or multilateral diplomacy , the American style of wantonly engaging in military ventures is a bit ironic : a great nation that promotes globalization , the nation with the most speaking privileges in the world 's largest international institutions displaying this kind of outdated militaristic view of national security and unilateralism in its diplomacy that rejects multilateral negotiations !  
In recent years , Communist China has rapidly promoted military modernization and its national strength has continued to grow , while economic and trade relations between the two sides of the strait have become increasingly closer .  Besides , the succession of Communist China 's leading power will also take place in the near future .  All those factors have increased the attention of people at home and abroad to the question of arms sales to Taiwan by the United States .  
This Opinion regards Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of the " three represents " as the guideline , gives an eye on the reality of the party-building in the military and explicitly proposes the guiding principle , fundamental objective , major tasks and detailed requirements on extensively promoting throughout the military an educational campaign to maintain the advanced nature of party members .  
An important experience we have accumulated in administrating military units at grass-roots level lies in sticking to " one group and two contingents . "  Practice has shown that every military unit with a solid contingent of party members is strong .  This unit can stand forward at crucial moments and confront difficulties and dangers .  
The party organization of this unit is strong in uniting and inspiring people .  Now that party members account for a considerable percentage of the military and armed police forces , if this contingent is satisfactorily administered , we will provide a solid foundation for the party 's absolute leadership over the military and provide a reliable guarantee for assuring the completion of every task .  
In the process of accelerating and advancing military modernization , if our military 's party members uphold obsolete ideas and concepts , lack high scientific and technological attainment , and lack the ability to skillfully use modern weapons and armaments and to give appropriate commands in modern wars , it will be difficult for these party members to embody the advanced nature of the party members and make great achievements in the military 's reform and construction .  
It is very difficult see the embodiment of the advanced nature in party members like these .  Promoting this educational campaign for maintaining the advanced nature of party members is of great significance for implementing the requirement of focusing the minds of party members on the correct theory , spurring the real work of the military , solving existing problems in the contingent of party members , advancing the military 's party-building in the new period and pushing forward the military modernization construction .  
Powell was the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff . And his thinking for directing military operations is characteristically built on clear principles of national interests , superior military forces , and minimum casualties and the explicit principle of withdrawal .  
Although overseas media vied with one another in carrying " disclosures " on issues such as when Xu Junping defected , what post he assumed in the military , what were the motives for his defection , and what impact his defection would have on the Chinese Communist military , no conclusion had even been drawn .  Moreover , there were even many contradictory stories circulating around , making the already mysterious and unpredictable case more complicated and confusing .  
This former government official , who is unwilling to disclose his name , believes that because their military aircraft crashed in the incident , the Chinese communists will certainly take advantage of this incident to force the United States to apologize , despite the fact that the US Armed Forces Pacific Command announced that the EP-3 plane was performing its mission over the international open sea and did not intrude the Chinese communists ' territorial airspace .  
The readings he finished in six months piled up to over 2 meters high .  He believed that those who are not proficient enough at maneuvering modern equipment can not be counted as qualified military commanding personnel , and only by optimally integrating high-quality personnel with hi-tech equipment , will it be possible to explore the equipment 's utility to the maximum and thus gain dominance in future hi-tech warfare .  
We are ready to make common efforts with Australia to increase mutual understanding and trust , promote friendship and cooperation , and push forward the continued steady and healthy development of bilateral military relations in the new situation .  
" Hong Kong Shang Pao " pointed out in its editorial : The pernicious incident of US military reconnaissance plane colliding with and crashing our military plane has caused an extremely great concern in the international community and particularly in Asia , and it has also aroused a strong indignation among the Chinese people .  
In answering questions from reporters at a press conference today , Zhu Bangzao stressed that the US aircraft that caused the incident was no ordinary plane , but was a military reconnaissance aircraft which , after crashing into the Chinese military aircraft , illegally entered Chinese airspace without the consent of the Chinese and landed at a Chinese airfield .  
Chi Haotian said : Both China and Gabon are developing countries .  The two countries ' cooperation in the political , economic , military , and cultural areas has been remarkable ; and the two countries share common views on a wide range of important international issues .  
He said , international law applies to every country , and this US plane we are speaking of is not an ordinary plane but a military reconnaisance plane which entered China 's airspace without permission after colliding with and destroying a Chinese plane due to carrying out maneuvers contrary to regulations over China 's coastal waters , and landed at a Chinese military airfield .  
Personalities here believe that the benign interaction of the Chinese and Australian senior military officers will be beneficial to developing a friendly and cooperative relationship between the two countries and armies and to maintaining regional security as well .  
Chi Haotian said that China and Qatar established diplomatic ties in 1988 , and relations between the two countries as well as exchanges between the two countries ' military forces have developed ever since .  Chi Haotian said that he is confident this visit from the premier will take the friendly and cooperative relationship between China and Qatar to a new level .  
Fu Dunchun , associate professor of Hainan University , said : a US military reconnaissance plane gathered intelligence in air space over the South China Sea , bumped and damaged our military aircraft , and illegally landed on our territory .  The US side has felt no regret at all , made false countercharges and claimed that " China should be held responsible for the incident . "  The United States has totally exposed its hegemonism .  
In the China-US military aircraft collision accident that took place in the airspace over the coastal area of Hainan Island , the US military surveillance plane in China 's Hainan airspace bumped into and damaged a Chinese fighter and illegally landed on Chinese territory .  The United States did not feel slightly ashamed and uneasy for this but shifted the blame to China . It claimed that " China should be responsible for the accident " and that " China 's fighters should not monitor US surveillance planes that came to spy on China . "  
Sources told us that this large-scale exercise in the South China Sea was based on the background of an incident in the Taiwan strait , with the United States as the main imaginary enemy ; it was imagined that , given the intervention of the US Pacific Fleet , one of the focal points of the exercise to " resist the enemy outside coastal areas and territorial seas " was to counter US military information warfare and reconnaisance .  
Military sources in Beijing have revealed that the military exercise under way in the South China Sea has been affected by the collision incident and been forced to make a major readjustment ; a number of scheduled maneuvers have been cancelled and the focus has switched to dealing with the aftermath , including the order to the exercise units to repeatedly search for the missing pilot and recover the plane .  
During the 1950s , along with a high-degree synthetic development from a unitary structure of the Army to a combined structure for all services and arms , including the Navy and the Air Force , and following its coordinated air-ground operations on the battlefield in Korea as well as its preliminary practice of a joint landing operations at Yijiangshan Island , our military started to put on its work schedule the theoretical study of coordinated operations involving all services and arms , and attained major achievements in this aspect .  
The US military , which was the first to advance and put into practice the idea of joint operations , was also once restricted by the thinking a " unitary service " ; yet through academic debates and the run-in of a series of war practices , a fairly complete system of principles and theories on joint operations has finally taken shape , and is now undergoing constant development .  
As the foremost principle in joint operations , " unified action " requires that all actions be focused on achieving a common goal .  At the national level it requires the integrated use of political , diplomatic , economic , intelligence , and military power to achieve the strategic goals of the state , as well as specific strategic goals which result from that .  
The US military believes that , based on its technical superiority , in future joint operations they " will be able to achieve decisive superiority through asymmetric actions using the power of joint forces to strike at the enemy 's weak points and the skillful use of troops in terms of time and space . "  
The operational concept of " full dimensional protection " which was proposed by the US military in 1996 calls for the establishment of both offensive and defensive measures to deal with information warfare , guided missiles , and nuclear , biological , and chemical weapons of mass destruction .  
If this posture is insufficient to achieve the strategic scheme , then full-dimensional protection will be used to keep one 's own losses to an absolute minimum , maintaining military action freedom and , at the same time , bringing to bear the operational might of integrated C4ISR systems and strike systems to carry out controlled strikes against the enemy 's center of gravity to achieve a decisive victory quickly .  
According to an earlier report in Jiefangjun Bao , since the Taiwan strait crisis broke out , the United States has frequently sent reconnaisance planes to come and go close to China 's coastal airspace in order to step up its gathering of military intelligence on China , and they have even waited for opportunities to sneak into China 's airspace ; Chinese and US warplanes have frequently engaged in midair confrontation and chases , and this collision was by no means a case of accidentally " going too far . "  
The unexpected collision of US and PRC military aircraft at a point 140 km southeast of Hainan , leading to the PRC F-8 fighter plane crashing , and the US EP-3 reconnaissance plane making a forced landing at Lingshui Airbase , is a test of the crisis management ability of both the PRC and the US . It also makes it clear that the strategic partnership relationship is finished , and determines even more how the two regard each other as strategic competitors .  
If it is said that in the era of industrial economy , knowledge could find expression in a combatant 's skills or a commander 's tactics , in a future war , intellectual fighting capacity and knowledge confrontation will respectively constitute a major symbol of military strength and a fundamental characteristic of military confrontation .  
Russia has also merged some of its higher command schools with some of its engineering technology schools and increased courses on engineering technology for its postgraduate students studying in the command specialty by a large margin with an eye on training qualified high-level military personnel who are well-versed in scientific and cultural knowledge and proficient in various military specialties .  
It is the belief in being brave and fighting and defeating competitors and the working style of persistent struggle that was created by our military a long time ago .  It is the teamwork characterized by aligning oneself with the interests of the entire situation and being cooperative .  
During the meeting , relevant consular officials of the Chinese Foreign Ministry pointed out to the US Embassy and Consulate officials mentioned above that after the US military reconnaissance plane bumped against and destroyed a Chinese military plane in the airspace over the coastal waters of China , it , without the permission of the Chinese side , intruded into China 's territorial airspace and landed on an airport in China . This has violated relevant provisions of the international law and relevant Chinese laws .  China has the right to investigate the entire incident .  
The editorial says : The United States claims to be a country being most respectful to democracy and legal system in the world and always talks about human rights and law .  However , its military plane wantonly violated international law and paid no attention to the territories and sovereignty of another country .  
Evidently , it was the US reconnaissance plane that violated flying rules , bumped against and destroyed a Chinese military plane , and illegally intruded into China 's airspace and landed on an airport of the Chinese side , thus constituting a serious violation of China 's sovereignty and territory and threatening China 's national security .  
In the 1990s , he organized the military units to successfully fulfill the tasks of foreign friendly exchanges , equipment and technology imports , academic and technological exchanges , multilateral military diplomatic activity , and maritime military safety negotiations .  
The US military reconnaissance plane 's spying activities in the airspace over China 's exclusive economic waters actually overran the scope of " free over-flight " allowed by international law , and violated the relevant stipulations of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea .  
The Chinese side has also pointed out that when the surveillance aircraft that caused the trouble flew into the airspace over China 's special economic zone , it should respect the provisions concerning the rights of this coastal country .  This act , which is very unfriendly to China , has seriously threatened China 's national security and severely damaged the consensus reached in May last year between China and the United States on avoiding dangerous military actions at sea .  
The reconnaissance behavior of the US military surveillance plane violated the provisions of the " UN Convention on the Law of the Seas " concerning the necessity of respecting the rights of respective coastal nations in overflight of exclusive economic zones , thus posing a serious threat to China 's national security .  
In the past few days officers and men of the PLA units and armed police stationed in Hainan have expressed strong indignation at the incident in which a US military reconnaisance plane collided with and destroyed one of our military planes , intruded into Chinese airspace without permission , and landed at Lingshui airfield .  They have resolutely supported the Chinese Government 's solemn and just stance and directed their fervent patriotism into training and execution of duties .  
The " Plan and Program " points out that by the year 2010 , the whole Army will establish an integrated auditing system in keeping with the joint logistics guarantee system and equipment guarantee system .  The auditing duties and functions will be explicitly defined .  The supervisory mechanisms will be set to work effectively .  The auditing regulations will be improved according to the requirements of military economic reforms .  
In the period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , marked results were achieved in the archive work of our army : In the whole army , an integrated military archive system with full categories , reasonable structure , scientific management , good facilities , and efficient services was set up basically .  Corresponding rules and regulations for archive building and management were also formulated and improved .  A batch of high-quality archive management software was developed .  
It has been learned that , in his recent statement issued to the press inWashington , US Secretary of State Colin Powell for the first time expressed hisregret over an incident in which a US military reconnaissance airplane collidedand damaged a Chinese fighter plane , resulting in a missing pilot whose destinyis still unknown .  
The Chinese Government and people have the right to know why the US sidefrequently dispatched military surveillance planes to China 's coastal waters tocarry out activities , why the US plane violated operational rules and suddenlyveered , bumped into , and destroyed the Chinese plane , and why the US planeintruded into China 's territorial airspace and landed at a Chinese airportwithout permission . 
The entire officers and men of Hainan 's publicsecurity and border defense units , who are shouldered with the security task ofguarding the 1,700-km coastline and 2.1-million square km of ocean , are filledwith righteous indignation at the incident in which a US militaryreconnaissance plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese military plane inmidair over the South China sea and entered China 's airspace withoutauthorization .  One after another , they indignantly condemned the US hegemonicacts .  
Over the past 100 years , the world underwent untold tribulations caused bywars , diseases , hunger , crises , and disasters ; but more importantly , the peopleof various countries carried out momentous social and natural struggles on amagnificent scale , and thus made unprecedented progress in the political , economic , ideological , cultural , scientific , technological , education , military , and medical aspects .  
Reporters Li Kun and Wang Weiping report : Ma Man Kay , president of theMacao China Chamber of Commerce , pointed out that the incident in which the USmilitary reconnaissance plane ramming and damaging China 's military aircraft inairspace above China 's exclusive economic zone and entering China 's territorialairspace and landing at a Chinese airport without permission is a serious onethat has violated international law and violated China 's sovereignty andterritorial airspace .  
Ignoring the international law , the US plane had intruded intothe special economic zone in China 's coastal area , and made a turn to bump anddestroy a Chinese military aircraft .  This is an ironclad fact and can not bedenied .  However , what has been hard for people to understand is that after theincident , the US side has refused to admit its fault .  
The United States has for many years kept conducting military reconnaissance activities along China 's southeast coastal areas , and US military planes have repeatedly appeared in the skies of China 's coastal areas and have even intruded into the line of China 's territorial waters for reconnaissance .  The US plane that bombed into and destroyed China 's fighter this time is a US military reconnaissance plane equipped with sophisticated electronic reconnaissance devices as well as military intelligence gathering professionals .  
The frequent military reconnaissance activities that the United States have conducted in China 's coastal areas despite the repeated solemn representations from the Chinese Government are never out of a good peaceful purpose , but have an obvious nature of hostility and have posed a serious threat to China 's security and interest .  Meanwhile , these reconnaissance activities have obviously surpassed the scope of " overflight freedom " and violated the principle of " overflight freedom , " as stipulated in the " UN Convention of the Law of the Sea .  
China 's military plane tailed after and conducted surveillance over the US military reconnaissance plane , which intruded into the airspace of our coastal exclusive economic zone to conduct military reconnaissance activities , according to the international law and China 's law .  Exercising sovereign right in the exclusive economic zone , and safeguarding the national defense security is just and legal behavior .  
This consensus confirms : The " International Civil Aviation Convention , " signed in Chicago in 1994 , is definitely not applied to military aircraft and national aircraft , but respecting and observing the related rules and the basic demands of the Convention is conducive to ensuring the safety of both sides ' military and civil aircraft flying over the international airspace .  
It is a serious violation of the international law that the US military reconnaissance plane conducted military reconnaissance activities in the airspace above China 's exclusive economic zone , bombed into and destroyed China 's military plane that was carrying out the regular surveillance task , intruded into China 's territorial airspace , and infringed on China 's territorial sovereignty .  
If they carry on a reconnaissance mission near China , they are most likely to be viewed as invading the Chinese communists ' territorial air space , the direct result of which will be the United States and China resuming a dangerous game they had played in the Cold War era with the US military aircraft going on reconnaissance missions .  If so , the US forces are likely to face higher risks .  Moreover , if a similar unfortunate incident occurs in future , no one can guarantee that the US forces will suffer no casualties .  
When our country was conducting military exercises in the East Sea and you , the United States , were engaging in reconnaissance activities , we just ignored you , and you thought that this was very " normal . "  But on this occasion , this incident occurred in an exclusive economic zone of China , or at the doorway of China ; you regarded it as " abnormal " and adopted a tough attitude .  
In recent years , with the gradual establishment of the socialist market economic system , the party central leadership and the State Council adopted more concrete measures for dealing with the prominent problems that were affecting the order of the market economy and for effecting a fundamental turn for the better in this regard .  The measures included the banning of party and government institutions , military units , armed police force , judicial and law enforcement organs from running enterprises ;  
The Pentagon is still sticking to its hardline stance , and has even again sent reconnaisance planes to carry out provocative activities ; apart from showing that the United States is unable to advance any further arguments to justify itself , it shows all the more the current US administration 's blind spots and total ignorance in foreign policy - - at least we have already seen that the diplomats involved in this affair are all military men who lack normal knowledge of foreign affairs , and even lack essential knowledge of Chinese humanity and history .  
Fu Quanyou expounded the development process and historical causes of the world 's new military revolution , analyzed the essential features and profound impact of the revolution , and explicitly put forth our Army 's major counter measures to meet the challenges from the world 's new military revolution .  
Overseas Chinese leaders expressed indignation at the hegemonic act of the U.S . spy plane 's collision with a Chinese military aircraft and the illegal invasion by the American plane of Chinese territorial air space and territory .  They reproached the United States one after another , saying that overseas Chinese and the Chinese people commonly consider this incident to wholly be the legal and moral responsibility of the United States , that the attitude of the United States is unreasonable , and its way of handling the situation inferior .  
It is necessary , in line with the requirements of maintaining the advanced nature , to vigorously step up ideological and political building , constantly enhance our steadfastness and consciousness in carrying out the party 's line , principles , and policies , energetically endorse and support reform , subordinate ourselves to and serve the overall interests of the state 's economic construction , conscientiously fulfill the fundamental functions of the armed forces , ensure unimpeded implementation of military orders , and provide a powerful security guarantee for the state 's reform , development , and stability .  
An analysis by a military expert of Taiwan Gao Xiongbo says : " Arms race is very costly .  Because Taiwan 's enterprises have a special background of relationship between the government and the commercial sector , most of them are leaning toward shortsightedness for immediate gain .  Taiwan 's industry is narrow and shallow and is fundamentally insufficient to support a wide-ranging and a long-term arms race .  
The US plane 's actions violated international law and relevant Chinese laws and regulations , damaged the consensus reached by China and the United States last May on avoiding dangerous military activities at sea , infringed China 's airspace and sovereignty , and threatened China 's national security .  
Tang Jiaxuan emphasized that ever since the US reconnaisance plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese military plane , the Chinese side has all along handled this incident with calmness and restraint and in accordance with international law and the provisions of relevant laws of China .  
He said the US plane intruded into China 's territorial airspace and encroached upon China 's sovereignty in violation of international law and the provisions of relevant laws of China , as well as the consensus that China and the US reached last May on avoiding dangerous maritime military activities .  Its act has thus constituted a threat to China 's national security .  
Chen Ci held that ever since the US military reconnaissance plane rammed into and destroyed a Chinese military plane , the Chinese side has all along handled this incident with calmness and restraint and in accordance with international law and the provisions of relevant laws of China .  
The spokesman said : In accordance with international law and China 's relevant law , the Chinese side absolutely has the right to carry out an overall investigation on the foreign military reconnaissance plane that damaged the Chinese plane , illegally intruded into China 's territorial airspace , and landed at China 's airport .  
Tang Jiaxuan emphasized that ever since the US reconnaissance plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese military plane , the Chinese side has all along handled this incident with calmness and restraint and in accordance with international law and the provisions of relevant laws of China .  
According to international law and the relevant laws of China , the Chinese side has every right to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the foreign military reconnaissance plane , which has rammed into and destroyed a Chinese plane and illegally intruded into China 's airspace and landed at a Chinese airport .  
It was a serious incident that the United States sent a military surveillance plane to conduct spying activities over the exclusive economic zone of China 's Hainan , bumped into and destroyed a Chinese military plane , leaving the Chinese pilot missing , and then entered China 's territorial airspace and landed at Chinese airport .  
The act of the US plane violated international law and provisions of relevant Chinese laws , jeopardized the consensus on avoiding dangerous maritime military activities reached between China and the United States in May last year , infringed on China 's territorial airspace and sovereignty , and threatened China 's national security .  
The incident where the US surveillance plane repeatedly infringed on our coastal waters , and rammed and destroyed the Chinese military aircraft , made the Chinese people further understand that hegemonism truly exist in the world , and aroused their fighting will to make China strong and their determination to seize the opportunity to accelerate economic development .  
In the wake of former president Lee Teng-hui 's visit to the United States in 1995 , communist China 's air force overturned the decades-long tacit understanding that its fighter aircraft would not venture far over the sea .  After the two-state theory incident in the summer of 1999 , the communist military aircraft even considered west of the strait 's central line as the scope of their free movements .  
In a short space of several years , Taiwan 's depth of defense has been drastically reduced .  Each time the military aircraft of our navy and air force , dispatched to defend our air space and territorial sea , confront communist China 's military aircraft flying close to the central line , they begin to worry whether the other party will suddenly cross the line or take more hostile action .  
In one way or another , overseas Chinese and Chinese nationals living in different parts of the world condemned the conduct of the US military reconnaissance plane of ramming into and destroying the Chinese aircraft .  They firmly supported the Chinese Government 's just stand , and they extended their respects to heroic pilot Wang Wei , whose whereabouts were still unknown .  
They should unite more closely around the party CentralCommittee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner ofDeng Xiaoping Theory , seriously implement the important thinking of " threerepresents , " strengthen the party building and improve the ideological andpolitical levels of the military , and provide a powerful spiritual motivationand reliable political guarantee for " winning in wars " and " neverdegenerating . "  
Judging from relevant reports , the diplomats played a negotiator role over the counter , and military leaders such as Chi Haotian and Jiefangjun Bao acted in an organized and planned manner , but not , as reported by some US mainstream media , that " Chinese generals " were asked not to get involved and not to be that tough .  
The plane collision incident provided an opportunity for the military and the hardliners inside the regime to affect the transfer of power with the impact of the people 's nationalist sentiments .  Jiang did not want to see that the incident developed to a degree that might seriously harm the Chinese Communists ' diplomatic relations with the United States , but neither could he openly show a sign of weakness and be outdone by the US side , because this would affect the legitimacy of his power status at home .  
When the news reached Huzhou that the US Government had offered an apology to the Chinese people for the incident in which a US military surveillance plane caused the crash of a Chinese military aircraft , the parents of missing Chinese pilot Wang Wei felt relieved ; meanwhile , they voiced their resolute support for the way the Chinese Government had handled the incident as well as the stand clearly stated by Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan when he accepted the US apology-giving letter .  
During peacetime , such military activities conducted by the United States have the obvious characteristic of being hostile to China . They are a threat to China 's national security and peace and order , and a provocation against China 's sovereignty .  They violate a basic principle of international law , which says that countries should respect each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
Apart from similar stipulations on a country 's territorial airspace and legal status , the " International Civil Aviation Treaty , " concluded in Chicago in 1944 , in order to strictly classify the different legal status between civil and military aircraft , clearly stipulates in Article 3 : " The national aircraft of a signatory must not fly over the airspace of another signatory or land on its territory without special permission or other form of permission and abide by its rules . "  
The Chinese side absolutely could have taken necessary coercive measures in accordance with the right for self-protection stipulated in international law against such a foreign military plane that illegally entered China 's territorial airspace and landed on an airfield inside a military prohibited zone in China .  
In order to legalize this rude and unreasonable demand , the US side even made up the absurd argument that the US military plane causing the incident was a part of its territory and US state property and therefore , was eligible for sovereign immunity .  
A Recount of the Foreign Relations Act of the United States ( third edition ) , the most authoritative international law document of the United States , even says the agreement of the accepting state alone is not enough .  On the basis of such an agreement , the accepting state and the foreign country must also reach a special agreement on relevant community before the foreign military forces are eligible for sovereign immunity in the accepting state .  
As mentioned above , the US military reconnaissance plane abused free overflight in airspace over China 's coastal waters , violated flying rules , bumped against and destroyed a Chinese plane , and entered China 's territorial airspace and landed on China 's military airfield without authorization .  That already constituted an incident of serious violation of international law .  
The large-scale Chinese military and civilian action of searching for Wang Wei , the missing parachuting pilot , was concluded at 18:00 yesterday .  The people of all walks of life in Hainan Province expressed deep sorrow at the fact that there is no possibility of Wang Wei returning alive , and acclaimed him as a hero in defending the motherland .  
The entire process of the incident was connected to historical , legal , cultural , language , and religious issues , and the only thing that was conspicuously absent was its military aspect .  US Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld did not even appear in public during the development of the incident .  It was not until 13 April that he held a news conference at which he complained that it was only the Chinese Communist plane 's provocative act that was the underlying cause of the collision .  
First , the establishment of mechanisms for military mutual trust must be based on a framework of bilateral or multilateral ties , that is , the parties concerned must have existing basic mechanisms to hold dialogues and channels to facilitate cooperation , and one of the most important preconditions is that they have a certain level of political mutual trust .  Without political consensus and trust , a mechanism for military mutual trust will be infeasible both theoretically and in practice .  
While performing the flying duty of tracking and monitoring the US military electronic reconnaissance plane this time , he displayed determination , courage , calmness , cool-headedness , heroism , and tenacity .  By sacrificing his life , he composed a glorious victorious song of patriotism and revolutionary heroism .  
Comrade Wang Wei had high revolutionary aspirations and a lofty spirit of selfless devotion .  He put into practice our military 's fundamental objectives in an exemplary manner , and fulfilled our military 's fundamental functions in a faithful way .  He was an outstanding representative of the new generation of revolutionary military servicemen .  
The decree urges all officers and men throughout the military to rally still more closely around the party central committee , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , consciously study and practice the requirements of the " three represents , " work in a down-to-earth manner , wage unremitting struggles , step up preparations for military struggles , and constantly raise our military 's defense and combat capabilities under modern conditions , thereby making even greater contributions toward realizing reunification of the motherland and defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
A combination of operational forces has been accelerated further through the wide use of microelectronic and software technologies with computers at the core , remote and sense technologies dominated by battlefield monitoring and target detection , and military high-tech , such as military engineering , antichemical , and military command and management technologies .  Meanwhile , a new situation of joint operations , with coordination between frontline and rear units , among three armed forces , and between the military and civilians , has taken shape .  
and difficulties in organizational coordination , modern joint operations can not compare to previous wars .  Relatively speaking , the joint logistics service levels of our military are fairly low .  Thus , joint logistics subunits should make a breakthrough in changing the current situation where logistics units and the units that they serve do not coordinate with each other in terms of planning and supplying and in the aspects of command and support .  
Wu Quanxu , deputy chief of the General Staff Department , who had come to direct the training exercise , told us reporters : In order to protect people 's life and property and reduce to a minimum possible losses during a nuclear accident , the PLA has established and refined a rescue command system marked by integration of military forces with civil forces , peacetime needs with wartime needs , and forces of three services and have cultivated capabilities of launching an emergency rescue operation in all types of nuclear power accidents .  
We are determined to bear in mind Chairman Jiang 's instructions , carry forward Wang Wei 's spirit of fearing no sacrifice and dedicating ourselves to the motherland 's interests , continue to enhance the revolutionary character of the troops , quicken the pace of modernization and regularization , work hard to practice and master military skills , guarantee the winning of the future war , and guarantee that the character of the armed forces will never change .  
If the target firing tests of the unmanned Stealth fighter are successful , and the program for development of the new type of nuclear weapons is approved , this will mean that the Bush Administration will pour more and more funds into developing futuristic military technology in the hope of maintaining the US hegemonist status in the world through pursuing absolute superiority in military technology ; and still more , it will mean that the United States will make the world still less peaceful and secure , and this is bound to trigger a large-scale arms race worldwide .  
Robert Wilson , a thermonuclear weapons expert at Princeton University , warned that the US military has simply got dizzy , as there can not be any such thing as a nuclear weapon that can destroy enemy underground bunkers without threatening the local inhabitants .  
While enforcing the task of flying to tail and monitor the US military reconnaissance airplane , Comrade Wang Wei was resolute and decisive , calm and cool-headed , and courageous and indomitable .  In order to safeguard state sovereignty and national dignity , he dedicated his valuable life , thus putting the aim of our army into practice with his utterly fearless revolutionary behavior .  
Our military has made noticeable achievements in these efforts , but we should understand that , as sources of military professionals have been continuously changing and we are facing complex circumstances and vital struggles , unswervingly adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership of the military and using this military spirit to unite officers and soldiers , is still a significant and serious topic for our military 's ideological and political construction in the new situation .  
However , the US military plane , disregarding the international rules for flight safety that flying vehicles must not fly in opposite directions and must not cross each other , changed course abruptly , causing the collision .  
The former official said the debriefings of the 24 crew members after their return to the United States conform to the information disclosed by the US military when the incident first broke out .  Both indicated that the US aircraft was on autopilot , and a fighter of Communist China made a quick forging ahead and pulled up from beneath the US plane , which led to the collision .  
The vast numbers of officers and men of all of the armed services and the Armed Police have been greatly inspired by the report that Central Military Commission Chairman Jiang Zemin signed an order to confer the honorable title of " Guardian of the Sea and Air " on Wang Wei , and vowed to emulate Wang Wei and turn their patriotic passion into deeds to build up the military and to worthily serve the country and to work diligently for the building of modern and regularized revolutionary armed forces .  
The " three represents " advocates the realm of a communist 's lofty thought , which is going with development of productive forces , advocating advanced cultures , and giving primary consideration in all ways to the interests of the people .  This spirit is a powerful spiritual driving force for us to ensure thorough implementation of all work and to truthfully realize the demand that the party exercises absolute leadership over the military .  
We are happy to see that since the normalization of the two countries ' relations , high-level leaders of the two parties and two countries have conducted frequent mutual visits , and both sides ' exchanges and cooperation have expanded and developed in a more in-depth manner in the political , economic , military , scientific , technological , and cultural fields .  
The General Staff Headquarters made a decision a few days ago on setting up coordination centers for protecting the legitimate rights and interests of military units , servicemen and servicemen 's family members in provincial capitals where there are many military units under the General Staff Headquarters on condition that the authorized size of the armed forces is not expanded .  
It has been learned that the major tasks of these coordination centers are : to coordinate work in handling legal issues involving units under the General Staff Headquarters , their servicemen and servicemen 's family members and to assist local governments and judicial departments as well as provincial military districts and sub-districts and the people 's armed forces departments of respective provinces to properly handle in good time legal issues involving the military and local people and to provide legal service for military units , servicemen , and servicemen 's family members .  
During the four-year-long training in the military school , he interpreted the meaning of responsibility with his loyalty and acquired the pass certificate for hovering in the blue sky with excellent scores in all subjects .  On the road to an ideal , there are hardships to accompany one 's dedications .  
Top level leaders have frequently exchanged visits , while contacts and cooperation are increasingly expanded and deepened in the political , economic , military , scientific , technological , and cultural fields .  
Having pretty much tried all the economic revival programs to no avail , a succession of undercurrents is appearing in Japan involving the use of " an arms buildup and expanded military industry production to stimulate an economic recovery , " attempting to shift Japan toward a model in which " arms stimulate the economy " and thus achieving the goal of " killing two birds with one stone , " that is , getting the economy to take a temporary turn for the better and also achieving the goal of becoming a great military and political power .  
After the crew 's safe return , however , senior US military and political officials immediately turned around and went back on their word , reversed right and wrong , produced lame arguments , and even put the blame on others ; they publicly declared that military reconnaisance operations against China are " for the purpose of ensuring our security interests and protecting the security of our allies , " " preserving world peace , " and so on .  
Obviously , for the United States to engage in this kind of military activity in peacetime contravenes the basic principles of international law regarding mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , and is markedly characterized by hostility to China ; it is a threat to China 's national security and peaceful order , and an open provocation against China 's sovereignty , and it has caused a tense atmosphere affecting regional security .  
Proceeding from their hegemonist aims , they desperately cling to their cold war mentality , always wanting to set up some " enemy " or " opponent , " and proceed to regard socialist China as " the main threat " ; they continually use the Taiwan , Tibet , and human rights issues as pretexts for interfering in China 's internal affairs , persist in developing Theater Missile Defense , which jeopardizes China 's security , plot to step up arms sales to Taiwan , and regard China as the assumed enemy in military exercises .  
The western region 's economic development has been relatively slow ; the condition of its social base is poor , and the strategic logistical facilities have always been a weak link and have never been able to meet the new demands of military combats .  
As the great western development moves forward , and under the close cooperation among the state , the local governments , and the military , the western region 's infrastructure will be able to meet both social and national defense needs , so that the Chinese military 's strategic logistical facilities will have a solid foundation for achieving great development .  
Looking ahead into the future , the western region 's scientific and technological standards no doubt will be raised to a much higher level , and the west 's scientific and technological vitality no doubt will propel the military 's work to invigorate logistics with science and technology to new heights .  
We must insist on putting the military economy in the context of the national economy and combining strategic logistical construction with local infrastructure construction .  In the construction of railroads , highway , airport , docks , telecommunications , pipelines , urban construction and other basic construction , we must take into consideration the military needs and make sure they can be taken care with little or no extra spending .  
We must take advantage of the western great development to promote military economic construction and make scientific and technological innovation and the propagation of results the focal point as we resolutely embark on the road of using science and technology to invigorate rear services and find ways to raise the scientific and technological contents of logistical work .  
We should target the characteristic that most logistical science and technology have military and civilian applications as we vigorously bring in local advanced and practical scientific and technological results , put civilian work to military use and promptly turn them into a military economic benefit , so that they can provide a service and boost our safeguard capability .  We should pay attention to using society 's R &amp; D capability to accelerate the strong pace of using scientific and technological advancement to achieve security .  
Matters that can be taken over by society should gradually be handed over to society ; security organs with nonmilitary functions should be handed over to the localities , and security organs that shoulder military functions should be streamlined and augmented to create a new logistical security system with operating mechanisms consistent with the Chinese military 's quality construction and the western region 's economic development .  
We must firmly uphold the concept of the whole situation and the concept of long-term construction to actively immerse ourselves in the western great development , work with a will to make the country strong and a spirit of arduous struggle to build an enterprise , and push forward the western region 's military economic construction step by step to make our due share of contribution to raising the country 's comprehensive national strength and increasing our national defense capability .  
The decision further urges them to emulate Wang Wei 's dauntless spirit of not fearing strong enemies , not evading difficulties and dangers , and daring to conquer all enemies , so that they will constantly temper their military style of being heroic and indomitable , making decisive struggle , and winning decisive victory .  This will also enable them to strenuously learn modern knowledge of science and technology , become versed in using the weapons in their hands , and truly raise their ability to defend the country under modern conditions .  
They should also emulate Wang Wei 's lofty ideological character of making selfless dedication , loving and respecting his work , disregarding personal gains and loses , and being indifferent to fame and profit so that they will be able to take the initiative to subordinate themselves to and serve the cardinal needs of reform and construction , cultivate a fine moral character , establish a lofty goal of life , and maintain the unchangeable integrity of revolutionary military personnel .  
Yu Yongbo presided at the gathering .  He demanded that the units of the entire armed forces take Comrade Wang Wei as their example , consciously practice the important thinking on " three represents " proposed by Chairman Jiang Zemin , vigorously promote the modernization of the armed forces , do a sound job in preparatory work for military struggle , comprehensively enhance our army 's capability to successfully fight a modern war , especially a partial war under hi-tech conditions , and make new contributions to defending and building the motherland .  
Relying on its strength in science and technology and its powerful armaments , the United States has set up a worldwide intelligence system for collecting from land , air , below the sea , and indeed from space political , military , and economic intelligence on all parts of the world , so as to serve its pursuit of global hegemony and creation of a unipolar world .  
" It has always been my dream to wear the green military uniform .  I want to fly a fighter plane and take to the wild blue yonder .  
Before we came to the Military Representative Office to gather news , we already learned that the military representatives here enjoyed very high prestige .  By the time we went round the military plant , we were surprised at what we found .  If a military representative discovers a minor problem , he can issue a white feedback note demanding an immediate measure to make correction .  
However , in view of existing weak links in the plant 's quality control work , the Military Representative Office proposed to solemnly deal with the matter in order to strengthen the sense of the quality of military products among intermediate-level leading cadres .  Following careful consideration , the plant 's party committee finally decided to dismiss the director of a branch plant , who was in charge of the production of that product , from his post .  This caused strong repercussions in the whole plant .  
Following several days ' hard work , a young military representative finally fulfilled his task of providing technical support .  However , when he returned to the Military Representative Office the following day feeling he was relieved of a heavy load , he was unexpected criticized .  He wept and felt he was wronged .  
Both the " offshore decisive battle " and the " crippling battle " are ideas developed from the same strategic concept of " effective deterrence and solid defense , " but the actual intention is to internationalize the Taiwan issue , stretch the battlefield to the mainland and even the Pacific region , create the pretext for intervention by external forces , and then launch an attack first if the mainland shows signs of using military force , thereby crushing the mainland at one go .  
Most of the weapons tested were long-range attack weapons , underscoring the Taiwan military 's new " offshore decisive battle " strategic concept .  The exercise also stressed the combined tactical applications of new types of weapons , in order to test the tactics and the weapons ' technical performance and give full play to the overall combat capabilities of various types of weapons .  
Ideological and political education is not an ordinary job , but rather an essential and fundamental task in adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership over the military and the key to strengthening the military 's comprehensive construction and carrying out every task .  
In light of the many and heavy tasks faced by brigades and regiments , their Party committee secretaries should pay special attention to observing and analyzing the situation from the political perspective , adhere to the correct direction of military construction , give top priority to ideological administration and education .  They should rely on correct education and instruction to assure that the military is under the Party 's effective control and rely on the powerful spiritual backbone to unite military professionals and inspire their fighting spirit .  
Party committee secretaries should take the lead in studying and understanding the major contents of this opinion , straighten out the main theme of their work , and firmly stick to ideological and political education , the key to their work .  In this way , they can pool effort , coordinate relationships between different sectors and tasks and advance the overall situation of military construction .  
A senior personality from Taiwan 's military even declared in public : " We monitored the entire process of the incident and recorded the mid-air conversations made by the Chinese communists ' pilots . "  " We have handed over the tape recordings to the US side . "  
Some of the right wing figures in the moderate group even believed that , based on this , trade contact is helping to increase China 's overall national power and leading to an increased military threat of Taiwan by the mainland , and that the risk of the United States being involved in a regional conflict is even greater .  
The procedure also stipulates that no Internet online service business sites are to be set up within 200 meters of such places as key central party , political , and military organs , within 200 meters of middle and elementary schools , and in residential buildings .  
The military training for the students of an institution of higher learning , a senior middle school , or a school equivalent to a senior middle school shall be organized and executed by the organization within the school responsible for military training or its military instructor in accordance with the relevant stipulations of the state .  
Article 20 .  Military regions , provincial military districts ( including Beijing Garrison and other garrisons ) , military subdistricts ( including sub-garrisons ) , and the people 's armed forces departments of counties , autonomous counties , cities , and municipal districts shall conduct national defense education for militiamen and personnel on reserve duty in combination with political education , organizational rectification , military training , performance of services , conscription work , and activities on important festivals and commemoration days .  
The fine traditions and the fine work style of our army are the precious spiritual wealth , as well as the source of the invincible power , of our army ; and this military history is therefore required to fully embody the glorious traditions and the fine work style of our army , so that it can be used as a good teaching material for our education on traditions among our troops .  
Meanwhile , the book must also make a comprehensive , profound , and accurate summarization of the historical experiences and lessons that our army has gained and learned from its building , so as to serve as an important historical reference in the course of strengthening national defense , promoting army building , and making sound preparations for military struggles .  
Chi Haotian urged the compilers of the military history to ensure a sound quality for the entire book by taking the attitude of holding themselves responsible for history , the party , the people , the officers and men , and for the revolutionaries of the older generation ; and to make sure that the military history they are compiling is a faithful historical account , as well as an accurate " Historical Record , " of our army that can be handed down to future generations .  
The laser guns , deployed in fixed positions or installed on mobile vehicles , can effectively shoot down and destroy attacking ballistic missiles , high and low altitude supersonic cruise missiles , ultra high speed stealth planes , and military targets at sea .  
Since the implementation of the new system governing noncommissioned officers over a year ago , noncommissioned officers have been playing a very prominent role at the basic-level units .  They have become backbone forces in military units ' combat training , education , and study of specialized technical skills , playing a decisive role in military units ' basic and long-range developments .  
Through this education , we should arouse the patriotic enthusiasm of officers and soldiers of the military to love and serve their motherland and strengthen their convictions in winning wars and eradicating corruption so that they will have the full political enthusiasm and great fighting strength for being ready to carry out the sacred mission given by the Party and the country - - maintaining the territorial unity of the motherland and protecting the sovereignty and dignity of our country .  
We believe that , with joint efforts of both the military and the people throughout the country , the law on national defense education will be carried out and implemented in a comprehensive manner , and China 's national defense education project will advance in a healthy manner .  We believe that the sense of " all-people " national defense and the cohesion of the Chinese nation will further be strengthened , and the peace-loving Chinese nation will certainly create a stronger national defense .  
Extensively promoting the educational campaign to study and put into practice the important thinking of the " three represents " and maintain the advanced nature of Party members is an important task of the military 's political work for this year , which was decided in accordance with the directive of the Central Military Commission . It also is an important measure and realistic procedure for improving the quality of Party members and strengthening Party-building throughout the military .  
In recent years , India has formulated a military strategy of " guarding against China northward , fighting against Pakistan westward , dominating the Indian Ocean southward , and expanding its sphere of influence eastward " in addition to its efforts to build nuclear deterrent power .  Expanding its sphere of influence eastward means extending its sphere of influence to the South China Sea and a part of the Pacific region .  
Ding Jiye ; A whole series of reforms of our armed forces ' finances have been carried out in recent years , and military expenditure management is now being moved from the traditional empirical and extensive style to modern , scientific , and meticulous management .  This reform of drawing up the armed forces budget is a key step in this process .  
Ding Jiye : Mainly in three aspects : First , we institute categorized budget management , that is , military expenditure is divided into two main categories , sustained expenditure and construction expenditure , according to the nature of the use of the funds ; these two categories are budgeted separately , macroeconomic regulation and control is stepped up , and different focal points to be ensured are set down ;  
Ding Jiye : This reform stresses improving the method and procedure in drawing up the budget .  The main special features are : The reform itself does not require increased input , while the regulation and control function of the military budget is markedly strengthened , the economic returns on military funds will be markedly enhanced , and funds can be concentrated on ensuring preparedness for military struggle ;  
The DPRK Nodong Sinmun published a commentary condemning the US-ROK joint military exercise as a " strategic provocation . "  It pointed out that the United States is attempting to continue to carry out its hostile policy of strangling the DPRK " by power , " and the US adventurist actions have poured cold water on the people of the Korean peninsula who earnestly desire national self-determination and reunification and a beautiful future .  
and it is also feasible to cooperate with the electronic confrontation squad of our side to mock an SOS sent by the pilot of the enemy plane in such a way that the enemy can not distinguish whether the signal is genuine or fake , and once the enemy 's military strength is dispersed , our side can annihilate the enemy .  
Social development , especially in the modern era , has enmeshed military action more closely into the political , economic , diplomatic , and scientific and technological arenas .  More military means are now available for achieving specific politic goals , and the range of activities covered by military struggles is gradually widening .  
An important mission in warfare research is to study new rules for commanding war in light of changes in the form of warfare , with special emphasis on the way operational guidelines and strategic military operations are prepared and executed .  
It is essential that strategic studies cater to the objective requirements of future military struggles and involve planning for building up military strength , with special emphasis on putting forward overall requirements for promoting rapid progress in building up military strength .  
Of more than 10 strategic principles , the US authorities determined on measures for subverting China in various fields of social life including the political , economic , diplomatic , military , trade , cultural , and educational fields .  
[ passage omitted ] In the 10 years beginning in 2001 , based on their yearning for an American century , extreme rightwing American politicians , tycoons , the military industrial complex , the media , and its ideological wildness will wallow together in the mire , and unscrupulously stir up the " theory of the China threat " ; in coordination with a psychological offensive , they will carry out a new " physical offensive . "  
Lai Changxing at that time relied on the network of connections he had woven over many years in key Party , government and military organs by wearing the hat of a private entrepreneur who was famous all over the country , a member of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference of Fujian Province and an honorary citizen of Xiamen City , among other political glories .  
The incident which occurred on 1 April in which a US military reconnaissance plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese fighter plane and then landed on Chinese territory - - the Lingshui Airport on Hainan Island - - had its first phase settled after US President Bush expressed " deep regret " and US Ambassador Preuher delivered a " letter of apology " to the Chinese foreign minister , and then the Chinese government allowed the American crew members to leave for home before Easter because of humanitarian considerations after completing some necessary procedures .  
In light of the rapid development of the revolution in the military field throughout the world , the complex and dynamic international situation and profound social revolutions , the youth of officers and soldiers must devote great efforts to becoming high-quality military professionals through diligent study so as to carry forward and promote the glorious tradition of the May 4th Movement , and fulfill their sacred mission .  
Only when the majority of young officers and soldiers have a sense of urgency being aware that time waits for no man , making diligent efforts to become high-quality military professionals and striving to improve their own quality can they keep up with rapid development in the global field of military science and technology and genuinely fulfill their sacred mission of revitalizing the military and serving the motherland .  
According to the experienced Indian military analyst ( Kapil Kaq ) , " this joint military exercise is multilevel and is also the first time that India has shown that it has already made preparations in pragmatic fashion for fighting a limited conventional war ; India 's conventional military forces remain in a high state of combat readiness and will sternly retaliate on a large scale against an enemy . "  
Thus apart from laying a solid foundation of knowledge , especially by taking a " general course " on directing joint operations in a military academy or school , our commanding officers should also devote more energy to learning and applying knowledge on different services and arms through peacetime campaign training exercises ; should work hard to learn about the basic formations of different services and arms as well as the functional features and operational principles of different types of weapons and equipment ;  
should be resolved to turn more demonstration exercises into real training exercises , which may test and examine the units involved .  Whenever conditions allow , we should stage training exercises involving students from various military academies and schools , commanding officers from various units , and command organs from the units set to play a key role in such exercises , thus enabling all personnel concerned to handle the same situation together , and the general departments should organize and send personnel to examine and appraise training results .  
The US , Japanese , and British forces have all stressed the following two requirements : First , a senior commanding officer shall have received training in various military academies and schools before taking office ; Second , a senior commanding officer shall have served in different posts in different services before taking office .  These two requirements have laid a foundation for a senior commanding officer to direct joint operations .  
The task of reinforcing the army through science and technology is a grand and complex system project ; and we need a series of thorough and scientific plans , theoretical demonstrations and verifications , as well as policy decisions to cope with a multitude of complicated and confused problems in the fields ranging from weaponry development , military establishment and structural changes , to training reform .  
Thanks to all these efforts , batches after batches of high-end cadres with high educational backgrounds have been recruited into the military , and have gradually become a main force in the contingent of cadres of our army .  However , there still exists a wide gap between our army and foreign armies in the cultivation of high-quality talent .  For example , officers holding master 's degree and above make up a relatively low proportion in our army ;  
most cadres are deficient in combined capabilities and have a relatively poor scientific and technological quality ; and in particular , there is a shortage of top-notch technological personnel .  It is just as Chairman Jiang has pointed out : " At present , the quality of the cadres contingent of our army has yet to totally suit the demands of our military strategic requirements for the new period , and this is an issue that has to be settled urgently . "  
Those who have attained extraordinary work results , have given an outstanding work performance , have made great contributions , and have shown a strong work ability shall be promoted to higher posts either ahead of time or overstepping their proper ranks ; and those who have achieved major scientific research results or have considerably enhanced the military efficiency shall be amply rewarded .  
In recent years , a submarine chaser group of the East Sea Fleet has successfully accomplished dozens of urgent , difficult , dangerous , and arduous tasks , such as emergency and disaster rescue , locating shipwrecks , and going on patrol at sea .  It has won the title of advanced unit in military training from the higher authorities for many years in a row and is known as " hunters " of the East China Sea .  
Observers point out that the most direct and evident information gleaned from the fact that , only three months after taking office , the Bush Administration could not wait to deploy an NMD program far exceeding that of his predecessor is that the United States needs to simulate its economy , which has started a downturn , by means of stepping up production in the defense industry , and also to offer a political reward to the military industrial complex for supporting Bush in getting into the White House .  
fifth , the US decision to link NMD with TMD overseas is bound to harm regional peace and stability ; should the United States being Taiwan into the east Asia TMD , this will be organizing a US-Taiwan military alliance in disguise , interfering in China 's internal affairs , and increasing the tension in the Taiwan strait .  
It is present in political , economic , military , scientific and technological , and cultural education ; its core values are patriotism , revolutionary heroism , and the spirit of dedication ; and its ultimate objectives are to boost all citizens ' will , skills , and physical capabilities in loving , developing , and defending their motherland , so that they can firmly adopt the idea of " being prepared for danger in times of peace " and " joining hands to resist foreign aggression . "  
First , not long ago , the United States ' Bush administration decided to adjust its military strategy and set forth a plan for deploying a global missile defense .  Before that , the United States had drawn Japan into its TMD ( theater missile defense ) program by forcing Japan to sign a cooperation agreement and get involved in the four-year program for joint technological research and development of the TMD system .  
The " operational manual for new-type aircraft and fighters " compiled by reading several hundreds of new aircraft materials , studying and analyzing over a-hundred pieces of cabin equipment and aerial test flight verifications , and with the efforts of Li Keqiang and pilots of the whole regiment was published , thus providing effective technical support for our military training for refitting new-type fighters .  Following that , six volumes of " collections of theses on study of new-type aircraft tactical and combat methods " were compiled and published .  
In the Indian Ocean region , India is rather powerful in terms of territorial size , population , scientific and technological capability , military and economic strength .  India also has certain influential power in the international political arena .  Therefore , drawing India to its side and playing the " Indian card " will bring a lot of benefits for the United States to seize the world hegemony .  
and externally , they have gone all out in their pursuit of a " pragmatic diplomacy , " a " money diplomacy , " and a " secret diplomacy . "  Particularly , they have invited a " guardian god " from abroad , expanded their military purchases , and threatened to " fight a decisive offshore battle . "  
The party committee of the Ministry of Public Security 's Frontier Guard Administrative Bureau has attached great importance to launching the " strike-hard " struggle .  To solidly and efficiently launch the " strike-hard " struggle , the bureau has established a frontier guard " strike-hard " leading group .  Various public security frontier guard headquarters have also established " strike-hard " leading groups headed by principal military and administrative officials .  
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi commented today at a press conference that China is carrying out a peaceful policy of foreign diplomacy in which independence and initiative is maintained .  This will aid in protecting and advancing peace and stability in the Asia Pacific region as well as in the world .  No matter how military planning is strengthened , advocacy of containment of China is contrary to the historical trend and is entirely wrong and will get nowhere .  
The report states : To pursue the new Asia strategy , the United States should make significant readjustments of its military deployments in the Asia-Pacific region , such as shifting the focus of its regional military deployments to South Asia from Northeast Asia , developing and improving the military security network with its allies , building Guam into a military center of the United States in Asia , strengthening joint air and naval forces , and developing its long-distance fighting capability .  
In May , 2000 , the PLA demonstrated in the Nanjing Military Region a series of single-soldier training topics by stressing a reform in the following two aspects : As for training contents , the PLA for the first time prioritized training in comprehensive quality by taking training in modern military technology as the mainstay and training in " three capabilities ( intellectual capability , technological capability , and physical capability ) " as the vital ingredients ;  
If Taiwan takes all that is offered , an increase in its military strength is bound to inspire misgivings of the communist China , the two sides of the strait are bound to head for an arms race , and , no doubt , the current cross-strait relations will go from bad to worse .  The arms sales , in which the Chen Shui-bian Government believes it has achieved a major breakthrough , may become a cause leading Taiwan to wars .  
Its missile plan is aimed at achieving its absolute military and economic superiority by means of hegemony .  To pursue this purpose , the United States does not scruple to provoke a global arms race , does not scruple to undermine the regional security of other countries , and does not scruple to break the international rules and order .  In short , for the sake of its national interests , the United States does not scruple to harm the interests of the whole world .  
To strengthen the actual combat capability of the United States Air Force in Korea , the United States military , of late , has continuously strengthened the facilities of the Osan air base , specifically constructing underground a reinforced command and control center , and a C41 ( command , control , communication , computer and intelligence ) system .  
Guam is located in the southern extreme of the Pacific Ocean 's Mariana Island Chain . The strategic function Guam as a forward deployment and support base for the United State military is increasing by the day .  
However , this writer is of the opinion that the United States ' current military deployment in the Asia-Pacific region still is in a kind of historical continuation status - - there have not been any major changes in terms of quantity and quality .  Whether or not the United States will continue to adopt a " Cold War Forward Strategy " in its new strategic plan and step up its direct military presence around China are yet to be observed and studied .  
There are two reasons why the United States has decided to give up its strategy of " winning two local wars breaking out simultaneously . "  First , the United States has been feeling that its military strength and transport capability are inadequate and its financial resources are insufficient , making it difficult to continue to hit others using two fists at the same time .  
Implementing a system according to which division , brigade and regimental level commanders in the infantry , naval , air and secondary artillery forces receive training at military academies and universities from other branches of the military is an important measure in improving the knowledge of our military cadres , in cultivating commanders of united military operations , and in improving our military 's ability to conduct joint operations .  
The Central Military Commission recently decided to select middle - and high-ranking cadres working in one branch of the military to receive training given by a military academy under another branch of the military .  This created a new training model that will certainly be an important driving force in improving our military 's ability to conduct joint operations in modern - - and particularly high-tech - - wars .  
As our reform is entering a crucial stage of storming fortified positions , new developments and problems have emerged in large numbers , such as the work of preparing for military struggle with the aim of winning the war and not become morally degenerate , and the cadre system reform with the implementation of the raw on Officers on Active Service and the temporary Measures for Resettling Demobilized Soldiers as the content . 
and how to implement General Secretary Jiang 's principle of dunning the country by virtue , satisfactorily unify efforts to run the army according to law with efforts to step up ideological and moral education among officers and men and , while enhancing the legal system concept and moral quality of officers and men , enhance the management level of army units , raise the consciousness of officers and men in loving the army , learning military skills , and strictly observing discipline , and so on .  
In order to ensure the smooth enforcement of the government and military orders in a special natural , political , and social environment in Tibet , the Tibet Military District CPC Committee spelled out the following requirement in no uncertain terms : " Though there is a forbidden zone for life on the roof of the world , there is no special zone for enforcing the government and military orders here , " thus enhancing a sense of " unconditional submission " among the officers and men .  
In 1998 , after the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission made such a major decision as banning the PLA units from engaging in business activities , the Tibet Military District decided to take back Zhufeng Hotel , which had been leased to a well-known business group from the south , and rename it as a guesthouse for military use .  It also decided to take back some 100 street-facing shop places around the compound of its headquarters , which had been leased to the local businesses , and rebuild them into a compound wall .  
In coping with external military threats , Russia , which is resolutely opposed to NATO 's expansion to the east , has put forward a proposal for establishing , with European countries , a rapid reaction force to maintain the security of Europe . Moreover , Russia has held many large-scale military exercises with the Commonwealth of Independent States and established a " collective air-defense system " in the western part of Russia .  
The target of the military reduction in force is mainly logistic personnel , health personnel , administrative personnel of military organs , " surplus units " that have emerged after the merging and reorganization of military arms and services , and personnel who have completed or who will soon complete their term of military service .  Military reduction in force will not include standing military units and war preparedness duty units .  
The Russian air force will optimize its setup and organizational structure through merging , reducing redundant commanding organs , and replacing backward weapons and equipment so that it will have the capability to serve as a fighting group in peacetime and to cope with local armed conflicts , thus becoming the principal attacking military service of the Russian armed forces in the new century .  
In dealing with the serious problem that has emerged in the social standing and daily livelihood of military personnel who have been affected by the national economic crisis for some time , Putin pointed out that at present , " the income and social standing of military personnel are incompatible with the price they pay in serving in the military , which has seriously undermined and affected the unity of the armed forces . "  
Further , this base allowed different types of units under different arm services to conduct combined tactical training at the same time .  Crack troops have been selected and established as the " blue army brigade . "  Through direction , transfer , separation , and back-to-back training , troops participating in military exercises were able to use their skillful tactics under sharp confrontations .  
In the light of the United States ' attitude of clinging obstinately to its course on the NMD issue and course of action in starting the research and development of advanced military satellites and space weapons , Putin recently issued another presidential order to demand an early formation of Russia 's new " celestial army " and set this 1 July as the deadline for completing the formation .  
Nevertheless , following the gradual deepening of their understanding of the importance of space intelligence and information in the future and particularly in the face of the reality that United States has started to seize space superiority , many Russian military experts have in recent years held that the space of a battlefield of the 21st century will extend to the outer space and that a future war can be won only by occupying a place in the space .  
It can be seen that Russia 's government and military have taken the organization and formation of the " celestial army " as an important work in restoring the imposing bearing of a military power and racing to control the future commanding point in space .  As such , Russia 's " celestial army " has arduous tasks and a long road ahead .  
During the last 50 years , thanks to the concern of the central authorities and the support of the people in the rest of the country , the party , the government , the military , the police , and the people were united as one and worked hard and perseveringly to accomplish the tremendous achievement of rapid economic development , all-round social progress , and continuous improvement in the people 's living standards .  The entire region has gone through earth-shaking changes .  
To carry out Chairman Jiang 's important directive on striving to construct a contingent of high-quality cadres , the General Department of Staff and the General Political Department decided to , starting this year , replace the old system of directly promoting excellent soldiers to the officer level with a new system in which particularly excellent soldiers are selected to be sent to military academies or universities .  These soldiers can be promoted if they pass an examination at the end of the training program at academies or universities .  
Leaders and political institutions at all levels should , in accordance with the criteria , select promising soldiers with outstanding moral and military integrity and excellent and crucial soldiers , heroic models and exemplary figures in preparing for war , performing their duty and carrying out significant tasks , so as to allow this policy to be an award and a guide in further arousing enthusiasm in loving the military and learning military skills among the majority of soldiers .  
Lenin said : " Only by being armed with all human knowledge can one become a communist . "  Only the new type of military personnel armed with all human knowledge , especially modern high-science and - technology knowledge , can accomplish our military 's historical mission of prevailing on the battlefield and remaining unchanged in nature .  
If cadres are characterized by a uniform quality structure and simple experiences , with infantry officers not understanding the various branches of the military , cadres of the various branches of the military not understanding the issue of being composite , political cadres not understanding military matters , and military cadres not being able to do political work , such a state of affairs in terms of quality will not meet the requirements of joint operations in the context of informationization .  
This essential character requires that military personnel of the new type should not only become military experts , but also be politically minded , politically sensitive , highly capable of making distinctions on political issues , firm in adhering to ideals and convictions , and pure ideologically and morally .  
At the meeting , Jiang Zemin , on behalf of the party Central Committee , the State Council , and the Central Military Commission , extended warm congratulations to national model military officers transferred to civilian work and to advanced units and workers engaged in work in resettling demobilized officers and extended cordial regards to the military officers to be transferred to civilian work and to those comrades engaged in resettling such military personnel .  
Participating in the national conference were responsible officials of relevant central departments ; responsible official of various provinces , autonomous regions , municipalities directly under the central government , and sub-provincial-level cities ; and responsible officials of the armed forces , the armed police force , and major military units .  
In military affairs , he has advocated a " decisive battle offshore " , increased military spending , intensified the purchase of advanced offensive weapons , and advocated that the United States should " coordinate in the defense of Taiwan " and help Taiwan to resist an " attack " by the mainland .  
The Gulf War and Kosovo War have demonstrated the trend of information war .  The United States has realized that , under the situation of a new military revolution , the pattern of future war will have a qualitative difference from a mechanized war with nuclear weapons .  US military strategy must be adjusted to suit the changing patterns of war .  
The US strategic adjustment is a new round of expansion under the conditions of the development of the political , economic , and military situation in the world and the necessary result of further consolidating the US position of being the sole superpower in the new century .  The defense group of the Bush administration has a strong color of " Cold War fighter " .  The essence of his " new pragmatism " is to use the strong power of the United States as basis to maximize its national interests .  
The new edition of " Military Doctrine " approved by Putin , which opposes NATO 's eastward expansion , has for the first time put forward the viewpoint that Russia 's national security is faced with " the danger of foreign invasion and domestic trouble and the aggravation of outside threat will constitute a military threat " to Russia .  
Under the situation of weakness of comprehensive national strength and being inferior to NATO in conventional forces , nuclear weapons will remain an effective deterrent power of Russia in the future period and the " tower of strength " to support Russia 's desire to be a major military power .  
Russia will raise the quality of training for war preparations .  The two Chechen wars exposed the low level of the Russian military 's preparations for war and its lack of training and other problems .  Therefore , starting last year , the three services of Russia started to reform the military training system , increasing training time and frequency , expanding training scale , and fully utilizing modern high technology to improve the quality of training according to the requirements of the " Military Doctrine " and reform plan .  
The " Russian Weapons and Equipment Development Plan for 2010 " , approved by President Putin early this year , has specifically defined the direction of priority development of weapons and equipment for the Russian military .  The Russian military will adhere to the general principle of " reducing quantity and increasing quality " in the development of weapons .  It will give priority to developing integrated weapon systems with higher capabilities and greater precision that combine reconnaissance , forewarning , command , positioning , attack , and communications .  
The Russian military has actively organized joint air defense exercises and anti-terrorist exercises with countries of the CIS , held military conferences with the CIS , enforced joint air defenses , and helped concerned countries restore radar early warning systems .  The Russian military has also provided countries of the CIS with modern air-defense missile system and warplanes .  Russia and countries of the CIS have now gradually established a unified air defense system and formed an effective defense and deterrent capability .  
Local governments at all levels including their party committees and departments and the party organization at all levels in the military have made many effective contributions to the appropriate resettlement of demobilized military cadres and reform in that resettlement .  They have effectively ensured the smooth implementation of the Party Central Committee 's strategic decision to cut military forces by 500,000 , enhanced the construction of quality in the military , accelerated national economic development and strengthened the social stability as a whole .  
The majority of demobilized military cadres carry forward and promote the excellent traditions and working styles of the people 's army - - struggling with painstaking efforts , striving forward and dedicating themselves to their careers and enthusiastically forging ahead .  The majority made new contributions to the great cause of constructing socialist modernization , have won praise from the party and the people and have added more glories to the people 's army .  
Role models of demobilized military cadres that won awards at this conference are representatives of the excellent demobilized military cadres working in every front line throughout the country .  Their advanced deeds and lofty ideology embody the new spiritual outlook of the majority of demobilized military cadres , being precious spiritual resources .  The entire military should satisfactorily study and vigorously disseminate their deeds and ideology .  
The enthusiastic and hospitable Indian people expressed their cordial and friendly feelings toward the visiting Chinese naval officers and men .  In downtown Bombay , over 1,000 residents warmly applauded the successful performance by the Chinese military band .  
Liu Jinhai , who has just been awarded a national model for demobilized military cadres , said in a deep manner that , when he left the military , he noticed the non-military government at all levels was facing a great deal of pressure dealing with resettling demobilized military cadres and he decided to move forward in his career himself .  
Resettling demobilized military cadres at divisional and regimental levels still remains a focus of discussion among representatives .  Wu Cuiling , director of the Jinzhou Municipal Resettlement Office of Liaoning province , said in an emotional manner that , demobilized military cadres at divisional and regimental levels have dedicated their prime years to the military and to the great cause of safeguarding national security .  They have lofty prestige among officers and soldiers that are still serving in the army .  
Bian Jiagui , deputy director of the Beijing Garrison Command 's Political Department , said that extraordinarily rapid scientific and technological development throughout the world is embodied not only in economic fields but also in military fields .  Military cadres should devote greater efforts to delving into science and technology and continuously improve their abilities in every field .  Only in this way can military cadres set up a solid foundation for being competitive in the non-military sectors after their demobilization .  
President Akayev said cheerfully that the fact that the fruitful activities of the " Shanghai Five " in recent years have drawn the attention of the international community has a lot to do with its growing international prestige in the region and in the world , with our successful solution of problems in the political , military , economic , trade and other spheres , and with the tremendous role we are playing in the protection of regional security .  
After the invasion of terrorists into southern Kyrgyzstan last year , it was a member of the " Shanghai Five " that first provided political , military and technical assistance to the country .  The collective security system of the Commonwealth of Independent States also played a positive part .  At present , the armed forces of Kyrgyzstan are bracing themselves for possible assaults from international terrorist forces .  
All military forces profoundly carried out and implemented the important strategy of administering the military according to the law , through which they have further raised their level of making decisions , administering the military , managing military training and managing soldiers all according to the law and have effectively accelerated ideological and political construction and the comprehensive construction of the military .  
Under the banner of " self defense " , they broke through the " restricted zone " set by the constitution and relevant ordinances .  They have kept engaging in arms expansion .  They have increased their military spending year by year , ignoring long ago the regulation that Japan 's military expenditure is not allowed to exceed 1 percent of its gross national product .  
Both ordinary people and politicians have joined their ranks .  As far as the forms and nature of their activities are concerned , the post-war Japanese rightwing forces are quite similar to the pre-war ones .  They conduct terrorist activities , plot military coup d'etat , suppress progressive forces , strangle the freedom of speech , spare no effort to deny the history of invading China , adhere to the historical point of view of a kingdom , and advocate nationalism .  
To this end , India has designed a series of diplomatic steps : In 1996 , India for the first time joined the Regional Forum of ASEAN and in 2000 , its defense minister paid a visit to Japan and the two countries conducted a joint military exercise in the South China Sea , which has laid a foundation for India to be militarily involved in the South China Sea and signified that India has stridden over the second door in the process of " eastward expansion " .  
The tasks undertaken by the Bureau of Investigation and Analysis which has more than 7,000 staff and more than 70 intelligence stations all over the world are the most mysterious .  In simple terms , it is targeted against neighboring countries and major countries and through means like espionage and reconnaissance to collect and sort out the political , military , and economic intelligence of these countries and provide the most updated research and analysis results to the Government Cabinet of India . Meanwhile , it also possesses certain rebellion-instigating , subversive , and anti-espionage functions .  
Since last year , Japan and India have constantly strengthened their cooperation in military and other fields , established a partnership relationship , conducted many joint military exercises , jointly cracked down on those pirates threatening Japan 's energy passage at sea , and weakened the strategic pressures brought about by China to Japan at sea . 
In mid May , officers from the northwestern operation department under the General Staff Headquarters and the military command academy and specialists in military science jointly organized an operation drill to oppose pro-Taiwan independence forces ' attempt to liberate Taiwan and as an effort to put down their rebellions .  This operation drill was launched with high technology at a simulated battlefield , set up based on the ratio of a real war battlefield .  
The third battle : Naval and air troops crossed beaches for landing .  Paratroops occupied strategic forts while naval and air troops and the Second Artillery Corps used strong firepower to support the attack and prevent foreign troops from eliminating mines , blocking seas , and entering the Taiwan region to join the remaining pro-Taiwan independence forces for military counterattacks .  
In a meeting today with Rupert C . Montanaro , commander of the armed forces of Malta , Chi Haotian , vice chairman of the Central Military Commission , state councilor , and national defense minister , said that developing healthy and lasting military ties between the two countries under the new historic conditions is the common wish of the Chinese and Maltese people .  He was convinced that Sino-Maltese military relations would enter a new stage of development following the commander 's ongoing visit .  
The Ministry of National Defense made public for the first time in 5 June the training of its " special operations " forces through its " Wuhan drill " .  As has been learned , the new joint-branch No . 862 special operations brigade of the Army is the only multipurpose special operations unit of the national army , which is responsible not only for the defense of Taiwan and Penghu but also for the highly confidential task of assaulting military targets behind enemy lines .  
Through the previous period of study , the majority of Party members in the military have obtained a certain level of awareness and understanding of the rich content and political , theoretical and practical meaning of the important thinking of the " three represents " .  However , this important thinking is broad , extensive and profound , with very rich content .  
We should closely associate with the domestic and international situation , military construction and the ideological reality of every individual person .  We should inspect ourselves in accordance with the requirements of the " three represents " , profoundly consider and effectively understand the essence and internal relations of the " three represents " .  We must thoroughly understand the historical background and the era-oriented significance of the " three represents " .  
Only when leaders of Party committees and Party members working for institutions take the lead in profoundly studying , thoroughly comprehending and understanding the important thinking of the " three represents " in light of other aspects can they solve problems met by Party members working for grassroots units and satisfactorily provide military grassroots units with correct and effective guidance in promoting this educational campaign .  
Under new historical conditions and due to the complicated and multi-faceted duties of our various military units in future anti-aggression war , we must abandon the traditional concept of " resisting and attacking enemies face-to-face " in our research and thoroughly study strong opponents who are capable of fighting a high-tech war .  
The social , economic , political , and military moves of any side will affect the reunification of China . The Democratic Progressive Party and Chen Shui-bian authorities are launching the " Taiwan independence " activities and are selling out Taiwan 's interest in collusion with the anti-China forces in the United States and Japan at the cost of making the people on both sides discouraged and disappointed at the peaceful reunification and afraid of the future . 
In the field of the military strategy , with regard to the United States ' national missile defense plan which was widely criticized , this representative figure of the conservatives in the US political circles said that Washington was not subject to the binding force of the " Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty " it signed with the former Soviet Union . He also " guaranteed " that the legislation for the deployment of the NMD system would be completed as soon as possible .  
This important thinking came from practice and guide practice .  Once this important thinking is combined with practice , it will become a powerful spiritual and material strength and will greatly advance construction of party-building and comprehensive military construction .  
To sum up , party members should put the important thinking of the " three represents " into practice in a repetitive and long-term manner , make theory part of their personality and working achievements , so that the overall personal quality of the majority of party members will be greatly improved and the military 's comprehensive construction will advance in leaps and bounds .  
Due to the continuous decline and notable shrink in the transactions of Taipei 's stock market in the previous week , the influence of the upcoming PLA military exercise on Dongshan Island , and the upcoming publication of the various industries ' business income in May , electronic shares did not perform well on 4 June , and Taipei 's stock market opened low and remained low .  Except for financial shares , which registered growth thanks to the support of specific funds , all shares declined .  
US media have also paid great attention to it .  Quoting a US military intelligence official , " Washington Post " said that this military exercise of the PLA held in Fujian 's coast was such a large-scale one that " had not been seen for some time " .  Troops participating in the exercise are as many as nearly four times those in the 1996 large-scale exercise , and US surveillance planes have spotted at least 157 amphibious landing ships and combat cars of the PLA gathered on Dongshan Island .  
Berger was Clinton 's military advisor on foreign affairs and security questions , and was a motivating force for the United States and China developing " relations of strategic partners " .  At present , he still insists that " based on the United States ' principles of democracy and national security , the government is obligated to continue to carry out policies to maintain contact with China in principle " .  
First , as " the Le-cheng Program " is a highly confidential program involving top secrets , Taiwan 's military has had to implement the program without mentioning it in public , and Taiwan 's officers and men involved in the program also know very little about it .  As Taiwan 's media have of late published a series of unfavorable reports on " the Le-cheng Program " , Taiwan 's top brass are concerned that the public will not support the program .  
During his inauguration anniversary interview with the Wall Street Journal , he specifically cited the bitter experiences of leaders in neighboring countries in comparison with his own .  Philippine President Estrada was forced to resign , while the Indonesian President was censured by the national assembly , which also threatens to impeach him .  " Taiwan went through the so-called recall incident but made it through in one piece " and the key was that the military did not have a hand in the political scene as Taiwan kept its fine tradition of military nationalization .  
NSC Consultative Committee Member Ko Chen-heng has seriously considered this issue .  He thinks that the system under which the military 's command authority belongs to the minister of national defense in peacetime and to the chief of the general staff during wartime is dangerous and is faulty in design .  Ko Chen-heng told his friends in private that the only military suggestion that he , as a Consultative Committee member , has given President Chen is : " The command authority in the military command system must be an integral whole and should not be divided " .  
The barracks were surrounded by barbed wire , and orderly parked camouflaged military vehicles and artilleries were clearly visible .  Two seriously looking rifle-holding soldiers stood guard .  Eight big characters in red were written on a wooden plate : " It is forbidden to take pictures in this important military area " !  
It was a clear day with fewer clouds .  Sea gulls were flying close to the water .  Dark green military tents were already set up on the beach , surrounded by a dozen or so military vehicles .  
Zhu Zhaofa , office director of Dongshan County 's " frontline supply station " , said that during the military exercise , the planned economy model under the market economic system is implemented for Dongshan Island 's material supply .  While ensuring unchanged prices for the residents , more materials are provided for the army under a preferential scheme .  
US domestic and foreign policies will definitely have a tremendous effect on the world because of the United States ' superpower status in the world .  In particular , the readjustment of US military strategy will not be limited to US security only .  We can see that the political scheme and economic needs from that readjustment will have a major impact on the international political structure and strategic environment of the entire 21st century .  
They won 8 medals for achievements in special military skills competition and in " " revolutionization , modernization , regularization " , meritorious service reward for 51 man-times , and two distinguished honors of winning the titles of " advanced regiment in scientific and technological training " and " advanced regiment in overall construction " .  
The military region party committee , maintaining that these personnel should contribute their talents and services to developing ways and means for winning future warfare , decided to turn them into highly proficient military personnel during the course when the armed forces were engaged in science and technology training .  
Then , aside from assigning the personnel with doctorate or master 's degrees to units with modern equipment and positions that require scientific and technical expertise , the region also gave them important military assignments to accomplish , or assigned them to oversee projects of tackling difficult operational and training problems .  
and four Armed Forces Awards for Scientific and Technological Advancement , Third Class . Tao Qian , an officer with a doctorate degree in science of military campaigns , recently demonstrated his ability in the base that the military region built for combined campaign training exercises .  His remarkable performance in teaching the theory of organized campaigns and directing a real exercise has made him the pacesetter of the military region in providing the armed forces with science and technology training .  
As joint operations waged under modern conditions involve a large number of precision-guided weapons , intelligent weapons , as well as the C4ISR system , which serves as " nerves and brains " for different weapons systems and military command systems , concentration of military strength is now increasingly dependent upon a commander 's enormous potential unleashed via an information system , and upon a perfect integration of different weapons systems and information systems .  
However , since he took office , he has failed to honor his commitment .  To consolidate his political base , he has been blindly playing up to the interests of the conservative forces , the rich , and large enterprises , especially of the military industrial enterprises , in the financial budget and taxation policy , education policy , social security policy , environment policy , and on a series of other issues .  
After the Kosovo war , the United States military and congress unanimously affirmed the policy decision to , after the Gulf war , strengthen the improvement and production of geographic information and precision guidance weapons .  At the same time , they decided , beginning in the year 2000 , to increase by $ 1.2-billion every year the money provided to install global satellite navigation reception equipment on more joint direct attack weapons , joint weapon-launching systems outside defensive areas , and bombs and missiles of joint voice channel monitoring weapons .  
The military branches of other NATO nations , at the same time as they are reforming and strengthening their geographic information assurance , also want to increase the number of equipment retrofit kits adaptable to the NAVSTAR GPS on their missiles , bombs , weapon-launching platforms , electronic surveillance and intelligence systems - - in accordance with the demands of United States military joint combat - - to heighten the global positioning and navigation level of various kinds of munitions .  
In carrying out ideological and political education in the military , it is necessary to focus on the reality of the primate phase of socialism and the objective existence of the socialist market economy , to be responsive to society 's diversified development , to grasp the mainstream and essence , and to work hard to utilize , incorporate , exploit , and develop positive factors .  
In carrying out ideological and political education , the military must adhere to the main melody , vigorously advocate patriotism , collectivism , and the spirit of sacrifice , adhere to the purpose of serving the people whole-heartedly , adhere to principles of materialism , resolutely fight against idealism and feudal superstitions as well as decadent bourgeois lifestyles and various erroneous currents of thought and phenomena .  
Therefore , in carrying out ideological and political education , the military should focus on characteristics and special features , in the process of developing or discarding ideas or ethical standards existing in society in a pluralistic context .  
In carrying out ideological and political education in the military , it is necessary to implement the strategic policy for the new period and to closely center on the requirements of military struggle , working to provide sustained , adequate spiritual motive force for " being able to win " .  
To aim ideological and political education at the war time , it is first of all necessary to intensify education on war-readiness in response to the prevailing situation to guide officers and soldiers , so that they will profoundly understand the importance and urgency of getting prepared for military struggle and educating officers and soldiers to make them understand that hegemonism is now rampant , that " Taiwan independence " forces are increasingly rampant , that there has been a continual tension at the Taiwan Strait , and that there are increasing uncertainties about " peaceful unification " .  
It is necessary to rectify guiding thinking on education , to set education objectives , to arrange education contents , and to improve the education system on the basis of closely centering on the implementation of the military strategic policy for the new period , so as to form an education mechanism suited for prevailing in contemporary warfare and to ensure that the military is capable of accomplishing the sacred mission of resisting aggression and maintaining the country 's unity and territorial integrity .  
It is necessary to fully explore scientific and technological strengths on the basis of accommodating characteristics of information society and to build the military 's internal network of information on political education and make such a network operational as soon as possible , so as to reduce the number of levels and simplify procedures to ensure that education can keep up on a timely basis , respond rapidly , work effectively , and produce real results .  
The ministers held that the fruitful military cooperation between the SCO member states sets a good example of a new kind of regional military cooperation suitable to modern trends in the post-Cold War era .  It is not only conducive to promoting long-term and healthy development of friendly relations and cooperation between SCO member states , but also of great significance to safeguarding regional and world peace and stability .  
The ministers unanimously agree that the fruitful military cooperation based on that of the " Shanghai Five " has set an example for establishing new-type regional military cooperation commensurate with the trend of the times after the Cold War , which is not only conducive to promoting the long-term healthy development of the friendly and cooperative relations among the member nations of the " Shanghai Cooperation Organization " but also is of great significance to maintaining peace and stability in the region and even the world at large .  
After the Bush administration came to power , it treated Russia as " the number one potential opponent " of the United States . It showed an extreme distrust of the Putin government and expressed strong disapproval of Russia 's developing military cooperation with Iran in addition to restoring and strengthening its relationships with some former Soviet Union allies .  
The sovereignty of each newly independent country , even the political stability of the whole region , are threatened by the continuous illegal Chechnya military terrorist acts , the long-lasting Afghan war , the influence of Islamic fundamentalism and the chaotic drug and arms smuggling .  The furious terrorism , separatism and extremism especially endanger the region .  
The Summit attendees unanimously proposed " zero tolerance of separatism , ethnic separatism and religious extremism , " and wrote the proposal that " each member state should adopt measures to combat the international terrorism , organized crimes , arm smuggling , drug trafficking and other transnational criminal activities " in the first joint charter .  It centered the " Shanghai Five " cooperation on the experiment of establishing an effective security cooperation framework instead of its initial goal of accomplishing border military trust and disarmament .  
" Shanghai Five " has played an important role in abolishing border military confrontation among the member states , building up military trust , resolving the border leftover problems , jointly preventing multinational criminal activities , controlling drug and arms smuggling and jointly cracking down on the international evil forces ever since its founding five years ago .  These engagements have become the reason and the strength for the existence of " Shanghai Five " and for the consolidation of its mechanism .  
It is learned that because of the wide gap in the ratio of investment in offensive and defensive weapons , the national army is actively developing " defensive deterrence weapons system , " including secret development of the medium-range ballistic missile with a firing range from 1,000 and 2,000 kilometers , code-named " Tiching . " The army has reported the whole program to President Chen Shui-bian , who has asked the military to develop it as a priority key project .  
Information from military sources has disclosed that the development program of the medium-range ballistic missile , undertaken by the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology [ CIST ] , is a top secret .  Very few officials in the military know about it .  However , some foreign think tank personages have verified it from the Ministry of Defense [ MND ] officials , and there are signs that the number of people who are aware of the program is increasing .  
After the change of the government in March last year , President Chen Shui-bian began inspecting various military headquarters .  When hearing confidential briefings at the CIST on the morning of 4 July , he " confined " the media at the underground " news room . "  Although the journalists were promised that they could view the first half of President Chen 's speech by a closed circuit television broadcast , the video and audio signals were completely cut off after the president spoke just two sentences .  
In discussing the bilateral military relationship , Chi Haotian said the Chinese armed forces are very positive regarding developing friendly relations with the British armed forces , with the frequent high-level exchanges of visits between the two countries ' armed forces in recent years , and constant progress in each area of cooperation and exchange .  
It is for this reason that Comrades Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin , respectively the core of the first three generations of the leadership group of the Party Central Committee , published at crucial moments in the revolution and construction important speeches on " the current situation and the task , " comprehensively and correctly analyzed the domestic and international situation at that time and educated the Party , the military and the people .  
In light of this situation , the office has pooled its backbone technical personnel .  After more than one year of hard work to overcome key problems , they have developed a new type of missile for military training .  Compared with regular missiles , these missiles for military training purpose are low in manufacturing cost .  They can be used several thousand times .  Therefore , they are highly welcomed by military units .  
At the Second CPC Congress of the Arms Department of the General Staff Department , which was convened on 19 June , Fu Quanyou , member of the Central Military Commission and chief of the General Staff Department , stressed : The units of various arms are set to assume arduous tasks , heavy responsibilities , and glorious missions in a new era , in which the PLA forces will push forward a modernization drive in an all-round way , and speed up preparations for a military struggle .  
We must push forward " four innovations " with persistent efforts , namely , innovating in theories , contents , methods , and systems , and work hard to bring about a breakthrough in our military theories , operational guidance , and basic tactics .  We must energetically press ahead in an all-round way our activities of training troops through science and technology , and popularize and upgrade such activities as well .  In training our troops through science and technology , we must also work hard to translate achievements into fighting capacity .  
It is not a special case .  With the many favorable conditions , the Chen Shui-bian administration has speedily entered a stage of good diplomatic relations with the United States . On the contrary , the new politically powerful in Washington had a poor opinion of the Chinese Communists , which greatly deteriorated further after the Chinese Communists ' handling of the military plane collision incident caused ill feelings among the American people .  
The US Defense Department recently submitted a study report to Congress which emphasized that in order to meet the requirements of future war , the US military should attach importance to integrating the combat strength of all branches of the armed forces and organize a combined rapid strike force , so as to make the command system smoother and strike action faster and more effective !  
It is learned that prior to these additions , CCTV had established nine major channels covering news , economics , comprehensive literary and art , international events , sports , movie , children , military , agriculture , television dramas , and English programs .  
It was learned that the zhongshan Institute of Science and Technology has secretly developed " Taiwan 's Tomahawk " cruise missiles designed for striking at targets 1,000 kilometers away , and the missiles have already been tested for hitting targets several hundred kilometers away .  Launched in different ways , " Taiwan 's Tomahawk " cruise missiles are capable of hitting various highly valuable military targets along the mainland coast within nearly 1,000 kilometers from Taiwan .  
the fact that the United Daily News disclosed the military 's covert research and development of the " Hsiung-feng II-E " cruise missile , Major General David Soong , vice president of the Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology , yesterday attended a press conference held by the Ministry of National Defense . He explained during the conference that the " Hsiung-sheng Project " is a project of the Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology aimed at improving the Hsiung-feng II-E anti-ship missile , as well as increasing its accuracy , intercept capability and destructive power .  
Especially since the beginning of the 1990 ' s , with the continuous progress of the domestic and international situation and the magnificent cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the central leadership collective of the party with Jiang Zemin as the core has adhered to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , and made new explorations in practice and a new summarization in theory of many major economic , political , cultural , military , and diplomatic issues , thus enriching and developing Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
The mainland 's military media reported yesterday that the Air Force fleet of the Nanjing Military Region recently conducted an airborne long-distance contingency drill based on actual battle requirements .  The troops overcame difficulties arising from changes in weather conditions and an unfamiliar flight route and airport , and carried out a remarkable mock attack on the " enemy 's " radar , thereby realizing a successful first-entry , first-discovery , first-attack , and first-hit .  
Through this campaign , officers and solders have profoundly understood that the party 's absolute leadership over the military is determined by the nature of our military .  It is crucial for the life of our military and fundamental for the victory of our military .  This campaign has further consolidated the determination of officers and soldiers to continuously advance the military modernization construction under the leadership of the party .  
Cadres of naval and air forces have organized for party members and cadres , in light of the six-point requirements proposed by the General Department of Politics on maintaining the advanced nature of party members , to identify their weaknesses in ideological and political qualities and scientific , technological and cultural abilities , and strengthen the military 's sense of the urgency and responsibilities for advancing the military construction .  
All military forces closely united this educational campaign with the practical struggle and the reality of the thinking of officers and soldiers and distinguishing the right and wrong regarding crucial and major issues .  
A division of Jinan Military Area Command regarded strengthening the leadership over ideological and political work as an important responsibility of party committees .  In light of the rapid development in the international and domestic situations as well as with frequent occurrence of crucial issues , this division promptly analyzed the ideological trend of the military , and adhered to the system according to which leading cadres give reports on the situation , answer questions that officers and soldiers are generally concerned about and use decisions made by the party Central Committee to unite thinking .  
On the basis of this training and with the guidance of departments concerned under the fleet , they made bold efforts in giving up the previous drill pattern of " hitting dead targets . "  Instead , they used mobile target ships that can change direction and speed to simulate the movement of " enemy " ships .  As a result , they have greatly enhanced the difficulty in military drills .  
do a good job of the logistic work in the preparations for military struggle and of logistic reform and innovation with high demands and the spirit of the speech as the base , by centering on the party 's objective of endeavor and historical mission in the new century , and in line with the requirements set by the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission , and realize adequate logistic support in real terms ;  
We must meet the general requirements of building armed forces that are " qualified politically and competent militarily and has a fine style of work , strict discipline and adequate logistic support , " and follow the military strategy for the new era as our overriding guideline .  We must stress the quality of army-building and strengthen our armed forces by relying on science and technology and run the army according to law in an effort to build the People 's Liberation Army into a strong , modern and revolutionary regular army .  
Those advanced collectives and outstanding individuals are from enterprises , rural areas , organizations , schools , scientific research institutes , neighborhoods , military and other fronts .  Their advanced deeds and noble spirit have embodied the character , styles and features of contemporary members of the CPC with clear characteristics of our time .  
In conducting their respective theoretical study , ideological and political education , and political theory course teaching , the central study groups of party committees , armed forces , and military academies and schools must allot special time to organize the study of General Secretary Jiang 's important speech and properly unify the thinking and understanding of officers and soldiers on major issues so that they will willingly maintain a high degree of ideological and political unity with the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
It is a rather complete system of science in the aspects of philosophy , political economy , and scientific socialism and covers the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnic , military , foreign affairs , united front , and party building aspects .  It is also a system of science to be further enriched and developed in all aspects .  
An expert working on a certain base of the General Armament Department said that faced with new situations and tasks , scientific researchers must strive to realize the important ideology of the " Three Represents , " to occupy the main battle position of the world 's advanced military scientific and technological development , and to become the advanced representatives for the modernization construction and development of the weapons and equipment of the Chinese Army .  
During a discussion session , officers and men of the " Indomitable Company , " recalling the achievements scored thanks to the close care given by the party 's three generations of leaders , said that they must carry forward the " indomitable spirit , " train hard , strive to gain high-tech military knowledge , acquire tough amphibious landing skills , undertake the sacred mission , increase glory to the party flag , and add luster to the military banner .  
the proportion of the gross industrial product made up of dominant products , high-tech products and technical products for both military and civilian use rising to 40 percent from the current approximately 30 percent ;  
According to what is understood , for more than 20 years China 's national defense science and technology industry has gradually realized a transformation from an industry that produces industrial products for military use only , to one that produces products that integrate military and civilian use .  Every industry within the military industrial complex has fundamentally formed a developmental pattern with professional characteristics for products for the civilian industry .  
Launching a psychological offensive in conjunction with military action and breaking down the enemies ' morale through applying psychological pressure that leads to their defeat and to the seizing of the initiative in a war has been a favorite method embraced by both Chinese and foreign military thinkers both ancient and modern times .  
and it was a programmatic document guiding us in the new millennium to comprehensively promote the party 's construction of grand new projects , and to comprehensively promote the grand cause of the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics .  The troops throughout the entire military must thoroughly understand the vital significance of General Secretary Jiang 's speech , make studying and implementing the speech a significant political mission and a long term strategic mission , and lose no time in firmly grasping these missions .  
Analyzing the issue in the context of international strategy , how could the United States guarantee that the reconnaissance plane with sophisticated equipment would not take pictures of important military facilities along the coast and carry out " legal espionage mission " once it was permitted to cross China 's territorial airspace ?  Moreover , without regard to China 's strong objection , the United States had resumed its spying mission in the air space of South China and said that it would continue to do so .  
As disclosed by an informed source , US Secretary of State Colin Powell will be visiting Beijing around 20 July to repair the battered bilateral relations after the military plane collision incident and the US arms sales to Taiwan and to pave the way for President Bush 's official visit to China this October . He will establish with the Chinese side the general direction and main agenda of the summit meeting , and the Chinese side will recommend to the US side Bush 's specific itinerary at the request of the United States . 
Beijing 's top hierarchy recently stated its formulation on the relaxation of Sino-US relations .  It noted that as proven by facts , the Chinese government is becoming more and more mature in its handling of major international affairs , as in its crossing of swords with the United States over the military plane collision , stressing that the Chinese government has maintained national sovereignty , dignity and interests while preventing a serious impact and damage on Sino-US relations as a whole .  
The cadre center of the city military sub-district has exploited its advantage of having many politically steadfast veteran cadres and organized and sent its personnel to veteran cadres ' activity centers in urban and rural areas and to neighborhoods to publicize and explain the thinking of " three-represents , " and to encourage veteran cadres to advocate advanced culture .  
In the face of the worst flood since the founding of New China , leading members of the Guangxi regional party committee and the regional government personally went to the front line to direct the work of combating the flood .  More than 100,000 military servicemen and people have been organized to reinforce the dikes .  After overcoming various kinds of difficulties , they built more than 10 kilometers of auxiliary dikes within two days .  
All military units and armed police units should offer assistance to areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups , old revolutionary base areas , border areas , and areas bogged down in serious poverty in the central and western parts of the country .  
The circular requires that all military units provide more technological , educational , cultural , and medical support to the people in poor areas , thus helping them develop the ability to shake off poverty and get rich .  
Military schools and academies and military scientific research institutes should use their favorable conditions to pass scientific knowledge to the people in poor areas , transfer scientific and technological achievements to production , spread the use of advanced techniques , help the masses to master science and technology and thus build up their ability to develop the economy .  
The KMT 's confederation proposition reads : " The party , on the basis of abiding by the National Unification Outlines and the 1992 consensus about ' one China , with each side of the strait having the freedom to define its meaning , ' seeks to establish a peaceful and stable cross-strait relationship , build a mechanism governing mutual trust in the military sphere , and build the Taiwan Strait into a zone of peace .  
A rapid response unit will join in the military exercise for the first time .  The special armed unit whose members were transferred from the Beijing Theater 's certain group army , has accomplished various assault training missions in northern China over the last two years .  The unit has been airlifted to the Fuzhou Theater by Russia-made IL-76 transport planes to join in live-fire training .  In addition , the airborne force is now in a predetermined area awaiting orders .  The marine corps has also sent a task force to take part in the war drill .  
The magazine says that in the planned military exercise , the PLA will use the following hi-tech weapons : Feibao medium range fighter-bombers , IL-76 transport planes , Zhi-9 armed helicopters , modern class warships , Kilo class submarines , Dongfeng - 15 tactical ballistic missiles , 63A tanks , S-300PMU1 air-defense missiles , Daoer M1 air-defense missiles , and red earth shells .  
According to military sources , Chen zhen-xiang , taking a handful of Army General Headquarters officers with him , left for a secret visit to Europe on 30 June . At least Germany , Austria and Switzerland were included in his itinerary .  It is believed that he visited some of the host countries ' army units to get acquainted with the current situation of their army-building efforts and learn from their experience in the use of wheel-type armored vehicles and tactical wheel-type vehicles .  
Zhang Qiyue said , as everyone knows , China practices a peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , and its military expenditure has always been at a low level among major world powers .  
It is quite unreasonable for Japan to make wild comments about China 's normal national defense construction in an official publication such as its " Defense White Paper , " and this does not help to promote mutual understanding and trust between the two countries in the military security field .  
With regard to the means of commanding armament , the military region has developed an applicable software for the armament command system of group armies and built an initial automatic command system for armament for field operations that is linked to field operation command and coordinated with logistical support .  
Making full use of the powerful position of junior military academies and strengthening ideological and political education among the children and youth so that they will foster from childhood the fine quality of loving the party , the motherland , the people , and the army and give them training in acquiring a patriotic spirit of a high degree , a strong sense of national defense , a strong will , and strong physique is a major issue that has a bearing on the future of China 's socialist modernization .  
The provincial military district system , in accordance with relevant regulations at a national level and in the military , integrate political education , organization and rectification , military training , recruitment work , and major holiday and commemoration activities , accomplishing national defense of civilian militia reserves .  
The party , government , military , and civilian must pool their efforts , coordinate closely , and expand in a deep and sustained way the advertisement of the " National Defense Education Law " , creating a fine social atmosphere that all people will focus on , be concerned with , and support .  
They have also dispatched the fleet to the sea to conduct test training in different sea areas and under different weather conditions .  They have successively completed more than 30 difficult training courses , including replenishment in rocky areas at night , round-the-clock comprehensive supplies from all directions , replenishment in strong waves and winds , and joint logistical replenishment tasks by military and civilian vessels .  
To increase the rapid response capability of the base for accidental events on the sea , the base 's logistics leaders and units have vigorously developed the maritime emergency support services .  They have organized emergency support subunits out of defense logistics , arms and equipment , and military supply departments .  They have equipped them with light and advanced logistic facilities as well as conducted special training for them so that they can promptly provide maritime logistical support on receipt of an order .  
The foundation of the two countries ' complementary and mutually beneficial economic , trade , and military relationship is solid ; China is Russia 's sixth largest trading partner , and Russia is China 's ninth ; last year their bilateral trade totalled $ 8 billion .  
Over the past three years , by accepting and resettling a total of 4,008 demobilized military cadres , as well as 270 camp families , the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has successfully completed the state-assigned resettlement task and basically attained the goal of making the armed forces , the local authorities , and the demobilized cadres feel satisfied .  
The US military maintains that in order to secure a victory in a ground offensive campaign , the US ground force should build mobile units capable of fighting and encircling an enemy in a vertical way .  
The MND organized more than 100 officers to participate in the operation of the " Lecheng " plan , which includes many plans and special projects and requires a wide range of cooperation .  Frequent meetings every month enabled US officers on active service to visit all Taiwan 's sensitive and important military areas , such as the Air Force Operation Command , the Army 's missile bases , and the Navy submarine base , and to conduct field investigations of the coastal areas where the Chinese communists may conduct landing .  
The US military has also assisted the Army to establish an " electronic warfare battalion " in secret .  It has leased all the necessary electronic warfare equipment and delivered to the Army a set of mobile equipment , which is the most advanced equipment in service .  The US military plans to deliver five sets of such equipment to Taiwan .  
These people naturally bear a grudge against the armed forces or the government .  Since military personnel have their deep-rooted political belief and ideology , the top military and intelligence leaders are taking communist China 's military united front work plan for the recruitment of our retired servicemen very seriously .  The unit concerned has in fact identified a certain retired army lieutenant general as a possible hidden target of military united front work by the Chinese communists , as he has been seeking advantage for himself by all means on the mainland .  
To cope with the situation as quickly as possible , the government should increase high-technology weapons , get rid of the thinking of symmetrical operations , change the current situation in which the army amounts to a higher proportion in the three armed forces , and implement as quickly as possible the tactic of downsized troops .  In this way , the situation in which outlays for personnel maintenance accounts for half the annual defense budget and eats up the military investment budget can be avoided and fighting capability will be intensified .  
Rumsfeld has indicated on numerous occasions that , although Europe 's importance to the US remains unchanged , with the break up of the Soviet Union the military threat that the US faces in Europe has been greatly reduced , and the eastward expansion of NATO has also clearly increased NATO 's strategic depth , resulting in a great improvement in the security environment of the European allies , and at present the likelihood of war breaking out on the European continent is far less than in Asia .  
While it will still take time for the United States to build NMD , its firm intention to deploy a missile defense system in pursuit of absolute military superiority is having an increasingly marked negative impact on the international strategic order .  It will undoubtedly undermine the global strategic balance , triggering a new arms race .  
Shuai Hwa-min pointed out that , speaking of this current phase , Taiwan-US military exchanges certainly have their necessity and importance , but this kind of exchange , rather , is not the kind which can generate a military alliance and actual troop joint military exercises , which is what the people of the nation are hoping for .  The biggest key factor is that the two sides are nations without diplomatic relations .  Therefore , future Taiwan-US military exchanges will continue to be low key , but they will be conducted in an essentially advancing way .  
According to " New York Times , " the US Department of Defense recently decided to make a major adjustment in its military strategy , replacing the strategy of " fighting and winning two major wars simultaneously " implemented since 1991 with a new strategy requiring troops to " win a decisive victory " in a major regional war and , at the same time , maintain sufficient capability to fulfill other important tasks .  
The US military has to spend a huge amount of fund to sustain the armed forces capable of fighting " two wars . "  This strategy requires that the United States maintain at least 1.4-million troops on active service .  Even with such a massive army , the Pentagon has to admit , the United States can only undertake less than a half of the war tasks .  
In the purpose of military buildup , it will strive to build an army " more compact in scale , quicker in response , more flexible in action , more accurate in attack , tighter in defense , faster in deployment , and more effective in support , " which " will have absolute supremacy over all future threats , including opponents equipped with weapons of mass destruction . "  
Guam is about 1,500 nautical miles from the Philippines . The US deployment of massive forces at this important " strategic supporting point " reflects the strategic thinking of the new Bush administration and will be conducive to launching a long-distance precision attack against the mainland 's coastal regions by US military within 12 hours .  
The military exercises staged there by Communist China will be conducive to practicing a cross-region combined battle of the three services and testing the rapid mobilization system in the local region without interfering with the overall situation of economic development of the southeast region .  
The province has fully exploited the material support provided for coastal defense and security management by rapid economic development .  Drawing on science and technology , Jiangsu has abandoned the past method of simply relying on patrols and inspections of beaches .  Instead , the province has included public order , production , transit , ships , ports , and military facilities in coastal areas into the land-sea-air comprehensive management system .  
Lianyungang and other localities have brought into full play the role of high-tech facilities of military bases in the field of coastal defense surveillance and have built and improved a multilevel surveillance and intelligence network for the sea and coastal regions ( including islands ) .  This has enhanced the coastal defense monitoring capability in ocean and territorial airspace , not merely restricted to coastal beaches , thus solving the difficult problem in coastal defense management .  
In order to ensure harbor safety and a smooth navigation channel during wartime , the unit made full use of local fishing vessels in their preparations for military struggles and regarded conducting joint military-civilian sea drills to " launch counterattacks on small-scale enemies " an important study subject .  After repeated deliberations and verifications , the unit drew up a plan to build a combined formation of corvettes and armed fishing vessels and lay down the principle for allocating men and equipment .  
We have a system to establish political commissioners and political institutions .  We also have a system to base Party branches on the military units at the company level .  The availability of and the adherence to these systems enables our military to ensure the military remains under the Party 's firm control despite the dynamic historical conditions and constant changes in members of the military .  
The system according to which the leading commander of a military unit is responsible for this unit and which stipulates that this unit should be under the collective leadership of the Party committee of this unit as well ? is a way to carry out the democratic centralization system in the military ; it is the fundamental system for adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership over the military and is an effective mechanism for Party committees to lead military forces .  
At a certain place in eastern China , a hunter chasing an animal in a dense forest suddenly came upon a sight that stopped him in his path : A unit of soldiers , wearing green berets , herb-spot camouflage uniforms , and white armbands were charging toward him , along with scores of tanks in camouflage ; the tanks were not displaying the " 1st August army emblem " but a triangular military emblem .  The hunter ran as fast as he could .  
Because the " Red Army " and the " Blue Army " compete with each other without knowing the other side 's manpower deployment , battle approaches , and tactical motives , their tactical training has therefore altered from a unilateral combined training to a realistic actual-troops confrontation , thus changing the mode of our military 's exercise , in which the " Red Army " used to win every battle .  
The large-scale sci-tech military exercises have made many achievements using new experiments , such as combined operations drills , internet warfare against directorate organizations , rapid reaction training of artillerymen , training in offshore composite formation by numerous naval vessels , mobile launch training for missile troops , and others .  
Many large-scale military exercises have shown the newest achievements that China 's military has obtained from the traditional " three attacks and three defenses " - - attacking tanks , planes , and airborne troops , and defending against nuclear , chemical , and biological attacks - - to the " new three attacks and three defenses " of attacking stealth aircraft , cruise missiles , and helicopter gun ships , and defending against precision strikes , electronic jamming , and reconnaissance and surveillance .  
On this occasion , on the issue of biological weapons , the Bush Administration uses the excuse that the stipulations of the draft agreement of the protocol , regarding verification and inspection , might threaten US commercial and military secrets , leading to the adoption of an opposition standpoint , in total disregard for the appeals and great efforts of the international community ; this has once again demonstrated that the Bush Administration is determined to obstinately cling to its course and disregard the opposition of the international community .  
The psychological and electronic warfare troops established recently by the PLA coordinated for the first time the operations of military reconnaissance satellites over the Taiwan Strait . The second stage was " combined forces of the navy , the army and the air force crossing the Strait and carrying out landing operations , " which mostly consisted of guided missile attacks and other methods .  This illustrates the fact that the manner adopted by the PLA to attack Taiwan has switched from one of a " sea-borne landing " to " airborne raids " and other varieties .  
Su Zhirong : In the new era , the PLA has set implementation of military combat preparedness as the primary objective of modernization , with the armed forces building the " two fundamental transitions , " that is : in military combat preparedness , making the transition from dealing with combat situations under normal conditions to achieving victory in combat under conditions of modern technology , especially high technology ;  
China uses its military power to ensure a safe and secure domestic and foreign environment for our national economic construction and reform and opening up , to protect our national interest , national dignity and international prestige .  These all fall into the category of a self-protection strategy .  
The PLA General Logistics Department , acting in line with state laws and army regulations , conducted checks on 82,000 vehicles with military license plates , and recovered a number of stolen , expired , and fake military license plates , thereby deterring criminal groups from committing illegal activities that undermine the army vehicles ' legitimate interests .  
It also has a bearing on the rise or fall of the Chinese nation .  It will also determine whether or not our army can always become the effective tool to fulfill the Party 's political tasks under the new situation .  Therefore , to continuously arm our army with military equipment of advanced technology , enhance our army 's fighting power , and fulfill the Party 's highest political requirements in " fighting to win " should be our army 's basic task in upholding the Party 's absolute leadership over the army under the new situation .  
Efforts must be made to step up our efforts in carrying out reform in the army and strengthening army building .  We must continuously develop high technology in order to enhance fighting power by training more skilled professionals , improving military equipment , reforming the military structure , and carrying out major high-tech military drills .  All this is aimed at turning our army into a mighty army that will remain invincible in future warfare and live up to the expectation of our Party and the people .  
Over 60 qualified military and technical personnel and 34 university students who were from the current term entered the base and settled down , while scores of directing and dispatching personnel pursued advanced studies in colleges and institutes .  
At the same time , in line with the features of the establishment of external units , the base has provided the " Blue Army " with infantry , artillery , armored , engineering , chemical , communication , electronic confrontation , and helicopter troops - - which form a joint training command headquarters with the air force and the army aviation unit - - and has copied military drills and training conducted by powerful adversaries . 
Over the past few years , the Central Military Commission and the General Departments have implemented a series of significant measures and devoted even greater efforts to rewarding excellent military professionals .  For example , awards were established and issued for significant technical achievements and for military professionals who excelled in a variety of fields .  Senior specialists are treated according to higher standards .  
The verdict that metes out the heavy punishment points out that Ji Shengde , in addition to accepting huge amounts of bribes from Lai Changxing , could not explain the sources of his assets that valued at tens of millions of Hong Kong dollars , broke the rules set for military intelligence operations , and used enormous amounts of public funds without authorization .  
He said , developing good neighborly and friendly relations between the DPRK and Russia is in the fundamental interests of both countries , and there are tremendous potentials for bilateral cooperation in the economic , military , and cultural fields .  
Jiang Zemin emphasized that the general task of the whole party and the whole armed forces is to meet the needs of the new international situation in the new century , gain more relatively peaceful time to develop the economy , science , technology and military to a new level , and increase the comprehensive national strength .  Only in this way will it be possible to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity better and this is the strategic policy .  
Since the 1991 Gulf War , the US and British aircraft have been flying on patrol missions in two " no-fly zones , " set up over the north and south of Iraq respectively , frequently striking at various civilian and military targets in Iraq , and resulting in losses in human life and property .  
An official of US Defense Department who asked not to be named said on 10 August that the United States hoped to establish with Russia complete , normal , and friendly relations in the economic , political , military , and other fields , as a solid foundation for security and stability , and that , in this process , the two countries will simultaneously recede from the " ABM Treaty . "  
To win a local war under the future high-tech conditions , the PLA has actively carried out weaponry and military restructuring and changed its training contents and methods , with a view to increasing high-tech weaponry , improving the quality of troops , and enhancing its troops ' quick reaction ability .  
On 7 and 8 August , the Russian military delegation headed by Colonel General Yuri Baluyevsky , first deputy chief of Russia 's general staff , and the US military delegation headed by Douglas Feith , undersecretary of defense for policy , held a two-day meeting in the US Pentagon . At the end of the meeting , they issued a brief statement , saying that the delegations of the two countries held a " substantive discussion " on an extensive scope of issues concerning strategic stability and international security .  
An unidentified official of the US Defense Department said on 10 August that the United States hoped to establish all-round normal and friendly relations in the economic , political , and military fields with Russia as a solid foundation for security and stability , and hoped that both sides would agree to withdraw from the ABM Treaty at the same time .  
The " Ordinance " stresses : The development of an automated command system must be organized and carried out according to military needs .  It is necessary to adhere to the thought of integrative development , unify leadership , unify planning , unify the technical structure , effect scientific organization and close cooperation , emphasize practical results , and ensure quality .  
It is precisely these two " leaps " that have provided vast room for the development of the Japanese armed forces .  Thus , the self-defense forces are developing in the direction of long-range and massive weapons .  Moreover , Japan has joined hands with the United States to push ahead with the development of the Theater Missile Defense system in a bid to achieve absolute military superiority with which it " can both attack other countries and avoid attacks from them . "  
The ongoing large-scale military exercise " Liberation No 1 " in Fujian 's Dongshan Island entered its third stage of " making counterattack and hitting reinforcements " a few days ago .  Two Sovremenny-class warships imported from Russia joined the combat groups in a combined exercise of attacking an aircraft carrier , and two live Sunburn missiles were fired for the first time .  
Given this , in order to divert public attention from domestic economic issues , allow himself a breathing spell , and win more time for working out new economic policies , Junichiro Koizumi deemed it necessary to create some political , diplomatic , and military news , and this is nothing but an old trick favored by some Japanese politicians .  
Cadres and soldiers did penetrating research on foreign military equipment and discovered that , considering the defensive and maneuvering capabilities of modern armed helicopters , ordinary light weapons definitely can not shoot them down easily .  
Borrowing from the military region signal regiment 's achievements in the scientific and technical training of troops , the group army 's signal elements overcame the difficulty of insufficient amounts of equipment and materials , and scientifically conducted " three defenses " training in defending against enemy reconnaissance and surveillance , defending against enemy electronic jamming , and defending against an enemy 's precise attacks .  
and attempted to sever the kinship forged with blood , which is thicker than water , between the people on two sides .  As if that is not enough , the Taiwan authorities have time and time again spent the hard-earned money of the general public in buying advanced weapons from abroad .  They advocate " fighting a decisive battle outside our borders " and wish to enter into a military alliance with the United States and Japan against the mainland .  
The Jinan Military Region especially held a training class for retiring political commissars at rest homes and some retired veteran cadres in order to have sufficient backbone instructors to guide the study by veteran cadres of the entire military region .  
To align the personal quality of these professional soldiers with the requirements of the rank of nomcom as soon as possible , people who have obtained the rank of noncom must understand their position and role in military construction , be aware of their duties and have a strong sense of urgency regarding learning information about organization , training , and education and about administrating soldiers , so as to improve their overall quality in the military and in political fields .  
For the sake of ensuring the unity of our motherland , the Chinese armed forces are perfectly capable of monitoring fixed and moving targets along the southeastern coast and nearby waters , to spot , track , and identify medium-sized and larger military vessels .  They are capable of anytime , all-weather monitoring of large warships ( mainly aircraft carriers ) .  
actively organize and encourage both army troops and militia reserves to plunge themselves in the current large-scale development of the country 's western region ; take up urgent , difficult , dangerous , and heavy tasks on our own initiative ; and strive for dual effects of promoting economic development and consolidating the defense building in line with the principle of manufacturing products for both peacetime and wartime use and for both military and civilian use .  
Then , under Helen 's command , the US special mixed fleet turned and fled toward the open waters .  In 1996 , when the PLA conducted a military exercise including test-firing its guided missiles , the United States also sent aircraft carriers to the Taiwan Strait . After the PLA 's nuclear submarines departed from their military port and disappeared in the vast seas , the US aircraft carriers immediately left the region .  
The key to building a system of logistics support that is adaptable to joint operations and to fundamentally eliminating such deficiencies as multiple channeling , separation of the general-purpose support and the special-purpose support , and operation via separate bodies is to take the road of integration .  This will bring about a new setup of logistics support where support for the three armed services are integrated as one , the system is compatible to both the military and the civilian , and the general-purpose logistics supplies and services are all supported in a unified way .  
The existing joint rear service system based on military regions still adopts the past method of combining supply and demand as one and integrating fund and support-in-kind .  This can hardly meet the demand of the " three-dimensional matrix " style operational mechanism of integrated support .  The mechanism for logistical operation must be changed .  
Qian Qichen said in his speech , international nongovernmental organizations have developed very rapidly in recent years ; they have played an increasingly important role in international political , economic , military , cultural , and social fields , and have become a force that can not be neglected in the international arena .  
It is said that during the amphibious landing joint military exercise on Dongshan Island , the Chinese Communist once more used large commercial vessels to ship supporting firepower cannons and rockets .  The purpose is nothing more than making up for the severe shortage of conventional amphibious landing vessels .  But this action will only be feasible under the condition of possessing superior naval and air forces .  These vessels are big and weak targets , but not a miraculous cure as they appear to be .  
Viewing from the United States ' perspective , high ranking US officials have generally recognized that in the Indian Ocean region - - no matter whether it is considered from the angle of territorial size , population and resources , scientific and technological capabilities , or military and economic strength - - India fully deserves to be considered as one of the top great nations , and it also possesses influence in the international political arena that can not be ignored .  
Moreover , the Taiwan authorities have repeatedly used the money earned by onerous toil of the ordinary people to buy advanced weapons from foreign countries , advocated " a decisive battle offshore , " and intended to form a military alliance against the mainland with the United States and Japan .  
A military official has commented that the new government may very likely be drawn into a scandal in future in the " underwater sonic detection system " cooperation program , just like the scandals surrounding the purchases of French Lafayette frigates that troubled the previous government .  
For example , the health of Tang Yao-ming has become a political issue because of his position .  When the media learned that he underwent surgery to remove his gallbladder , they sought confirmation from the military before reporting on it .  However , the military broke the news first by publishing Tang Yao-ming 's surgery on Ching-Nien Jih-Pao . Thus , the media were unable to break the news .  This struck a great fear into journalism and the media can no longer trust the directive to " confirm all matters through the spokesman . "  
After the plane collision incident in early April this year , the Chinese Government actively resolved the incident in reasonable and moderate fashion , but after the US aircrewhad returned home the US side turned around and would not admit that it was in the wrong , and the US military announced the temporary suspension of military exchanges with China .  
since the mid-1990 ' s , the PLA has discarded its former positional defense warfare and started to attach importance to rapid mobile warfare ; while streamlining its personnel , it has organized rapid reaction units , and now has over 100,000 troops in rapid reaction units with modern equipment , which are subordinate to the group armies in the seven military regions ; these are capable of rapid reaction by land , sea , and air , and can be termed as the PLA 's crack and fist units in the new century .  
During the current military exercises underway at Dongshan island and the southeast coast , the special electronic countermeasures unit which has just been organized has for the first time been operating in coordination with military reconnaisance satellites ;  
This is specifically expressed in the following ways : The special electronic countermeasures unit which has just been organized is for the first time operating in the Taiwan strait in coordination with military satellite reconnaisance ;  
During the current military exercises underway at the Dongshan Island and the southeast coast , the special electronic countermeasures unit , which has just been organized , has for the first time been operating in coordination with military reconnaissance satellites in the Taiwan Strait ;  
General Secretary Jiang 's July 1 speech , he said , is important because it provides our party with a powerful ideological weapon for understanding , strengthening , and improving itself under new historical conditions and provides a strong spiritual force for our great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  Studying the speech is not only an important political task for the entire military now , but also a long-term strategic task .  
Meanwhile , Israeli Prime Minister Sharon suspended his vacation and returned to Tel Aviv , where he immediately convened an emergency meeting participated in by cabinet members , including the foreign minister and the defense minister .  The meeting decided to continue adopting a resolute retaliating measure against any act of attacking Israeli targets .  It even allowed the military to adopt acts of attacking targets inhabited by common people .  
The Chinese military expert held that the 21st century would be a " marine century . "  He said : It is necessary to make conscientious efforts to build a powerful and large navy and turn it into one of the major forces that protect the motherland and safeguard world peace and regional security .  
The spokesman said : Attempts , plans , and actions by a single country to seek military and strategic advantages in outer space not only have always existed but are being further developed .  If this is not prohibited , it is likely that weapons will be employed in outer space in the near future , which could even lead to a multilateral arms race in outer space .  
With regard to Taiwan 's form of government , the Taiwan authorities are seeking to transform Taiwan into an " independent political entity " through a " constitutional reform . "  In foreign relations , the Taiwan authorities have spared no effort to carry out the activities of creating " two Chinas . " In military affairs , the Taiwan authorities have bought large quantities of advanced weapons from foreign countries and attempted to establish a military alliance of a disguised form with the United States and Japan .  
We have of late paid a visit to a certain air strike division of the Chinese Air Force , a hero unit known far and wide for its military prowess in the southeast , and interviewed the division 's Commander Zhang and political Commissar Su . What we saw and heard there has left us such a deep impression that the " fist " flight division has all along remained as a vanguard .  
Under the pretext of the so-called " China threat theory , " some foreign forces have also seized opportunities to intervene in the Taiwan question , an act of interference in China 's internal affairs , through diverse means such as , in the military sphere , continuing arms sales to Taiwan and building " theater missile defense , " in an attempt to secure their strategic interests in the Asia-Pacific region through the continued playing of the " Taiwan card , " thereby presenting a threat to our national security .  
- - He stressed holding cross-strait talks on an equal basis under the one-China principle and did not mention " talks between the central and local authorities . "  He reiterated that conditions for Taiwan can be more liberal than those for Hong Kong and Macao , that is , a high degree of autonomy ; the mainland will not send troops and officials to Taiwan ; Taiwan 's judicial powers will be completely independent ; Taiwan will have the power of final adjudication ; Taiwan can completely retain its original party , administrative , and military systems ;  
Speaking about the military meeting between the United States and Taiwan to be held in Washington in April , Zhu Bangzao emphasized that the Taiwan issue is China 's internal affair and the United States should not interfere in it .  The Chinese Government is opposed to US arms sales to Taiwan and has on many occasions explicitly opposed US moves to provide Taiwan with any theater missile defense system and relevant technical equipment .  This stand is firm and unshakable .  
The extent to which science and technology are applied and mastered in the military domain and the scientific and technological level of arms and equipment as well as military scientific and technological quality of commanders are the key symbols of army modernization .  How to take the strategy of building a strong army through science and technology as an important means of realizing army modernization ?  
regard raising the scientific and technological quality of military personnel as an important strategic task ; work hard to train qualified cross-century hi-tech personnel ; implement in real earnest Chairman Jiang Zemin 's requirement of " rather letting qualified personnel wait for equipment than letting equipment wait for qualified personnel , " and put scientific and technological quality progress of qualified personnel in a prominent position in the Chinese army 's modernization building .  
He emphasized the necessity of giving prominence to key points , linking with the reality of the armed forces , closely centering around the two historical themes of " being able to win " and " not changing color " facing the PLA , thinking deeply about how to keep abreast of the new trends in the world 's military development and how to bring about development in big strides in the modernization of the armed forces , and putting forward suggestions and proposals that show real knowledge and deep insight .  
At the same time , he also proposed that departments concerned should re-appraise the reasonability and serviceability of the existing national defense engineering system in southeast coastal areas based on the Central Military Commission 's military strategic principle for the new period , should rebuild this system in line with the requirements of the future high-tech war , and should intensify the building of military facilities and future battlefields in order to meet the demands of the military struggles against Taiwan .  
The national defense budget for this fiscal year will be raised by 12.7 percent ; the task of cutting 500,000 military personnel set three years ago has been completed ;  
The grand military review for celebrating the 50th founding anniversary of New China demonstrated to the whole world our army 's fine spiritual outlook and tremendous achievements in modernization .  This military review also greatly inspired the patriotic enthusiasm and the national pride of the people throughout the country .  
Reportedly , after drawing from the experience of the military pressure exerted during Taiwan 's presidential elections in 1996 and also for the sake of avoiding unnecessary conjecture , the air force , navy , and missile troops along the southeast coastal areas have received orders to suspend all their military exercises one week before and after Taiwan 's current presidential elections .  The military action will be focused on stepped up monitoring and patrols .  
A military source said that the situation of current cross-strait ties is changeable and the period is crucial .  There is no need to be panic because it is quite normal and reasonable for the troops stationed along the coast to be on alert and to be prepared for all contingencies .  
As the Chinese military begins to pay close attention to its modernization and strives to catch up to and surpass others in every military aspect , there is a book circulating in China entitled " Chao Xian Zhan " ( " Unrestricted Warfare " ) .  It advances a tactic known as " unrestricted warfare , " and although this is neither a mature thought nor a formal line of thinking in the Chinese military , it nevertheless has evoked broad repercussions .  
They hold the key to how the emerging countries should deal with today 's international order and rules .  The many problems China has run into in its modernization process , including its backward political , military , economic conditions today , make many people suspicious of the rules of international competition and contemporary warfare .  Many believe that under the rules drawn up mainly by the Western developed countries , China can never win .  
After the Cold War , although the United States ' military development has advanced to a level unprecedented in human history , the international rules and international order have remained in effect .  The Americans have not gone all out , like other imperial expansionists we are familiar with in world history , to forcefully establish hegemony based purely on military power similar to the kind we know in history .  
Those who proposed " unrestricted warfare " fully considered the changing military operations brought by the new technological means , but they failed to consider the rules , morals , and conscience of mankind that also govern the course of war .  The new military means and modes of warfare are still governed by traditional rules of war , including the restrictions of international laws ; there is no legal vacuum .  
In a modern war where the use of force sees no bounds , the weak are still nations outside of the West , because the Western nations so far are in control of the initiative for technological and scientific advancements and the resulting military advantages .  In a war where the two opposite sides have no rules but make massacre their ultimate goal , the victor will still be the side with technology and material superiority .  
Modern war is contention of the entire military systems and not simply confrontation between certain military systems , and it is victory in the main military domain that determines overall victory .  To gain temporary superiority in some non-crucial military domain by breaking the rules of war , even if that superiority is due to advanced technologies , will only bring partial victory which often ends in overall defeat .  This is because after the rules of war are broken , the side with overall superiority will become even more destructive amid the confusion .  
These non-traditional acts of violence are not accepted as legal national means of war by today 's international military systems and by modern international laws on armed confrontation , because by most countries ' existing laws and moral order , most of those acts are clearly and unmistakably illegal acts of violence .  A country founded on laws and democratic traditions can not regard an illegal act as a legal means .  
" The Chinese People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] is a mighty , civilized , and victorious military force which has been ever-triumphant .  Moreover , after carrying out reform and opening up for over 20 years , China has attained outstanding accomplishments in facilitating economic and social progress which attracted global attention .  Consequently , China has very considerably enhanced its social productivity , comprehensive national strength , and national defense capability .  
Female senior engineer Su Longxu , aged 37 , has developed over 40 scientific and technological accomplishments over the past 10 years .  Out of the total , seven were first-class and second-class awards for military scientific and technological progress , and eight items were awarded national patents .  Ninety percent of the scientific and technological accomplishments have been promoted and applied extensively .  
The top level in Beijing believes that peaceful reunification must be guaranteed by powerful military force and correct strategic design , otherwise , the initiative in cross-strait relations will be lost .  
To safeguard the interests of their own bourgeois class , Western countries headed by the United States have used political , economic , and military means to enforce their political system , ideology , and human rights concept in the international community and to grossly interfere in the internal affairs and trample on the sovereignty of other countries .  
The military pointed out that the result of the presidential poll , which led to a change of the ruling party , aroused discontent from military cadres , most of whom are Kuomintang members .  For this reason , Defense Minister Tang Fei and Chief of General Staff Tang Yao-ming both made speeches at the meeting , hoping that the three armed services will submit to the election outcome and focus on stabilizing the situation and reassuring the public .  
Thus , although a formation of U.S . aircraft carriers had shown up more than 100 nautical miles east of Taiwan to make its military presence known during our army 's military exercises in 1996 , it had not actually sailed into the Taiwan Straits . Moreover , as soon as the U.S . forces learned that a number of Chinese nuclear submarines had lifted anchor and left the port , the aircraft carrier battle group immediately moved back 100 nautical miles .  
The Soviet Union was all along reticent about the true figures of its military spending .  The total amount of its defense expenditures , published for the first time in 1989 , was 77.3 billion rubles .  It was further admitted in 1990 that its military spending represented one-fourth of its national budget .  
Last year when Putin acted as prime minister , he took resolute action and ordered that the Russian army recover Chechnya occupied by illegal armed forces .  Although the Russian army suffered heavy casualties , this move received the support of the people and the military .  
It will be exposing the deceitful propaganda of the Taiwan military authorities from the political and military perspectives .  Its aim is to fully demonstrate the strong determination and great might of the PLA [ People 's Liberation Army ] in fighting " Taiwan independence " and splittism and defending state sovereignty and territorial integrity in order to promote the development of cross-strait relations in a benign direction .  
He urged the US side to promptly complete a full and thorough investigation on the " bombing incident " and severely punish responsible persons so as to have a satisfactory answer to the Chinese Government and people and be conducive to ending the past and ushering in the future and creating a good foundation and atmosphere for improving and developing military relations between the two countries .

US President Clinton recently submitted to Congress the national defense budget for fiscal 2001 ; the total amount of the budget is $ 305.4 billion , an increase of $ 16.5 billion - - 5.7 percent - - over that of fiscal 2000 ; the figure represents over one-third of total global military expenditure and is equivalent to the total expenditure of the eight countries ( regions ) which rank after the United States .  
The aircraft is equipped with advanced comprehensive navigation electronic systems and weapons ; it can cruise at supersonic speed , has stealth capability , is highly maneuverable , and possesses superior features in being able to find , fire at , and destroy an enemy without being detected itself ; it represents the orientation for future fighter development , and so its research and development have aroused attention in military circles the world over .  
With the " backing " of the huge defense budget , the extremely expansive and aggressive US military and foreign policy has worsened the international atmosphere and disrupted international order , and goes against the tide of the times of world peace and development ; it is " bad tidings " as mankind enters the new century .  
Thanks to the construction and development over the past half a century , a remarkable improvement has been registered in the overall surveying and mapping level of our army ; and the use of new and high technologies , represented by satellite positioning , remote surveying , digital mapping , and a military geographic information system , has provided a strong surveying and mapping support for the operational commanding of our army .  
Whether or not cross-strait military strength is balanced is a major basis for the United States in deciding on arms sales to Taiwan ; when the mainland bought 10 Su-27s , the United States could sell 20 F-16s to Taiwan , and this trial of strength between spear and shield will continue , because the United States believes that regional security can be assured so long as relative balance is maintained in cross-strait military strength .  
Under the new circumstance , it is the military academies ' central task to cultivate new-type and high-quality military talents , who have comprehensive and excellent development in aspects such as ideological and political building , scientific and cultural building , military profession , and physical and psychological strength , and are endowed with comprehensive knowledge and talents as well as the spirit and ability to make initiative .  
The ideological and political building should be carried out with focus on this center , and the promotion of students ' ideological and political quality should always be given the priority .  Great efforts should be made to resolve the issue of ideal and faith so to form the spirit of devoting to the national defense cause .  Importance should be attached to the cultivation of sublime morality and the formation of characteristics unique for military personnel .  
It is reported that Guangzhou City held a national defense mobilization meeting last month .  Huang Huahua , secretary of the Guangzhou City CPC Committee , chaired the meeting in his capacity as the first political commissar of the Guangzhou Military Region . He called on the relevant quarters in the city to seriously do good preparatory work for military struggle in the new period in accordance with the central authorities ' arrangements .  
He pointed out that under the unified leadership of the central authorities , the military and armed police , the party committees and government at all levels , and the political and legal organs regarded implementing the central policy decision as a serious political task and assigned it an important position ; they swept into action with a high sense of political responsibility and sense of work urgency , and got a really good grasp of implementation , with the result that this work has continually proceeded in a healthy and orderly way .  
Hu Jintao said that in the past two years the leadership group offices , handover work offices , and military and armed police leadership group offices and their staff at all levels have displayed the spirit of selfless devotion and the style of fighting continuous combat , scrupulously carried out their duties , worked hard , swept into action , done their work in a precise and meticulous way , carried out a great deal of arduous and detailed and highly effective work , and completely fulfilled this political task assigned by the central authorities .  
Hu Jintao pointed out that the key to why the work of withdrawing the military , armed police , and political and legal organs from business activities has been able to fulfill the predicted target in a relatively short time and has consistently maintained stability in the overall situation lies in the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee , State Council , and CMC , in the positive efforts of the large military units , armed police , and regions and departments , and in the effective support of all sectors of society .  
Through carrying out this work , not only have the military , armed police , the party committees and government at all levels , and the political and legal organs undergone testing in stressing politics , taking account of the overall situation , and observing discipline ; we have also found a number of effective measures and summed up a number of successful experiences , which provide a useful reference for unfolding specific items of tidying things up in the future .  
If in the future a problem again arises of some unit of the military , the armed police , or the political and legal organs engaging in business activities , we will hold accountable not only those directly responsible but also the leaders of that unit in accordance with the regulations on building good party style and clean government , and will strictly discipline them .  
Wei Jianxing emphasized at the conclusion of the meeting that the military , armed police , party committees and government at all levels , and the political and legal organs must seriously implement the spirit of Comrade Hu Jintao 's speech , further enhance understanding of the great strategic significance of the central policy decision , and enhance awareness of upholding the decision .  
In recent years , the National Defense Committees at all levels of the military region have conscientiously implemented the gist of relevant instructions issued by the party Central Committee , the State Council , the Central Military Commission , and the State National Defense Committee ; persistently regarded the military strategic principle of the new period as their general guidance , deepened reform , paid close attention to a sound implementation , and have attained evident results in their national defense mobilization building .  
At present , all localities are engaged in the formulation of their " 10th five-year " plan for national economic and social development .  All localities are required to draw up an overall plan and take into consideration the needs of the national defense building ; and urban construction , communication and transportation , medical care , postal and telecommunications services , and other industries and trades which are closely related to the military sector , in particular , should take earnest steps to incorporate the national defense mobilization building into their overall development plan .  
Chi Haotian pointed out that strengthening preparation for war [ zhan bei gong zuo ] , upgrading the high-tech and high-quality equipment of the armed forces , and making good preparation for properly fighting an " anti-Taiwan-independence " war and opposing hegemonic military intervention at any time are the principle for war preparation formulated by the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission in accordance with the reality that the two sides of the strait are still in a state of war and hegemony has not stopped interfering in China 's internal affairs .  
At present , Taiwan 's military expenses exceed $ 10 billion per year .  As long as the hostilities between the two sides of the strait are terminated , Taiwan will be able to save a huge amount of military expenditure and shift the financial resources to social welfare and other fields which need the resources more urgently .  This will obviously be beneficial to the people of Taiwan .  
To sum up , we may see that only the saving of military and diplomatic expenses and the lowering of the costs by the " three direct links " will bring huge benefits ; as for the tapping of potential from cross-strait cooperation , the invisible assets in the political , foreign relations , cultural , and educational fields will be immeasurable .  
To consolidate its sector dealing with Taiwan affairs in light of the new situation , the CPC is about to institute a major reshuffle of the relevant mechanism , including increasing the military 's involvement in Taiwan affairs as well as the number of Taiwan affairs offices nationwide , especially the size of such offices in coastal areas . 
In fact , the Taiwan authorities have never relaxed military preparations for " armed resistance to reunification . "  They have purchased a massive amount of advanced weaponry from foreign countries and sought to join the theater missile defense system in a bid to establish a certain disguised form of military alliance with the United States and Japan .  
People who understand international law know that an unequal international treaty the signing of which is forced by military aggression is not valid , and so whether or not after its defeat in the war Japan signed a document on returning Taiwan to China does not affect the legal status of Taiwan as Chinese territory .  
The first is to suddenly employ large-scale military operations , using the effectiveness of a wave [ attack ] to make their military operations , transportation , communications , electric power , mass media , and other crucial facilities lose their function and utility , causing Taiwan to be paralyzed .  Only by having the first wave reach this kind of level can the foreign anti-Chinese forces be made to give up their plan of interfering .  
The Zhanjiang sub-military district , which guards China 's southern gate , recently held a joint troops and militiamen military exercise at the Baishawan in Xuwen County . The military exercise included storming the beach , rapid shifting of offensive lines , rapid putting up of air defense , and comprehensive logistics support .  
As reported , the establishment of military lawyers in the armed forces ' political institutions will be put under the leadership of the chiefs of the relevant units , and political institutions will perform their duties under the leadership of the legal advisory offices of the relevant units and receive guidance from the higher level of responsible judicial departments in professional work .  
They said they started the war to keep stable the Yugoslav Federation 's situation and to halt military conflicts and disputes , namely , with good intentions , but what followed was : The people were plunged into misery and suffering , the national economy fell back 20 years , and the natural environment and people 's lives were threatened by prolonged pollution from nuclear radiation and chemical and poisonous gases We can not help asking : Can a war solve any problem ? 
We should be aware that with the arrival of an information era and the promotion of global integration , a war will gradually no longer be ignited by traditional disputes .  Western countries headed by the United States are looking for new causes for provoking a war or military intervention .  They are now in the stage of theoretical exploration and tests .  The Kosovo War and the wars started by NATO previously are new adjustments made to achieve this aim .  
Chi Haotian said that since establishing diplomatic relations in 1985 China and Bolivia have enjoyed smooth development of friendly cooperative relations , both sides have expanded exchanges and cooperation in political , economic , military and cultural fields , to which China is satisfied , and is willing to make continuous efforts to further relations between the two states and armed forces in a healthy and stable way .  
After Chen Shui-bian , who had been a member of the opposition party , was elected as Taiwan 's new leader , the outside generally doubted whether or not the armed forces , which had been controlled by the Kuomintang over a long time , would take orders from Chen Shui-bian , who previously was strongly opposed to interference in government work by the military , called for cutting military spending , and exposed the dark side of the military , and doubted whether or not the military would stage a coup d'tat .  
He said that to promote national defense in future , we must " carry out nationalization of the armed forces , establish modern and highly-efficient military strength for national defense , conduct streamlined training for war , increase the combined combat-effectiveness of the three armed services , improve quality , improve welfare , and establish the dignity of the national troops . "  
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations seven years ago , China and Slovakia have made joint efforts to promote the constant development of friendly cooperation in the political , economic , military , science , technology , and cultural fields .  
the multi-polarization trend in the world pattern is irreversible ; and the competition of comprehensive national strength with the economic , scientific , technological , and military strength as well as national cohesion as the main content is tending to become more acute .  Judging from the general situation , peace and development remain the theme of the times .  
Hu Xiaodi pointed out : A program aimed at " controlling the outer space " has been drawn up and under implementation through the political , economic , scientific and technological , and military might of a superpower , with a view to seeking unilateral military and strategic superiority .  
In discussing which chief modes should be adopted for cultivating military cadres by relying on general higher education , this responsible person stated that in the " Decision " , three main modes are put forward : choosing cadres for cultivation from within schools , directly accepting into the corps graduates from general higher level institutions , and soliciting students studying national defense .  
typical high level institutions implement an employment policy of " dual directional selection , self reliance on job choice " , thus increasing greatly the indeterminate variables for selection of graduating students into military work .  
This responsible person stressed that based on the high or low quality level of the military cadres selected from general high level universities , speaking in a definite sense , their level of quality impacts the entire level of military development and the success or failure of our undertaking .  
In the new historical period , Chairman Jiang , based on the developmental changes in the domestic and foreign situation , summarized the new experience in our army 's modernization development , creatively putting forward the scientific concept of " ideological and political development " , stressing that we must put ideological and political development in the premier position among all the army 's development projects , and he gave a series of important instructions in regard to strengthening military ideological and political development under the new situation .  
In accordance with the requirements of Chairman Jiang 's " Two Armings " , the entire military , on the basis of conducting ideological theoretical arming , has put great efforts into strengthening modern science and technology arming , especially arming with high technology knowledge , actively transforming concepts , adjusting work thinking , and putting the focus on cultivating personnel , creating talent , and comprehensively raising the quality of officers and soldiers .  
Facing new situations and tasks , ideological and political development has shouldered heavy responsibilities .  The troops in the entire army will take Chairman Jiang 's important thinking regarding the " three represents " as the guide , constantly reforming , being brave in innovating , and industriously opening up a new page in military ideological and political work .  
Further , it has readjusted the national military strategy and military concepts ; stressed local wars under high-tech conditions and rapid response capability ; emphasized the task of strengthening the military through science and technology such as electronic warfare , information warfare , network warfare , and modern communication ;  
At the ceremony of promoting military officers to the military and police rank of general on 21 June , Jiang Zemin made a special emphasis in his speech : In the year of the new century [ as published ] , cadres at the divisional-bureau level in all services and arms as well as all military scientific research institutes are required to attain the level of higher education and the level of possessing modern professional knowledge .  
At the conference , Fu Quanyou , member of the Central Military Commission [ CMC ] and chief of general staff of the People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] , stressed : Deepening military training by scientific and technological means is implementing the important ideology of President Jiang Zemin 's " three represents , " and a major measure and basic practical activity for solid and effective preparations for military struggle .  
The army at all levels must follow the principles for military strategy in the new period and consider military training by scientific and technological means as the most direct and most effective preparations for military struggle .  It is necessary to educate officers and men about the arduous situation of military struggle , raise the army 's morale by stressing the importance of the people 's army 's fundamental functions , and use the revolutionary spirit of fighting for victory to arouse the fighting spirit and comprehensively raise the army 's capability to win wars .  
Military training by scientific and technological means is a comprehensive and profound change , which will have a fundamental , complete , and deep influence on military training , military struggle , and army-building .  
When asked by a reporter to comment on the issue that the US Senate will begin to discuss and put to vote the so-called " China Nonproliferation Law " bill on 10 July , Zhu Bangzao said that China is always opposed to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , has exercised strict and effective control over relevant materials according to its military trade and anti-proliferation policies , as well as its relevant international commitments , and has made tremendous efforts to prevent international proliferation .  
Taken internationally , science and technology are advancing rapidly with each passing day in the world at present , the process of globalization is gathering pace , the trend toward a multi-polar world pattern is irreversible , and the competition in comprehensive national strength taking the economic , scientific and technological , and military strength and national cohesion as principal contents is increasingly vehement .  
The earliest military strategy of Taiwan based itself on " recovering the mainland . "  Finally , to face reality , Taiwan changed its strategy into fighting a " decisive war on the island , " the core of which was a " decisive battle on the beach and offshore ; " that is , " destroying the enemy forces at the waterfront and annihilating them on beachheads . "  
The trends described above indicate that the Taiwan authorities and the military are transforming a " passive defensive strategy " into an " active defensive strategy , " the core of which is to strengthen military " deterrence , " avoid as much as possible a decisive battle on the island , and make great efforts to push the battle ground off the island or even to the west of the center line of the strait or within the mainland .  
The thinking of a " decisive battle offshore " and any overconfident military and political provocations are no doubt nonsensical and crazy practices and a risk that invites self-destruction .  Some people in Taiwan should rein in on the brink of the precipice .  
The fourth five-nation summit was held in Bishkek , the capital of Krygyzstan , in August 1999 .  The joint statement issued after the summit further promised to make joint efforts to establish a mechanism of mutual cooperation , develop multilateral cooperation , promote regional stability , fight ethnic secessionism , and eliminate drug-trafficking and terrorism .  The five nations also reiterated that they would abide by their border treaties and agreement on military trust and make constructive contributions toward regional and world peace .  
and that a US military strategic chain link from Japan in the north to Australia in the south be established and targeted on China . Taiwan is located in the central and crucial position in this military strategic chain link of the United States .  
Its basic characteristic is the comprehensive use of various high-tech information technology [ IT ] developed in the 1990 ' s to conduct rapid , hidden , and destructive damage to the enemy 's military and civilian computer networks and communication systems , cutting off the enemy 's military contacts , disabling command , dowsing the fighting spirit , and bringing great chaos to the economy and society of the country concerned .  This will finally allow the attacking side to achieve the goal of striking the first blows without shedding a drop of blood .  
Second , the US military has a large number of complex and high-tech weapons .  Therefore , there is a large consumption and costly price for logistical and technical support .  In addition , because of independent purchases systems for various weapons of armed services , the maintenance and upkeep is extremely difficult .  
In view of this and in consideration of the current regional and surrounding geopolitical circumstances , all sides have determined to deepen cooperation in the political , diplomatic , economic and trade , military , military technological , and other fields to consolidate regional peace and stability .  
3 .  All sides point out that the agreements reached between the five countries in settling border issues and enhancing military trust have embodied a new security view that is built on mutual trust , equality , and cooperation ; are conducive to enhancing mutual understanding and good-neighborly relations ; and have contributed in a constructive manner to ensuring stability in this extensive region .  
President of Kyrgyzstan Askar Akayev first expressed his gratitude to the " Shanghai Five " for moral support and military and technical assistance to his country when international terrorists invaded southern Kyrgyzstan in August last year .  He suggested the need to establish an anti-terrorism center for central Asia in Bishkek .  
From Shanghai , Moscow , Alma-Ata , Bishkek to Dushanbe , the degree of military confidence among the five countries along their borders has constantly risen , border problems left over by history have been settled gradually , cooperation in the area of political security has been constantly deepened , consensus over regional and international matters has been constantly expanded , and economic and trade cooperation has developed day by day .  
In recent years , the Taiwan authorities led by Lee Teng-hui carried out armaments expansions without restraint , stressing augmenting the Taiwan armed forces ' control of the air and command of the sea by relying on the geographical position of an isolated island and under the guidance of the military thinking of " active defensive and effective deterrence . "  The Air Force 's special budget for the purchase of F-16 and " Mirage-2000 " fighters alone was as high as $ 12 billion .  
We are positive toward developing bilateral military exchanges at various levels .  We hope that through joint efforts , both sides will further expand the scopes of bilateral military ties , and ensure that Sino-US military ties will develop in a sustained , healthy , and stable manner .  
They should extensively carry out the guiding spirit of the national rally for naming double-support model cities ( and counties ) .  In light of promoting the reform , development , and stability of the state as well as army building , they should carry out various activities in a thoroughgoing and effective manner .  They should further consolidate and develop the great situation of the unity between the military and the government as well as the unity between the military units and the people .  
All localities and all military units should conscientiously carry out the guiding spirit of the central ideological and political work conference .  They should launch the activities of building spiritual civilization through the joint efforts of servicemen and civilians and promote coordinated development of spiritual and material civilization .  
During the visit , Jiang Zemin urged all departments participating in the cooperation of war industries to implement the principle of " the integration of military and civilian use , and the integration of wartime and peacetime needs , " meet the needs of the new situation of the development of the socialist market economy , adhere to the principle of turning civilians into a part of the armed forces , and establish a vigorous structure for the development science and technology for national defense ;  
We must obtain maximum results from our limited resources , form a complete set of effective mechanisms for competition , appraisal , and supervision , optimize the distribution of the science , technology and productive forces of the whole society , promote the ties , integration and cooperation between the military and civilian scientific research structures , and enable the achievements in technological innovation to be turned faster and better into productive forces for national defense and economic development .  
Zhu Bangzao said , there is another important content of this statement , that is , non-strategic ABM defensive systems that are not banned under the ABM treaty , and international cooperation in this field , should not damage the security of other countries , should not lead to the establishment and strengthening of closed military and political blocs , and should not damage global and regional stability and security .  
Yu Yongbo said emphatically : The important speech given by Chairman Jiang at the central ideological and political work conference profoundly expounded on a host of major issues in strengthening and improving the party 's ideological and political work in the new situation .  A policy document of great theoretical and guiding significance , the speech further pointed the way for us to cope with the overall situation of party and government work and to do a good job in ideological and political work in the military .  
At that forum , which was presided over by Nanjing MR Commander Liang Guanglie , Fang Zuqi also reminded the responsible persons from the upper echelons of the party committees in the Nanjing MR to " strengthen and improve ideological and political work in the army " and " make great efforts to provide a powerful mental motive force for winning a war " in the process of making preparations for military struggle .  
China is a peace-loving country which has mainly developed her self-defense national defense on her own .  In the meantime , China has also conducted some cooperation with the countries concerned .  Originally , China had signed with Israel an agreement on purchasing an aircraft equipped with an early warning radar on the basis of normal military trade relations between the two countries .  
A few days ago , at a certain sea port in northern Jiangsu , more than 30 civilian ships of large tonnage called up by the Jiangsu Provincial Military District carried officers and men of a certain motorized infantry brigade and heavy equipment and sailed towards the wavy Huang Hai sea area to start a two-day , two-night sea-crossing and military tactics and technology training .  
According to today 's " Jiefangjun Bao , " since the beginning of July , Nanjing Military Region has sent units of a whole division and regiment to the coastal forefront to conduct maritime military training , forming a military training picture of a grand scene at sea along the meandering coastal line .  More than 10,000 officers and men of a certain infantry division were organized into a formation and crossed the sea in arms in stormy conditions .  Neither the front nor the end of the formation could be seen ;  
Officers and men of a certain air force station of the People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] along the southeast coast on the frontline of military struggle against Taiwan have learned the lesson from the Kosovo War , firmly upheld their mission , taken practical actions , accelerated the modernization of flight logistics , continued to raise the level of logistical command automation , and provided strong logistical support for winning the war .  
Upon receiving an emergency order , the naval training vessel " Shichang " set sail in a thick fog with visibility of only 15 m .  It braved the wind and the waves of a near Force 10 typhoon for 17 days , sailing 4000 nautical miles .  It satisfactorily completed comprehensive training in maritime national defense mobilization with " wartime civilian vessels emergency mobilization and acquisition " as its main task .  The vessel returned to a certain military port in the Bo Hai a few days ago .  
It is necessary to actively push forward various reforms of the army , boldly make innovations , advance with keen determination , strengthen the theoretical study of military sciences , further optimize structures and formations , adopt the strategy of strengthening army with science and technology , improve weaponry and equipment , and vigorously nurture and bring up high-quality talented people , so as lay a solid foundation for the development of our army in the new century .  
However , an analysis of Taiwan 's military combat capability , especially of its naval and air forces , will readily show that the Taiwan military 's so-called " decisive battle offshore " can only be described as a dangerous and dubious wishful thinking .  
Another weak point of the Taiwan military is that it purchases weapons from a variety of countries ; their quality , performance , and operating regulations differ , with the result that it is very difficult to form the weapon systems into a complete perfect set , and this has a direct impact on taking advantage of their combat capability .  
The report believes that although the Chinese communists ' military threat against our troops has changed from mere advantage in quantity to competition in quality , leading to a disparity between the two sides of the strait and the Chinese communists are eager to settle the " Taiwan issue , " thus imposing a greater threat to our security , both sides of the strait should still create conditions for cooperation with goodwill , jointly deal with the issue of " a future China , " and seek a win-win result on the basis of mutual trust .  
Thanks to this " three attacks and three defenses " training , all military units generally acquired the skills of attacking tanks , aircraft , and paratroopers and the skills of defending against nuclear attack , chemical warfare , and biological weapons .  At the same time , People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] training has developed by leaps and bounds as a result .  
During a 16 June military review , the new leader in Taiwan put forward for the first time the strategic thinking of " fighting decisive battle outside Taiwan . " He also instructed the military to enhance its information warfare capability , develop air-to-ground missiles and other offensive weaponry , set up a special agency for the development of " space weapon system , " deploy for the first time guided missile boats to the Kinmen front , and conduct live-warhead missile launching exercise .  
It is a new form of military training adapted to the science and technology age and designed to win victory in a local war under high-tech conditions .  The mainland 's development of strategic ballistic missiles is in the direction of raising mobility , precision and warhead efficiency ; its development of tactical missiles is in the direction of increasing range , enhancing precision , raising payload and improving warhead efficiency ;  
Taiwan 's " Minister of National Defense " Wu Shih-wen said in the preface of the report : " The change of our strategic concept to effective deterrence and tenacious defense does not mean we want to engage in an arms race with the Chinese Communists , " and " we hope we can proceed in an orderly way and step by step to promote the establishment of an institutionalized military mutual trust mechanism between the two sides to ensure lasting peace in the Taiwan Strait . "  
The General Armament Department of the People 's Liberation Army recently held a forum of military representative bureau heads of the armed forces , which stressed that the building of the army 's weapons and equipment must match the overall situation of economic construction and national defense construction ; it is necessary to seriously study the new situation and characteristics of the work of military representatives under socialist market economy conditions , and further speed up the reforms in the building of the army 's weapons and equipment .  
The General Armament Department of the People 's Liberation Army recently held in Beijing an all-military forum of military representative bureau chiefs .  It stressed that military weaponry should meet the needs of the overall situation of national economic and defense construction .  It also pointed out the need to conscientiously study the new state and characteristics of military representatives ' work under the socialist market economic conditions in order to further speed up the reform of weaponry building .  
Our basic missions in strengthening ideological and political education in military academies are to " be victorious at war and not to degrade , " to ensure that we are on the correct path of developing advanced military academies , and to ensure that we can materialize the target of cultivating military professionals with high caliber .  
While paying attention to the pattern of modern education , the " Opinions " have also made use of the PLA 's political superiority .  The " Opinions " have summarized and incorporated the PLA 's basic experiences of strengthening ideological and political education in military academies under new circumstances .  The " Opinions " are currently , and will be for some time in the future , an important guiding document for strengthening ideological and political education in military academies .  
Our basic missions in strengthening ideological and political education in military academies under new circumstances are to " be victorious at war and not to degrade , " to ensure that we are on the correct path of developing advanced military academies , and to ensure that we can materialize the target of cultivating military professionals with high caliber .  
Facing the challenge of a revolution of military affairs in the world , Xu Guangfeng studied and practiced hard at his post and promptly became a technical vanguard of the group army .  He applied specialized knowledge learned from school to actual tasks .  
In October 1996 , Xu Guangfeng , as an outstanding officer of the military region , was sent to a unit to receive specialized training on guided missiles .  He learned unknown areas of special subjects , was bold in scaling technological heights , and quickly mastered maintenance , repair and management of weapons of advanced technology .  He improved his own ability from mastering general special knowledge to mastering special knowledge of high technology .  
During his visit to China last July , Putin said that further developing all-round cooperation in the economic , trade , science and technology , and military fields is one of the important direction for expanding and deepening the equal , trustworthy , strategic cooperative partnership between China and Russia .  
The experience the academy has gained in this respect has inherited the glorious tradition of the ideological and political work of the party and PLA , reflects the specific situation and characteristics of the new period , and is marked by innovations and improvements .  It is not only useful to military schools , but also worth drawing on by ordinary institutions of higher learning in various localities .  
As far as the cadet 's ideological and political quality is concerned , the academy holds that a revolutionary ideal embodies a concentrated reflection of the scientific world outlook , philosophy of life , and values , that the military spirit emphasizing the party 's absolute leadership over the PLA is the foundation for ensuring the PLA 's unchanged quality , and that the highly patriotic spirit of dedication is an inexhaustible driving force for service members to take root in the PLA to perform meritorious deeds .  
It has thus aroused the cadets ' sense of mission and responsibility .  In addition , it has encouraged the cadets to become new-type military personnel capable of operating high-tech equipment by promoting the thinking of " letting well-trained people wait to be equipped rather than having equipment ready but without well-trained people to operate it . "  
As related by relevant departments of the General Staff Headquarters , China had the capability to independently develop and produce advanced armored tank vehicles a long time ago .  Our military 's armored force has formed a weaponry system with various types of vehicles , such as tanks , light amphibious tanks , armored carriers , and coordinated fire support , combat support and logistics technical support vehicles .  
During recent years , our military 's armored force has deeply implemented the military strategic principle of the new period , established its footing on winning a victory in the local war under high-technology conditions , striven to upgrade quality , and steadily marched toward the goal of building itself into a picked , composite and efficient force .  
It has been learned that Yao Zhesheng owned a luxury villa in Beijing , spend most of the time there , lived a lavish life , cultivated special relations with senior officials , and maintained excellent relations with officials of the Public Security Ministry , the General Administration of Customs , the United Front Department under the CPC Central Committee , and even with the military .  
He said : In his half-century revolutionary career , Comrade Su Yu performed immortal feats for the liberation of the Chinese people , and made important contributions to building a modern and regularized revolutionary army ; strengthening the national defense of the New China ; and enriching and developing Mao Zedong military thinking , leaving behind him an everlasting monument and a precious legacy .  
Zhang Wannian said : In his military life , Comrade Su Yu defeated his opponent by a surprise move .  He developed a unique art of conducting campaigns and conducted a string of major and ferocious battles , setting many shining fighting examples .  
The rapid progress of science and technology in the world , especially the development of information technology , has created new and broad prospects for the development of the productive force and the society .  It is creating a profound influence on political , economic , military , science and technology , culture and social fields of various countries .  
Although the Chinese government insists that the Taiwan question brooks no intervention and has taken retaliatory action against European countries that sold advanced arms to Taiwan with satisfactory results , it is reluctant to take action to stop the United States from overtly calling for the maintenance of the status quo while covertly supporting " Taiwan independence , " because it is aware of its substantial gap with the United States in economic and military strength and has to take care of its economic development and improve the material life of its people .  
His advanced deeds and noble spirit fully embody the lofty realm of communists and revolutionary soldiers in consciously practicing " three represents , " and demonstrates the spiritual outlook of teachers of military academies who heroically blaze new trails , are content in serving as the ladder for others to get ahead , and work with selflessly devotion .  
All military academies should energetically promote the good practice of respecting teachers and assigning importance to teaching , strive to foster more excellent teachers like Liu Yixin , fundamentally improve the level of teaching and the quality of education , fully bring into play the role of military academy education as a matter of fundamental and overall importance in providing the lead in the modernization of the army , and make new and greater contributions to the building of our army into a revolutionary , modernized and standardized army , he said .  
After the explosion occurred , relevant leaders of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region and Urumqi City promptly went to the scene of the explosion to direct rescue operations .  Several hundred public security personnel , armed police , and military personnel stationed in the area as well as more than 100 medical personnel swiftly plunged into fire fighting and rescue work .  The injured people were sent to nearby hospitals for emergency treatment .  
The conference was attended by the relevant responsible persons from various provincial , autonomous regional , or municipal people 's procuratorates , various military procuratorates , and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Procuratorate , as well as some other procuratorates .  
In line with Chairman Jiang 's important instructions , the all-military political work meeting has put forward the historical missions of ideological and political construction in the military in the new situation - - to provide powerful spiritual motivation for winning future high-tech wars , and to provide a reliable political guarantee for maintaining the nature , inherent qualities , and style of the people 's military .  
Every year throughout the military , over one thousand leading cadres at or above the army level have gone among the soldiers to understand the situations , give guidance and lectures , answer and solve hot and difficult educational issues , and give effective guidance on education .  This has produced a lively situation where party committees have attached great importance to education , leaders have worked together to manage it , and officers and men participated in it enthusiastically .  
In light of the new situation that has occurred in maintaining and developing a healthy and pure internal relationship in the military , they should strengthen the awareness of the cadres of " taking a correct attitude and commanding the troops in a civilized manner " and the awareness of military personnel regarding " respecting cadres and obeying management , " strengthen the unity between officers and men , and improve internal and external relationships .  
While working on improving the quality of classroom education and fully enhancing the role of classroom education as the main front , they have focused on the reality wherein there are closer contacts between life in the military camps and society , and where officers and men are receiving more extensive information ; enhanced the educational roles of mass media ; in many ways efficiently used society as a great classroom ;  
and launched joint educational activities between the military and localities .  In line with the reality that there has been a general increase in the awareness of democracy , equality , and participation among officers and men , they have carried out diverse types of mass self-education , during which " everyone have stated clearly their problems , distinguished between right and wrong , talked about principles , and found answers . "  
The " Suite of Songs on the Morals of Military Men , " which was organized and created by the General Political Department , has rapidly become popular in military camps north and south of the great river , the frontiers , and islands , and officers and men have received education on our military 's fine traditions and the moral standards of military personnel in the art forms that they love .  
According to reports , along the journey of advancing into the new century , all units of the military have rode on the strong east wind of the central ideological and political work meeting , earnestly acted in the spirit of Chairman Jiang 's important speech , and with higher standard and full of enthusiasm , striven to produce new results in strengthening and improving ideological and political education in the armed forces and to create a new situation .  
After the economically developed west , with its strong military forces , has been attacked and destroyed , Taiwan 's entire economic , political , and military systems will be in a state of chaos and paralysis , and no matter how strong the eastern defense base is , it will be unable to retrieve the war situation in the west .  
Some foreign missionaries directly served colonial expansion , took part in selling opium , gathered intelligence , encouraged and participated in military aggression , seized economic gains , took part in plotting to force the government to sign unequal treaties , relied on the special privileges provided by unequal treaties , ran wild in the countryside , bullied and humiliated the people , and stirred up the opposition of the people .  
In the separation of government functions from enterprise management , for example , problems arising from the running of commercial enterprises by special interest entities were solved when the military , armed police and political and legal organs were ordered in 1998 to disengage themselves from commercial operations .  
According to the initial report made by the investigation team , there were no dubious factors for the explosion .  But the military unit obviously violated the operational rules while transporting outdated explosive articles scheduled to be scrapped .  A mistake led to a military vehicle colliding with a bus , causing heavy casualties .  
Some personalities in Beijing 's military circles believe that the planned reorganization indicates the development of China 's comprehensive economic and scientific and technological strength , and it will raise the international standing of China as a force of peace in the Asia-Pacific Region and in the world .  
In 1997 , at the 15th CPC National Congress , Chairman Jiang Zemin declared to the whole world : Following the 1-million personnel retrenchment in the 1980s , China will further cut down the personnel size of its army by 500,000 in the next three years .  In order to implement this strategic decision made by Chairman Jiang and the party Central Committee , the PLA has readjusted the organizational establishment of its troops ; reformed its logistic support , weaponry management , and the structure of its military academies and training institutions ;  
A group of military commanding talents is in the making , who have had a modern scientific and cultural knowledge and a modern management knowledge and who are capable of using modern weapons and are capable of organizing and commanding combined operations among different arms and services .  A new enhancement has been noticed in both the military and political qualities of the officers and men of the three armed services .  
Presenting themselves in public in their firm , vigorous and uniform steps , the military units being reviewed fully embodied the militant fighting spirit of the North Korean People 's Army .  
Despite the changing international environment , the two countries have understood and supported each other since the establishment of diplomatic relations more than 40 years ago .  The two countries have had fruitful cooperation in political , economic , military , and other areas , setting a model for South-South cooperation among developing countries .  
To make a success of training the troops through science and technology , it is necessary to carry it out in close connection with the requirements of actual combat , centering on resolving key and difficult problems in preparations for military struggle , persist in hard and strict training , intensify targeted training , and make efforts to narrow the gap between training and actual combat .  
The military source said that the establishment of the Fuzhou Theater signifies the intensified degree of tension in the Taiwan strait compared with the previous stages and increased possibility of a breakout of a partial war by adding that the military had raised a level of military alert in this theater .  
The report stated " the Fuzhou Theater in particular has rapidly been taking shape as a strong joint operation mechanism for the troops and has greatly enhanced the capability to launch a large-scale joint operation under difficult conditions of having to organize the Theater in a very short period and of personnel coming from different military systems . " 
According to an authoritative source , the 56 theoretical research achievements for theoretical exchanges during this experience-exchanging military exercise are focused on resolving major and knotty issues faced in a modern war , such as combined operations among different arms and services under high-tech conditions , reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance , air strike and counter-air strike , defense breakthrough [ tu fang ] and counter-defense breakthrough , and jamming and anti-jamming , and they represent the leading edge of the military theoretical research of the Chinese Army ;  
It has focussed on the major theories and practical issues related to the preparations for military struggle , thus further defining the orientation and thinking of deepening the training of troops through science and technology .  The training of troops through science and technology represents a profound revolution in the military affairs of China 's armed forces at the end of the 20th century .  
The whole army should use as its guidance Chairman Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " as well as on strengthening the armed forces and improving their training through science and technology .  In light of the military strategic principle in the new period as well as the goal of realizing the preparations for military struggle , the whole army should continuously deepen its ideological understanding .  In addition , the whole army should ensure that it follows correct orientation during the whole process of training of troops through science and technology .  
We should take a lead in socialist spiritual civilization construction .  We should further foster close ties between the military and the government as well as between the military and the people .  We should continuously make new contributions in promoting coordinated economic and social development , in consolidating and developing China 's political stability , and in creating a good situation of social stability .  
The most important point is whether the entire people possess a strong combat will .  This is also the core of the policy of " national defense by the whole people . "  As long as the people throughout the country strengthen their mental defense , reinforce the all-people 's defense mechanism , do not fear communist China 's propaganda offensive and military threat , and remain a backing for the government and armed forces , the armed forces will certainly have confidence and ability to ensure the country 's security .  
Attending the meeting were over 700 people , including leaders of relevant departments from various provinces , municipalities , and autonomous regions , and central state organs ; the PLA General Staff Department ; various military regions and districts ( and garrisons and commands ) ; the Air Force ; and the National Civil Air Defense Offices of key cities as well as responsible comrades from the Civil Air Defense Offices at and above city level , some academies and institutions , and scientific research institutes and colleges .  
The circular finally stressed : We should make vigorous efforts to train and utilize qualified personnel capable of working in both military and civilian posts and this is at once a need of army building and a need for tackling the problem of lack of qualified personnel in the rural areas and promoting rural development as well . 
In another development , the Chinese put on display for the first time an advanced guided missile whose name remains unknown .  Though it was only a model and was attached to the model of the Qianhong 7 aircraft ( namely , the Flying Leopard heavy bomber especially manufactured for its naval air force ) , it has attracted the attention of foreign military experts .  A US military expert who is taking part in the show , believes that is a new supersonic antiradar , antiship guided missile recently developed by the CPC military .  
Facing such an intricate and complex international political , economic , and military struggle , in order to safeguard China 's national security and the unification of our motherland , ensure a smooth progress for our great socialist cause , and protect the fundamental interests of the people of the entire country , we must enhance our awareness of guarding against possible future mishaps and must reinforce our national defense building .  
Present at the meeting were leaders of all provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities , relevant departments under central and state organs , the PLA General Staff Headquarters , all military regions and provincial military districts ( garrison commands and garrisons ) , the Air Force , key cities for the civil air defense work designated by the state , and the Civil Air Defense Offices at the city level and above ; as well as the responsible comrades of a number of colleges , universities , and scientific research institutions .  
In the next 20 years , although oil supply and demand in the world will be basically balanced , as complicated contradictions remain between major oil consuming countries , between oil consuming and producing countries , and between countries with oil resources , this may increase uncertain factors that trigger off political , military , and diplomatic contradictions and conflicts , and may directly and seriously affect the world or regional oil markets .  
Gore seemed to lay greater stress on establishing an Asia-Pacific multilateral security mechanism and attach greater importance to the US ' relations with China , but he stressed that Japan was the US ' principal ally in Asia . Gore and the younger Bush shared identical views on the two key issues of stressing Japan being the principal ally of the US in Asia , and of maintaining the US military presence in Asia .  
AMEEGC General Manger Xia Guohong told this reporter during the air show in Zhuhai that the AMEEGC will , by adhering to the guiding thought of " gearing to the market , with aerospace as the principal line , striving for scientific and technological innovations , prevailing on the strength of quality , " speed up the general adoption of the market principle and the process of converting military enterprises to civilian production in order to maintain a sustained , sound and fast development of China 's space undertakings under the conditions of market economy .  
Since the relations between The People 's Republic of China and Lao People 's Democratic Republic ( referred to as " the two parties " hereinafter ) were normalized in 1989 , the traditional friendship and friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries have been fully restored and developed and their exchange and cooperation in political , economic , trade , military , cultural and educational , and other areas have been constantly strengthening .  
1 ) Displaying the achievements made in reform and opening up : The three groups of commemorative gold and silver coins marking the 30th , 40th , and 50th anniversaries of the founding of the PRC highlighted the great achievements made over the last 20 years , which saw rapid and sustained economic growth , constant improvement in people 's living standards , national unity , and the progress made in the scientific and technological and military fields that boosted China 's overall national strength . 
The meeting pointed out that the existing Chinese People 's Liberation Army Ordinance Governing Officers on Active Duty , since its implementation in 1988 , has played an important role in enabling the officers of the People 's Liberation Army and the People 's Armed Police Force to become more revolutionary , younger in average age , better educated , and more professionally competent ; in boosting their initiative and creativity ; and in ensuring their observance of law in performing military duties .  
It was learned that the hardware platforms of this kind generally used in China and foreign countries at present are priced at more than 500,000 yuan at least , while the hardware platform of this China-pioneered system is less than 20,000 yuan in price .  Specialists maintain that the successful development of this system has provided our military with a standardized , generalized , high-functional , and fairly cheap platform to develop the video system of battlefields , with China possessing the independent intellectual property .  
Comrades in charge of the relevant central party , government , military , and mass work units ; and deputy secretaries of party committees in charge of united front work and directors of united front work departments from provinces , autonomous regions , municipalities , cities whose leaders rank at the level of deputy provincial leader , and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps attended the session .  
This year in particular , there have been consecutive incidents of the killing of a South Korean hostess by a U.S . serviceman , the " mistaken bombing " by the U.S . military at Maehyang-Ri , and the discharge of poisonous waste fluid into the Han River by the U.S . military .  This has touched off even stronger anti-U.S . sentiments .  
he laid very great stress on the question of how to fight to win a partial war under hi-tech conditions , and demanded that the armed forces have a clear understanding of the new situation , further enhance their awareness of hardship , and step up their training with a high degree of political responsibility and the sense of urgency of seizing the day ; they should also make military training more targeted and narrow the gap between training and actual combat . 
Revolving around the political steadfastness and ideological and moral purity of troops , the entire military and armed police force regard resisting " red lanterns and green wine " [ feasting and revelry ] and preventing the erosion of decadent ideology and culture as a breakthrough point to vigorously grasp the education and consolidation of ideologies , styles , and disciplines as well as the internal and external relations .  
" If you want to win the battle , you have got to plan how to win the battle and train yourselves to win the battle . "  Therefore , the capabilities of field operation survival , rapid response , and combined operation of various arms units have been further strengthened , the weaponry and equipment , military quality , and defensive fighting capability have been remarkably improved , and new steps have been made in the direction of better troops , high effectiveness , and combined operations .  
( III ) In the face of the complex and changeable international situation and the new situation of various ideologies and cultures surging against each other and the contradictions and struggles in the ideological and political realm being very complicated , what to grasp and how to grasp the ideological and political building is an issue which has a bearing on what kind of mental outlook the Party , the country , and the military should meet for the challenges of the 21st Century .  
The fruitful achievements of the " four educations " in the People 's Liberation Army and the armed police force have provided beneficial inspiration for strengthening and improving the ideological and political work in our Party and our military during the new historical period .  
Over the educational practice of the last six years , the party committees and political organs at all levels of the entire military and the armed police force have justifiably and loudly upheld high quality and style , explained well large principles , propagated advanced things and developed healthy tendencies in a large way , and refuted erroneous ways and rectified unhealthy tendencies in a clear-cut manner , thus creating a strong public opinion and excellent ideological atmosphere about taking the overall situation into consideration , emphasizing the dedication , and observing disciplines .  
second , for the first time it set out comprehensive , systematic , and effective frameworks for handling bilateral relations , from the leaders ' hot line to the mechanism for dialogue on human rights , and from military exchanges to cooperation in law enforcement .  
China 's economic development potentials and its vast potential market , the unique role it plays in Asian affairs , its political influence among the developing countries , its special geopolitical status and future prospects of " great China " [ da zhong hua ] , and the acceleration of its military modernization - - all these factors mean that the US government and public can not but attach greater importance to China 's weight in the future international political pattern and its influence in world affairs .  
Beijing is worried that Taiwan and the US would take this opportunity to resume their military cooperation which has been suspended since 1979 .  Recently , signs showing this have surfaced unceasingly .  The Taiwan Security Enhancement Act clearly stipulates that the US military headquarters in the Pacific should have " direct and confidential communications " with the Taiwan military .  In mid-December , Taiwan 's request of buying Aegis-class destroyers from the US was proposed again , and will be decided at the China-US meeting scheduled to be held in April next year .  
It was reported that although the military tribunal already accepted the accusation lodged by the military procuratorate against Ji Shengde , who had embezzled nearly 80 million yuan by means of accepting bribes and diverting public funds for other use and on charge of dereliction of duties , the tribunal has recognized the justification of Ji Shengde 's lawyer : First , more than half of Ji 's stolen money can be recovered .  Because Ji Shengde spent most of his stolen money buying luxurious houses in Beijing , whose prices are still rising now .  
This kind of powerful strategic goal , together with the relatively rigid policy of President-elect George W . Bush towards China , surely helps one feel very confident in the resolve of the United States to protect Taiwan . It also stabilizes the gradual drift towards instability among military powers and national powers across the straits .  Because of this , the judgment of some people regarding the future of Taiwan now appears to be excessively pessimistic .  
In the bill requesting deliberation on the draft revision , Premier Zhu Rongji and CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin said : Since the regulations were put into force , they have played an important role in making the corps of our military officers more revolutionary , lowering the average age of officers , raising the their educational level , and making them more professionally competent , as well as heightening the initiative and creativity of the large numbers of officers .  
Yu Yongbo said : To carry out the spirit of CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin 's instructions that the military should " fight to win " and " never change its nature " and to meet the requirements on our military officers posed by the new situation and tasks , new requirements that military officers must be " loyal to the CPC , and must have firm revolutionary ideal and conviction and possess modern military knowledge " are added to the basic requirements of military officers stipulated in the current regulations .  
To meet the new situation of reform of the system of cultivating and replenishing military officers and the need of the development of troop modernization building , the draft revision includes particular stipulations on the supply of military officers .  These stipulations include : outstanding enlisted personnel and graduates of ordinary secondary specialized schools can be promoted to officers only after they have studied in and graduated from a military academy ;  
Experiences leading to the gratifying situation in the air force 's flight safety record are varied and can chiefly be summed up as follows .  First , all air force units always insist on applying the new period 's military strategic thinking in managing things , placing military training at the center of all work , giving priority to flight training arrangements , and well maintaining continuity in flight and in training course .  Second is persistence in subjecting units to tough and strict training .  
The youth military academy activities carried out in elementary and junior high schools and the military training conducted in senior high schools and institutions of higher education proved effective in giving national defense education to young people ; these measures are widely accepted by the students , their parents , school authorities , as well as the general public .  
He also disclosed : The flight squadrons currently stationed in the southeast coastal region are all crack troops with the most advanced equipment and weaponry in the Chinese air force , the most superb military technology , and the pilots with the greatest wealth of experience that can take off and conduct operations in all weather .  
Tens of thousands of troops from around the country took part in the exercises , encompassing all the military regions nationwide .  Branches of the military taking part in the exercises included rapid response units , amphibious armored units , digital artillery units , special operations units , marine corps units , airborne units , Army , Navy , and Air Force aviation units , and reservist units .  
According to the white paper " China 's National Defense in 2000 " published in mid-October of this year , since 1995 China has declared two rounds of military cuts , which resulted in the cutting of a total of 1.5 million personnel from the military , thereby significantly reducing the size of the military and streamlining military establishments .  Now the established size of the entire military is kept under the level of 2.5 million personnel , and consequently the Chinese military has embarked on the road toward streamlined armed forces with Chinese characteristics .  
" There is no lack of senior government officials and expert scholars who are familiar with East Asian affairs , international foreign affairs , and military security in the core members of the new Bush cabinet .  The basic tone and route of the China policy from Washington tends to establish a pragmatism .  We have to deal with it in a calmer and more rational attitude of dealing with concrete matters relating to work . "  
The high-ranking MND official pointed out : In recent months , the Chinese Communists have not engaged in any large-scale exercises along the coast , nor have there been unusual troop movements .  It is possible that the Chinese Communists are trying to create an atmosphere favorable to the opening of small-scale three links .  Our military has put in place defense and relevant security measures on the offshore islands .  Having inferred possible scenarios , the MND has concluded that there is no need to adjust the military strength on the offshore islands in the near future .  
The official said emphatically : Using simulated systems , our military long ago practiced ways of coping with possible moves by the Chinese Communist troops and came up with several contingency plans .  The US military provided relevant information and data specifically for this purpose .  It assisted Taiwan 's military in analyzing , through the application of the " net assessment " method , possible moves by the Chinese Communist troops for use as reference in contingency planning .  
From the perspective of business line , 12 of the 14 key industries monitored - - light industry , textile industry , machinery industry , metallurgical industry , petrochemical industry , building materials industry , tobacco industry , nonferrous metal industry , electronics industry , gold industry , pharmaceutical industry , and power industry - - have realized greater profits in varying degrees , and the net loss of coal industry and military industry has markedly decreased .  
and shall consciously devote themselves to the cause of national defense " ; Section Three shall be revised as : " Shall have attained a certain theory or policy standard ; shall have mastered modern military , scientific , cultural , or professional knowledge ;  
( 3 ) Have the theories , policy level , modern military , scientific culture , specialized knowledge , organizational and command capabilities , go through school training and achieve the corresponding record of formal schooling and physical health required for assumption of the responsibilities of one 's job ;  
Li Chieh also indicated that , considering the operational management problems on the elongated Taiwan Strait , the numerous missiles deployed on shores , and the limited operational space in the Strait , if the Navy can carry out mobile ocean-going missions from a greater distance , the Navy 's operations would not be confined in the Taiwan Strait and could hinder Communist China 's military deployments and prevent it from mobilizing its full force into operations in the Taiwan Strait .  
The two sides stressed that the friendly cooperative treaty should be based on safeguarding the security and interests of the two countries and their peoples , and that the Sino-Russian strategic cooperative partnership should be substantiated on the political , economic , and military fronts . 
Thus , the Taiwan side may possibly ask for procuring Kidd-class destroyers before the opening of the annual US-Taiwan arms sales negotiations scheduled to be held in April . If this is really true , newly elected President Bush will meet , for the first time , a grim challenge in handling the subtle military balance between " China " and Taiwan .  
Guided by theoretical study , we should step up study of the international strategic situation and the characteristics and law of military management under the high-technology local war conditions and the new situations ; we should actively organize and coordinate military organs , military academies , scientific research units , and the troops , to systematically study crucial and difficult problems .  
Since the US economy has grown strongly in recent years , its military strength far outstrips anyone else , and it controls international organizations such as the World Trade Organization and the World Bank , many in political and academic circles have become dizzy and declared that the US pursuit of world " unipolarization " is historically inevitable .  
The military made numerous fruitful results in ideological and political building , started sci-tech training , steadily promoted logistical reform , markedly improved armaments , and continued to raise the overall combat effectiveness .  
and thus laid a solid foundation for raising its own overall standard and for its own development as well .  The corporation also sorted out a clear-cut train of thought for developing civil products , clearly identified goals ; and secured fresh progress in respect of pluralizing the principal body of investment for backbone civil products , separating civil products from military ones , listing civil products separately in production , and industrializing hi-tech civil products .  
It was learned that in the 10th Five-Year Plan period , apart from readjusting scientific research or production capacity for military products , the corporation is also expected to further streamline production of key military products ; preliminarily industrialize its scientific research and production capacity for hi-tech military products ; further develop civil products with active efforts in setting up separate production lines for such products , in separating civil products from military ones , and in listing civil products separately in production as well .  
The corporation will further the work of structural transformation and joint-venture or cooperative operation ; will work hard to pluralize property rights , ensure scale operation , and pluralize the principal body of investment for civil products as well ; will focus on developing civil products of high or new technology , which are usable for both military and civil purposes ;  
3 .  The faction that thinks it is impossible to maintain the status quo , but readjustment should be made gradually : Japan 's demand to become a political and military big country will become an irresistible trend in Japan 's political arena in the future .  The United States can only pay attention to the regional power structure and the popular will at home , and readjust bilateral relations step by step in accordance with such demand .  
By contrast , the mainland China developed most of its military weapons by itself .  During the same period , it purchased a total of $ 2.59 billion worth of regular weapons from around the world , ranking 14th in the world .  The key country where the mainland China purchased its weapons from was Russia , from which $ 2.12 billion worth of weapons were imported .  
The " Epilogue - - China 's New Century " gave full expression to the firm determination of the entire military troops and civilian people throughout the country to closely rally around the party central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core and build our country into a rich and powerful modern socialist nation with a high degree of civilization and democracy in the new century .  
The procedures have further perfected the organizational structure of leadership over the work of protecting military facilities ; specified and concretized respective stipulations on the protection of military restricted zones and military directorial zones ; reinforced protective measures concerning the military facilities which are not assigned to any military restricted zone or military directorial zone ;  
While talking about Sino-US ties , he said : Last year , Chinese and US leaders conducted a successful meeting .  The two countries have enjoyed smooth economic and trade development .  Bilateral cooperation in scientific , technological , educational , cultural , military , and other aspects has also been continuously strengthened .  
To this end , Japan has changed its previous military deployment against the Soviet Union and comprehensively moved its main force to the west and southwest .  This year , it has also decided to establish an " island-protection force " to cope with the " activities of China 's naval vessels . "  Japan has even planned to equip itself with aircraft carriers in the next 15 years .  
Under such strategic positioning , the Indian military has worked out a multi-directional strategic principle of " attacking the west , resisting the north , going south , and maintaining stability internally , " which means that India should adopt a posture of vigorous offensive against Pakistan in order to defeat it once and for all ; 
India 's concept of military strategy has always been linked with the issue of territory .  Moreover , it entertains the idea of not hesitating to go to war .  For example , it has defined an offensive principle of " piecemeal encroachment of territory , internal subversion , military superiority , and strategic deterrent . "  
Le Kha Phieu spoke highly of the fruitful cooperation in the political , economic , cultural and military fields between Vietnam and China and appreciated China 's great achievements in reform and opening up .  He also said Vietnam attaches great importance to China 's experience and believes that the friendly cooperation between the two countries and the two armed forces will surely develop better in the new century .  
Beijing 's military theorists , including international strategists and military commanding experts , are relatively calm about the US military reinforcing Guam . They held that the Unites States has long been using military forces to surround China , not because of the strengthening of national power of the mainland .  Therefore , it is unnecessary to get excited about the shift in US military forces .  The things to do are only to keep up the analysis of US military forces .  
The US military 's expansion of its nuclear submarine base in Guam has a relatively particular purpose .  It wants to use Guam as an experimental site for US nuclear submarines in the new century .  For instance , a submarine 's deep-water communications and data image transmission and the suitability of undersea launching of missiles under new fighting conditions can all be tested at the base in Guam .  
When inspecting Fort Stewart military base as commander-in-chief of armed forces for the first time on Monday this week , Bush announced that the military expenditure for the next fiscal year would be increased by another $ 14 billion , bringing the total US military budget to $ 31 billion .  
In recent years , thanks to the sustained boom of the US economy , the pay in nonmilitary sectors has been increasing rather fast and the appeal of the armed forces has diminished .  Outstanding talent is unwilling to serve in the military and those who are already in the military are not contented .  
According to the " Provisional Procedure , " military cadres at the divisional level and those who are below the battalion level and who have served in the military for less than 20 years will continue to be assigned jobs when transferred to civilian work .  The local party committees and governments concerned should be responsible for arranging jobs for these cadres .  
The amount of the pension should be calculated on the basis of 80 percent of the monthly pay , military-rank pay , plus the standard allowance of the military cadre at the level equivalent to the new civilian job and the total of basic and length-of-service wages in the military .  
They may be settled in the original places of their spouses or the location of their marriage .  If their spouses have moved with the military units and have been registered residents for four years in Beijing , three years in Shanghai , or two years in Tianjin , Chongqing , a provincial or regional capital , or a city of a sub-provincial level or if their spouses are registered residents in any other cities , they may settle in that city .  
The broad masses of transferred military cadres , on the other hand , should preserve and carry forward the fine tradition of the people 's army , serve the interests of the whole , support the reform program , and show understanding and sympathy for the difficulties experienced by the state and local authorities in trying to settle them .  They should take the initiative to obey the arrangements made by the organization and work hard at their new posts to make fresh contributions to the cause of socialist modernization .  
For example , when Israeli forces deployed attack helicopters to pursue and kill a Palestinian military officer on 13 February , the US State Department spokesperson voiced a rare and stern criticism of Israel for this " premeditated assassination " and stated that Israel should be held responsibility for the ever-increasing wave of violent conflicts .  
Left Winger Deng 's 10,000-word Memorial Criticizes " Three Represents " It is understood that the " anti-Jiang faction " is composed mainly of retired senior party and military cadres .  A few serving officials and those officials dissatisfied with a graft probe into their children , secretaries or themselves , also have joined the faction , gradually developing activities against Jiang within the party .  
The " record , " citing the US election campaign and other detailed examples , lays bare the myth of American " democracy " and completely brings to light its escalating violence , unfair judicature , the widening gap between the rich and the poor , worrying economic and social rights of workers , serious gender discrimination , children being in a grim situation , unchanged racial discrimination , bad benefits for minorities , exhausting all resources for military buildup , and brutal infringements on other countries ' human rights .  
Russia has three major weapons : strategic nuclear missiles , anti-satellite weaponry , and directional anti-missile high-energy laser and particle beam weaponry .  But Russia today does not have the money to continue to develop them .  Taking advantage of the other 's problem , the United States is setting a trap for Russia by using its NMD program to egg Russia on to develop high-expense anti-missile system , thereby causing Russia 's national economy to be bled white by huge outlay of military expenses .  
Theoretical study classes and Marxist philosophy lectures were organized at all levels to help leading cadres systematically study the theory of dialectical materialism and historical materialism and to guide grass-roots officers and servicemen and cadets in military schools and academies to master the basic viewpoints of the materialist and atheist theory of Marxism .  
Meanwhile , with a view to successfully fulfilling the target of building up a regular , younger , and knowledgeable military , the Central Military Commission has recently selected and promoted from the basic level of all major military regions a group of forty-something cadres with university educational background and above to both the army and divisional levels , as a back-up force for the leading bodies of all major military regions .  
The relevant department disclosed that the Chinese People 's Liberation Army will increase the salaries and benefits of its officers and soldiers ( including the salaries of nonmilitary personnel and the allowances for soldiers ) next month .  The increase rate is about 25 percent over the current salaries .  This expense will be incorporated in the total military spending budget worked out by Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng under the national financial expenditure for this year .  
They should lay special emphasis on the study of the international strategic situation , high-tech local warfare , and the law of military management characteristic of the new situation so as to keep enhancing the scientific nature and effectiveness of their work of PLA construction and preparedness for military struggles .  
In answering a relevant question raised by a foreign journalist , Zhu Bangzao said that the US military spending this year is $ 14 billion more than last year and this increase is almost equivalent to China 's national defense spending last year .  Double standard should not be used on this issue .  
The main reasons for China to increase its national defense spending this year is to ensure that the living standard of the servicemen will improve simultaneously with social and economic development and with the increase in the average income of urban and rural residents , and to meet the needs of the modernization of national defense and the reform of the military management structure .  
All the armed forces stood up to the rigorous tests of complicated international and domestic situations as well as military and political struggles , always kept a high degree of stability , centralization , and unification , and accomplished with flying colors such tasks as conducting major military exercises , fighting floods and dealing with emergencies , holding a military review in celebration of the 50th founding anniversary of the PRC , and assuming the defense responsibilities in Hong Kong and Macao , making important contributions to defending and building the motherland .  
Ichiro Ozawa , a radical politician and the current head of the opposition Liberal Party published his article in a magazine in 1999 , entitled " my proposal of constitutional amendment , " which said that the current constitution was forcefully formulated during the occupation of the US military , therefore , the constitution is invalid .  
Afterwards , Wang Zhongyu heard reports from the Hebei Provincial Committee , the provincial government , the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee , and city government leaders , and fully affirmed the work of the provincial and municipal Party committees and governments , the rapid action of the military , military police , and public security police , prompt rescues , and effective measures .  Furthermore , he provided concrete requests and suggestions for the next steps in the rescue work , helping the injured , cracking the case , and protecting social stability .  
In his important speech at a meeting held by the NPC delegation from the People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) , President Jiang Zemin , proceeding from the change of international and world military situations and the overall situation in the country , incisively expounded some major issues concerning army building in the new century and set clear and definite requirements , and further pointed out the way for the modernization of national defense and the armed forces .  
It focuses on the implementation of a zero-base budget in a bid to bring into full play the role of macro-economic control of the budget .  In this way , it can gradually form a new budgetary system for the armed forces , in which financial power and financial resources are concentrated , military spending is scientifically distributed , budgetary items are specific and transparent , and supervision and restraint are tight .  
Moreover , although many military experts have identified Aegis warships as the " former TMD system , " Lieutenant General ( ?  Biersi ) [ name as transliterated ] , former commander of the US 10th submarine fleet who retired three years ago , seriously warned the Taiwan authorities during his visit to Taiwan at the beginning of this year , saying that the original design of the Aegis was not targeted at the anti-missile system such as the TMD , but now everybody believes that it can be used to confront ballistic missiles .  
The Bush administration 's foreign-policy team is still intoxicated with irrational economic prosperity in the 1990s , and it has not yet realized that the biggest challenge the United States is going to face will not a military but an economic one ; the fatal weakness of the Bush administration is that its senior financial and economic officials lack the prestige to stabilize the confidence of Wall Street investors .  
They dished out the so-called strategy of " fighting a decisive battle offshore , " purchased advanced weapons and equipment from abroad without restraint , conducted military exercises directed at the mainland of the motherland in an attempt to increase their capacity of " rejecting reunification through armed force . "  
Highlights include the microscopic lens used by Sun Yat-sen when he was a medical student , the original manuscript of the " Twenty-one Demands " with Yuan Shikai 's handwritten comments , the banner used by the Beijing University students during the May Fourth Movement , the robe worn by the Chinese judge at the international military tribunal in Tokyo after World War II , the loudspeaker used by Mao Zedong to proclaim the founding of the People 's Republic of China at Tiananmen and the wreckage of Lin Biao 's aeroplane .  
The national anthem was played and some 200,000 people , including 20,000 overseas Chinese and 400 foreign diplomats and visitors , stood at attention . The huge military parade then started , following a report given by Lt . Gen . Chiang Chung-ling , commanding officer of the parade , on the number of personnel and units involved .  
When a scene takes place in the emperor 's palace the most formal of all costumes , the Mang , is worn by both civilian and military officials . In ordinary scenes such characters would wear a less formal Pi , and when in their homes they can wear the even more casual Chetzu . These three costumes are made of soft material and have gentle lines .  
Tales of the faithful dog rescuing his master abound in the traditional folklore of ancient China . Dogs have also served man in the art of war and defense . Throughout history , select breeds have been trained to attack , defend , carry messages and transport supplies . This special military role continues today .  
The limited number of winners and the extreme conditions required to earn this distinctiondiligent adherence to duty and training , coupled with the crucial element of cooperation among the soldiershave served to raise the standard of a fighting spirit , help establish a military " model unit " , and an efficacy of military strength .  
Mountains had to be traversed as there was no dynamite to blast out more convenient detours . In constant fear of aboriginal raids , builders cleared a wide area in order to discourage aboriginal attacks . Forts , outposts and military encampments were also set up at varying intervals along the course of the route . Chang Yeh Yi-hu , a first lieutenant in the Japanese army , spent 17 days travelling the trail .  
Wings of Glory Representing the glorious tradition of the Chinese air command , the Chinese Air Force Academy stands as a landmark in modern military training . Originally founded in 1932 by the late President Chiang Kai-shek , the school has grown from its original humble origins near Hangchou , to its present modern facility in Kaohsiung County , southern Taiwan .  
The Bureau of Entry and Exit has announced that " young overseas students " wishing to return home may apply to the various Ministry of Foreign Affairs foreign representatives for special passports . The measure is designed to smooth procedures for young overseas students wishing to return home .

A : The Executive Yuan has always seen the improvement of military , public servant , and teacher salaries as an issue of importance , and adjustment will be made in fiscal 1988 . The rate of adjustment will be matched by the Executive Yuan with the total calculated budget for fiscal 1988 . These adjustments must take into account the factors of price fluctuations , financial liability capabilities , and the general salary levels of the people . They have no relation whatsoever to the level of foreign exchange reserves .  
After he completed his military service in 1966 , he got a job as a medical photographer at a U . S . Navy research institute in Taipei . During his twelve years there , he learned many photographic and developing techniques . In his free time he traveled around shooting pictures of people and places he found interesting , and he also got to know Teng Nan-kuang , whose influence resulted in a greater breadth and freedom in his work .  
The Ministry of Education has made the following revisions : Now , students who have graduated from a public or private high school , or any higher level of education , or passed the Higher Civil Service Examination or Junior-Grade Civil Service Examination and has completed his military duty , or those who are exempt from military duty , may apply to study abroad .  
Within these three goals , these are our efforts in each individual area : In the area of national defense : Following the policy of military modernization , we have built up formidable armed forces , successfully developed sophisticated weaponry according to a predetermined plan , and implemented the policy of using only highly qualified soldiers ; over the past five years , military personnel have been reduced by over 35,000 persons .  
So starting from the present , the party should expand the channels for participation and communication , so that party members and cadres have ample opportunity to express their opinions . A view of the current political situation reveals ever-changing and treacherous trends and widespread military conflict . The antagonism between the two extremes of freedom and slavery as well as of democracy and totalitarianism has never let up in the least .  
Under principles of " internationalization and liberalization " the system should be harmonized with those of our major trading partners . Consideration should be given to eliminating the exemption for military personnel and teachers as well as unreasonable erosions of the tax base ( like leaving out interest income up to 360,000 NT dollars or from stock trading ) , simplifying tax brackets , lowering the highest rates , and looking into the tax reporting method ; these are all concrete proposals to make a thorough reform of the tax system .  
Aside from military related references , common answers were xenophobic ( 32 ) , narrow-minded and picky ( 34 ) , selfish ( 23 ) , cheap ( 18 ) , crafty ( 11 ) and hypocritical ( 8 ) .  
Besides military work , the large capital investment and cultivation of talent can provide enormous resources for the future development of a complete air industry and for raising the level of domestic industry in general .  
Rising up to take advantage of this opportunity and lay a comprehensive and lasting foundation for the future of the Chinese people is the common responsibility of the 1.2 billion Chinese at home and abroad . It is also the duty of the people on our bastion of national revival , civilian and military alike , to lead the way with great wisdom , determination , and solidarity , based on our many years of experience and achievements in implementing political democracy and an economy that benefits the people .  
During his military career , Hau cultivated a broad understanding of international politics , foreign affairs , science and technology , and social and mainland affairs , but observed a strict separation between the military and politics .  
The Northern Hsiung-nu were defeated in a military expedition led by Tou Hsien and Pan Ch'ao and driven away to " Ta-tse , " but " no one knows what became of them eventually . " Having vanished from Chinese history around the first century A . D . , the Hsiung-nu resurfaced in European history in the fourth century when they crossed the Don in pursuit of the westward-fleeing Alans and won complete victory in a great battle with the Ostrogoths and Visigoths , after which they established a kingdom on the Hungarian plain .  
According to research by Hsia Li-ming associate professor at Taitung Normal College , there is a marked difference between Chinese imperial maps , produced to meet the political and military requirements of the court , and European navigation charts of the same period , where the commercial interest is foremost .  
Although political considerations have held them back from making any aggressive move so far , from a purely military perspective our success during the 1958 Kinmen bombardment in downing 31 MiGs against one plane lost and gaining air supremacy over the Taiwan Strait , together with our subsequent vigilant posture , have actually made them weigh the cost of attacking Taiwan by force , " is how assemblyman Ting Shou-chung of the Legislative Yuan 's defense committee sees it . "  
For example , one of the most successful items in this year 's old people 's consumer exhibition by the social affairs department was undoubtedly the " old people 's manpower bank " organized by the Women 's Outreach Center . Over 300 people signed up on the spot , and in due course another 50 be came official members , including retired military officers , retired doctors , teachers , banking personnel and civil servants .  
Data indicates that if the mainland authorities launch an attack on Taiwan regardless of internal democratic opposition and the cost in casualties - - one third to one quarter of their combined forces manpower - - then they have three possible options for military action : The first is attacking the islands one by one , starting with Kinmen , Matsu and the Pescadores , at the same time using their air and sea dominance , and missiles , to strike military , political and economic targets on Taiwan itself .  
Submarines lose some of their superiority in the relatively shallow Taiwan Straits , where sea trenches are not wide enough for use , and military experts believe there can be at the most only thirteen mainland submarines deployed around Taiwan , to the north , east , south and southwest where the waters are deeper .  
Something worth mentioning is that with new military equipment largely automated and technological , future manpower needs will be reduced , which eases the problem that has been caused for the navy by the shortened term of naval conscription .  
Excellent personnel quality has always been the strongest point of our national defense . During annual recruiting for the combined forces academy , the proportion of enrollees for the navy is usually the highest , which underlines the quality standards required by the navy . In recent years however the numbers seeking admission to military school have fallen steadily , with the navy feeling the bite more than the other forces because of its reputation for the hard life .  
Explains an experienced naval officer : " Because they are versatile and swift , they can get anywhere nearby within a very short period of time . Stationing them at outer islands increases combat strength throughout the seas around Taiwan . In combination with onshore missiles they amount to a formidable control over the Taiwan Straits . " Whenever there is a fourth-degree alert the missile speedboats are ordered to deploy to outer islands , and when the alert is raised to third-degree they disperse among military harbors , ready for combat at anytime .  
The end of combat zone administration is not like simply cutting a watermelon in two - - one chop for a clean break with no complications . The regulations , personnel organization , administrative measures and so on that remain from over thirty years under the system of combat zone administration all have to be changed . So there are many areas where the military authorities and local government will have to work together in the future .  
Some grown-up " overseas students , " who have fulfilled their military obligations or finished junior college in Taiwan , have organized a club for them called the Chinese Youth Association . Besides holding lots of outdoor activities to let them work off steam so they can fall asleep as soon as their head touches the pillow when they get home , the older members help the students with their homework or find doctors or lawyers for them in case of emergencies . "  
In Europe , many countries that have achieved a certain level of economic development have devoted more and more resources to advancing technology in medicine , environmental protection and other areas related to public welfare rather than engaging in the all-out pursuit of economic strength or military power . The Soviet Union , on the other hand , lagged way behind Europe , North America and Japan in developing consumer-oriented technology , but it was undeniably a scientific and technological power in terms of its achievements in military research and development . "  
Under a situation that was too much even for the Cantonese character , renowned for its defiant tendency , the natives could only cause relatively minor disturbances for the British military , and the " shame of changing masters " became deeply embedded in their hearts . Yet the threads of nationalist thinking had not yet come together in the minds of the people .  
The civil officials judge the good and the bad - - the military carry out the punishment ; ox-headed and horse-faced demon messengers from purgatory detain the criminal and the gold and silver generals put him or her in a cangue ; the white messenger of death turns his eyes up fiercely and sticks out his tongue , while the black messenger carries the arrest warrant . You can not help but tremble in such a sinister atmosphere .  
Because the Japanese military imposed strict order , any photography that included topographic features , military bases , or indeed any photo whose field of vision extended downward more than 45 degrees had to be approved by the military police . Thus it was difficult for ordinary people to photograph freely outdoors .  
Actually , public and private schools have a deep connection . A few of the schools were established by retired members of the military dog training center . Also , when the police canine division was first formed , they trained both the people and the dogs by relying on the long experience of private dog schools .  
At one time - - I do not know what it was about - - a military warden was up on the platform , droning on and on , when a hissing noise rose up from all the students below . I could see the principal standing at the side , smiling , with no expression of being unhappy about the situation . " Wu Chin-fa thinks that the leeway given to the students by Kao-hsiung High during the period of martial law made a lasting impact on him .  
The end of Autumn Chrysanthemum is a happy scene of great coming together amidst the conflict between different ethnic groups . The children from the military dependents villages used the fraternal method of financial gifts and peace mediation ( in Wu Chin-fa 's eyes , the children from the military dependents villages had the most resources in those years ) , to smooth over the conflicts between Fukienese-Taiwanese and Hakka-Taiwanese factions , and resolve a scene of bloody conflict .  
At present 25% of the national budget goes for defense and the military ; 20% goes toward economic development ; routine government administrative costs account for 10% ; 15% is applied to education . . . . The remaining few percent is up for grabs among public health , agriculture , social welfare , religious , and other interests , naturally leading to the " squeezing out " effect .  
Five years later the low wall around the city had been completed , and artillery placements were added to all four gates ( north , south , east , and west ) to ward off attacks from indigenous peoples or foreign military units . The internal and external walls were each twenty feet thick , and there was a moat around the outside . Such was China 's southernmost county seat .  
In the early years , the Japanese sealed off the mountain areas in order to weaken Taiwan 's ability to resist their power , but after detailed exploration by the Japanese government , gold was mined in large quantities from 1897onwards . It is estimated that the main veins were all worked out within less than 20 years . All this gold was shipped back to Japan , where it became a major source of finance for the imperial army 's purchases of military equipment from abroad .  
In 1987 , he finished a survey of the western section of the Ching dynasty Patungkuan Trail over Mt . Yushan , and uncovered many sections of well-preserved Ching stone paving . At the site of a Ching military camp , he collected numerous fragments of blue and white porcelain crockery , which were identified by the National Palace Museum as products of the Dehua kiln in Fujian Province .  
The essence is entirely in the trailThese small foot paths and trails have gone from being the indigenous people 's " settlement trails " in earliest times , to being " military affairs roads " or " barbarian management roads , " to being the " fitness trails , " " historical sites " and " scenic routes " of today 's national park . Their roles have often changed , but their importance is the same as of old .  
On this day they paid honor to the flag god and inspected the military troops . " Swords and spears bright as snow , banners bright and colorful " accompanied the cold , harsh autumn . It truly carried a sad chill : " The brave warrior goes off , never to return " !  
Though the palace stands tall in a central position in downtown Taipei with countless people and vehicles streaming along the wide roads on all sides , the heavy guard of military police all around it has long made it an unapproachable , sternly mysterious forbidden territory in the eyes of the public .  
The tall central tower on top of the Presidential Palace is also the object of much curiosity . Every day at dawn and at 5:50 each afternoon , the public can watch the flag raising and lowering ceremonies , in which two military policemen hoist or take down the national flag on top of the tower . But just what kind of world is hidden inside the tower ?  
And so in 1901 , when the Governor-General 's Residence was completed ( now the Taipei Guest House ) , it was luxuriously expansive and well appointed . The Japanese craftsmen designed the space imitating the baroque style in order to show their noble authority . Widening Tungmen Street , which originally led through the East Gate , they left the Gate as the center of a traffic circle , so as to make it convenient for military parades as well as every-day horses and carriages . Full of traffic , the road was very impressive .  
These programs were connected to the political plan Japan had for its colony : Japanese leaders felt that Taiwan occupied an important strategic position astride the East and South China seas , and the navy was especially anxious to exert effective control over Taiwan and the Pescadores . Not only did they want to build Taiwan into a base for further military expansion , they hoped to squeeze the colony for its economic resources ( such as sugar ) to support capitalist economic development in the mother country .  
Mainland textbooks on the other hand stress the Communist Party of China 's development of an all-out resistance campaign behind enemy lines , stressing that " the Nationalist government , for fear of unleashing the great power of the people to resist the Japanese , only mobilized the government and the army in partial resistance , leading to severe military failures . The CPC implemented a total war of resistance , effectively complementing the Kuomintang 's overall military strategy and threatening the enemy 's rear . "  
But even though high-level medical technology ca n't be provided on location in these remote districts , where populations number in the hundreds , combined medical assistance should be sufficient , through telemedicine , mobile medical care , and public-sponsored rural physician visitation services , all of which have been carried out for many years , as well as the backup system of offshore military medical services .  
The anonymous sender wrote on it that it was composed 600 years ago by Liu Bowen , a wise and resourceful military counsellor to the first Ming emperor Zhu Yuan-zhang . The sender also added notes next to the crucial words and phrases to indicate that the poem had anotheinterpretation : " When the Taiwanese independence movement falls , where will Chen Shui-bian go ? Chrysanthemum flowers fall , plum flowers bloom , prospects unfold for the new united front and Jaw Shau-kong . " ( The characters for Jaw 's name appeared in the poem . )  
At this time , " the editorial read , " the highest military official for Hebei was absent . Civil and military officials at all levels had been ordered to just stay in their positions , so they were even more cautious and restrained than usual . It is inconceivable that the local Chinese forces would have dared to spark an incident during the night maneuvers by the Japanese forces .  
Even if his academic record was n't anything special , he worked to help support his family . He was quick at making chicken cages , and early every morning would wash and shell the dried fava beans that his mother bought at the wholesale market and sold from her front door outside the military dependents ' village . "  
The elephant veteranWhen they arrived at the military base at the head of Fengshan Bay , Ah-Lan passed away , perhaps because she could not adjust to the new environs . And because the military was not actively engaged , the remaining two elephants could only look forward to retirement . Later on , they were sent straight up to the Taipei Zoo , then located in the northern suburb of Yuanshan .  
Many young people , unable to find work immediately after completing their military service , see driving a taxi as a job which offers independence and an apparently reasonable income , so they enter this " reception center for the unemployed and waystation for those changing jobs . "  
To be fair , the three military drama troupes held many morale-boosting public performances and competitions over the years , which soothed the homesickness of those mainland officers and soldiers who moved to Taiwan early on . They have served overseas to promote Chinese culture , and they have helped prevent the disappearance of the Peking dramatic arts . The problem is that art and the military simply make peculiar bedfellows .  
Therefore , over the last ten years , the three Peking opera troupes went on fewer and fewer military entertainment missions . The main mission of the troupes became entertaining at veteran 's homes , participating in the annual national drama competition and performing for the public .  
" This is not just an issue about 200 people 's livelihoods , or who 's going to take over . It 's more about redefining Peking opera and readjusting the guidelines for national cultural development , " says National Institute of the Arts teacher Wen Chiu-chu , who just completed research on " Taiwanese Peking opera . " The three military opera troupes used to be cultural products forcibly cultivated by the government . They used up quite a lot of national resources , and under excessive protection they lost their ability to be innovative and different .  
It was discovered that in maledominated jobs-the military and police , construction workers , machinists-men use various roundabout methods to " mark their territory . " Thus posters of naked women , impossible to avoid seeing , are put up in factories . Or construction workers will urinate openly right in front of passing women . It even happens that women scholars doing field research or female students supporting labor rights may find themselves in dangerous situations in such environments .  
Porter pointed out that previous ideas about national power and competitive advantage focused on countries with vast territory and abundant natural resources , which ideally were backed up by military strength .  
Because Kaohsiung harbor has a huge capacity , and is a pivotal spot for routes to southeast Asia , in the Japanese occupation era the authorities made it a concentration point for heavy industry and petroleum refining . After the outbreak of the war in the Pacific , Japan used Kaohsiung as a base for advancing southward , and established many military facilities there .  
Satellites , in accordance with their different functions and missions , can be divided into five categories : scientific satellites are used to conduct scientific research in space ; surveillance satellites are used to obtain military intelligence ; resource satellites collect information on global resources ; weather satellites monitor atmospheric conditions and collect information for meteorological prediction ; and finally communication satellites , which are in high demand for their wide range of communication applications .  
Chen Hung-wei , a journalism student at Chengchi University , began to play the Japanese version of " The Three Kingdoms , " a game incorporating Chinese history and military strategy , two years ago . Not knowing Japanese did n't stop him from enjoying the game ; he spent the entire summer vacation after his freshman year attacking cities , invading countries and opening up the borderlands , often playing all night long .  
And , because the Three Kingdoms requires a knowledge of military tactics , it pushes players to study history more deeply outside the game . Tu 's son , a fifth grader , has carefully read a colloquial Chinese translation of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms ( the original is written in the difficult classical Chinese ) in order to better play the game , allowing his father to see the game 's charm firsthand .  
The southern Taiwan sun beats down on the low , densely packed buildings of Er-kung New Village , a military dependents ' community in Tainan County . In the morning market , the crowds seem to boil . In contrast , the expansive grounds of Our Lady of the Assumption Church , located in the center of the village , seem particularly cool and serene .  
Coincidentally , the great Roman general Julius Caesar also bound military carriages to the backs of elephants and used them to invade Britain . But this was only after the famed Carthaginian general Hannibal had crossed the Alps with 37 elephants in a sneak attack on Rome . In spite of their superior military strength , the Romans suffered serious losses in the attack . After such an unforgettable lesson , the Romans " imported " elephants for military use .  
A military gap ? Professor Chung has considerable confidence in the current naval forces of the ROC . He says that , leaving aside nuclear weapons , Taiwan 's maritime defense level , including ships , weapons systems , and personnel quality , is ahead of the PRC by 10 to 15 years .  
The new submarines run very quiet , so they are not easily detectable . Their fire control , sonar , and underwater detecting systems are all linked automatically in real-time mode , so they can go operational very rapidly . " They are superior to any diesel submarine in the PRC fleet , " says Sung Yu-ning , editor of Defense Technology Monthly and a long-time observer of military technology .  
The US plays the leading role under the newly issued Guidelines , while Japan will support the US in any military conflict around Japan . When there is a crisis involving a " regional " issue , the US is required to take responsibility for restoring peace and security in the " region . " Japan , meanwhile , is obliged to keep open its base facilities , airfields , and ports , and provide support to US forces in operating in international waters and airspace .  
Some have suggested that in the wake of the cold war , the world is too peaceful , but the nation must have enemies . And in the process of passing the EEA , the US Justice Department stressed that " economic security " was a major part of national security , as important as military security . Furthermore , it estimates that foreign governments and companies have robbed American companies of more than US $ 100 billion in profits and many millions of lost jobs by stealing trade secrets . Productivity and national power are closely linked .  
Amid the growing voices of opposition widespread attacks on the government 's monopoly of radio broadcasting were heard . After much discussioon about broadcast policies , the government began in 1993 to turn over radio bands that were originally reserved for military use , and nearly 120 new mid - and low-range local stations were granted licenses .  
In late 1928 , undeterred by Japanese obstruction , Zhang resolutely decided that the northeast should change flags , thus reestablishing the unity of China after a long period of fragmentation . In September 1930 , when a military campaign by Chiang Kai-shek against two northern warlords was at a stalemate , Zhang sent a telegram pledging his allegiance to the central government , and dispatched forces from the northeast into the Beijing-Tianjin area . This put an end to the six-month-old civil war , and again helped restore national unity .  
The Western powers were at the time entering a depression and had no energy to interfere in the affairs of the East . Secondly , blockading of the Communists was underway in Jiangxi . The Nanjing-Guangdong split had occurred , when leading military and political figures established an alternative government after the arrest of Hu Hanmin . The Yangtze also flooded with calamitous consequences , leaving millions of people dead or dislocated .  
Various parties have speculated on different possible causes , including engine stoppage and hijacking . Others have even suggested that the plane was victim of an artillery shot fired during recent military exercises . However , on the day of the crash the military called off area exercises due to rain , ruling out this last possibility . But until the aircraft 's black box is recovered , there is no way of really knowing what happened .  
An ad hoc task force comprising both civilian and military investigators is now hard at work on the case , but has discovered signs that many documents have either been lost or falsified . Many worrisome questions remain unanswered : How many people are involved ? How high up does the case reach ?  
The Investigation Bureau has received a tip that organized crime might be involved in the development of a radio communications system and related equipment , a project being carried out by the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology on contract to the armed forces . Commenting on the recent spate of scandals within the military , Assistant Professor Sung Hsiao-yuan comments : " The likelihood of corruption increases in direct proportion to the degree to which an organization is closed . The same holds true regarding the level of technical expertise required to carry out its operations . "  
Hau Pei-tsun , a former premier as well as chief of the General Staff , was a member of the armed forces for most of his career . Speaking about his experience as chief of the General Staff , Hau has stated that the military already has a perfectly sound procurement system , and that the important thing is the ethical standards of the officers in charge . If top generals get involved in politics and start engaging in tricky power plays , the military will naturally fall into disarray .  
Li Chin-kuo , a graduate of the Institute of Zoology at National Taiwan University , has always been concerned about wildlife . After the FS Studio class , he used the limited amount of money that he had been able to save during his compulsory military service to buy a digital video camera and a second-hand car , and headed off to fishing villages in search of material .  
They helped Chang retrace his first heartthrob , who he has never forgotten , and also his middle school military instructor , who devoted great efforts to guiding him . He is thrilled at the idea of expressing gratitude through TV , saying it is 100 times more effective than contacting these people in private . " I can let the whole world know how grateful I am to them ! "  
In military affairs , after the PRC unilaterally broke off negotiations in 1995 , they initiated a series of missile tests in the Taiwan Strait . According to the ROC Ministry of Defense , in recent years the PRC has continually seen Taiwan 's new generation of military capabilities as its primary hypothetical enemy and undertaken numerous military exercises based on this premise . In addition , the national defense report just issued by the PRC emphasized repeatedly that the possibility of using armed force against Taiwan could not be excluded .  
Of Taiwan 's offshore islands , because Kinmen and Matsu are in a high state of military readiness , it would be costly to attack them . Thus , the PRC could choose to assault those islands in the South China Sea which are currently occupied by ROC forces . Another possible form of small-scale military conflict would be the use of surface-to-surface guided missiles . Since the political effectiveness of such missiles against offshore islands would be limited , these would more likely be targeted against political or economic centers in Taiwan itself .  
According to the PRC 's national defense white paper for this year , mainland China has realized that there is a global trend toward domination of the battlefield through high-technology weapons . Therefore , the PLA is aggressively " moving along the path of a streamlined , high-quality military with Chinese characteristics . " The PRC plans to reduce its total armed forces by 500,000 men within three years , so that the PLA will stabilize at a level of about 2.5 million personnel .  
In order to achieve its new goals , the PRC has been buying or developing ( with the help of hired Russian experts ) SU-27 fighters , inter-continental ballistic missiles , and cruise missiles , and is forming a naval task force capable of independent operational capability . General Tang Fei , chief of the ROC general staff , judges that there are a number of objectives behind the PRC 's transformation of its military strategy .  
It hopes to raise its political status at a global level and at the Asia-Pacific regional level through the development of a high-technology operational capability . It also aims to increase its capability to deal with domestic and border area instability . Besides these , however , and of more immediate interest to Taiwan , another of the main goals behind mainland China 's new strategy is to maintain a reliable military threat to cope with Taiwan and its so-called " separatist tendencies . "  
With the end of the US-Soviet Cold War , the PRC has recognized that an enormous transformation has occurred in the global political and military structure . Bipolar confrontation has been replaced by regional or functional conflicts . Under these circumstances , middle-sized powers or regional powers can expand their international political influence .  
But looking only at the bilateral cross-strait relationship , there 's also a contradiction . On the one hand , despite occasional political dialogue , neither side has ever altered its basic position , and this is reflected in the fact that , in military affairs , each side sees the other as its most likely adversary . On the other hand , no matter how tense the situation gets between the two regimes , economic and social interaction between their citizens does not decline .  
In 1994 and 1995 , the question of whether Japan should take on a greater military role in Asia stirred intense controversy in many Asian countries . At that time , Lee Kwan Yew stated in no uncertain terms to American and Japanese news media that he was opposed to a stronger overseas role for the Japanese military . In stating his opposition , he told of his own terrifying experiences during the Japanese occupation of Singapore , and even spoke of a dark side to Japanese culture .  
Judging from the ROC national defense report , in which strategic thinking is guided by " no seeking of war but no fear of war , " it would have been be essential to respond flexibly ( i.e . at a parallel level ) to Communist China . Under such circumstances , there could have been rapid escalation to a military conflict .  
The chief culprit is suspected to be poor drainage at a disused military firing range on top of the hill . The Shihlin District Prosecutor 's Office is carrying out an investigation , and has not ruled out other possible causes , such as illegal logging , or that the drainage system for the whole area is inadequate .  
From 1957 on , the central government appointed three consecutive governors with military backgrounds . Behind this pattern was a tense military standoff with mainland China , which shelled the island of Kinmen heavily in 1958 . A number of projects designed to promote political stability and ensure economic and social survival and development were completed during these years .  
With regard to the organizational structure of the provincial government , Professor Cheng states that during the years when military men filled the governorship , administrative powers were highly concentrated in the hands of the central government . In 1967 , the city of Taipei came under the direct jurisdiction of the central government , whereas before it had been under the provincial government . In cities under the provincial government , the chief administrators of municipal districts , who had formerly been chosen by direct elections , also began to be appointed . The locals rule  
The program proved extremely popular and was aired for a full two years . Many of the documentary films used were collected by John Hei on trips overseas , and sometimes the ROC military even borrowed such material for information purposes .  
The Taiwan Garrison Command was established in 1958 , assuming complete control over martial law , police functions , entry to and exit from Taiwan , media and cultural censorship , postal spying , and military trials ( which could also be used in civilian cases ) .  
The object of traditional combat training was for war and self-defense . When military officers retired and moved back to their original homes , they brought their skills to a wider population , and thus martial arts began to spread . In the agricultural society of old , most people led plain lives , without time for such pursuits or the money to pay for training , which is why martial arts were generally passed down only in the families of the wealthy .  
For instance , before we broke ties with one nation , it informed us that it was facing economic collapse , that for eight months government workers had received no pay and that there had been three attempted military coups . They asked for US $ 120 million in loans or financial assistance , but this would only have been enough to meet their short-term debts .  
These are some of the main arguments that constitute Lin 's 1988 book China 's Nuclear Weapons Strategy , which is now available for the first time in a Taiwan translation in Lin 's recently published The Nuclear Hegemon . Although China 's Nuclear Weapons Strategy was published back in 1988 , it is still very enlightening for readers today to find out how Communist China 's nuclear weapons strategy is very much tied to Chinese strategic tradition . Anyone studying Communist China 's military can not ignore the influence of traditional strategic culture .  
In sum , by reading Lin 's new book , The Nuclear Hegemon , the reader can enjoy , first , a systematic look back at Communist China 's long road to becoming a nuclear power and its subtle use of traditional Chinese strategic thinking , as seen through the eyes of a Chinese . The reader can also come to understand the true capabilities of the PLA through the essays on PLA military modernization .  
In fact , American China policy has maintained a general direction based on three main national interests : democracy and human rights , economics and trade , and security and military strategy . The periodic swinging results from a tug of war between two groups of US domestic forces , one more accomodating toward Beijing such as the mainstream China scholars , the other more critical , such as the media . Nevertheless , Taipei seeks simultaneous improvement of relations with both Washington and Beijing .  
Due to the increased tension across the Taiwan Strait and incessant rumors of elevating levels of military alert , within five days Taiwan 's stock market shed more than a thousand points . On July 16 alone it plummeted 506 points , with total market value shrinking by more than NT $ 1.5 trillion . To prop up the market , the Ministry of Finance forced four major government-related funds-the postal savings fund , labor pension fund , labor insurance fund and civil service pension fund-to buy stock .  
" Hsinchu residents seem conservative and parochial on the surface , " says Chen Mei-chun , a researcher with Dandelion Workshop , " but once you have made contact you find that they can be very flexible , and highly spontaneous . " When Chen was studying at Tsinghua University she spent some time filming a documentary and collecting historical material in the Chincheng New Village , a military dependants settlement just across from the university .  
From Qingdao they went to Hunan and from Hunan to Guangzhou . Finally , hearing that the commanding officer of the forces defending the Penghu ( Pescadores ) Islands hailed from Shandong and was willing to look after the children of fellow Shandong natives , the school principals discussed the matter among themselves and decided to go to the Penghus . Male students aged 17 and over were to divide their time between study and military training ; boys under 17 and female students were to take classes in a separate school .  
In his Master 's thesis entitled War and the Taiwanese , Li Kuo-sheng states that the system first appeared after the January 28th Incident of 1932 , when the Japanese attempted unsuccessfully to invade the lower Yangtze valley from their concession in Shanghai . Okamura Yasuji , chief of staff of the Japanese Imperial Army , was anxious to bring an end to the endless patronizing of local prostitutes by Japanese soldiers . To this end he ordered the establishment of military " comfort stations " where the soldiers could take care of their sexual needs .  
Ho Pi-chen , chief executive officer of TWRF , strongly contests the contention of the Japanese government that the comfort women were engaged in private prostitution . In talking with former comfort women from many different countries , Ho has learned : " Most of these women were transported to the front on naval vessels . The comfort stations were built by the military , and the military determined how they were to be run . When the women got sick , they were attended to by military doctors .  
Chu notes in her research that after they captured the city of Haikou on Hainan Island in 1939 , the Japanese military ( operating through the Government-General of Taiwan ) ordered Taiwan Development to carry out economic development on the island . The company was given a wide range of tasks , and construction of buildings urgently needed by the occupying forces received top priority . Facilities built included administrative quarters , a mess hall , barracks , and a naval comfort station .  
Under the crisp and pleasant skies of late December , Mrs . Pu , a woman in her late fifties who lives in a military dependents ' village in Taoyuan , hastens to place her order for 40 catties ( 24 kg ) of streaky pork . When the meat arrives she chops it into one-catty strips , then steeps these in a marinade of dry-fried star anise and other spices , mixed with rock sugar , salt and Gaoliang liquor .  
The " organic law " will , among other changes , cause individual services to lose their respective intelligence agencies , which will be unified under the general staff . The political warfare system ( an autonomous system of political commissar-type officers , created in early Republican times , to ensure the loyalty of the military to the nationalist revolution 's leaders ) will be reorganized and its functions will undergo a qualitative change .  
Of course , different countries are in different situations , and the external threats faced by these countries are not comparable to the cross-strait situation . PRC military affairs expert Alex Kao concludes that although the idea of taking a war beyond Taiwan is worth consideration , it would only be really useful if it could be adopted into the national security structure and done in an integrated and comprehensive way .  
The Republic of Palau , situated on an archipelago in the Micronesia region of the South Pacific , occupies a strategic position both for international transport and in military terms . It has a total area of 488 square kilometers and a population of something over 18,000 . After being " discovered " by the Portuguese in 1783 , Palau was subsequently ruled by Spain and Germany . After WWI it was made a Japanese protectorate , and after WWII was governed by the US under a UN trusteeship .  
In response to these doubts , Chen Shui-bian stressed that Tang 's achievements in reforming the military during his tenure as minister of national defense were plain for all to see , and his enlightened working style and democratic approach were fully in accord with the principles of inclusive , clean government . Taiwan needed stability in which to pursue reform and progress , develop its economy and assure its national defense capability , and Tang was the best choice to bring this about .  
The various parties leveraged their carrots and sticks against their delegates , threatening expulsion for not supporting the neutralization of the National Assembly at the same time as they tried to appease their delegates . Finally , on April 24 these maneuvers helped bring about the passage of several constitutional revisions , including deactivation of the National Assembly , favorable provisions for residents of Taiwan 's offshore islands ( Kinmen , Matsu , and Penghu ) and military personnel , and revocation of lifelong special privileges for grand justices .  
1,000 years ago , under the rule of scholars who valued culture over military prowess , Song-dynasty China saw rapid economic development and brought forth remarkable cultural and artistic achievements .  
But county executive Chen Shui-tsai , who was in the military for decades and maintains close contacts with the local defense command , says that while he understands the importance of military security , people must recognize that Kinmen 's role has changed from that of defender to communicator . The military , he says , will simply have to make the necessary adjustments to coordinate with the implementation of the little three links . " The security-related measures chosen by the Ministry of Defense will be key to the smooth implementation of the little three links . "  
The only people allowed to fly in or out of Kinmen were senior military officials and persons in need of emergency medical treatment . A Kinmen native living in Taipei had to first spend two entire working days completing the paperwork , then take a day traveling by train to the southern port of Kaohsiung . From there the traveler boarded a military landing craft for a choppy trip back home lasting more than ten hours .  
The level of education soared , and a total of 43 candidates from Kinmen eventually passed the extremely competitive imperial examinations over the years . The military period began after the Mongols put an end to the Song dynasty in 1279 . Loyal Song subjects unwilling to submit to Mongol rule retreated to Kinmen . Four centuries later , after the Ming dynasty was conquered by Manchus from the north , Zheng Chenggong ( Koxinga ) used Kinmen as a base in his attempt to restore Ming rule .  
It was chilly inside the shack , and Lin Chong decided to go down to the village for some liquor . Following the military veteran 's directions he passed an old temple and came upon a little inn . The owner recognized the veteran 's bottle-gourd and gave Lin a friendly welcome . Once Lin had warmed up he bought some dried beef and liquor , and headed back to the fodder depot .  
On August 21 , the task force announced that Yin 's murder had been planned out in advance by persons who were currently active in the military service . One was Captain Chen Lu-tseng , chief of staff for former Navy Commander-in-Chief Chuang Ming-yao . Another was a high-ranking military official whose identity is too sensitive to reveal .  
The day after the quake , while watching TV , their son Li Chien-ho saw the familiar sign from the family hair-stylist shop collapsed on the road side , and rushed off to get a temporary leave from his military unit to go home . Returning to Chungliao after a five-hour motorcycle journey through the night , face-to-face with his devastated home and uncertain whether his mother was alive or dead , he burst into tears .  
They are convinced that humanitarian assistance is necessary and should be permanent . Some even suggested that service in agricultural assistance teams be allowed to substitute for compulsory military service , so that even more young people from Taiwan can participate in international humanitarian assistance . Let 's go back for a moment to August 22nd .  
I wanted to stand up and testify in my personal status-as a writer who was imprisoned , shackled , and beaten because I insisted on freedom of speech and refused to bow down before authoritarianism ; and as a " thought criminal " for whom a military court sought the death penalty-to the fact that the dark ages are over in Taiwan , and that mothers will no longer have to cry for political reasons .  
The latter was the northernmost of these three counties , and extended all the way to Taipei and Keelung , but settlers long declined to venture north of Touliu ( today the county seat of Yunlin ) . Further south in Tainan , the Dutch arrived in the 1620s and established a fortress called Zeelandia . Later in that century , the Ming loyalist Koxinga 's able minister Chen Yonghua adopted a policy of keeping Taiwan equally strong in both the cultural and military spheres . A period of cultural flowering ensued in the south .  
In 1874 the Japanese , acting under the pretext that certain Ryukyu islanders had been murdered in Taiwan , sent a military expedition to occupy Mutanshe in southern Taiwan . Then in 1884 France , having declared war on China , attacked and shut down Keelung . All this made the Manchu court realize Taiwan 's importance as a gateway to the seven provinces along the southeastern coast . Clearly , the aims of foreign powers vis-a-vis Taiwan had changed .  
Wang admitted to military investigators during initial questioning that six months earlier , acting alone , he had lowered himself down from the rooftop into his neighbors ' apartment looking for money . When Wu Ming-han heard noises and woke up , Wang panicked and hacked both Wu and his wife to death with a meat cleaver . Wang then stole NT $ 6,000 before returning to his own apartment .  
Not long after coming to Taiwan , Ho prepared a study entitled " Developing Organization behind Enemy Lines and Establishing Intangible Bases , " and sent it to Chiang Ching-kuo . Ho was summoned to meet with Chiang , and as a consequence was allowed to enter the army academy , from which he graduated ( in Class 20 ) at the " ripe old age " of 39 . But he did not enjoy any further special successes in his military career .  
Recalling how hard it was back then , just she and four students in a lumbering old military transport plane , the always hearty Chou laughs and relates : " The thing we were most afraid of was landing on the wrong side . As we were coming in on our approach , a student said to me , ' We 're OK . The sign says Recover the Mainland ! , not Liberate Taiwan ! ' "  
Not long afterwards , he was arrested by the Japanese military for a cartoon in a newspaper depicting a famous Chinese general from the Ming dynasty killing a " dwarf pirate . " ( " Dwarf pirate " has long been a derogatory term used by Chinese to refer to Japanese . ) He thereby became categorized as a " Chinese juvenile political criminal . "  
Lin Pao-chun says , " Before Historical Records , Chinese military strategy had absorbed the idea of ruling with compassion , and the highest objective of the student of the martial arts was to eliminate the violence in his own heart . Lin expands on this point , stating that in the ethos of the knight-errant , magnanimity was more important than fighting skill . Moreover , knights-errant were expected to be ethical , moral , honorable , decorous and patriotic , as well as protecting the common folk .  
9-11 has left us at the brink of war , but the possibility of military conflict as a result of US retaliation is not the only worry . A fluke incident and a single leader 's misjudgment in many other flashpoints worldwide could push us beyond the point of no return . The historic enmity between Israel and Palestine comes to mind , as do the ethnic and religious killing in Eastern Europe . North and South Korea are another cause for concern .  
Chen Bin , a gezai xi music composer who graduated from the music department at the Fujian Provincial Academy of the Arts , has noticed that when he composes music for a contemporary gezai xi work , stirring Western symphonies or military tunes always come into his head subconsciously , which is very much at odds with the warm , homey emphasis of traditional gezai xi .  
The Pearl S . Buck Foundation takes its name from the Nobel Prize winning author , Pearl S . Buck , whose unforgettable renderings of China and its people are contained in the classics The Good Earth and Dragon Seed . The foundation was established in Philadelphia in 1964 , and four years later a branch was established in Taiwan . At its inception , the focus of the organization was to address new social concerns engendered by the presence of the American military on the island , specifically the growing number of children of mixed Taiwanese-American parentage .  
After the government of the Republic of China came to Taiwan in 1949 , the island of Kinmen became the front line in the Chinese Civil War and an important military base . A huge network of tunnels was dug out underground , while , on the surface , lovely traditional villages remained totally intact .  
During the Ming dynasty an Inspection Office was set up here , and Kinmen became an important maritime defense settlement . After the commanding general , Zhou Dexing , said of the place , " It is as impregnable as a metal [ kin ] wall and a moat of boiling water , and it commands control of the ocean gate [ men ] , " it came to be called Kinmen . Thus Kinmen 's role as a key military strong point began several hundred years ago .  
Many of the works on display are considered to be national treasures in the mainland ; indeed , they are recognized as consummate works of art by experts in the international community , as well . This exhibit offers the opportunity to learn not only about the cosmopolitan nature of the Tang dynasty and its capital , Chang'an , but also allows us to recognize the Tang as the most glorious of ages , in terms of art , culture , Buddhism , and military and economic strength .  
Chang Shiang-hua , who played a leading role in the translation of these poems , points out : " No matter how much difference there may be in political , military , or economic values , no matter how much competition or even conflict there maybe , basic human nature can still in many respects be recorded in poetry , and convey the beauty and the purity of heart .  
In his faculty apartment at Tainan National College of Arts , there hangs a picture he took of a little girl in a military dependent 's village . The girl is wearing a simple white dress and her eyes are staring at the camera . It is Chang 's favorite photo .  
Efforts to cut back on plastic waste shifted into a higher gear on January 1 with a measure restricting the use of plastic bags and plastic ( including expanded polystyrene , i.e . " styrofoam " ) disposable eating utensils . This marks the second phase of implementation of a policy that was first introduced on a more limited scale last July , when the government clamped down on the use of such items by government agencies , membership supermarkets for military personnel , and public and private schools .  
After fulfilling his mandatory military service , Lin was reluctant to return to the bakery , but he could n't find any other work . He was n't happy with the thought of spending a life amidst flour and oil and standing next to a hot oven . He often switched jobs , shuttling between guest houses and leading a dissipated life .  
They include the medical teams of the International Cooperation and Development Fund , young men doing " overseas duty " as a substitute for military service , religious organizations , and individual doctors . They are performing a wide range of medical assistance activities not just limited to simple humanitarian aid , including donation of medical supplies , technical exchange in the field of public health , education and training , promotion of preventive medicine against epidemic illnesses , and " matchmaking " between people with certain medical needs and those who can provide what is needed .  
" Currently , only 35 people a year are allowed to perform foreign medical service in lieu of military service , " Kay notes . " This is too small a number , and those performing this service should n't be limited to males of enlistment age . " Having grown up amid affluence , young Taiwanese often have a utilitarian bias . By performing overseas service , they can learn that " those who give always get more in return . "  
Chen called on DPP party officials and public office holders to withdraw from management of electronic media , and he also stated that the government would abandon all management rights in those media outlets in which it holds stock . Moreover , he asked the DPP caucus in the Legislative Yuan to give priority to amending the laws governing radio and TV-especially those provisions that would exclude government , political parties , and the military from control over the media-saying that it is their duty to complete the amending process in this legislative session .  
During Qing times , train station warehouses were strategic military entrepots ; during the Japanese occupation they were used as storage facilities by the sugar , salt , and forestry industries ; and after the war they were used to accommodate rail passengers on their way south or north . Although they were located in urban centers with good communication links , these warehouses stopped being used for freight storage many years ago .  
Of all the famous artifacts it was the carved ivory balls in particular that captured his interest . The superb craftsmanship expressed in their warm rich hues and intricately carved multiple layers never ceased to amaze him . Seeing these ivory balls he too was determined to carve ivory once he had completed his obligatory military service .  
The incident was sparked when police stopped a pair of students from NTU and Taipei Teachers ' College for riding double on a bicycle . When the students proved uncooperative , the police beat and detained them , setting off a chain of events that eventually led to mass arrests by the military police .  
Frank , like James , was born in China , and had a deep emotional attachment to the country . He found it hard to understand and accept the tragic circumstances that befell Asia and was filled with inner spiritual turmoil . In 1946 , at the age of 26 , at a US military base near Hiroshima , Japan , he shot himself .  
Sadly , " because these grass-roots anti-Japanese movements had no clear political objectives and the fighters had no military training , the years of rebellion all came to naught , " says Chien Jhiung-jen , a professor of humanities at Providence University and author of the book The Taiwan People 's Party . From these bloody lessons , Taiwan 's gentry realized that there was no future in armed resistance , and so began the non-violent approach to challenging the colonial regime .  
Just after finishing his studies and completing his military service in 1985 , Hsu competed in a global trek around the globe sponsored by a local daily newspaper , the Independence Evening Post . After circling the globe , Hsu settled into the stable life of a salaryman . However , this adventurous spirit , who feels that sleeping in the wild is more comfortable than sleeping in a bed , seemed destined to return to the mountains , to the unpopulated wilds , and to the swift currents of the sea .  
" Players living in Taiwan have always been pretty keen to represent their country , " says Chinese Taipei head coach Hsu Sheng-ming . " Players who take the top three spots on the team can earn exemption from military service and a substantial award from the central government . In addition to these practical matters , in every stage of training the players are instilled with strong ideas about pursuing honor for their country . "  
Fortunately , both Kinmen and Matsu undeniably possess rich tourism assets . Kinmen offers an aggregation of overseas emigrant culture , historic front-line military sights , and Southern Fujianese culture . Matsu , on the other hand , has intact communities of Eastern Fujianese style architecture and a rare species of tern . The larger question , though , is where and how do Kinmen and Matsu best fit in ?  
" Hard " thinking , based on military aggression and economic hegemony , has long dominated the fate and historical development of mankind , several times leading the world to the brink of extinction . Therefore Lu placed special emphasis on the spirit of cooperation and sharing , on " soft thinking " that can lead to win-win situations , pluralism , and mutual coexistence and prosperity . She urged that the Pacific be managed as a " soft ocean " of sustainable development .  
Rebellious spirit and modern Taiwanese literature aside , Mt . Pakua and the Changhua Big Buddha are the most common images people have of Changhua . Mt . Pakua in particular , thanks to its featuring in history so prominently , and the number of stories it 's involved in : rebelling against the Qing dynasty , fighting the Japanese , being the site of a military base . . . the peak , over 400 meters above sea level , features in many a heroic tale .

Based on these logistical factors , the existing UNOSOM aircraft fleet is not sufficient to meet current military and humanitarian requirements within Somalia .  
The traditional concept of security , focused primarily on the security of States and based mainly on military components , should be replaced by a broader concept that includes social , economic , environmental , cultural , religious and ethical aspects .  
These estimates provide for a total of 354 military observers , 6,226 military contingent personnel ( out of an authorized level of 6,625 ) , 128 civilian police observers , 243 international civilian staff , 200 United Nations Volunteers and 500 local staff .

In addition , military countermine techniques are intended for dealing with landmines laid in accordance with established practices and are less effective when faced with randomly laid mines , as is common in internal conflicts .  
With a downward trend in global military spending and an increased reliance upon lighter arms in situations of actual conflict , the technological base for more sophisticated weapon systems is getting narrower .  
A military that has ultimate allegiance to the Constitution and other laws of the land , and to the democratic Government , and is trained in and committed to the principles of human rights and humanitarian law attending legitimate military duties ;

If the cries of the maimed and killed , their families and friends could be heard , they would demand effective action from responsible and complacent Governments , callous people and the indifferent military .  
The need to develop innovative material for use at the primary and secondary school levels , within universities and in professional training , especially for the judiciary , law enforcement officials , the military , and medical and social workers ;  
This backstopping covers operational , political , military , humanitarian , legal , logistical , financial , personnel and other administrative aspects of peacekeeping operations .  
Calls upon all States to take urgent , effective measures to terminate all collaboration with the racist regime of South Africa , in particular in the military and nuclear fields , and to refrain from entering into other relations which run counter to the maintenance of existing sanctions against the regime in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and of the Organization of African Unity ;  
Noting with grave concern the extensive links and collaboration between the apartheid regime of South Africa and certain countries in the political , diplomatic , economic , nuclear , military and other fields , and the growing military and nuclear cooperation between racist Pretoria and Israel ,  
Condemns the extensive links and collaboration between the apartheid regime of South Africa and certain countries in the political , diplomatic , economic , nuclear , military and other fields , and the growing military and nuclear cooperation between the racist regime and Israel ;  
But this sharing of experience and this programme of cooperation , as pointed out in the Managua Declaration and the Plan of Action , must transcend the sphere of conceptual criteria and value judgements on the democratic system and freedom , as opposed to totalitarian and authoritarian regimes , of the left or of the right , fundamentalist or religious , or merely the result of military or populist ambitions . 
In view of the increasing use of United Nations peace-keeping operations in support of humanitarian activities , the High Commissioner recognized the need for improved understanding , new doctrines and operational procedures , and new mutually advantageous systems for coordination between UNHCR and the military .  
The view was expressed that an international legal regime dealing with issues related to the dual use of military satellites and non-discriminatory access to the information obtained from such satellites should be elaborated and that such an instrument would promote the peaceful uses of outer space and the maintenance of outer space for peaceful purposes .  
By its resolution 46 / 36 H , entitled " International arms transfers " , the General Assembly , inter alia , called upon all States to give high priority to eradicating the illicit trade in all kinds of weapons and military equipment , a most disturbing and dangerous phenomenon often associated with terrorism , drug trafficking , organized crime and mercenary and other destabilizing activities , and to take urgent action towards that end , as recommended in the study submitted by the Secretary-General .  
The Committee regrets that the headquarters of the General Intelligence Department has been recognized as an official prison , that the armed forces officers are granted the capacity of public prosecutors , that they have the capacity of detaining suspects incommunicado , whether military persons or civilians , until the end of their interrogation for periods of up to six months , and that detainees are deprived of access to judges , lawyers or doctors .  
But in the final analysis the proper functioning and efficiency of the United Nations depend first and foremost on the political support that Member States , especially the most powerful , give to multilateralism , as well as the political , military and financial resources they are prepared to make available to international organizations .  
The commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations affords an opportunity for giving deep thought to finding the best means of facing up to the challenges of our times and to equipping our Organization with the military capability and material resources that would enable it to address problems at the international level with a single standard based on the principles of equality and justice .  
The global order can no longer be based solely on the special position of the anti-fascist coalition or the nuclear club , or on economic or military power ; rather , first and foremost , it should be based on the real contribution of individual countries to the prevention of every form of totalitarianism and to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; on their role within global socio-economic development ; on their democratic achievement ; and on their regional importance .  
Let us learn from our successes , as from our failures , by developing preventive diplomacy at the regional level and by increasing the rapid response capability of our Organization in the humanitarian and military spheres .  
In Singapore , compulsory national service in the military , police force or civil defence authorities has played an extremely important role in forging common links , fostering shared values and a sense of nationhood among young people from diverse backgrounds .  
Firstly , in the cultural and intellectual area , as it constitutes the vision which guides youth in all areas ; secondly , in the aesthetic field , art and literature are the essential pillars of culture ; thirdly , science as the basis of progress in our present generation which is witnessing growing scientific progress ; fourthly , sports and military fields ; fifthly , public social service , and finally , the field of trips and touristic activities and hostels .  
Another main reason for this failure is that the policies of major arms-producing countries designed to control the spread of weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons are always short-sighted and discriminatory and aim simultaneously at securing the destructive power of their own weaponry and their own military dominance .  
The United States itself has practised various types of terrorism against us , from the imposition of embargoes to military provocations in our territorial waters and overt aggression against our peaceful cities under the cover of darkness - let alone its sheltering of ungodly extremists trained in the United States to carry out acts of sabotage inside Libya , with the assistance of United States authorities . 
One can not forget that the historic changes of a few years ago those changes which finally , once and for all , sealed the fate of totalitarianism actually took place along a line of confrontation which kept Europe and the entire world divided into two opposing ideological and military camps for several decades . 
Is it not also an injustice that the veto power should continue to be valid even when it is used to consecrate acts of aggression , as happened 10 years ago , when it was used by a country that enjoys the privilege in trying to avoid condemnation for a treacherous military , air and naval attack against my country in the course of which hundreds of innocent people were killed and injured ? 
El Salvador experienced one of the most severe , complex and difficult crises in Central America in the second half of this century in the 1980s , to be precise , when a military and political conflict began and went on for 12 years .  
In the case of foreign military installations , we did hear some comments to the effect that the military installations were an important factor in local employment and the local economic situation , and that because of the decision to close or downsize some of them there were adverse consequences that some of the Territories were unable to face without adequate cooperation from the administering Powers . 
We urge the Special Committee to take very careful note of the documentation presented to it by Amnesty International , by other human rights groups and by East Timorese in exile , which details the ongoing human rights abuses in East Timor , such as torture , involuntary disappearances , maltreatment of political prisoners and extrajudicial killings .  The recent killing by the Indonesian military of 6 civilians in Liquica is but one example .  
In the context of our common endeavour we must encourage international cooperation in all possible uses of science and advanced technology for both military and civilian purposes so-called dual-use through the transfer and exchange of scientific and technical know-how for the peaceful purposes of promoting sustainable development and the preservation of international security .  
In addition , the European Union adopted , on 18 September , a common position with the aim of fostering the adoption of a new protocol on blinding lasers , which satisfies the humanitarian concern to avoid unnecessary suffering without limiting the legitimate military use of lasers .  
The European Union takes note of the progress made during the first part of the Review Conference , held in Vienna from 25 September to 13 October , with the adoption of a new Protocol IV on blinding laser weapons , which responds to humanitarian concerns to avoid unnecessary suffering without limiting the legitimate military use of lasers .  
I fully agree with the view expressed by the representative of Spain that , in all probability , it is on the regional level that increased confidence and greater transparency in military matters have the most significant , positive effects , especially as far as conventional weaponry is concerned .  
Greater transparency in military matters and the nurturing of confidence between States are the key elements required for bringing about the regional and global stability which would contribute to reducing excessive and illegal trade in conventional weapons .  
Similarly , my delegation feels it necessary to point out that security in the Latin American region is also closely linked to the process of economic and social development and , hence , the need for integral plans for regional security which spell out the social , economic , humanitarian and environmental aspects alongside the military issues . 
An end to military rivalry , foreign occupation and feelings of racial superiority would be conducive to a world free of poverty and injustice , in which relationships would become more democratic , humane and stable .  
The months immediately preceding December last year marked such a deterioration in the political and security situation in Liberia that the number of military observers of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia ( UNOMIL ) had to be drastically reduced , the humanitarian situation worsened , and the area controlled by the Military Observer Group of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOMOG ) effectively became limited to no more than 15 per cent of the country . 
We consider that the countries that are participating in ECOWAS and in the ECOWAS Military Observer Group ( ECOMOG ) are playing a key role in preventing Liberia from sliding into complete military and political anarchy and in preventing the breakup of the country which , without any doubt , would have serious negative consequences for the entire region .  
At its 93rd plenary meeting , on 20 December 1994 , the General Assembly decided to defer consideration of the agenda item entitled " Declaration of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity on the aerial and naval military attack against the Socialist People 's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya by the present United States Administration in April 1986 " and to include it in the provisional agenda of its fiftieth session . 
As peace and security are closely interlinked with political , economic and social development , including democracy and the realization of human rights world wide , crisis management should consist of an adequate combination of diplomatic , military , legal , economic , environmental and social measures of stabilization .  
In his 4 November 1994 report ( paras . 79-86 ) , the Special Rapporteur concluded , inter alia , that Bosnian Serb de facto authorities continued to be responsible for large-scale violations of human rights and , both directly and indirectly , for displacement of people from areas under their control , for systematic military attacks on civilians in the " safe areas " and elsewhere , and for grave disruption of humanitarian aid and medical evacuation programmes .  
Undertake to explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction in excessive military expenditures including global military expenditures and arms trade , investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development ;  
Although the democratic Government had been elected by a sizable majority , opposition forces had controlled the Senate because it included nine senators appointed by the outgoing military regime .  
At a time when national security should be seen more and more in the context of military and political stability at the regional and international levels , the time had come to apply the principle of undiminished security at the lowest level of armaments .  
In this context , my Government wishes to emphasize the need for the quick deployment of UNAVEM III , because it alone as we all know will bear responsibility for the quartering , disarming and selection of UNITA troops that are to be integrated into the unified national army of Angola and for the demobilization of the excess military personnel that will be reintegrated into civilian life after receiving vocational training .  
My delegation is particularly grateful to the Secretary-General for his excellent report ( S / 1995 / 97 ) , dated 1 February 1995 , which has provided valuable insights into the continuing problems in Angola in the political , military , civil and humanitarian spheres .  
Broad parliamentary support would be required to change the legal situation , especially in view of strong opposition from the Catholic Church , whose moral authority had been enhanced by its defence of human rights under the military dictatorship .  
The Secretary-General , in his peacemaking initiative and in close consultation with the Security Council , sent to Tajikistan a small integrated United Nations unit of political , military and humanitarian officers to monitor the situation on the ground , provide liaison services and constitute a ground core for any possible more extensive United Nations participation in the regional efforts in Tajikistan in the future .  
Needless to say , the tragic events triggered by the military coup d ' \ x { 5f4b } at during the night of 20-21 October 1993 can not be viewed in isolation ; they should be considered in the light of their historical , political , economic and social background .  
It was not possible to set up or put into operation the national state security council because those who were to be members had declined and the rebels came up against the unanimous condemnation and firm demands on the part of the political , moral , social and even military forces calling for a return to constitutional legality . 
In that regard , the mission proposes that a legal expert , a military expert and an administrative expert , all highly qualified and having considerable experience in their respective fields , should be appointed to assist the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in his mission .  
In order to counter the instability posed by the production and proliferation of weapons , women 's non-governmental organizations have called for reductions in military expenditures world wide and for the elimination of the international weapons trade , questioning the morality of a militaristic culture and armed conflict as a means of resolving disagreements .  
By 21 February , a total of 211 international staff members from 36 countries had joined the Mission , comprising 111 substantive staff , of whom 72 are United Nations Volunteers , 60 administrative and logistical support staff , 10 military liaison officers and 30 civilian police observers .  
With regard to the possibility that special laws or exclusive jurisdictions could be invoked to uphold impunity in respect of human rights violations , a careful study has begun of Guatemalan domestic legislation , with special reference to the military criminal justice system and the identification of cases in which the functioning of this special system could promote impunity .  
Any armed attack on the civilian population is obviously prohibited , and that prohibition does not end even if the indirect aim is to achieve military objectives , unless there is a pressing military need and , at the same time , a certain proportionality between the military objective to be achieved and the expected and foreseeable harm which may be caused to the civilian population .  
In this context , it would be desirable to separate the police function from the military function and to have a police body with sufficient technical and operational training to carry out its activity in a spirit of respect for human rights , and for such a body to have greater human and material resources so that it can operate in rural areas and perform its irreplaceable functions . 
Such actions affecting private property or public utilities designed to meet the needs of the civilian population involve a high degree of risk for civilians and can not be justified as legitimate military operations .  
These confidence-building measures , which could lead to an informal suspension of offensive military operations , would constitute a demonstration of good will aimed at alleviating the suffering of the civilian population in areas affected by the armed confrontation , protecting human rights and facilitating the work of MINUGUA as well as all national entities devoted to the protection and promotion of human rights . 
With regard to military operations , until such time as a cease-fire is agreed to and takes effect , URNG insists on the commitment to respect the provisions of the comprehensive agreement on human rights intended to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population , protect human rights and facilitate the work of MINUGUA and of all national bodies devoted to the protection and promotion of human rights and the rights deriving from international humanitarian law .  
Bioremediation of polluted groundwater , technologies for containing pollution , biological methods of treating pollution in the unsaturated zone above groundwaters contaminated by past industrial and military activities , and the treatment of extracted contaminated soil are among the topics of the regional ECE Seminar on the Prevention and Control of Groundwater Pollution to be held in September 1995 .  
The cost estimate also makes provision for pending claims by civilian and military personnel for lost personal effects as a result of the civil war ( $ 500,000 ) , of which an amount of $ 375,000 has been brought forward from the previous mandate period .  
Also condemns in the strongest terms the kidnapping and killing of military peace-keeping personnel attached to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda , the killing of personnel attached to humanitarian organizations operating in the country , the wanton killing of innocent civilians and the destruction of property during the conflict , which constitute a blatant violation of international humanitarian law ;  
Being aware that the Hague meetings addressed general military considerations for the operation of UNPROFOR and believing that a continuing evaluation is desirable to provoke also a more forward-looking analysis not necessarily constrained by the lowest common denominator ,  
Deeply concerned further by the increasingly severe and grave violations of human rights by the Government of Iraq against the civilian population in southern Iraq , in particular in the southern marshes , where the combination of massive drainage projects and wide-ranging military operations on the part of the Government of Iraq has forced residents of the marshes to flee in large numbers , many of whom have sought refuge on the border between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran ,  
Also expresses special alarm at the grave violations of human rights in southern Iraq , and urges the Government of Iraq to implement without further delay the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur , including , inter alia , the immediate halting and reversal of the draining of the marshes and the cessation of its military activities against the marsh Arabs , whose survival as a community is endangered ;  
The notion of " economic integration " in fact implies specific and obvious political and legal consequences , particularly when it is linked to the continuation of the military occupation and the total political dependence of the Cypriot territories in question on Ankara .  
The progress report focused on prerequisites of learning from experience with United Nations peace-keeping operations , and on the status of a ready capacity to act for six substantive components of complex missions : information , electoral , repatriation , human rights , civilian police and military .  
The three political , military or humanitarian functions can be carried out in integrated and unified operations , provided that there are clearly established modalities of cooperation , including information sharing , transparency , joint planning and logistics ;  
The travel costs of military and civilian personnel to the mission area on assignment , rotation or repatriation have been estimated at an average of $ 2,000 per person one way , or $ 4,000 round trip ( basic air fare of $ 1,000 , plus 100 kilogrammes of unaccompanied baggage and travel allowances at $ 1,000 ) .  The cost of a round-trip travel on a three-day official mission to New York is estimated at $ 1,400 ( $ 700 basic airfare and $ 700 in allowances and daily subsistence allowance ) .  
Further areas of concern related to biological weapons , new types of weapons of mass destruction , radiological weapons , limitation and reduction of conventional weapons and international arms transfers , the prevention of an arms race in outer space , curbing the naval arms race , naval armaments and disarmament , and reduction of military budgets .  
Discussion at the United Nations focused on issues such as limitations on conventional weapons ; transparency in international arms transfers and arms production ; curbing the illicit traffic in conventional arms ; transparency in military expenditures ; inhumane weapons and the Convention restricting their use ; and , recently , regulation of the transfer of technology with military applications .  
In the Final Declaration , adopted by consensus , the Conference reaffirmed the strong common interest of the States parties in preventing the use of environmental modification techniques for military or any other hostile purposes and confirmed that the obligations assumed under the ENMOD Convention had been faithfully observed .  
An understanding was reached that military or any other hostile use of herbicides as an environmental modification technique was a method of warfare prohibited by the Convention if such use of herbicides upset the ecological balance of the region , thus causing widespread , long-lasting or severe effects as a means of destruction , damage or injury to any State party .  
The possibility of reducing the huge financial , material and human resources devoted to the military sector and reallocating part of them to the civilian sector of national economies has been the object of deliberations within the framework of the United Nations for over three decades .  
Travel costs for the military and civilian personnel have been calculated on the basis of the following travel rates : ( a ) for repatriation of military contingent personnel , by group travel arrangements , at a rate of $ 540 per person ; and ( b ) for international civilian personnel , by commercial arrangements , at a rate of $ 3,500 per person one way or $ 7,000 round trip , inclusive of the entitlement for excess unaccompanied baggage .  
In addition to its introduction and my concluding observations , the report includes seven sections , devoted respectively to military aspects ; public security aspects ; human rights , the judicial system and the Commission on the Truth ; electoral matters ; economic and social issues ; financial aspects ; and administrative aspects .  
There has been a manipulation of social demands ; a campaign to discredit new State institutions , particularly the National Civil Police ; a rise in common crime typical of post-war situations ; and isolated but persistent calls for a growing military role which could undermine the credibility and authority of the National Civil Police and the political system as a whole .  
The world 's less powerful countries and those of lesser political , military and economic influence have thus become wary of the exploitation of global humanitarian principles and objectives to serve the purposes of some parties rather than others .  
Despite numerous reminders about the Geneva Conventions and calls upon Serbian military and political leadership to halt and reverse their practice of ethnic cleansing , these crimes continue as cited by your report of 22 March 1995 , abated only by the rapidly decreasing number of potential human victims . 
As a country that is a frequent target for international terrorists and narcotics traffickers , the United States is properly concerned that the work of an international criminal court not compromise important , complex and costly investigations carried out by its criminal , justice or military authorities .  28 .  For the most part , neither drug crimes nor crimes of terrorism occur as isolated criminal acts .  
Despite the numerous reminders citing the Geneva Conventions and the calls upon the Serbian military and political leadership to halt and reverse their practice of ethnic cleansing , these crimes continue , abated only by the rapidly decreasing number of potential human victims as is , in fact , pointed out in the Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } report of 22 March 1995 .  
Both the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb authorities must exercise the maximum restraint and must realize once and for all that there can be no military solution to the conflict , only a comprehensive political solution such as will restore the peaceful coexistence of the various ethnic , cultural and religious components that have lived together in Bosnia and Herzegovina for centuries .  
Estimates for activities ranging from water purification and storage to the number of civilian and military personnel required for the Mission and infrastructure repairs were excessive ; in that regard she fully shared the concerns expressed and the recommendations put forward by the Advisory Committee in paragraphs 24 , 34 , 39 and 42 of its report .  
Accusations , such as producing and stockpiling chemical weapons and trying to develop nuclear weapons and building up conventional arms , are concocted apparently in order to frighten Iran 's neighbours , justify an illegitimate foreign military presence in the Persian Gulf , and impose a costly and unnecessary arms sale to the countries of the region .  
The ninth report of the Human Rights Division , issued in September 1993 , emphasized that the increase in crime was linked to non-implementation or delayed or incomplete implementation of the agreements : " [ Firstly ] , the failure to confiscate military weapons in the hands of the civilian population . . . 
In a whole range of areas , there is no halt to military actions , in clear violation of the agreements of 21 and 31 December last year between the Bosnian parties on a cease-fire and on a complete cessation of hostilities .  The situation is being aggravated by attempted offensives from the Government forces and by disproportionate responses from the Bosnian Serbs , including acts against the civilian population which is absolutely inadmissible .  
Since then , the country has removed strategic and tactical nuclear weapons , closed scores of bases and demobilized many thousands of military personnel , transferring to local authorities the responsibility of providing them with housing and basic services .  
In his statement before the Special Political and Decolonization Committee ( Fourth Committee ) on 28 October 1994 , 4 / in explanation of vote on the draft decision on the question of St . Helena , the representative of the United Kingdom stated that , as in previous years , the draft decision was unacceptable to his Government because it mentioned military facilities on Ascension , an island which , although linked to St . Helena for administrative reasons , was not included in the Committee 's agenda .  
Despite an almost total information blockade and the restriction of the movement of representatives of international organizations by the Croatian side under various pretexts , foreign media have managed to inform the world public about some of the atrocities and the systematic drive of the Croatian military and civilian authorities to erase the traces of these atrocities by burning the dead , burying them in unmarked mass graves or by washing the streets and roads to remove the evidence .  
On 4 March 1995 , at 1000 hours , a khaki-coloured Iraqi bus , carrying 45 military forces wearing khaki , was observed travelling from west to east , at a distance of 2 kilometres from the geographic coordinates of PB 152-478 on the map of south of Mehran , in no man 's land , between east of border pillar 27 / 7B and west of border pillar 27 / 8 .  
In the Mission 's view , the laying of mines in places where people work , live or circulate constitutes a violation of this commitment and of the principles of international humanitarian law , since it puts the civilian population at unnecessary risk and there is no proportionality between the intended military objective and the foreseeable harm that may be caused to that population . 
The prudent action of the military authorities , who were aware of the guerrilla presence in the city and promptly informed MINUGUA , postponing the arrival of army troops at those points until after the URNG forces had withdrawn , avoided an armed confrontation that could have seriously endangered numerous civilians .  
The Mission believes that URNG has committed human rights violations and has failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population , by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting the " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines or explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals . 
As regards the assurances given by Mr . Batu that Turkey does not harbour any designs or territorial ambitions against Greece or any of its neighbours and without going into any historic retrospection that would give ample and eloquent proof of Turkey 's traditional performance in the broader area of the Balkans and the Middle East , suffice it to recall the notorious contemporary case of the military invasion and ongoing occupation of Cyprus .  
After nearly three years of civil strife , marked by increasing violence , corruption , and near-total devastation of the country 's social and economic infrastructure , the military general , Raoul Cedras , under strong threat of outside military intervention sanctioned by the United Nations , returned the legitimate authority of the Government of Haiti peacefully to its democratically elected president , Jean-Bertrand Aristide .  
However , the United States Administration , together with the south Korean puppet army , has , since 1976 , staged " team spirit " joint military exercises against us each year , mobilizing nuclear weapons instead of coming to the talks , and even cancelled the already proclaimed reduction plan of American troops in south Korea , in July 1979 .  
The strengthening of the offensive capabilities of the Turkish occupation forces in Cyprus , coupled with the completion of extensive fortifications all along the buffer zone , are indicative of the real intentions of Turkey in Cyprus : that is , the imposition of a military solution , something to which Turkey resorts with utter contempt to international law and civilized behaviour .  
International security must be identical for all States in all its dimensions : military and political , social and economic , scientific and technical and humanitarian .  
To the contrary , recent developments in eastern and western Bosnia and Herzegovina offer ample proof that the Belgrade Government and , specifically Mr . Milo \ x { ea92 } vi _ , has not only failed to influence the so-called Croatian and Bosnian Serbs positively , but has effectively encouraged them to intensify their military option and ethnic cleansing .  
Faced with the joint and highly coordinated offensive military activities of the Croatian and Bosnian Serbs , and the growing interference of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , the Republic of Croatia presented the Croatian Serb leaders with a clear choice : to accept immediately the principles of peaceful reintegration or face police and military action aimed at restoring Croatian sovereignty over its occupied territories .  
We call upon the authorities in Zagreb to hold inviolate the civil and human rights of the local Serb population and to treat all prisoners of war in accordance with accepted standards of international law governing the rights of military personnel in conflict situations .  
The report also noted that URNG had committed human rights violations and had failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines and explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals . 
There have also been infamous cases in which State intelligence authorities or security forces , opposition groups , armed domestic resistance movements or criminal organizations hire mercenaries to engage in illegal actions such as forming paramilitary forces for purposes of repression , organizing death squads or providing military protection for illicit drug trafficking , smuggling or arms trafficking .  
The Code , reaffirming the continuing validity of the comprehensive concept of security , set politically binding norms and principles guiding the role of armed forces in democratic societies and the relation , among States as well as the relations of States vis - - vis their nationals in the military field .  
These settlors need not only represent recognized legal experts in international military / peace / security issues , but also those having expertise in economic , social and cultural relations where disputes are most often the root cause of all disastrous conflicts .  
Total arms expenditure , including money spent on developing advanced technologies for military purposes , has absorbed considerable human , material and financial resources .  
There seems to be a common understanding among the above States that bilateral CSBMs , once agreed , should lead to greater transparency in military activities , thus having a stabilizing effect , especially in border areas , and stimulating contacts between the military of the respective States at the lowest possible level .  
Military doctrines of the States in the region should be exclusively defensive and in all respects adapted to the international agreements on restricted use of military force and non-use of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons ;  
Recommends that the Commission to be appointed by the Secretary-General be composed of five to ten impartial and internationally respected persons , including legal , military and police experts , under the Chairmanship of an eminent person , and assisted by the appropriate support staff ;

In current conflicts , peace-keeping operations may benefit from using modern technologies to gather information ( weight , heat and infra-red remote-sensing devices ) , to detect and defuse mines ( infra-red , ground-penetrating radar ) , to improve communications and inter-operability among multinational United Nations forces , to equip blue helmets with more effective military means while causing a minimum of damage to humans , and to assist in humanitarian efforts .  
Growing stocks of surplus fissile material from the military sector and growing amounts of plutonium in civilian fuel cycles make accountancy and control an urgent task of paramount importance .  
In addition , the component 's task is to monitor the activities of the existing police forces , so as to ensure that they are acting in strict accordance with the plan , which is intended to secure the organization of a free and fair referendum without military or administrative constraints and to prevent any possibility of intimidation or interference from any quarter .  
In 1994 , the Special Committee , in keeping with its consistent goal of limiting documentation and streamlining its report to the General Assembly , recommended to the Assembly that in preparing the general working papers on the Territories , the Secretariat should , where applicable , incorporate under separate headings those sections relating to foreign economic and other interests and those on military activities and arrangements on those Territories .

A special effort was made to bring to the Conference experts from industry , public and private , and to emphasize the practical issues and options of the conversion process .  The subjects covered included the nuclear industry , military machines , shipbuilding , electronics , aeronautical and aerospace industries , information , intellectual property and international cooperation .  
It aims at training senior managers of Chinese military enterprises for conversion to production of civilian goods for the domestic and world markets , and facilitating joint ventures by bringing together major domestic and international investors from the private sector in the most attractive and committed Chinese enterprises .  
Include information about international and regional instruments and standards in their public information and human rights education activities and in adult education and training programmes , particularly for groups such as the military , the police and other law enforcement personnel , the judiciary , and legal and health professionals to ensure that human rights are effectively protected ;  
Undertake to explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures , trade in arms and investment in arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to permit the possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development , in particular for the advancement of women ;  
The Croatian Army , which is operating in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the express request of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina , and consistent with international law and within the framework of the bilateral agreement signed between the two respective Governments , will end its limited military activities in the area in the shortest time possible .  
The Turkish invasion of northern Iraq was accompanied by flagrant violations committed by the invading forces through intensive utilization of weapons that were not commensurate with the number of those who were subjected to the military campaign , in which military aircraft and heavy military equipment were used , causing great damage to property and killing Iraqi Kurdish citizens .

We always believe that however complicated a dispute between States or an internal conflict in a country may be , we should encourage the parties concerned to seek peaceful solutions through negotiation and dialogue , for this is the only right and effective way to a comprehensive and durable settlement .  The practices of imposing sanctions , using military force or even expanding a war in order to stop it are not conducive to a settlement .  
NULLWhile one reason the abuses , human rights violations or crimes allegedly committed by military commissioners and members of CVDCs , whether for political or general reasons , continue is that the people are afraid to say anything , the main reason they continue is that , in much of Guatemala the institutions responsible for maintaining public order and administering justice either do not exist or are very weak . 
While there is no evidence to suggest that the attack was formally sanctioned or approved by military commanders either at the most senior level or locally , it is hard to believe that so many men could have become involved without the knowledge of the local commander .  
NULLThe events described above , coupled with other political and military developments within the Republic of Croatia and the contiguous territories of the former Yugoslavia , as well as the frequently declared intention of the Croatian authorities to recover lost territories by other means if negotiations did not succeed , made it very difficult to resume meaningful negotiations and bring them to a successful conclusion .  
Throughout 1995 , field officers have continued to travel from commune to commune meeting with civil , judicial and military authorities and local populations to learn about the general conditions of each commune , including security , access to property , the material needs and the functioning of the judiciary , conditions of detention centres and alleged human rights violations .  
The offensive in western Bosnia , whose ultimate goal is the seizure of Prijedor and Banja Luka , is continuing unabated despite the demands of the Security Council contained in the presidential statement of 12 October 1995 ( S / PRST / 1995 / 52 ) , that all parties fully comply with the provisions of the cease-fire agreement and refrain from any military activity that could seriously jeopardize the peace process . 
Another basic theme of the regional programme is support for the economic and social reintegration of former combatants , demobilized military personnel and wounded victims of war and conflicts in the subregion , who are covered by specific peace agreements . 
The continuing plundering of the cultural heritage of the Greek Cypriots and the changing demographic structure of the area under Turkish military occupation through massive importation of settlers were two additional characteristics of the unacceptable situation created in Cyprus through the force of arms .  
Similarly on the point of occupation , the General Assembly concluded that , " in particular , [ the activities of ] the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) . . . aimed at achieving the integration of the occupied territories of Croatia into the administrative , military , educational , transportation and communication systems of the Federal Republic are illegal , null and void , and must cease immediately " .  
It is anticipated that one of the areas to be developed is joint peace-keeping seminars , co-sponsored by national staff colleges and the United Nations , with a view to increasing general knowledge and understanding of peace-keeping for mid-level and senior military and civilian officers .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
It is clear that continuous Croatian threats , sabre rattling and persistent military provocations , as well as the deployment of great number of Croatian troops in the contiguous territories of Srem and Baranja , are not a way to overcome major outstanding problems in a satisfactory manner , i.e . , by peaceful means and through political negotiations .  
Noting that the peace dividend has not materialized in the form of additional financial flows to developing countries , and expressing the need for the reallocation by developed countries of resources freed from military purposes arising from the end of the Cold War towards productive development purposes in support of existing international commitments for development ,  
To supplement premises provided by the Government of Angola under the terms of the status-of-forces agreement , and taking into account the total number of military and civilian personnel of the Verification Mission , UNAVEM requires the continued rental of additional premises for residential and office accommodation at Mission headquarters at Luanda and at six regional headquarters .  
Taking into account the vast area of the country , its ravaged infrastructure and the total number of military and civilian personnel to be mobilized throughout the Mission area , the services of these aircraft are considered essential in accomplishing the operational requirements of the Mission .  
Also noting that despite the positive developments in the political and military situation in Angola , the economic , social and humanitarian situation remains dire , and reaffirming both the importance of and the need for a continued and effective United Nations presence in promoting a negotiated settlement in Angola with a view to fostering the peace process ,  
The Security Council further recommended that the Commission be appointed by the Secretary-General and be composed of 5 to 10 impartial and internationally respected persons , including legal , military and police experts , under the chairmanship of an eminent person , and assisted by the appropriate support staff .  
The massive exodus of almost the entire Serb population from Krajina and western Slavonia , preceded by the previous exodus of over 300,000 Serb population from Croatia outside Krajina , as well as military intervention of the regular units of the Croatian army in Western Bosnia served the purpose of the current leadership of Croatia to create " Greater Croatia " , i.e . , an ethnically pure State without the Serbs .  
While welcoming the thoughtful use of military assets by UNHCR in relief operations , and other innovative solutions , his delegation was firmly convinced that violators of humanitarian law should be held individually responsible .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
Upon inquiry , the Committee was informed that contractual arrangements with the military supplier of helicopters proved to be more economical than budgeted ; instead of contracting for a minimum number of hours per month , plus making provisions for additional hours , payments were made on the basis of actual helicopter hours used . 
The Council recommended that the Commission be appointed by the Secretary-General and be composed of 5 to 10 impartial and internationally respected persons , including legal , military and police experts , under the chairmanship of an eminent person , and assisted by the appropriate support staff .  
Governments bore the primary responsibility for formulating appropriate strategies , policies , programmes and actions to combat poverty ; the effort required sound macroeconomic policies , structural changes and the mobilization of domestic resources , inter alia , through more equitable tax regimes and a reduction in military expenditures .  
Condemns further violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including killings , the burning and looting of houses , the shelling of residential areas , harassment of and attacks on refugees , the elderly and the infirm perpetrated by members of the Croatian Armed Forces and civilians in the formerly Serb-controlled regions of Croatia during and subsequent to the military operations there in August 1995 ;  
pointed out that the resolution mentioned above had been adopted on an initiative of the Sudan , motivated by its concern for the situation of more than 20,000 children who had been sequestered by the insurgent movement in the south of the country , which used them as explosives carriers , human shields in minefields and as a military reserve , a situation which was intolerable since it violated religious and humane principles .  
with interest that the Government of Nigeria , on 1 October 1995 , affirmed the principle of multi-party democracy , announcing its intent to accept the principle of power-sharing , lift the ban on political activity and the press , devolve power to local levels of government and subordinate the military to civilian authority , but disappointed that only limited action in this regard has followed ,  
the global level , it was pushing for a ban on anti-personnel land-mines , an optional protocol to the Convention raising to 18 the minimum age of recruitment into armed forces , and a reordering of priorities away from military spending towards investment in human development .  
On 24 November , at border crossing point Sremska Raca , a Mission team 's local female interpreter was harassed in the ladies room by an intoxicated individual wearing a military uniform .  
noting that despite the positive developments in the political and military situation in Angola , the economic , social and humanitarian situation remains dire , and reaffirming both the importance of and the need for a continued and effective United Nations presence in promoting a negotiated settlement in Angola with a view to fostering the peace process ,  
Provision for two military observers and 14 temporary posts authorized for OSGA in 1995 ( one-D-2 , one P-5 , two Field Service , one General Service and nine local-level posts ) and an additional three posts : one at the Field Service level for a Communications Officer and two local-level posts , one for a vehicle and generator mechanic and one for an administrative assistant ;

considered the complexities of the situation described above , and based on a careful analysis by my military advisers , I am convinced that a mechanized division of two brigades , with combat capability , air support and a strong mobile , armoured reserve , would be required .  
the absence of precise information concerning the operational requirements of each mission , the cost estimates have been based on the average cost per person per day of military personnel and civilian police derived from the commitment authorization of $ 115,373,000 gross ( $ 113,866,300 net ) provided by the General Assembly for the month of December 1995 .  
Condemns in the strongest terms all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict , recognizing that the leadership in territories under the control of Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and formerly Serb-held areas of the Republic of Croatia , the commanders of Serb paramilitary forces and political and military leaders in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) bear primary responsibility for most of those violations , and that persons who commit such acts will be held personally responsible and accountable ;  
Further condemns violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including killings , the burning and looting of houses , the shelling of residential areas , harassment of and attacks on refugees , the elderly and the infirm perpetrated by members of the Croatian armed forces and civilians in the formerly Serb-controlled regions of Croatia during and subsequent to the military operations there in August 1995 ;  
gravely concerned , however , at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including killings of civilians , arbitrary arrest and detention , restrictions on freedoms of expression and association , torture , forced labour , forced portering , human rights abuses in border areas in the course of military operations , forced relocations and development projects , abuse of women and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
with interest that the Government of Nigeria , on 1 October 1995 , affirmed the principle of multi-party democracy , announcing its intent to accept the principle of power-sharing , lift the ban on political activity and the press , devolve power to local levels of government and subordinate the military to civilian authority , but disappointed that only limited action in this regard has followed ,  
flow of men and mat �� iel , not to mention the direct involvement of the military leaders of the former Republic of Yugoslavia , played a very important role in the brutal and criminal overrunning of the safe areas , in contravention of all the Security Council resolutions on the matter , and led to the exodus of tens of thousands of civilians and the liquidation of thousands of unarmed men and boys .  
the past year , there had been increasing reports of slavery and forced labour of women and children belonging to racial , ethnic and religious minorities ; of atrocities against indigenous peoples ; of indiscriminate aerial bombardments against civilian targets , and of unaccompanied minors being conscripted into military service .  
In 1994 , the Special Committee , in keeping with its consistent goal of limiting documentation and streamlining its report to the General Assembly , recommended to the Assembly that in preparing the general working papers on the Territories , the Secretariat should , where applicable , incorporate under separate headings those sections relating to foreign economic and other interests and those on military activities and arrangements on those Territories .

Amid all these problems , the Government of National Unity installed on 19 July 1994 was faced with the daunting challenge of rehabilitating and rebuilding a war-ravaged economy , reviving the provision of basic social services to a traumatized population , coping with the wreckage of genocide , stabilizing a fragile political alliance , and consolidating internal peace and security , as well as warding off looming military threats from exiled soldiers of the former regime .  
They have been declared entirely subordinate to the political Constitution as an apolitical , non-partisan , non-deliberative body obedient to civil authority ; mandatory military service has also been abolished .  
Through its current operation Israel has demonstrated once again its utter contempt for Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) , as well the Charter provisions and principles of international law governing relations between States . My delegation regards this military action , which has brought about scores of casualties among the civilian population , particularly among women and children , as unconscionable . 
However much some might try to justify the Israeli military actions , these international criteria are not applicable to the repeated , massive attacks against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon , nor against innocent unarmed civilians in Lebanon .  
In conclusion , while looking forward to the achievement of a genuine , permanent and peaceful settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict , my Government is hopeful that the international community will take a firm stand against the Israeli military aggression in the area .  
These settlors need not only represent recognized legal experts in international military / peace / security issues , but also those having expertise in economic , social and cultural relations where disputes are most often the root cause of all disastrous conflicts .  
The mechanisms must have a unified and clearly defined command and control structure ensuring the orderly and effective discharge of the mandate assigned to them , and precise coordination of the political , military , humanitarian , civilian and administrative components of any activity must be ensured ;  
We share the view that today the notion of security has undergone a radical transformation and includes an entire set of equally important political , economic , environmental , social , military and other components .  
If power politics are allowed to be deployed in the pursuit of exclusive and narrow interests in a climate of confrontation , if the world 's resources are shared on the basis of military power rather than of international treaties and conventions , if priority is not given to international law and international cooperation , and if we attempt to evade the responsibilities that we have all undertaken under the Charter , however appealing and convenient that might appear in the short term , we will sow the seeds of chaos , anarchy and rapid disintegration .  
The social and economic consequences of these conflicts have no parallel in contemporary history , but we can not simply pretend that military imposition , coercion and sanctions are a universal panacea that can solve the numerous humanitarian problems of the world .  
A sound early warning system , combining political , military , humanitarian , human rights and economic areas , would broaden the base of options and enhance the chances for success in the early detection of conflict situations .  An early international monitoring presence in itself has a major deterrent effect .  
In spite of obstructions and misinformation campaigns , the Islamic Republic of Iran has continued to articulate and pursue initiatives and measures aimed at fostering greater regional confidence ; enhancing respect for principles of international law ; bringing about transparency in armaments and reduction of military spending ; creating zones free from weapons of mass destruction ; strengthening peace and security through persistent endeavours to encourage and facilitate understanding and conciliation ; and consolidating economic cooperation .  
The situation is exacerbated by the disappointing results experienced by several countries in converting military production and in arms reduction when compliance with international commitments becomes a factor in diverting already meagre resources and funds from the urgent needs of economic development .  
In so doing , Japan deems it important to keep in mind in particular that in our present-day world , peace and stability can not be achieved and maintained solely on the basis of political and military factors , but that stable and durable peace can be realized only through efforts that take into account a wider perspective which comprises humanitarian concerns and social and economic reconstruction and development as well .  
In this sea of change in international relations , the whole concept of international security has increasingly moved away from the bipolar view , concerned largely with military security , to one which assigns a central role to sustainable development and the welfare of the individual .  
The occupation itself constituted the primary violation of the human rights of the civilian population and was the source of other violations and harsh practices by the occupying Israeli authorities , including closure and sealing of the occupied territories , land confiscation , the demolition of Palestinian homes , the detention of Palestinians , and the killing of Palestinians by military and undercover security forces .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
The Republic of Croatia , being cognizant that the overall peace process in the former Yugoslavia is at a delicate stage and being fully determined to contribute to peace and stability in the region , would support a continued deployment of United Nations military observers in the area of the Prevlaka peninsula in Croatia , with an understanding that such deployment shall be a short-term interim arrangement , until , as proposed by my Government , the United Nations arrangement is replaced by a regional arrangement .  
Whereas in the past , neighbouring States had been wary of South Africa 's military strength , South Africa 's current deliberate policy of transparency and the concerted use of common resources to ensure regional stability should form the basis for fruitful cooperation between States in the future .  
KODELLAS ( Greece ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that for the past 21 years it had been indisputable that the Cyprus problem was a clear case of the violation of the territorial integrity , unity and sovereignty of an independent State , of massive human rights violations and of the artificial division of a country by military force . 
Although the Security Council meets far away from the scene of the events we are discussing today , and although we are not subject to the difficulties faced by the people in the field , I believe it is important that the personnel of the United Nations civilian and military should be aware of our solidarity with them and understanding of the difficult tasks and living conditions that they have to face .  
The establishment for an initial 12-month period of a major operation with a significant military contingent could , in our opinion , not only foster mutual trust and discourage any thoughts of outside interference , but also , generally speaking , ensure security throughout the region during the transitional period and oversee the demilitarization process . 
In welcoming the special envoy of the Secretary-General , Mrs . Sadako Ogata , United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , the Prime Minister went even further , and announced the mechanisms planned as a means to establishing permanent consultation on security measures between the military and civilian authorities concerned and the representatives of United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations .  
However , through our civil military cooperation ( CIMIC ) operations IFOR has established an effective mechanism to coordinate activities with the many international non-governmental and other civilian organizations contributing to the reconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
Military contingents , including military , technical and rear support units ( subunits ) , shall be fully supplied with weapons and military equipment , spare parts and military and technical supplies , and technical servicing , evacuation and repair components under schedules , tables and norms specially drawn up for them , taking into account the physical and geographical conditions of the region in which their tasks are carried out and in accordance with individual agreements .  
In addition , we are very concerned about the continued UNITA military activity in some regions of the country , in a pattern of military movement without prior notification to UNAVEM III and of isolated attacks and ambushes against civilian and military targets alike , almost always resulting in a loss of human life . 
My delegation believes the report provides us with important information regarding the political , military , humanitarian , financial , economic and social aspects of the situation in Angola , which , in our opinion , will prove invaluable to our discussion concerning the future of UNAVEM III .  
Expresses deep concern at the numerous delays in the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol , reminds the Government of Angola and UNITA of their obligations to consolidate the peace process and , in this regard , urges them to maintain an effective cease-fire , conclude their military talks on integration of the armed forces , undertake active engagement in the demining process , and commence the integration of UNITA personnel into administrative and governmental institutions in furtherance of the objective of national reconciliation ;

Hiding behind a " living shield " of members of the Government forces , they are continuing attacks which are compelling the command of the armed forces of the Republic of Tajikistan to abandon the positions occupied by it in order to avoid unjustified losses of life among military personnel and the civilian population .  
To establish or strengthen operational coordination machinery for the competent institutions so as to increase the effectiveness of national and regional efforts to combat crime and all threats to democratic security necessitating the use of military , security or civilian police forces , such as terrorism , illicit arms trafficking , drug trafficking and organized crime ;  
To provide information , within the Security Commission , on the respective military and public security expenditures approved in their budgets for the current fiscal year , taking as a reference the " Instrument for standardized international reporting of military expenditures " adopted by the United Nations on 12 December 1990 , under the provisions of article 52 ( k ) of this Treaty ; and ,  
To consider the information provided by the Governments on their respective military and security budgets for the current fiscal year and to elaborate joint proposals for the possible adaptation of future budgets , taking into account the internal situation of each State ;  
The permanent communications mechanism which the Parties undertake to establish and put into operation in order to facilitate secure , efficient and rapid communications among the respective competent civilian , military and public security authorities and between them and the Security Commission , with a view to preventing incidents , responding to alerts and contributing to the fulfilment of the objectives and obligations set forth in this Treaty . Article 61 .  
These resolutions , inter alia , demanded that the Government of the Republic of Croatia respect fully the rights of the local Serb population in the former Sectors following Croatia 's military operations , including their rights to remain , leave or return in safety , take urgent measures to put an end to all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights and investigate all reports of such violations so that those responsible for such acts be judged and punished .  
Also noting that despite the positive developments in the political and military situation in Angola , the economic , social and humanitarian situation remains dire , and reaffirming both the importance of and the need for a continued and effective United Nations presence in promoting a negotiated settlement in Angola with a view to fostering the peace process ,  
The mechanisms must have a unified and clearly defined command and control structure ensuring the orderly and effective discharge of the mandate assigned to them , and precise coordination of the political , military , humanitarian , civilian and administrative components of any activity must be ensured ;  
The United States is becoming more undisguised in its moves to build up a " tripartite military alliance " with Japan and south Korea , and moves forward on a full scale with the reintroduction of its cold war era policy to the Korean peninsula and its vicinity , by repeatedly launching joint military exercises among the United States , south Korea and Japan over the so-called " north Korea 's threat " .  
Now that north and south Korea have already signed an agreement on non-aggression and inaugurated the north-south joint military body , this detailed proposal of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea , if realized , would bring about an epoch-making environment for d \ x { 5f4b } ente and peace on the Korean peninsula and would also create the prerequisite for a confederal reunification of Korea .  
In the months preceding the suspension of hostilities ( see para . 45 ) , there was a relative increase , on the part of URNG , in armed clashes , harassment , the installation of roadblocks and the occupation of residential areas for propaganda purposes which sometimes endangered civilians , for instance , when they were caught in the line of fire or when military units were located near populated areas .  
Threats and intimidation continued to be directed against individuals and entities working for the protection of human rights by CVDC members and former military commissioners in rural areas and by unidentified groups operating in urban areas .  
Once the resolution establishing an operation has been adopted , this unit , which may be reinforced as needed by the future commanders of the main national detachments , would ensure the overall military planning of the operation by preparing , in particular , a detailed military directive and the initial order of operations . 
Experience seems to recommend , however , on the one hand , the systematic designation , for all operations of whatever size , of a special representative of the Secretary-General having complete authority over the various components of the operation and , on the other hand , at least for peace-restoration and conflict-moderation operations , which almost inextricably link military tasks ( even including combat ) with negotiation and humanitarian aid activities , an integrated structure involving close cooperation between civilians and military personnel at all levels of command , including logistics .  
The costs relating to the military mandate total $ 30,455,700 gross ( $ 29,739,700 net ) inclusive of the Office of the Force Commander , which consists of two international staff , one at the D-2 level ( the Force Commander ) and one Field Service officer , 170 local staff , 1,230 contingent personnel , maintenance and operating costs , 142 contingent-owned vehicles , including engineering equipment , and 53 rented vehicles . 
In general , desk officers and military mission officers deal with day-to-day operational and related political issues that affect the mandate and conduct of operations , as well as a broad range of other issues , which include military , logistical , administrative , humanitarian , electoral and legal issues .  
This seminar will provide instruction in the development of peace-keeping training methods and programmes to a select group of military and civilian police officers who already have previous United Nations peace-keeping experience and who are presently involved in peace-keeping training at the national level , or will likely become involved in the future .  
The Secretary-General 's military advisers and potential troop contributors to a renewed but significantly reduced UNMIH assessed that a contingent of 1,900 would be the minimum viable force required to accomplish UNMIH 's mandate with an acceptable degree of risk to the United Nations personnel involved .  
This force , at 9 per cent of the size of the multinational force which intervened in September 1994 to establish a stable and secure environment , and one third the size of the currently mandated UNMIH , was designed to be of sufficient strength to be capable of executing the military mission it was being assigned , and no more . 
The most updated theory of international aviation law states than an aircraft designed for " civilian " air transport belonging to a private airline and operated by a civilian crew may in a particular situation be considered to be " State aircraft " if it performs a military , customs or police function . . .  Other aircraft , besides those involved in military , customs or police services , could also be considered " State aircraft " because the enumeration in the Convention is not preclusive .  
Invites Member States and regional , international and non-governmental organizations to stand ready to provide assistance in support of progress achieved by the parties towards political dialogue , and to cooperate with the Government of Burundi in initiatives for comprehensive rehabilitation in Burundi , including in military and police reform , judicial assistance , development programmes and support at international financial institutions ;  
Invites Member States and regional , international and non-governmental organizations to stand ready to provide assistance in support of progress achieved by the parties towards political dialogue , and to cooperate with the Government of Burundi in initiatives for comprehensive rehabilitation in Burundi , including in military and police reform , judicial assistance , development programmes and support at international financial institutions ;  
The three country studies are being complemented by comparative analyses of selected United Nations missions , interviews with key personnel in civilian and military peace-keeping as well as national policy makers ; analyses of United Nations documentation and reports with a view to improving coordination between Headquarters and field commanders ; and review of press reports to gauge public reaction to the way in which peace-keeping operations are conducted .  
Condemns in the strongest terms all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict , recognizing that the leadership in territories under the control of Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and formerly Serb-held areas of the Republic of Croatia , the commanders of Serb paramilitary forces and political and military leaders in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) bear primary responsibility for most of those violations and that persons who commit such acts will be held personally responsible and accountable ;  
Further condemns violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including killings , the burning and looting of houses , the shelling of residential areas , harassment of and attacks on refugees , the elderly and the infirm perpetrated by members of the Croatian armed forces and civilians in the formerly Serb-controlled regions of Croatia during and subsequent to the military operations there in August 1995 ;  
Also gravely concerned , however , at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including killings of civilians , arbitrary arrest and detention , restrictions on freedom of expression and association , torture , forced labour , forced portering , human rights abuses in border areas in the course of military operations , forced relocations and development projects , abuse of women and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Noting with interest that the Government of Nigeria , on 1 October 1995 , affirmed the principle of multi-party democracy , announcing its intent to accept the principle of power-sharing , lift the ban on political activity and the press , devolve power to local levels of government and subordinate the military to civilian authority , but disappointed that only limited action in this regard has followed ,  
The cost of the mission for the 12-month period amounts to $ 7,302,500 gross ( $ 6,795,200 net ) and provides for 44 military observers , maintenance and operating costs for 38 United Nations-owned vehicles , one air support helicopter and one fixed-wing aircraft for supply purposes and overall logistic support and civilian support of 24 international and 35 local staff .  
The Advisory Committee inquired as to the administrative , organizational and resource requirements for UNFICYP 's humanitarian activities and was informed that a military unit comprising from 15 to 20 personnel , including civilian local level staff , was involved in this activity . 
As indicated in the executive summary of the report of the Secretary-General , the cost estimate of $ 17.1-million gross provides for a strength of 135 military observers and 139 civilian staff ( 64 international and 75 local ) and reflects " a moderate increase over the prior period " .  
It is the invalidation by the United States side of the key provisions of the Armistice Agreement that has paved the way for south Korea 's current status as the greatest United States overseas military base and nuclear base .  
Stressing that all forms of repression and cruel and inhuman treatment of women and children committed by belligerents in the course of military operations or in occupied territories , including taking them hostage , their imprisonment , the destruction of their dwellings and their forcible eviction , should be considered criminal ,  
All documented sources , including those of the information media and the international relief organizations , have confirmed that it is Uganda that provides support and that it is the major source arming the insurgency and supplying it with men and logistic , military and political support and providing transit access to all the forces and parties that are supporting the insurgency . 
Taking into account the geographical size of the Mission area and the number of military and civilian personnel and the premises of UNAVEM III , it is considered essential that personnel from the aforementioned sections be deployed in the regional headquarters to administer and monitor related activities under the supervision of their respective sections at Mission headquarters .  
As the Mission approaches full deployment and with the operations of the logistic support service contract , emphasis was given to the strengthening of selected areas of administration and integrated support services to ensure optimum efficiency in the utilization of human resources and the timely provision of services to military and civilian personnel .  
( e bis ) Restructure and target the allocation of public expenditures to promote women 's economic opportunities and equal access to productive resources and to address the basic social , educational and health needs of women , particularly those living in poverty ; ( g ) Reduce excessive military expenditures and investments for arms production and acquisition , as is appropriate and consistent with national security requirements , in order to increase resources for social and economic development ;  
96 Paragraph 233 ( d ) calls upon Governments and non-governmental organizations , the United Nations and other institutional organizations , to include , as appropriate , " information about international and regional instruments and standards in their public information and human rights education activities and in adult education and training programmes , particularly for groups such as the military , the police and other law enforcement personnel , the judiciary , and legal and health professionals to ensure that human rights are effectively protected " .  
The Office will include four other international Professional staff : a political adviser / special assistant at P-5 level , a legal affairs officer at P-5 / P-4 level , a military advisor at P-4 level and an administrative officer at P-3 level .  Its support staff will consist of 10 international and locally recruited General Service staff and 2 security officers .  
The perpetration of acts of terrorism and the imposition of inhumane measures by the Israeli military are neither surprising nor a new phenomenon - for they are integral to the expansionist and aggressive nature of this regime , which has disregarded the will of the international community and violated numerous General Assembly resolutions and Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) with impunity .  
To our disappointment , however , not only have military actions continued , but they have in fact intensified , as evident in the brutal shelling of the United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon ( UNIFIL ) compound earlier today , which has taken the lives of yet more innocent civilians .  
The Chinese delegation expresses its profound concern at the large-scale military offensive launched by Israel in recent days in southern Lebanon , which has resulted in the loss of innocent civilian lives , the massive destruction of property and a large number of civilians ' becoming homeless or refugees , consequently further escalating the conflict in southern Lebanon and aggravating the already tense situation .  
The two sides express their readiness to further develop friendly exchanges between their military forces at various levels and further strengthen their cooperation on military technology on the basis of equality and mutual benefit , bearing in mind their respective international obligations .  They declare that the development of military relations between China and the Russian Federation and their cooperation in the field of military technology are not directed against any third country or country bloc .  
As regards the subprogramme on environmental law , institutions and policies , over 10 additional intergovernmental meetings were convened on issues relating to the protection of marine environment from land-based sources of pollution ; the Lusaka Agreement on cooperative enforcement operations directed at illegal trade in wild fauna and flora ; military activities and the environment ; and African Ministerial Conference on the Environment .  
In keeping with the options I outlined in my report to the Council of 19 January 1996 , and pursuant to resolution 1042 ( 1996 ) , I sent a technical team last month to examine the current functions of the MINURSO military component and to determine whether its size could be reduced , while still permitting it to play an effective role in monitoring the cease-fire and verifying allegations of violations . 
The members of the Council urge you to fulfil your recent unilateral commitment to quarter 50,000 troops at the latest by 15 June 1996 and to increase significantly the number of workable weapons and other military equipment turned over by UNITA troops to UNAVEM III . The members of the Security Council are also concerned that the military talks on the modalities for the integration of UNITA troops into the Angolan armed forces were not concluded on 15 May 1996 in accordance with the timetable agreed by all parties on the Joint Commission earlier this month . 
The establishment of an appropriate defence system incorporated in collective security arrangements ( NATO ) and the definite formulation of a defence policy based on the principles of civil control of military forces and on a democratic political system are our permanent commitment .  
The military element , with an initial strength of 1,200 personnel , would be located in Port-au-Prince only and be composed of one reduced infantry battalion and one reduced reconnaissance battalion , a helicopter unit , a military police unit , an engineer unit , transport and logistic elements , as well as adequate medical support .  
The Mission is deeply concerned at the continuation of this practice , which , given the army 's historic influence over such committees , undermines the primacy of civilian authority and also affects the human rights situation , in that members of the voluntary civil defence committees and former military commissioners are implicated in numerous complaints of human rights violations .  
In view of the foregoing , it is clear that , while members of national military contingents discharge international functions and serve in United Nations peace-keeping operations under the operational control of the Organization , no direct contractual or statutory relationship exists between them and the United Nations .  
Ethnic and religious tensions between Timorese and Indonesians had increased ; mass immigration of Indonesians into the territory of East Timor was continuing ; cases of torture , arbitrary detention , attacks , summary executions , disappearances and killings were becoming increasingly common ; the numbers and violence of the military and police forces were increasing , and many Timorese , especially young people , had become strangers in their own land and had been forced to seek asylum . 
Whenever incidents occurred that were contrary to its firm commitment to uphold and protect basic rights and fundamental freedoms , as had happened in Dili on 12 November 1991 , the Indonesian Government took swift and decisive action to bring to justice those responsible , be they civilians or military personnel . 
The revised cost estimates submitted in document A / 50 / 696 / Add . 1 of 30 October 1995 amounted to $ 890,230,900 gross ( $ 881,791,500 net ) , compared to the original estimates of $ 1,013,629,900 gross ( $ 1,002,021,100 net ) and took into consideration reduced requirements for military and civilian personnel , rental of premises , transport operations , air operations and the purchase of equipment .  
The United States Secretary of Defense and Speaker of the House have recently intensified their campaign of disinformation and hostile propaganda against the Islamic Republic of Iran by the reckless suggestion of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran respectively on National Public Radio on 2 August and NBC 's " Meet the Press " of 28 July - statements which represent blatant examples of political manipulation of public opinion already apprehensive about the recent tragic events . 
In 1994 , the Special Committee , in keeping with its consistent goal of limiting documentation and streamlining its report to the General Assembly , recommended to the Assembly that , in preparing the general working papers on the Territories , the Secretariat should , where applicable , incorporate under separate headings those sections relating to foreign economic and other interests and those on military activities and arrangements in those Territories .

The human rights situation in Burundi is characterized by large-scale massacres involving both State agents and rebels ; selective murders of intellectuals , political leaders , provincial officials and Hutu merchants , as well as certain Tutsi military officers alleged to be moderates ; arbitrary arrests ; and enforced disappearances .  
Condemn the serious crimes and inhuman atrocities of genocide , massacres , extrajudicial killings , reprisal killings , arbitrary detention , torture , use of rape as an instrument of suppression , burning of houses , villages and townships , and destruction and desecration of holy places , committed by the Indian Government , through its military and paramilitary personnel , renegades and mercenaries , in Jammu and Kashmir during the last seven years ;  
Condemn the serious crimes and inhuman atrocities of genocide , massacres , extrajudicial killings , reprisal killings , arbitrary detention , torture , use of rape as an instrument of suppression , burning of houses , villages and townships , and destruction and desecration of holy places , committed by the Indian Government , through its military and paramilitary personnel , renegades and mercenaries , in Jammu and Kashmir during the last seven years ;  
These included changing mandates and constant uncertainties in the Mission , delays in budgetary authorization , delays in issuing budgetary allotments , cumbersome and inflexible procurement procedures , lack of experienced United Nations staff , frequent rotation of military personnel , difficulty in integrating military and civilian components and intractability of some local authorities with respect to their obligations under the various status of forces agreements . 
The international community rose in unison in condemning unequivocally the military takeover and in demanding the prompt and unconditional return of Burundi to its constitutional Government , including the restoration of its elected National Assembly .  
The military coup d'etat of 25 July last in Burundi was a violent act that flew in the face of established constitutional order , accelerated the spiral of violence and arbitrarily usurped political power to the detriment of democracy , national reconciliation and peace in that country .  
These include the unbanning of all political parties , the restoration of the National Assembly , the initiation of businesslike and unconditional negotiations between all political and military powers in the context of the mediation efforts pursued by former President Nyerere , guarantees for the security and safety of members of the former Government , the immediate cessation of all acts of violence , ensuring the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the targeted needy groups throughout Burundi and ensuring the safety and security of personnel of regional and international humanitarian agencies .  
Over half a century of occupation of south Korea by United States military forces has created the tragedy of a divided nation , put grave obstacles in the way of peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula , even in the current post-cold war era , and inflicted immeasurable misery and suffering on the entire Korean population .  
New ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development , including poverty eradication , should be explored .  
Subsequently , our mission in New York received an unofficial note by facsimile transmission , a copy of which is attached herewith , in which Iraq was brazenly ordered not to reinforce its defensive forces on its own territory , not to defend itself , its people or its sovereignty , and not to repair or rebuild the civil or military installations situated in Iraqi territory , which the cowardly American aggressors had destroyed with their long-range cruise missiles . 
It has maintained close relations with the administrative , judicial and military authorities at local and national levels , and has reported its assessment of the human rights situation to the Government on a regular basis .  
In recent experience , some peacekeeping operations have been mandated to include different combinations of the following tasks : monitoring of cease-fires and buffer zones , protecting humanitarian convoys , disarming and demobilizing ex-combatants , reforming military establishments , demining , establishing police forces , organizing or monitoring elections , monitoring human rights , promoting electoral and judicial reform , promoting aspects of civil administration and coordinating economic rehabilitation .  
I hope the Turkish side will respond positively to my proposal , otherwise the only logical inference to be drawn will be that the massive presence of Turkish forces is not for the alleged safety of the Turkish Cypriot community , but for the perpetuation of the status quo , which , as stated in your report , has been created by military force and is sustained by military strength and which the Security Council has deemed unacceptable .  
The opposition informed UNMOT of its forward positions as at 20 July , briefed it about military developments in the Tavildara sector , agreed to identify potential UNMOT team sites behind their forward defensive positions once they had been verified and to establish communication with UNMOT in the Tavildara sector , as foreseen in the joint declaration .  
Growing stocks of surplus fissile material from the military sector and growing amounts of plutonium in civilian fuel cycles make accountancy and control an urgent task of paramount importance .  
Information had been gathered from authorities , victims ' families and non-governmental organizations , from investigations done by specialized agencies and the press , and by reviewing judicial documentation and ascertaining the open and public existence of organizations devoted to the recruitment of soldiers of fortune , that is , persons of military rank or persuasion disposed to serve as mercenaries .  
As reported at the consultation of the whole , on 18 September 1996 , at approximately 0200 hours local time , a 350-ton , 106-foot military submarine was found about 100 feet offshore , grounded in shallow water near the coastal city of Kangnung , one of the major ports on the eastern coast of the Republic of Korea .  
The above savings were realized mainly as a result of more favourable rates for the hire of aircraft used for rotation of military personnel ; receipt of additional vehicles , equipment and supplies from other missions ; cancellation and deferment of maintenance projects as part of the special measures taken in relation to the bad financial situation in the United Nations ; and the reduced prices offered by the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic for petrol , oil and other lubricants .  
In this paragraph , Van der Stoel betrays his intentions and his established bad faith : how otherwise can these claims that there are no special circumstances in Iraq be interpreted , when he knows perfectly well that Iraq has been facing a hostile situation and experiencing unrest , quite apart from having to endure gross violations of its sovereignty and territorial integrity due to the imposition by certain of the allied States of the no-fly zones in the north and south of Iraq , and direct military intervention ?  
The fact that our Kurdish people sought help from its national Government in order to end its suffering exposes the persistent claims of the Special Rapporteur and certain of the allied States , principally the United States , that their military intervention in the northern part of Iraq was intended to protect the Kurds , and supports our previous assertions , namely , that the secret but true intention behind that intervention is to tear apart Iraq and fragment its territorial integrity .  
The practices engaged in by the United States and its subsequent large-scale military mobilization , undertaken without regard for the widespread disapproval aroused in world public opinion , are in flagrant violation of the purposes and principles of the United Nations concerning the maintenance of international peace and security and respect for the sovereignty of States and the dignity of their nationals . 
Kazakstan calls on the parties to the conflict on all concerned States in the region and on the international community to take urgent measures to halt the military action , ensure non-interference in the internal affairs of the sovereign Islamic State of Afghanistan and guarantee its territorial integrity .  
As already noted , the reduction of UNMIH 's military element necessitated a concentration of the remaining forces in Port-au-Prince ( see attached map ) , which , as the centre of economic , political and social activity in Haiti , is critical to the maintenance of a secure and stable environment .  
I should also like to reiterate my firm conviction that the continued presence of United Nations civilian police monitors is contingent upon the existence of a secure environment maintained by a credible international military force ( see S / 1995 / 1031 , para .  29 ) .  
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 8 of document A / 50 / 363 / Add . 4 that , as proposed by the Secretary-General in paragraph 35 of his report to the Security Council ( S / 1996 / 416 ) , some of the existing UNMIH contingents remained in Haiti and that the revised cost estimates for the liquidation provides for the repatriation of 538 military personnel and contingent-owned equipment and for 8 international staff and 28 local staff for the closing of the base camp in Cap Ha \ x { 9ba0 } ien .  
However , terrorism was not confined to certain countries or regions ; it posed a serious threat to all countries , regardless of their military power , economic development and geographical location , and therefore required a concerted international response .  
Child sex clients have been identified as coming primarily from the following groups : paedophiles , preferential child sex abusers or regular situational customers , local prostitute users , tourists , travelling businessmen , migrant foreign workers , military personnel , public workers in isolated places and others .  
The relationship between the military and prostitution has been illustrated by cases of soldiers paying for the sexual services of orphaned , abandoned or displaced girls , who are often held in brothels under conditions of virtual slavery and forced to sexually service off-duty local soldiers .  
The revised cost estimates for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 amounted to $ 31,902,000 gross and reflected a 39 per cent decrease in gross terms in comparison with the original cost estimates , taking into account that it provided for the reduced strength of 230 military observers and 9 civilian police observers , supported by a civilian establishment of 167 personnel ( 102 international and 65 local ) and 2 observers from the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) .  
The revised cost estimates for the maintenance of the Observer Mission for the 12-month period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 represented a 47 per cent reduction in the previous estimate , due to the reduced staffing level , comprising 34 military observers , 43 international staff and 47 local staff , and the non-implementation of disarmament and demobilization programme .  
Violations of human rights remain extremely serious , including , in particular , the practice of torture , summary and arbitrary executions , forced labour , including forced portering for the military , abuse of women , politically motivated arrests and detention , forced displacement , serious restrictions on the freedoms of expression and association , and the imposition of oppressive measures directed , in particular , at ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
I should like to mention by way of example the return of UNITA members to the National Assembly , which they left in 1992 ; the return of the expected total number of general officers to the Angolan Armed Forces ; the completion of the selection process of a total 26,300 UNITA military troops for induction into the Angolan Armed Forces ; the re-establishment of government administration , given the continued illegal occupation of certain areas of the national territory ; and the free circulation of goods and people in the areas under its control .  
Just a few years ago , Nicaragua maintained a large army and devoted a large part of its national budget to meet high military expenditures , to the detriment of its economic and social development .  Just a few years ago , many of you , and even we ourselves , were looking with sceptism at the possibility of peace reigning in Nicaragua or of the country enjoying full liberty .  
The doctrine shall encompass respect for the Guatemalan Constitution , human rights , the international instruments ratified by Guatemala in the military field , protection of national sovereignty and independence , the territorial integrity of Guatemala and the spirit of the agreements on a firm and lasting peace .  
The necessary amendments shall continue to be made to the corresponding regulations so that the military education system is consistent , in its philosophical framework , with respect for the Guatemalan Constitution and other laws , with a culture of peace and democratic coexistence , with the doctrine defined in this Agreement , and with national values , the integral development of the individual , knowledge of our national history , respect for human rights and the identity and rights of the indigenous peoples , and the primacy of the individual .  
The practice of voluntary military recruitment shall be continued , until the Government of Guatemala , on the basis of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights , adopts the necessary administrative decisions , and the Guatemalan Congress approves a civil service law , which shall include military service and community service ; this law shall entail fulfilment of a duty and a constitutional right , which is neither compulsory nor a violation of human rights , is universal and non-discriminatory , and would reduce the length of service and offer options to citizens .  
Such practices are also liable to generate a worrying state of affairs , not only for Iraq , but also for Turkey and the region as a whole , which is primarily afflicted by the irregular situation created by the Americans and their allies in northern Iraq , not to mention the human injury to which Iraqi citizens are exposed as a result of the illegitimate activities of the Turkish armed forces and their military operations inside the territory of the Republic of Iraq . 
He reported about numerous allegations , the majority of which concerned death sentences imposed after trials by military courts , allegedly falling short of international standards .  
The Special Rapporteur informed the Commission that he had received allegations concerning secret trials , allegedly held before the Special Military Court in Lagos , of a group of more than 30 military officials and civilians accused of being involved in an attempted coup d ' \ x { 5f4b } at which was discovered in March 1995 .  
The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , in his report to the Commission on Human Rights ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 4 ) cited information that had been brought to his attention in 1995 concerning the secret trials held before the Special Military Court in Lagos of more than 30 military officials and civilians accused of being involved in an alleged attempted coup d ' \ x { 5f4b } at .  
The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers expresses grave concern that in Nigeria today substantial judicial power , particularly in the administration of criminal justice , is vested in the military and special ad hoc tribunals to the exclusion of the ordinary courts . 
Those constraints included the numerous changes in its mandate , as well as other uncertainties in its operating environment , delays in budgetary authorization , cumbersome and inflexible procurement practices and procedures , a lack of experienced United Nations staff , the frequent rotation of personnel , the difficulty of integrating military and civilian components , and the intractability of some local authorities with respect to their obligations under the various status-of-forces agreements .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
At a time when profound changes are taking place in the international arena and the United Nations is being increasingly called upon to face new challenges that are not always conciliatory and require the concerted efforts of all Member States , regardless of size , geographical situation or economic and military might , it is vital that a broad programme of comprehensive reform of the multilateral institutions be adopted to further measures , in a decisive manner , for the democratization of international relations based on the rule of law and the mutual benefit of States .  
This is because while members of national military contingents discharge international functions and serve in United Nations peacekeeping operations under the operational control of the Organization , no direct contractual or statutory relationship exists between them and the United Nations ; the terms and conditions of their assignment to the United Nations peacekeeping operations are set out in bilateral agreements and / or understandings entered into between the Organization and their respective Governments . a / General Assembly resolution 50 / 217 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses .  
In that part of the former Yugoslavia , the ethnic Albanians , who constituted the overwhelming majority continued to be subjected to Serbian police and military repression and to large-scale violations of their human rights despite repeated condemnations of that situation in the relevant General Assembly resolutions .  
This singling out of the Jehovah 's Witnesses is almost certainly due to their religious militancy , which is expressed through proselytism , conscientious objection to military service and a variety of public demonstrations which call into question the interests of the dominant Church and the legislative and political system of the State .  
While it would now be possible to obtain commercial insurance coverage for contingent personnel assigned to United Nations peacekeeping operations if the Secretary-General were so authorized by the General Assembly , in view of the opinion provided by the Office of Legal Affairs , any compensation made for the death or disability of such military personnel could not be paid directly to disabled troops or dependent survivors , but rather to the national authorities , as was the current practice .  
In my report of 1 October , I observed that the Haitian National Police had not reached the level of experience and confidence required to control and defeat threats posed by subversive groups , and that it was clear , therefore , that the presence of the UNSMIH military element was a key factor in the ability of the Haitian authorities to contain the danger of destabilization by forces threatening democracy .  
Respect for the right of the Iraqi population to food and adequate health care was also called into question by the rationing system set up by the Government , which protected the elite of the Baath Party and the Iraqi military , but served as a way of subjugating the population to discourage any opposition and retaliating against the population in the south of the country , which was suspected of being hostile to the Iraqi regime .  
The multidimensional , intra-State nature of conflicts required that United Nations peacekeeping operations should be equipped with the skills to tackle a variety of military , political , humanitarian and civilian problems .  
Given the increasing interrelationship between political , economic , social , military and cultural factors in conflicts , the concept of peacekeeping had been modified and had acquired a multidimensional and integral character .  
ICRC had also been developing a model manual for the armed forces on the law of armed conflicts , designed primarily for use by senior officers with tactical responsibilities , and intended as a reference tool for the military commander without legal background .  
Concrete measures which had been identified included improved police training methods , a protection programme for witnesses of human rights violations , assistance to victims of violent crimes , transfer to civilian courts of competence to try military police crimes , and federal investigation of human rights violations .  
Although the establishment of a rapidly deployable mission headquarters was a constructive step , it would not be a panacea for the range of problems experienced in previous United Nations peacekeeping missions ; it would provide operational and planning improvements , however , and would enable the United Nations to deploy more quickly to the field a well-prepared and jointly trained team of military and civilian personnel in the most critical phase of peacekeeping operations .  
His delegation called upon the major Powers to stop providing military , financial and strategic support , as well as direct and indirect financing for the construction of new settlements , since that posed a threat to a just and lasting peace in the region .  
This frontier was described as the " existing administrative border between the Republics of Montenegro and Croatia " and the reason stated for " raising the issue of borders " were " historic , geographic and other interests arising from the military significance and strategic position of Prevlaka and the entire Boka Kotorska Bay " .  
The suffering of the Afghan civilian population , who continue to bear the main brunt of the civil war , and the dangers that that war creates for regional stability , oblige the international community to intensify its search for a peaceful solution , despite the fact that certain Afghan parties seem to continue to favour the military option .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
Urges the international community to reduce , as appropriate , excessive military expenditures on and investments in arms production and acquisition , consistent with national security requirements , in order to increase resources for social and economic development , in particular , to poverty eradication programmes in developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries ;  
The cost estimates contained in annex III to document A / 50 / 696 / Add . 4 covered the pre-liquidation period from 1 January to 30 June 1996 and provided for the repatriation travel of 309 military observers and 7,463 contingent personnel , as well as for the maintenance of an average monthly strength of 1,237 contingent personnel , 293 international civilian staff , 458 local staff , 725 international contractual personnel and 23 United Nations Volunteers .  
Since Israel 's occupation of East Jerusalem , more than 28 years ago , the Israeli Government has tried to judaize the city by distorting its identity , changing its demographic character , deporting Palestinian inhabitants and reducing their numbers through the application of military , administrative and legal measures , moving settlers into the city and expanding Jerusalem 's borders to prejudice the final status of the city .  
In fact , the much needed international humanitarian and technical assistance to the Palestinian people remains hindered by the apparent non-cooperative attitude of the Israeli authorities , who continue to enforce upon the population of today 's Palestine the same restrictive bureaucratic formalities that they designed to deal with the people living under their military occupation in previous years . 
Noting the key role played to date by the United Nations Civilian Police , supported by United Nations military personnel , in helping to establish a fully functioning Haitian National Police Force of adequate size and structure as an integral element of the consolidation of democracy and the revitalization of Haiti 's system of justice , and , in this context , welcoming continued progress towards establishing the Haitian National Police ,  
Urges the international community to reduce , as appropriate , excessive military expenditures on and investments in arms production and acquisition , consistent with national security requirements , in order to increase resources for social and economic development , in particular to poverty eradication programmes in developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries ;  
I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that our country is prepared to provide , on specific terms , special units of its military forces for demining operations conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and other international organizations , or on a bilateral basis .  A mine-clearance training centre , established in the city of Kamyanets-Podilsky , provides all the facilities necessary to train foreign specialists in this field .  
Thirdly , the relationship between the States themselves : instead of waging propaganda wars and in some cases even resorting to economic coercion and the use of military force to deal with ethnic tensions and situations involving minorities in other countries , States should rely on the legal means provided by international human rights instruments , in particular the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , which contained a provision allowing States to make a complaint when they were not satisfied with the performance of another State in matters covered by the Convention .  
The maintenance of a significant United Nations presence in Haiti in the form of military elements , particularly against the backdrop of the far more drastic crisis situations in other regions of the world and the extremely difficult financial situation of the Organization , could be perceived as a manifestation of double standards , especially when one takes into account the totally different attitude towards other truly critical and more volatile flashpoints .  
Noting the key role played to date by the United Nations Civilian Police , supported by United Nations military personnel , in helping to establish a fully functioning Haitian National Police Force of adequate size and structure as an integral element of the consolidation of democracy and the revitalization of Haiti 's system of justice , and , in this context , welcoming continued progress towards establishing the Haitian National Police ,  
The same was true of other violations of the law of armed conflict mentioned in the new draft , i.e . , the employment of poisonous weapons calculated to cause unnecessary suffering or the wanton destruction of cities , towns or villages not justified by military necessity .  
IV of the Constitution of the United Mexican States provide that public service in the armed forces is compulsory ; that it is an obligation for Mexicans to receive military instruction making them fit to exercise the rights of citizens skilled in the handling of weapons and proficient in military discipline ; that males who are Mexicans and have reached 18 years of age shall be considered to be citizens of the Republic and that it is a prerogative of those persons to bear arms in the armed forces for the defence of the Republic and its institutions .  
National military service serves to enrol personnel in the armed forces , is instituted by constitutional declaration contained in the fourth paragraph of article 5 of the Constitution of the United Mexican States , which provides that the only public service which may be compulsory , under the terms of the respective laws , is military service , which requires all the country 's inhabitants to assist in the defence of the fatherland .  
Secondly , the reasons for raising the minimum age to 18 years are not only associated with recruitment methods but with the physical , psychosocial and emotional impact on the young person , the teaching of military skills and attitudes and the deprivation of opportunities to develop educational and social skills more appropriate for civilian life .  
A key element of an effective arms control regime is provision for complete , accurate and timely exchange of relevant information , including the size , structure , location and military doctrine of military forces as well as their activities ; - Verification . 
Authorizes the Secretary-General to commence the gradual and progressive withdrawal of UNAVEM III formed military units from individual quartering areas prior to February 1997 , and to accelerate the withdrawal schedule subsequently , if former combatants vacate the quartering areas in accordance with the Lusaka Protocol and other factors are conducive to withdrawal , without putting at risk the successful completion of the peace process ;  
The extension of UNAVEM 's mandate until 28 February 1997 will provide the Angolans with an additional chance to accomplish the remaining military and political tasks foreseen in the Lusaka Protocol and to establish the basis for a peaceful , united and prosperous Angola .  
Authorizes the Secretary-General to commence the gradual and progressive withdrawal of UNAVEM III formed military units from individual quartering areas prior to February 1997 , and to accelerate the withdrawal schedule subsequently , if former combatants vacate the quartering areas in accordance with the Lusaka Protocol and other factors are conducive to withdrawal , without putting at risk the successful completion of the peace process ;  
Underlines that the primary responsibility for the further successful implementation of the peace process lies with the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina themselves , which during the next two years should assume increasingly a greater responsibility for the functions now undertaken or coordinated by the international community , and stresses that without compliance and active participation by all the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina in rebuilding a civil society they can not expect the international community and major donors to continue shouldering the political , military and economic burden of the implementation and reconstruction efforts ;  
A number of major causes of the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina have yet to be removed and it is only the continuing sound international presence , both military and civilian , that can prevent the resumption of hostilities even on a minor scale .  
Underlines that the primary responsibility for the further successful implementation of the peace process lies with the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina themselves , which during the next two years should assume increasingly a greater responsibility for the functions now undertaken or coordinated by the international community , and stresses that without compliance and active participation by all the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina in rebuilding a civil society they can not expect the international community and major donors to continue shouldering the political , military and economic burden of the implementation and reconstruction efforts ;  
His delegation had actively participated in every aspect of the work , as the United States was committed to the establishment of a fair , effective and truly international criminal court that met all relevant standards of due process and strengthened both international and national law enforcement and military justice interests .  
It is noteworthy that Mr . Clerides who stressed during the exercises that " the joint military doctrine is here to stay and will proceed as planned " had already made their ultimate aim clear in pursuing this confrontational posture when he stated that " . . . when the time comes , Hellenism will be resurrected in north Cyprus " ( Simerini , 4 April 1996 ) . 
Non-democratic States over time tend to generate conditions inimical to development : politicized military rule ; a weak middle class ; a population constrained to silence ; prohibitions on travel ; censorship ; restrictions on the practice of religion or imposition of religious obligations ; and pervasive and often institutionalized corruption .  
Support for a culture of democracy has proved critical to success in holding free and fair elections in which all actors in society - government officials , political leaders , parliamentarians , judicial officials , police and military forces and individual citizens - play their accorded roles .  
Moreover , at a time of increasing demand but decreasing resources within the United Nations for international action , the potential of regional groups to contribute political , diplomatic , financial , material and military resources has taken on even greater importance . 
Rape continued to be reported as widespread ( perpetrated by members of all parties to the conflict ) and regular reports were received of women being obliged to perform forced labour for military and paramilitary units and groups .  
Reiterates grave concern about the excessive levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , as well as the lack of progress towards a significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;

As indicated in paragraph 17 of the report of the Secretary-General , an additional eight United Nations Volunteers would be assigned to the eight regional offices to carry out education and promotion tasks , coordinated by the MINUGUA Education and Promotion Unit , which , in conjunction with the Indigenous Affairs Unit , would design a comprehensive training programme aimed at indigenous leaders , civil and military authorities and non-governmental organizations .  
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development will be undertaken .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
We make this statement for the sake of the record of this institution , which was established for the attainment of the goals and ideals reflected in its Charter , maintains its neutrality , supports peoples ' will and is based on the principles of sovereign equality of all States , irrespective of their size , geographical location and military or economic potentialities .  
The new , restructured MINUGUA will oversee an unprecedented transformation in the political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public-security life of Guatemala .  
The signature of this most recent Agreement makes effective all the previous agreements signed by the parties , which cover complex political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public-security questions . 
Conscious of the human rights and dignity of all refugee children and adolescents and that , due to their specific needs and vulnerability within the broader refugee population , they need to be among the first to receive protection and assistance in any refugee situation , Gravely concerned that refugee children and adolescents continue to be exposed to family separation , physical violence and other violations of their human rights , including through sexual abuse and exploitation , and military or armed attacks ,  
With the successful conclusion of the military observer Mission in Guatemala , the definitive ceasefire between the Government and the URNG has established the necessary conditions for the promotion of peace and development in a subregion of the Americas which has been particularly vulnerable to pernicious blends of internal strife and external interference .  
In our view , special attention should be paid in the charter to the security interests of States that have not joined military and political alliances and have not expressed the desire to join such alliances in the foreseeable future .  
Unfortunately , these gains were nullified by subsequent events , characterized by the ominous statements made by the Israeli Prime Minister and members of his Government and backed by continued military occupation ; land confiscation and settlement in the occupied territories ; construction of housing units in the settlement of Givat Zeev ; demolition of Palestinian houses in the occupied territories ; confiscation of identity documents of Palestinians ; imposition of closures to drain the Palestinian economy , resulting in the loss of potential income ; and systematic change in the physical character and demographic composition of Jerusalem .  
In fact , the much-needed international humanitarian and technical assistance to the Palestinian people also remains hindered by the apparent non-cooperative attitude of the Israeli authorities , which still continue to enforce upon the population of today 's Palestine the same restrictive bureaucratic formalities that they had designed to deal with the people living under their military occupation in previous years .  
The vital contribution of the multinational Stabilization Force in providing a secure environment for the implementation of the Peace Agreement has been generally recognized , and it is particularly important that the conclusions of the Bonn Peace Implementation Conference confirmed an emerging consensus on the need for an international military presence to continue beyond June 1998 . 
I should like to conclude my remarks by expressing the Government of Japan \ x { e5b8 } deep appreciation to all the countries and international institutions that are engaged in the noble and difficult tasks , both civilian and military , that are required for the implementation of the Peace Agreement .  
Mr . Galu \ x { ea98 } a ( Czech Republic ) : Although the Czech Republic , as an associated country , endorsed the statement of the European Union presented by the representative of Luxembourg , I would like to make a few additional comments on this point .  The reason is that the situation in the former Yugoslavia , specifically in Bosnia and Herzegovina , is a long-term priority of Czech foreign policy , reflected in our intensive political , military , material and financial support for all efforts to bring stability to the region .  
These are the facts about the bellicose , obstinate , rejectionist and intransigent attitude of the Taliban , which is aided and assisted by the presence of agents of the cross-border military intelligence services and attested to by the physical presence of foreign military and paramilitary prisoners in Afghanistan .  
It is inequitable to reprobate and qualify as warlords those who are fighting for the independence of Afghanistan and not for personal and material gain and to equate them with those who are serving the interests of a foreign country by inviting foreign military personnel .  
Regional and international arms races and military expenditure do not merely threaten international peace and security and the stability of States ; they also absorb tremendous amounts of national economic and financial resources , particularly in the developing countries that so sorely need those resources to achieve their aspirations to economic and social development .  
The issues to be discussed at the conference are set out in table 4 , and include methods for estimating capital stock , including the perpetual inventory method and direct survey methods ; concepts of capital for different purposes , such as balance sheets and productivity analysis ; issues for national balance sheets ; and extensions of the 1993 SNA capital boundary , such as computer software , mineral exploration and non-weapon military equipment .  
While the international community was watching without taking proper action , the systematic policy of " ethnic cleansing " operations , planned and carried out by nationalistic politicians , military and paramilitary groups as well as civilians who were themselves victims of racist propaganda , resulted in the mass exodus of more than 2-million refugees and internally displaced persons , in the death of more than 200,000 human beings , in the economic destruction of vast areas of the region , and in the most horrendous acts of torture , systematic rape and similar expressions of barbarity .  
The continued presence of Rwandan refugees in neighbouring countries has had a number of serious , closely linked consequences of several kinds : humanitarian ( suffering endured ) , economic ( depleted humanitarian assistance ) , political and strategic ( interests of States ) , ecological ( destruction of host States ' ecosystems ) and security ( military and paramilitary activities of former FAR and militia members , as well as border insecurity ) . 
The case has some special features , not only because of its innately tragic nature , but because of its more immediate effects ; for the first time a President of the Republic accepted institutional responsibility for an occurrence ; for the first time a massacre was immediately brought before the courts ; for the first time a whole military unit was taken to court ; for the first time military jurisdiction was set supplanted by the civil courts in a case with military defendants ; for the first time criminal charges of extrajudicial execution were preferred .  
None of the parties to the conflict has fulfilled the obligations arising from article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions , and serious violations of its provisions have occurred , including attempts on life and physical integrity , homicide , torture , taking of hostages , outrages upon personal dignity and arbitrary arrests , including arrests of wounded and sick people , without the justification of military necessity .  
Rounds of consultations are currently being held at the level of the Government and political parties on a new preliminary bill on the subject , with the aim of harmonizing the specifically military and social aspects to be included in the future law .  
In order for the disbanding and disarming of military commissioners and CVDCs to lead to a fundamental change in the human rights situation , it is necessary to eradicate the counter-insurgency mentality , which is a source of potential human rights violations , and to promote in its place tolerance , unrestricted public participation and the effective presence of institutions for the protection of human rights .  
Likewise , all political , military or police authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina violating the Dayton / Paris Accords , international law and basic human rights must be held accountable and confronted by those responsible for implementation .  
After the fire , Thai government authorities allegedly relocated the toxic residues to a dumpsite in a military area in Kanchanaburi . The toxic waste is buried approximately 4 m underground and the entire 3,800 _ m2 area is covered with cement . 
The Agreement brings into effect all the previous agreements encompassing military , political , social , economic and environmental issues and binds them into a comprehensive nationwide agenda for peace .  
The Special Rapporteur would like to point out that rebels , Tutsi militias or Tutsi groups from the displaced persons ' camps accompanying the military , are all equally guilty of murderous acts that result in grave violations of international humanitarian law and human rights .  
Urges the international community to reduce , as appropriate , excessive military expenditures on and investments in arms production and acquisition , consistent with national security requirements , in order to increase resources for social and economic development , in particular to poverty eradication programmes in developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries ;  
He emphasized the fact that , owing to the deleterious effects of transborder crime , international cooperation against it had become the fourth major area after political , economic and military cooperation .  
It encompasses detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues which have been bound together into a comprehensive national agenda .  
The arming of Armenia on such a large scale and the sharp build-up of its military might in violation of international legal norms , at a time when relations between Azerbaijan and the Russian Federation are improving and steadily developing , poses a real threat to the entire region .  
Armenia , which has seized 20 per cent of Azerbaijani territory and expelled more than 1-million Azerbaijanis from their homes , and which constantly accuses Azerbaijan of being unwilling to resolve the conflict through peaceful means , has in fact not halted and continues through all illegal means to build up its military potential , which is a gross violation of the provisions of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe , which regulates the admissible levels of conventional weapons for the countries parties to the Treaty .  
The deliveries to Armenia of military equipment and spare parts for them , which were unauthorized by the Government of the Russian Federation , have provoked a negative response on the part of a number of Russian officials and have become the subject of special deliberations in the State Duma of the Russian Federation , which has instructed its main committees - on defence , security , and CIS and ties with fellow citizens - to conduct a thorough investigation .  
It encompassed detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues , which had been bound together into a comprehensive national agenda .  
The resettlement and integration verification area would consist of the Chief ( P-5 ) , one-P-4 to liaise with the international and national institutions responsible for the resettlement of displaced persons , one P-3 ( local ) to deal with the legal aspects of repatriation and documentation of ex-combatants , one military liaison officer , and one civilian police observer , supported by three Local level staff .  
Taking into consideration the modest financial capabilities of the State , in this short period it has been impossible to supply the appropriate equipment and arms for the armed forces of the Republic of Macedonia at a level that would provide for an appropriate initial reaction or a possible urgent military action ;  
He called for increasing contacts across the Taiwan Straits and negotiations that would lead to reunification in which Taiwan would ' exercise a high degree of autonomy and enjoy legislative and independent judicial power , including that of final adjudication ' and ' may also retain its armed forces and administer its party , governmental and military systems by itself ' .  
The continued preference of some of the warring Afghan parties for the military option , and their intransigence and lack of responsiveness to the strenuous efforts of the special representative to achieve a comprehensive settlement , confirm the need to develop the efforts currently being made by the United Nations and to direct these efforts to more practical steps leading to the creation of the climate necessary for the implementation of the proposals made to date and of the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council on this subject .  
In view of the grave consequences of a possible intensification of military confrontation , the Polish delegation shares the view expressed by the Secretary-General in his report that it is necessary to increase and coordinate international efforts to impress upon the Afghan parties the need to solve the conflict in a peaceful way , that is to arrive at a lasting political settlement with the participation of all segments of Afghan society .  
Greatly concerned , the Islamic State of Afghanistan wishes to request you to take appropriate preventive measures in order to halt the planned massive military assault which would inevitably entail the loss of many lives of the innocent civilian population .  
In an earlier report ( S / 25274 , para . 56 ) , the Commission stated that : " ' Ethnic cleansing ' has been carried out by means of murder , arbitrary arrest and detention , extra-judicial executions , rape and sexual assault , confinement of civilian population in ghetto areas , forcible removal , displacement and deportation of civilian population , deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas , and wanton destruction of property . "  
Although the aim of producing the above-mentioned report ( which was prepared by a United Nations expert ) was not to study the problem of landmines and remnants of war and their effect on the future of the country and its development , the references to and preliminary estimates of war damages make it clear beyond any doubt that what was suffered by Libya during the military operations , and the landmines and explosives left by those operations , represented a human and material disaster of incalculable proportions . 
This requires that they be included in economic and military matters , in both multilateral and bilateral diplomacy , and in official delegations to international and regional conferences .  
Organizations of the United Nations system and various economic , political and military structures at the regional level have become important international public employers , but here , too , women have remained a minority concentrated in lower-level positions .  
In her statement , the Chairperson-Rapporteur , Ms . Erica-Irene Daes , outlined four major concerns : ( a ) the need for a recognition of the effects of dispossession of lands and habitat on the health of indigenous peoples ; ( b ) the exposure of indigenous peoples to hazardous industrial and military activities ; ( c ) the need to improve access to national health-care systems ; ( d ) the role traditional medical practices could play in national primary health-care systems and the protection of those practices .  
As at 13 June , the cumulative total of arms and ammunition recovered and verified by military observers was 10,036 weapons and more than 1.24-million assorted pieces of ammunition , while approximately 3,750 weapons had been reported surrendered to ECOMOG outside the official disarmament sites .  
In such cases , it is also common for the majority of the members of the judiciary to be removed from office and for the ordinary courts to be replaced by military courts to try people for alleged political offences , culminating in a Supreme Court of Justice that legalizes institutional acts or their equivalent , or confers a supra _ constitutional status on emergency rules adopted by the regime .  
The Civil Affairs Unit continues to coordinate with legal non-governmental organizations to resolve cases where the Government of Croatia does not issue documents according to the agreed procedures , including failure to meet administrative deadlines , refusals to issue passports to men of military age and refusals issued without the adequate explanation required by Croatian law .  
In order to avoid military courts , in those countries where they have not yet been abolished , helping to perpetuate impunity by virtue of a lack of independence resulting from the chain of command to which all or some of their members are subject , their jurisdiction must be limited solely to specifically military offences committed by military personnel , excluding human rights violations constituting serious crimes under international law , which come under the jurisdiction of the ordinary domestic courts or , where necessary , an international court .  
Reiterates grave concern at the continuing excessive levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , and the lack of progress towards and significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;  
We sincerely hope that the Angolan Government , and UNITA in particular , will , in the fundamental interests of the people of their country and in a continued spirit of unity and cooperation , seize the historic opportunity to complete as soon as possible the pending tasks in the political and military fields and achieve national reconciliation at an early date , thus paving the way for national reconstruction and development in the country .  
We urge the Government of Angola , and in particular UNITA , to make haste and complete the remaining political and military aspects of the peace process , including the normalization of State administration throughout the national territory in accordance with the agreed timetable and procedures ; the transformation of the UNITA radio station into a non-partisan broadcasting facility ; the registration and demobilization of all remaining military elements ; the elimination of all obstacles to the free circulation of people and goods ; and the disarmament of the civilian population .  
The professionalism of the role the army now plays in national life was made clear by its comportment during the electoral process of March 1997 : in marked contrast to the record of military interference in the history of El Salvador , the army demonstrated its respect for the democratic decision of the Salvadorian people that those elections represented .  8 .  Before the signing of the peace agreements , public security functions were carried out by bodies dependent on the armed forces .  
At the beginning of the 1990s , the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung took the landmark initiative of demolishing the concrete walls built up on the south side of the military demarcation line , allowing free travel between the north and the south , and holding north-south high-level talks and the north-south summit talks to remove the root cause of the war and accelerate the process of peaceful reunification on the Korean peninsula in the next few years .  
I should like in the present letter to alert you to the fact that between 1 January and 30 June 1997 United States and other warplanes continued to violate the airspace of the Republic of Iraq from military bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and to engage in such hostile , provocative and inflammatory actions as the dropping of heat flares in civilian areas and on civilian installations in Iraq .  
Such a dramatic development as the current incident could be avoidable if the United States would not leave the maintenance of the demilitarized zone entirely to the south Korean puppets , insisting only on new war provocation , while neglecting our proposal for establishing an interim agreement that can replace the obsolete Korean Armistice Agreement , and for Democratic People 's Republic of Korea / United States military general-level talks . 
Noting the key role played to date by the United Nations Civilian Police , supported by United Nations military personnel , in helping to establish a fully functioning Haitian National Police Force of adequate size and structure as an integral element of the consolidation of democracy and the revitalization of Haiti 's system of justice and , in this context , welcoming continued progress towards professionalizing the Haitian National Police ,  
With its leaner and more focused mandate , the Mission will undergo a corresponding reduction of its personnel and will thus complete its transformation from the large peacekeeping operation established in 1995 , with a strength of approximately 6,000 military and 700 civilian police personnel , to a contingent of 250 civilian police and a headquarters unit of 50 military personnel having full command and control over a voluntarily funded security element .  
Noting the key role played to date by the United Nations Civilian Police , supported by United Nations military personnel , in helping to establish a fully functioning Haitian National Police Force of adequate size and structure as an integral element of the consolidation of democracy and the revitalization of Haiti 's system of justice and , in this context , welcoming continued progress towards professionalizing the Haitian National Police ,  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 21 August 1997 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , calling attention to the fact that Turkish military operations in northern Iraq are continuing to violate Iraq 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and urging the United Nations to meet its responsibilities as laid down in the Charter and halt the intimidation and aggression to which Iraq is constantly being subjected .  
It should particularly be mentioned that maps utilized by the Azeri side are , first , drawn on a distorted scale , as Nagorno-Karabagh and adjacent territories , in comparison with the neighbouring regions , are drawn larger than they are in reality , and second , the line of the Karabagh-Azeri military contact is drawn more eastwards than the genuine borders of the confrontation : a fact to be easily observed if Azeri maps are compared with the military and other maps used by the OSCE Minsk Group on the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict . 
The High Contracting Parties , while independently deciding on matters of national security and military organizational development , shall engage in close cooperation in these areas and determine forms of interaction on the basis of this Treaty , the bilateral Treaty of 16 March 1995 on the Russian military base in the territory of the Republic of Armenia , and other relevant agreements .  
The meetings and talks that were held during the visit confirmed the broad convergence of the interests of the two States in the political , military and strategic and economic fields , and the similarity of their approaches to global and regional problems .  
Promising directions of cooperation of development of cooperative links in the mining and metallurgical , chemical and jewellery industries and light industry , mechanical engineering , building materials production , military industrial complexes and agro-industry complexes ; the establishment of inter-State industrial and financial groups and joint enterprises ; cooperation between transport department ; harmonization of the actions of the banking systems of Armenia and the Russian Federation ; and other joint actions taken in the light of the mutual economic interests of the two countries .  
While crying for the introduction of diversified military equipment , the south Korean authorities are now shipping modern tanks , armoured vehicles , anti-aircraft missiles , anti-tank missiles and helicopters from the Russian Federation as well as the United States , Harpy unmanned attack planes from Israel and huge military equipment from many countries around the world .  
With a view to promoting peace and strengthening security in the Mediterranean region , the new Government of Malta has time and time again committed itself to a foreign policy that is based on the values of democratic governance , on the upholding of fundamental human rights , on the peaceful settlement of disputes and on a policy that is in favour of disarmament and strongly opposes military aggression , and the manufacture , distribution and proliferation of all types of armaments and weapons , especially weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological .  
It has never engaged in overseas aggression , nor does it have any intention of using landmines in other countries .  Should China use anti-personnel landmines in legitimate circumstances , it would be entirely for the purpose of defending against foreign military intervention and aggression , safeguarding its national unification and territorial integrity , and ensuring a peaceful life for its own people .  
Thirdly , it is necessary to prevent a small number of countries taking advantage of their advanced military technology and economic power to seek their absolute security and military superiority over others while they focus the target of disarmament on the developing countries and deprive them of their legitimate right and means of self-defence .  Fourthly , the countries with the largest and most sophisticated conventional and nuclear arsenals should continue to bear special responsibility for disarmament .  
The decision gradually to remove up to 500 tons of highly enriched uranium and up to 50 tons of weapons-grade plutonium from nuclear military programmes is an effective contribution by Russia to ensuring that nuclear disarmament is irreversible .  The 1972 Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems ( ABM ) is of paramount importance to nuclear disarmament as a key element of strategic stability and a prerequisite for further reductions in strategic offensive arms .  
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , will be undertaken so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
Genuine and substantive discussions should take place without further delay between the present military regime and the leaders of NLD and with other political leaders who were duly elected in the democratic elections of 1990 , including representatives of ethnic minorities .  Certain steps reportedly taken in July by SLORC , apparently to initiate such discussions , are a welcome and positive development , but that development must be intensified .  
These seminars are intended to strengthen the capacity and improve the performance of all public officials - judicial , administrative military , and law enforcement officers involved in the administration of justice at the prefectural level .  
The project covers five main areas of activity : human rights education and training for the judiciary , the military , the gendarmerie , the police , prison administration personnel , other civil servants and members of local human rights non-governmental organizations ; capacity-building in the sector of civilian and military justice ; capacity support for human rights non-governmental organizations ; the popularization of human rights through formal and informal education and promotion activities ; and support for genocide victims and vulnerable groups .  
The effective functioning of the justice system and , in particular , the independence of the judiciary have been seriously undermined by several factors , including military intimidation , political pressure , very low salaries and a limited level of legal training of the judges and prosecutors , publicly recognized corruption of the judicial personnel , and article 51 of the Civil Servants Act .  
In the context of widespread rumours about arrests , executions and disappearances , and of the evacuation of their nationals by several embassies , numerous persons affiliated with FUNCINPEC , BLDP and KNP , including senior political , military and police officials of those parties , parliamentarians , leading activists and supporters , as well as affiliated journalists , reported threats and intimidations and expressed fears for their lives and safety .  
In conclusion , the Special Representative urges the Government to complete its election preparations by agreeing on an appropriate legal framework , establishing an election commission that is clearly independent , taking legal and political steps to establish the Constitutional Council , creating guarantees that would give the political parties equal opportunities to express themselves via the media , demobilizing and disarming the armed troops of political parties , and ensuring political neutrality by all military and security forces .  
The Cambodia Office continued to benefit from the generous support of UNDP in several areas of its work , including the provision of legal advice to the National Assembly , supporting the National Assembly Commission on Human Rights and Reception of Complaints , provision of training for provincial judges and court staff , assisting the Government in developing forensic capability , and provision of training to police , commune leaders and military officers at the provincial level .  
These included deferment of military service for Serbs in the region ; guarantees of Serb political representation at the local , regional and national levels ; and affirmation of the Government 's intention to protect Serbs ' civil and legal rights as required by Croatian law .  
The Convention is recognized as the first truly verifiable global disarmament accord , with a unique , comprehensive and effective verification regime covering both military and industrial facilities .  
On the other hand , it was generally assumed by the Panel members that the measures for prevention should be applied primarily to the small arms and light weapons manufactured to military specifications , because in this case the question has to be addressed on a global basis and because the issue of civilian firearms regulation is currently being taken up by the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice .  
Resources that should be expended on providing a better life for present and future generations are being wasted on war machines and on vain efforts to acquire elusive military security on an individual national basis , instead of reliance on and pursuit of collective security .  
As far as transparency in the conventional weapons sphere is concerned , Jordan is of the view that unless the scope of the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms is broadened to encompass military holdings and procurement through national production , as well as stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction , effective operation of the Register can not be expected in the near future .  
The visits to Kibungo Prison and the communal cachots and the discussions with the civilian , military , prison and judicial officials who met with the Special Representative provided valuable insight into the prevailing conditions of detention and the urgency of conducting fair and effective criminal trials for those accused of genocide and related acts .  
Within this framework , the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms must , if it is to be successful , be expanded to include information on other categories of armaments that are not currently covered , such as nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , in addition to advanced technology with military applications .  
Moreover , the Register must be expanded to include nuclear weapons and sophisticated technology with military applications if it is to become a more balanced instrument , free of all discriminatory criteria , and to have a more global scope and the highest possible number of participants .  
Though we fully realize that peace and security , as well as stability , in the region of the Middle East will be achieved only when a comprehensive , just and lasting settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict in all its dimensions is attained , it is essential to create the necessary climate and security conditions based on equal security for all , security at the lowest level of armament , and security that would not allow for the military superiority of any individual party .  
It should be borne in mind that the expanded verification role of MINUGUA covers a package of agreements signed by the Government of Guatemala and URNG , which include detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues , which are bound together into a national peace agenda . 
New policy perspectives coordinating the commercial , consumer and strategic requirements on a national and international level needed to be established , and the dialogue between military , industry and civilian users needed to be extended .  
The unencumbered balance resulted mainly from savings attributable to lower deployment of civilian and military personnel , availability of rent-free premises and accommodation , lower requirements for transport and communication spare parts than earlier estimated owing to the implementation of the wet lease and self-sustainment arrangements under the new reimbursement procedures for contingent-owned equipment and the continued availability of supplies from existing UNPF stock .  
An average of 96 groundsmen and cleaners were employed under special service agreements to clean a maximum of 88 military locations at a monthly payment equivalent to the lowest grade provided for in the established local salary scales ( $ 915 per month ) .  
Norway firmly believes that the stabilizing presence of a NATO-led military follow-on force , authorized by a Security Council mandate , will also be required after June 1998 , when the current SFOR mandate expires , in order to consolidate our gains and provide vital support to the civilian agencies involved .  
Continued support from a robust and credible NATO-led military force will not least be crucial to a successful completion of IPTF 's efforts to restructure , retrain and reform the local police and judicial system in Bosnia in order to help them handle public security in a manner which is professionally sound , democratic and observant of human and minority rights .  
Reiterates its grave concern at the continuing excessive and increasing levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , and the lack of progress towards any significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;

According to reliable sources available to the Commission , the exiled Rwandan political and military elite located in Nairobi have formed an " invasion group " to plan for the invasion of Rwanda in pincer-movement attacks from the east and the west - the camps in Zaire and United Republic of Tanzania - which would " meet in Kigali " to conquer the country and restore Hutu rule .  
The Council recommended that the Commission be appointed by the Secretary-General and be composed of 5 to 10 impartial and internationally respected persons , including legal , military and police experts , under the chairmanship of an eminent person , and assisted by the appropriate support staff .  
In 1994 , in keeping with its consistent goal of limiting documentation and streamlining its report to the General Assembly , the Special Committee had recommended to the Assembly that , in preparing the general working papers on the Territories , the Secretariat should , where applicable , incorporate under separate headings those sections relating to foreign economic and other interests and those on military activities and arrangements in those Territories .

We have been enthusiastic supporters of all initiatives aimed at limiting the arms trade , in addition to being aware that there are free markets often beyond Government control , we are concerned that the industrialized countries , by lifting embargoes in this field , may begin moving towards the opposite extreme and promote the sale of weapons everywhere , under pressure from the military industry , which has an extremely powerful lobby . 
By building peace , reducing unsustainable military expenditures , promoting equitable and sustainable development and encouraging stable , democratic societies which respect human rights , we not only limit human suffering , but we also address the root causes of conflict itself .  
I wish to reiterate that , while we fully support the noble crusade to protect innocent civilians from anti-personnel landmines , a sweeping ban can not be a satisfactory answer for a country like the Republic of Korea , which faces the real and present risk of a recurrence of all-out war , and whose heavily populated capital is only 25 miles from the military demarcation line .  
More attention should be given to appropriate and timely preventive measures , because we believe that early measures adopted by the international community are the ideal way to avert the outbreak of conflicts and wars and to avoid taking the necessary political and military measures in the aftermath of the conflict let alone imposing half solutions that are often unfair .  
The result of this deliberate inflexibility is the perpetuation of the illegal Turkish occupation of 37 per cent of the territory of the Republic by Turkish military forces , the artificial forceful separation of the two communities , the colonization of the occupied area by illegal settlers from Turkey , the refugee problem , the usurpation of the Greek Cypriot properties in the occupied area and the continued blunt violation by the Turkish side of General Assembly and Security Council resolutions .  
There is strong dissatisfaction in the international community about the fact that while we have a fully functional Tribunal in The Hague , the military and political leaders responsible for the grave violations of humanitarian law and the acts of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Herzegovina remain free .  
I must therefore underline that continued and adequate support from all member States for the Agency 's technical cooperation programme is indispensable if one is to realize the atoms for peace vision , which is the dual quest to prevent the spread of a military use of nuclear technology and to facilitate the transfer of nuclear techniques for peaceful purposes . 
My delegation wishes to emphasize that current realities of the post-cold-war era the diffusion of political , economic and military power among diverse regions of the world require that decisions affecting the maintenance of international peace and security be made in a more representative and democratic manner , mindful of the sovereign equality of all States .  
Equally historic is the balance achieved in civil and military relations , following the successes of April 1996 , when popular pressure and the enormous weight of solidarity on the continent thwarted attempts to take us back to outdated forms of autocracy .  
Nonetheless , several issues are still pending , such as the formalization of an agreement to ban the production and stockpiling of fissile material for military use ; the establishment of adequate and legally binding guarantees for non-nuclear-weapon States ; and the strengthening of existing multilateral safeguard mechanisms .  
While we consider counterproductive the ambition to expand the geographical frontiers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , and while we attach particular importance to efforts to remove nuclear weapons from the territory of foreign military bases in order to limit nuclear arsenals to the territory of the nuclear States , we are also ready to hold consultations on building a balanced system of relations between Belarus and that important military bloc and to work for political , military and strategic equilibrium with all our partners .  
Regrettably , the continuing military occupation by Israeli forces of large areas of Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , the presence of a large number of armed settlers in the occupied territories , the frequent roadblocks and boundary closures and the serious damage caused to the Palestinian economy all of them unilateral measures have a negative impact on the search for a just and peaceful settlement that respects the legitimate rights and claims of all the parties .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
I should like in the present letter to alert you to the fact that between 1 July and 31 December 1996 United States and other warplanes continued to violate the airspace of the Republic of Iraq from military bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and to engage in such hostile , provocative and inflammatory actions as the dropping of heat flares in civilian areas and on civilian installations in Iraq .  
For instance , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions has continued to receive information about massive displacements of populations which have occurred mainly in the context of armed conflicts , including indiscriminate military attacks against civilians during counter-insurgency operations , attacks by irregular armed groups , and communal violence .  
Widespread abuses appear to be ongoing within the context of an oppressive military presence , continuing environmental damage and the cultural subordination of indigenous people in the face of the massive exploitation of resources by powerful multinational corporations .  
In an open challenge to every provision of international humanitarian law , in pursuance of an exclusive military option and by acquiring a large quantity of weapons and logistical support from abroad , the Taliban mercenaries attacked and occupied part of Charikar , the capital of the province of Parwan to the north of Kabul on 16 January 1997 .  
As you may be aware , the agreements on Hebron do not only refer to the redeployment of Israeli military forces in the city , but also to agreed security arrangements , joint security measures , the deployment of the Palestinian police and various civilian matters relating to the normal and effective functioning of the city , and the Israeli and Palestinian populations therein .  
The three country studies are being complemented by comparative analyses of selected United Nations missions , interviews with key personnel in civilian and military peacekeeping as well as national policy makers ; analyses of United Nations documentation and reports with a view to improving coordination between Headquarters and field commanders ; and review of press reports to gauge public reaction to the way in which peacekeeping operations are conducted .  
It is also expected that the Secretariat will inform the Security Council , in accordance with operative paragraph 13 of Council resolution 1076 ( 1996 ) of 22 October 1996 , about the political , military and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan , which will obviously include the recent ethnic cleansing by the Taliban , which has been widely reported and witnessed by impartial observers and the international mass media .  
The Security Council welcomes the letter of 13 January 1997 ( S / 1997 / 27 , annex ) from the Government of Croatia on the completion of the peaceful reintegration of the region under the Transitional Administration , which guarantees the local Serb community representation and a voice at various levels of local , regional and national government , provides for a limited deferment of military service , and affirms the intention of the Government of Croatia to provide the local Serb population with the protection of their legal and civil rights under Croatian law .  
The people of Cuba as a whole are called upon to continue the profound and systematic examination of the annexationist and colonialist plans of the Government of the United States of America included in the Helms-Burton Act as a means of ensuring that in every territory , community , workplace , educational institution and military unit there is full knowledge of the specific consequences that the execution of these plans would entail for each and every citizen , and to guarantee everyone 's active and conscientious participation in the measures needed to defeat them .  
If applicable , assists the Director in preparing methods and procedures for verification of human rights during internal armed confrontation , commitment to strengthening the system for the protection of human rights , commitment relating to security forces and the bearing of arms , military conscription and voluntary nature and behaviour of paramilitary forces ; assists also in following up the verification and evaluating the findings of regional offices . 
On 21 September 1996 , the Vice-President of SLORC , Gen . Maung Aye , is reported to have declared that the military could remain in power longer if elements receiving foreign support caused disorder and on 25 September 1996 , the NLM indicated that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi would soon be charged with political crimes as she was conspiring with former colonial powers and aiding exiled dissident groups in a plot to overthrow the Government .  
In order to cut the main links between the insurgent groups and the civilian population , SLORC has forced entire communities living in the border area between Myanmar and Thailand to move to relocation sites which are subject to tight military control .  
The Special Rapporteur also observes that article 17 of Protocol II Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 requires that , in the case of displacements carried out for the safety of civilians or for imperative military reasons , the responsible party must take all possible measures . . . in order that the civilian population may be received under satisfactory conditions of shelter , hygiene , health , safety and nutrition .  Article 14 of the same instrument also stipulates a prohibition of starvation of civilians under the control of organized armed forces .  
Furthermore , arms sales are also a blatant violation of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 1993 Principles Governing Conventional Arms Transfers , where it is categorically stated that each participating State has to consider the internal and regional situation in and around the recipient country , in the light of existing tensions or armed conflicts , and is obliged to avoid transfers which would be likely to endanger peace , introduce destabilizing military capabilities into a region or otherwise contribute to regional instability .  
The Council also expressed grave concern about the excessive level of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including the introduction of sophisticated weaponry .  
With regard to the military observers , their presence in Angola during the coming months will continue to be required for the verification of the implementation of the remaining tasks of the Lusaka Protocol , the monitoring of the formation of the unified army and the demobilization of excess UNITA and FAA soldiers , as well as verification and investigation of allegations concerning the residual presence of UNITA armed elements and the existence of weapons caches .  
There is a strong tide of international opinion _ which New Zealand supports vigorously _ that rejects the military use of these most indiscriminate weapons when set against the deadly toll extracted on innocent civilians , as well as the economic and developmental loss in countries already devastated by war , and concludes that only a total ban is an acceptable goal .  
The effort has attracted strong and high _ level political support from a large number of countries ; it is overwhelmingly supported by the public , leading NGOs and a growing band of senior military figures .  
Its President 's statement to the Special Rapporteur , the documentation he turned over and his account of the company 's background in the countries where it has concluded specialized service contracts offer an alternate way of looking at things in which military sciences are likely to be taken out of the State context and to move into the private sector where they offer skilled professional services in a free and global market .  
By its own definition , Executive Outcomes is a company devoted to providing highly skilled and confidential military advisor services and to furnishing personnel , mainly military and highly skilled , to provide strategic and tactical training services in countries requiring sophisticated , effective support for the adequate control of their socio-political reality , to put an end to internal conflicts and to encourage the development of economic activities related to natural and mineral resource development .  
Van der Stoel 's allegations concerning mass arrests in northern Iraq are pure fabrications , since everyone is aware of that region 's special status and the consequences of the abnormal situation in which it finds itself , being outside the scope of the State administration due to foreign military intervention and the establishment of air exclusion zones .  
The reported unencumbered balance resulted from savings attributable primarily to ( a ) lower transportation costs than estimated in the budget in respect of repatriation of troops and military observers , civilian police and international staff ; ( b ) fewer rented vehicles and lower requirements for spare parts and maintenance of the vehicle fleet ; ( c ) lower hire / charter costs and aviation fuel charges ; and ( d ) lower actual charges for the shipment of ONUMOZ - and contingent-owned equipment .  
The net additional requirements of $ 536,400 for commercial communications were attributable to the satellite user charges from the previous mandate period ( $ 356,200 ) , recorded in the reporting period because of the late submission of invoices and the extensive use of satellite facilities by the military , civilian police and electoral observer components of the mission in November and December 1994 ( $ 626,000 ) . ( b ) Main trunking contract .  
The second phase of Operation Joint Guard , the stabilization phase , has now begun , and over the coming months SFOR will continue its efforts to keep the peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina by accomplishing its principal military tasks and by providing selective support to the international civil organizations in theatre , thereby contributing to a progressive implementation of broad civilian programmes .  
It is therefore clear that if there is to be genuine improvement in the disturbing situation in the former Sectors , efforts by both international and local organizations to promote confidence and reconciliation will continue to be needed for the foreseeable future .  1 International observers had estimated the total number of killings which had taken place in the former Sectors in circumstances unrelated to the military actions of August 1995 to be at least 120 ( see S / 1995 / 1051 ) .  
The Assistance Mission 's mandate has been revised and extended by the Council in subsequent resolutions , most recently in resolution 1029 ( 1995 ) of 12 December 1995 , which extended the Mission for a final period until 8 March 1996 .  In the same resolution , the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to reduce the military personnel level to 1,400 , to withdraw the civilian police component and to initiate planning for the complete withdrawal of UNAMIR within a period of six weeks after the expiry of its mandate .  
The earlier than anticipated departure , effective 2 February 1996 , of the key military logistic support unit provided to UNAMIR required that the functions of that unit be provided through commercial contractors .  
Contributing to the total additional requirements of $ 162,600 under the meal and accommodation budget line item were daily subsistence allowance payments to military contingent personnel ( $ 16,700 ) recorded in part , under this budget line item ( see para . 10 below ) , and charges for meal allowance paid in the preceding mandate period ( $ 48,600 ) .  
While repatriation travel of staff officers was arranged on commercial aircraft and reflected under other travel costs budget line item ( see para . 10 below ) , other military contingent personnel departed on the UNAMIR-chartered aircraft , with respective costs absorbed under the fixed-wing aircraft heading , resulting in savings of $ 826,600 .  
We would like to express our delight and gratitude to the entire military and civil staff of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan for the devotion and bravery they demonstrated in complicated and often life-threatening situations as they carried out the very difficult duties assigned them by the Security Council .  
On the basis of the bilateral and multilateral treaty instruments signed in recent years , and taking into account the development and intensification of trade and economic relations and also the existence of cooperative links in the past , the parties have reached the conclusion that there is a need to promote in every possible way cooperation in such areas as transport , communications , energy supply , engineering , agriculture , in science and technology and military technology , the environment , humanitarian assistance , tourism , physical culture and sports .  
It would be preferable to support the viewpoint that the prohibited participation by children in military operations should not be designated as direct participation since the actual practice in armed conflicts hardly allows any conclusions to be derived from the proposed distinction between direct and indirect participation by children in the conflict .  
The reason for this is that , although children unquestionably require protection from enlistment in the ranks of these groups , the political and military circumstances of these entities vary to an extent that makes it not only difficult to subject them to a standard rule but also dangerous to accord them international legal status , which might be misinterpreted as granting them implicit recognition .  
However , this criterion must be linked with the preceding one , since such control must be sufficient to enable the armed group or dissident forces to conduct sustained and concerted military operations and to implement the Protocol .  
Turkeys military intervention in northern Iraq and the aerial bombardment of that region , which had provoked a massive population exodus southwards , constituted unacceptable interference in Iraqs internal affairs and had been widely condemned by the international community . 
Encourages Governments , United Nations bodies and organs , the specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as appropriate , to initiate , coordinate or support programmes designed to train and educate military forces , law enforcement officers and government officials , as well as members of the United Nations peace _ keeping or observer missions , on human rights and humanitarian law issues connected with their work , and appeals to the international community to support endeavours to that end ;  
The Advisory Committee requested additional information on the operational requirements that necessitated the increase in troops over the authorized level and was informed that the average troop strength exceeded authorized strength by 166 in May 1996 and by 132 in June 1996 owing to the fact that the repatriation of the former UNCRO engineering battalion had to be postponed to the end of June 1996 , since engineering support was needed to complete the installation of military camps . 
The main activities of the Observer Mission , in addition to the completion of the remaining military tasks , would focus on political , police and human rights aspects , as well as on humanitarian and public information programmes aimed at supporting and consolidating the national reconciliation process , with a view to creating conditions conducive to political stability , economic and social recovery and sustainable development . 
Accordingly , we concur with the Secretary-General 's recommendation to extend the mandate of UNAVEM III until 30 June 1997 , on the understanding that the operation would gradually proceed with the transition towards a United Nations observer mission in Angola to be formally established on 1 July 1997 .  In addition to the completion of the remaining military tasks , the observer mission would focus on political , police and human rights aspects , as well as on humanitarian and public information programmes aimed at consolidating the national reconciliation process .  
Encourages Governments , United Nations bodies and organs , the specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as appropriate , to initiate , coordinate or support programmes designed to train and educate military forces , law enforcement officers and government officials , as well as members of the United Nations peace _ keeping or observer missions , on human rights and humanitarian law issues connected with their work , and appeals to the international community to support endeavours to that end ;  
Such violations shall include , but not be limited to , murder , ill _ treatment or deportation to slave labour or for any other purpose of civilian population of or in occupied territory , murder or ill _ treatment of prisoners of war or persons on the seas , killing of hostages , plunder of public or private property , wanton destruction of cities , towns or villages , or devastation not justified by military necessity ;  
This military putsch , contrary to the basic principles of democracy , is a grave assault against the dignity and free choice of a people who rightly aspire to build a state based on the rule of law after having undergone so many years of instability and civil war .  
The absence of any major incident during the entire process confirmed what had already been demonstrated by the flawless observance of the informal ceasefire since 19 March 1996 , namely , that in addition to their leadership , the combatants on both sides were convinced that the time for military confrontation was over .  
In paragraphs 45 to 47 of my report of 7 February 1997 ( S / 1997 / 115 ) , I described in detail the challenges that would be faced by the administrative component of the follow-on mission , as logistical support would have to be provided to headquarters of the follow-on mission in Luanda , to the political , police , human rights and military components in six regional headquarters , and to almost all provincial capitals and over 30 other outstations .  
In addition to the regular contacts between the Steering Committee and the relevant international organizations , the multinational protection force Command in Tirana has daily contact through its civil military cell with the representatives of the main international organizations .  
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development will be undertaken .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
The second option would be to deploy a United Nations peacekeeping force , composed mainly of African contingents provided with adequate military capability and with sufficient financial and logistical support to fulfil the challenging tasks entrusted to it .  
Croatia 's position is that , with the successful holding of elections , UNTAES has completed the executive part of its mandate : authority over the region should therefore be transferred to Croatia , the UNTAES military component should be withdrawn and the remaining United Nations civilian presence restricted to a monitoring and observation mission pending its replacement by a long-term OSCE observation mission .  
In the Middle East , the Palestinian people and the Arab population in the Syrian Golan , southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley continue to face serious environmental dangers as a result of the continued Israeli occupation of their territories and the growing military threat posed by nuclear , chemical and bacteriological weapons .  
The wealthy Powers preferred to embark on an insane and increasingly expensive arms race which geared their economies to military objectives and diverted funds from aid that could have helped the developing countries .  
Reiterates grave concern at the continuing excessive levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , and the lack of progress towards and significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;  
With the advance of the Allied Democratic Forces for the Liberation of the Congo ( ADFL ) in eastern Zaire and the consequent elimination of rear bases of armed Hutu rebels close to the Burundi-Zaire border , the security situation in Burundi gradually improved during the first months of 1997 , though strong pockets of rebels remained within the former Zaire ( now the Democratic Republic of the Congo ) near Fizi , Kalemie and Moba - enabling them to launch operations against targets in Burundi , including the Government 's military strongholds of Bururi and Makamba provinces .  
This paved the way to military and non _ military approaches to security : peace and security seen not only from a military standpoint but also from that of various disciplines , i.e . technological , legal , economic , political , psychological , religious and environmental .  
In this context we must recall the brutal acts of aggression carried out on Lebanese territory by the Israelis on an almost daily basis , the bombardments by Israeli military aircraft , the use against civilians of proscribed weapons , the naval blockade of Lebanon 's southern coast and the inhumane practices carried out against Lebanese citizens in the occupied area .  
In addition to expertise and support relating to the political , diplomatic and military aspects of designing and negotiating a disarmament , demobilization and reintegration programme , financial and developmental assistance from the international donor community , humanitarian agencies and non-governmental organizations have proven equally essential .  
They also agreed that regular meetings between their senior military and security officials , as well as joint military exercises and patrols and participation in subregional or regional peace operations , would help not only to tackle specific concerns such as controlling the illicit trade in arms and drugs and helping to resolve specific conflicts , but also to enhance overall transparency and confidence among Central African States . 
In our view , and as envisaged in the Register 's founding resolution ( General Assembly resolution 46 / 36 L ) , an expanded Register including data on advanced conventional weapons , on weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear weapons , and on high technology with military applications would represent a more balanced , more comprehensive and less discriminatory instrument attracting a larger number of regular participants . 
The Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } report makes it clear that the peace process has taken a crucial turn and that the progress made during the past two and a half years is threatened by UNITA \ x { e5b8 } delay in implementing its obligations under the Lusaka Protocol : complete military demobilization , facilitation of the Angolan Government \ x { e5b8 } restoration of State administration throughout Angolan territory , the transformation of radio VORGAN into a non-partisan radio station and UNITA \ x { e5b8 } genuine transformation into a political party .  
The lessons learned earlier in Rwanda and Somalia , and in Afghanistan during 1996 , showed that as long as political mediation , military and security operations , emergency relief and development assistance operated largely as independent policy instruments , the international response to large-scale violence would be incoherent and ineffective .  
Under such circumstances , the DPRK long ago put forward to the United States side a proposal that senior military officers of both sides sit down face to face to negotiate the establishment of a new mechanism in conformity with the actual situation in order to deter dangerous situations from arising , and has been waiting with patience for positive response .  
This suffices to prove that the present authorities of south Korea have pursued a more vicious policy of confrontation and war against the northern half of Korea than preceding military fascist regimes .  
It needs to be questioned to what extent this secrecy is compatible with the access to information necessary for democratic practice and social justice and whether , in some cases , instead of contributing to long-term security , it may conceal information about processes ( ecological , financial , military , etc . ) which are a potential threat to everyone and which need therefore to be addressed collectively . 
Given the vast territory of Angola and the deployment of MONUA at Luanda , six regional headquarters and 18 provincial offices , these aircraft are essential in providing support for the transport of military and civilian personnel , the transport of medium and heavy cargo from the Viana logistics base throughout the mission area and for medical and casualty evacuation purposes .  
Furthermore , arms sales to south Cyprus also constitute a violation of the 1993 Principles Governing Conventional Arms Transfers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , where it is categorically stated that each participating State has to consider " the internal and regional situation in and around the recipient country , in the light of existing tensions or armed conflicts " and are obliged to " avoid transfers which would be likely to endanger peace , introduce destabilizing military capabilities into a region , or otherwise contribute to regional instability " .  
The major issues addressed included providing an enabling environment for conversion at both national and local levels ; the role of public and private sectors ; conversion of military bases and defence industries to export processing zones ; tourism development in former military bases and defence complexes ; civilian manufacturing , prospects for small and medium-sized enterprise development ; and continuity of social infrastructure services .  
In the face of the intransigent position of the military junta , which has refused to step down , bringing about further deterioration of the situation in the country , which has one of the world 's lowest living standards , and threatening regional peace and security , the Polish delegation believes that the measures recommended by ECOWAS , which the Security Council would take by adopting the present draft resolution , are appropriate for the objective of the expeditious restoration of the democratically elected Government of Sierra Leone .  
It has done so despite the exceptional circumstances , well known to the international community , that Iraq is experiencing because of the maintenance of the comprehensive embargo imposed on it in August 1990 and because of the brutal military aggression of January 1991 that created highly abnormal conditions in all spheres of civilian life and for all groups of the population .  
In extreme cases , where coercive economic measures are most likely to have important long-term effects , such measures are usually multilateral , comprehensive in scope , extensive in duration and also frequently coincide with civil or other military conflict that also thwarts economic development .  
The systematic and planned killing , deportation , rape , summary execution , abduction , arbitrary detention and looting was perpetrated by the Taliban while Pakistani military personnel accompanied and assisted the Taliban .  
It seems illogical , and indeed morally indefensible , to suggest that armed forces are free to engage in behaviour against citizens of their own country which would be outlawed were they involved in military operations abroad .  
It is my firm belief that for the time being there could be no civil implementation without the strong international military force available immediately to ensure the secure environment , which is also mandatory for the work of the civilian organizations .  
In Cuba , special sanctions are applied to anyone who , while wearing a military uniform or appearing as a public official , violates the physical integrity of a detained woman by sexual abuse or harassment .  
The International Committee was currently developing a model manual for use by armed forces , which would serve as a reference tool for military commanders to incorporate the norms of humanitarian law into the operational decision-making process .  
With regard to the right to a competent , independent and impartial judge , the Special Rapporteur would like to assess the civil and the military faceless judges in light of international standards .  
These seminars have been intended to strengthen the capacity and improve the performance of all public officials _ judicial , administrative , military and law enforcement _ involved in the administration of justice at the prefectural level .  
The effective conduct of such operations required closer integration of political , military , humanitarian and economic actions , as well as collective security efforts at the global and regional levels .  
During the 1980s , the region experienced its longest period of elected Governments and constitutional processes , reduced military spending , and the acceptance by the armed forces of civilian governmental authority .  
The report should have contained a functional analysis of the backstopping requirements of peacekeeping operations as they relate to the implementation of their mandates ( military , civilian police , human rights monitoring , humanitarian , electoral assistance ) .  
There is an increasing trend of more joint satellite missions , both on a national basis ( e.g . by merging military and civilian systems ) and through international cooperation .  
Increased efforts of the Catholic Church and others , along with better understanding of the international humanitarian norms among senior military officers , improved the overall quality of human rights monitoring in East Timor .  
Intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to religion , education , art , science or charitable purposes , historical monuments , hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected , provided they are not military objectives ;  
Intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to religion , education , art , science or charitable purposes , historical monuments , hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected , provided they are not military objectives ;  
While most concepts on transparency in military matters have been developed and implemented in a regional context , on a global scale the international community has moved forward slowly and has made only modest progress so far .  
Greek Cypriot political and military leadership issued provocative statements while air force and naval units engaged in manoeuvres , using live ammunition , which pronounced the element of offence in order to " capture occupied territories " .  
The claim that the Serbian authorities pursue an open policy of genocide and ethnic cleansing supported by brutal military and police action against innocent Albanian civilians is both untrue and ludicrous .  
Intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to religion , education , art , science or charitable purposes , historical monuments , hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected , provided they are not military objectives ;  
Intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to religion , education , art , science or charitable purposes , historical monuments , hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected , provided they are not military objectives ;  
Once an FMCT has been adopted , there would be a reasonable chance that the main nuclear _ weapon States would commit themselves voluntarily to placing irreversible fissile material transferred from military uses to civilian ones under full IAEA safeguards .  
Formed by the political forces hostile to Mobutu , but lacking the resources needed for the achievement of its objective , AFDL accepted military and logistical assistance from friendly countries , including Rwanda and Uganda .  
Destruction of houses , arbitrary indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians and forced relocation of people to unknown sites culminating in what is known as ethnic and tribal cleansing are all deployed as techniques for a show of military might .  
The existence of many internal armed conflicts , some of them attributable to ethnic mistrust and resistance , which extend to the regional level and in which the warring parties resort to the hiring of mercenaries to boost their military potential ;  
On 3 May 1995 , KPA closed the NNSC buildings they controlled on Conference Row and suspended free movement across the military demarcation line into the northern part of the neutral joint security area to the remaining NNSC members and UNCMAC personnel .  
In order to train these units for future missions , the countries members of the Committee have agreed to organize joint military exercises in connection with mock peacekeeping operations , scheduled to be held in south-western Gabon in 1999 .  
In pleading guilty , the former Prime Minister not only acknowledged and confirmed that genocide did indeed occur in Rwanda in 1994 but also indicated that it was organized and planned at the highest levels , both civilian and military .  
It would be appropriate to consider the question of security through a multidimensional approach encompassing military , economic and social aspects at various levels international , regional and national .  
Conflicts based on ethnic , religious or cultural grounds are still emerging in many parts of our planet , claiming innocent lives and precious resources , while the race in military expenditures knows no bounds .  
Other training and reference materials in the pipeline are : a training manual for primary and secondary school teachers ; a training manual for national and local NGOs ; a handbook for parliamentarians ; a trainers guide for military peacekeepers , a training manual for the treatment of victims of domestic violence for the police ; and a handbook on human rights and constitutions .  
Owing to the difficulties experienced by the UNOSOM administration during the life of the Operation which were attributable to the complexity of the political , military and security situation in the mission area , compounded by the magnitude of the residual administrative and financial tasks involved , the originally envisaged time-frame for the completion of the Operations liquidation process proved unrealistic .  
The activities concerned included training for judicial , administrative and military authorities , provision of material and logistical support to judicial authorities , as well as awareness campaigns , selection and training of government officials within ministries to act as human rights focal points , capacity-building for non _ governmental organizations , and training initiatives with a focus on social and economic rights .  
In light of the repatriation of the military engineering support unit during the 1998 / 99 financial period , it is proposed that the Missions civilian staffing establishment be reduced by 5 international and 10 local posts authorized in connection with the deployment of the unit ( see A / 52 / 730 / Add . 2 , paras . 23 and 24 ) .  
Expressing its grave concern about the continuation of the military confrontation in Afghanistan , threatening regional peace and security and causing massive loss of life and extensive human suffering , further destruction of property , serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure , refugee flows and other forcible displacements of large numbers of people ,  
There is a common thread running through the preceding statements that makes unequivocally clear one of the characteristics of the recent armed conflicts that have led to political or military action by this Organization : the fact that their first and principal target has been the civilian population , in particular its most vulnerable sectors children , women , the elderly , the sick , refugees and internally displaced persons .  
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations is currently gathering statistics provided by Member States contributing personnel so as to provide data on the participation of women in their military and civilian police establishments , in order to have a better understanding of the potential to increase the participation of women in peacekeeping in the foreseeable future .  
Support to peacekeeping exercises focuses on the multidimensional and multinational aspects of this training and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations routinely provides not just military and civilian police role players and trainers , but also Special Representatives of the Secretary-General , political , legal and public information staff members and humanitarian , human rights and non-governmental organization coordinators .  
The legislation gives priority to countries which have demonstrated a sustained commitment to poverty alleviation or have recently suffered a major natural disaster , but it excludes countries with excessive military spending , gross violations of human rights , blatant drug trafficking or ethnic conflicts ;  
Noting with grave concern the content of the report of the Commission of Inquiry of the International Labour Organization , [ 5 ] appointed in March 1997 in accordance with article 26 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organization , regarding the observance by Myanmar of the Forced Labour Convention , 1930 ( No .  29 ) , which indicates a widespread and systematic use of forced labour imposed by the military on the civilian population ,  
Gravely concerned about the systematic terrorization of ethnic Albanians , as demonstrated in the many reports , inter alia , of torture of ethnic Albanians , through indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanian citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) by the police and military ,  
We are therefore convinced of the need to address these issues linked with the risk of weaponization of outer space in the CD in a coherent manner and review those gaps and loopholes in existing legal instruments that need to be closed in order to preclude the possibility of military conflicts in , or including , outer space .  
We fully agree with the Norwegian State Secretary when she said last week that excess material that is removed from the military production cycle should no longer have the status of military non _ verifiable material , but gradually be made subject to a transparent , non _ military and civilian regime subject to international verification .  
During the war of liberation ( 1996-1997 ) , which was intended to put an end to the Mobutu dictatorship by restoring to the Congolese people its long-affronted dignity and establishing a State governed by the rule of law and respectful of human rights and fundamental freedoms , the Alliance des Forces Dmocratiques pour la Libration du Congo ( ADFL ) had accepted military and logistical assistance from several friendly countries , including Rwanda and Uganda .  
By virtue of its inherent right of legitimate individual or collective self-defence , the Democratic Republic of the Congo is conducting appropriate military and diplomatic action to regain its sovereignty and territorial integrity , and to make its cause triumphant in the community of nations .  
Indeed , in struggling for a just cause , the Democratic Republic of the Congo is determined to defend itself , not only at the military level ( through the exercise of individual or collective self-defence ) but also at the judicial level ( through an application to the International Court of Justice ) in order to secure the condemnation of the aggressors and just compensation for the damage suffered , including the damage described in this white paper .  
It includes the lack of response to acts of political violence but is also reflected in the almost daily reports of abuses by military and police officials against common people , including killing , rape , illegal arrest or kidnapping for extortion as well as beating and other violent acts .  
The timely response to the recruitment exercise facilitated the expeditious processing of the recruitment of civilian and active military and civilian police personnel , in accordance with established recruitment and placement procedures , involving appointment and promotion bodies which formulated recommendations for selection of the best qualified candidates with due regard to the need to ensure the widest possible geographical basis and with regard to gender .  
Such assessments require a political grasp of the clash of parties , values and interests in the mission area , as well as a solid military , logistical and administrative understanding of the risks , costs and means required for operational effectiveness .  
The Office of Operations leads the planning process by providing the overall framework , developing options for courses of action , leading reconnaissance missions to the field and coordinating and integrating inputs from within the Department and from other entities ( e.g . military , police , humanitarian , electoral , human rights and other aspects including logistics , support and staffing requirements ) into a comprehensive plan for approval by the Security Council .  
Force was especially demonstrated through demands that an " international military presence " , meaning foreign troops , be accepted even before a political settlement was reached , although the scope and character of international presence had been defined in the agreement concluded between Yugoslavia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) . 
We believe that the establishment of a reliable system for European security and stability is possible only on a common European basis with unswerving observance of international law and by making use of the potential of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) as the most representative and universal common European organization capable of dealing with all the challenges of the twenty-first century - political , economic , military and humanitarian ones .  
The decisions of the Constitutional Court clearly show that , in the Colombian legal system , military jurisdiction is of a special and exceptional nature and may handle the offences committed only when the punishable acts have a clear _ cut , close and direct link with official duties .  
This process involved not only the execution of suspected individuals within the leadership of each unit ( including many members of the Government and the Central Committee of the Party ) , but also the repeated wholesale arrest and killing of all of the Party cadres in a unit considered treacherous , such as a particular sector or military division .  
We are convinced that the construction of a reliable system of European security and stability is possible only on a pan _ European basis , in a context of unswerving respect for international law , and using the potential of OSCE as the most representative and universal all _ European organization which can address all the challenges of the twenty _ first century - political , economic , military and humanitarian .  
In its resolution 1193 ( 1998 ) of 28 August 1998 , the Security Council identified a further relevant factor when it noted the fact that despite repeated pleas by the Security Council , the General Assembly and the Secretary-General to halt foreign interference in Afghanistan , including the involvement of foreign military personnel and the supply of arms and ammunition to all parties in the conflict , such interference continued unabated .  
The intensified terror tactics and military assaults by the Yugoslav forces against the ethnic Albanian community in many parts of the province represent the continuation of a systematic repression by the Yugoslav authorities to drive innocent civilians , especially women and children , out of Kosovo , reminiscent of the policy of ethnic cleansing that was carried out during the dark days of the Bosnian crisis .  
Belarus stresses that the use of military force against Yugoslavia without a proper decision of the only competent international body , which is undoubtedly the United Nations Security Council , as well as any introduction of foreign military contingents against the wish of the Government of Yugoslavia , qualify as an act of aggression , with all ensuing responsibility for its humanitarian , military and political consequences .  
The primary causes for these types of violation , one source reported , are the wide gap between the letter of the law and practice by the relevant authorities ; legislation and regulations that lead to the arbitrary detention of political opponents ; the absence of procedural safeguards in the law ; the lack of judicial independence ; and the absence of a separation between the military and the police . 
When the Democratic Republic of the Congo 's painful transition to independence in the 1960s saw the birth of the first armed militias , political leaders , including those in the United Nations , did not gauge what the refugee problem would become 40 years later , with refugee camps transformed into military training and arms-supply facilities , compromising any good-faith attempt to provide humanitarian assistance to vulnerable affected populations .  
By a letter dated 24 March 1999 addressed to the President of the Security Council ( S / 1999 / 320 ) , the representative of the Russian Federation requested that an urgent meeting of the Security Council be convened to consider " an extremely dangerous situation caused by the unilateral military action of NATO against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia " . 
The unencumbered balance of $ 2,556,300 gross ( $ 2,216,500 net ) was attributable to the delayed deployment of civilian personnel , fewer rotation of military observers and a substantial portion of the Missions equipment requirements being obtained through transfers from the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi .  
The unencumbered balance of $ 2,199,100 gross ( $ 2,153,300 net ) resulted primarily from accelerated repatriation of military personnel and reduced requirements for air operations , as well as the fact that staffing and non-staff resources earmarked for the support of the run-off presidential elections were not utilized .  
Demands an immediate halt to all repressive actions undertaken in Kosovo by the Serbian authorities which has led to further ethnic cleansing in the region , the genocide of Kosovars , their forced mass exodus and the destruction of their property with the aim of preventing their return , and also demands the immediate withdrawal of the Serbian military and paramilitary forces from Kosovo ;  
The archive should be organized by major substantive and support tasks , including monitoring ceasefires and buffer zones , protecting humanitarian convoys , disarming and demobilizing ex-combatants , reforming military establishments , defining and establishing police forces , organizing or monitoring elections , monitoring human rights , promoting electoral and judicial reform , promoting aspects of civil administration and coordinating economic rehabilitation .  
Condemning also the massive military operations launched by the Serbian authorities against the unarmed civilians in Kosovo , resulting in large _ scale killings , systematic and planned massacres , destruction of homes and property , and forced mass exoduses to neighbouring countries , as well as internal displacement ,  
In view of the substantial withdrawal of MONUA military units and observers , logistical support provided by the Observer Mission to the civilian police component was augmented both in terms of geographical coverage and the increased number of police observers , which reached their authorized strength of 345 by October 1998 .  
With the completion of the phased withdrawal of UNAVEM III formed military units , the authorized strength of MONUA from 1 March 1998 comprised 90 military observers , 955 contingent personnel , 345 civilian police observers , supported by a civilian establishment of 281 international staff , 225 local staff and 71 United Nations Volunteers .  
Given the vast territory of Angola and the deployment of MONUA at Luanda , six regional headquarters and 18 provincial offices , these aircraft provided air support for the transport of military and civilian personnel , medium and heavy cargo from the Viana logistics base throughout the mission area and for medical and casualty evacuation purposes .  
The continuing violations of the rights of children , in particular through the lack of conformity of the existing legal framework with the Convention on the Rights of the Child , through conscription of children into forced labour programmes , through their military and sexual exploitation and through discrimination against children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
By enlisting enormous military might and by aerial bombardment of the population of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , its infrastructure and economic potentials , NATO has brazenly dropped more than 5,000 tons of the most destructive explosives and used cluster bombs banned by international law , causing enormous human casualties and vast material destruction .  
It is incomprehensible to request the withdrawal of the legitimate forces of a sovereign State from its own territory instead of calling for an urgent ending of foreign military aggression , killing of civilians and destruction of civilian targets .  
Condemning also the massive military operations launched by the Serbian authorities against the unarmed civilians in Kosovo , resulting in large _ scale killings , systematic and planned massacres , destruction of homes and property , and forced mass exoduses to neighbouring countries , as well as internal displacement ,  
The continuing violations of the rights of children , in particular through the lack of conformity of the existing legal framework with the Convention on the Rights of the Child , through conscription of children into forced labour programmes , through their military and sexual exploitation and through discrimination against children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
We would also like to know what measures the NATO members intend to take , and when , to stop and correct the overt , flagrant and continuing violation of the obligations they have undertaken , and how they plan to compensate for the economic and other damage to Yugoslavia and its citizens after the halting of military action against this sovereign member State of OSCE .  
The use of such personnel had been expanded from the traditional area of technical cooperation to other sectors such as military planning , logistical support for peacekeeping operations , disarmament , humanitarian assistance , internal oversight , economic and social research and administration and management .  
It urges the Government of Colombia to establish as soon as possible the necessary measures to guarantee a truly independent judicial system , to ensure the transfer of all judicial procedures concerning serious human rights violations currently under military penal jurisdiction to the jurisdiction of the ordinary justice system and to separate the functions of the executive and the judiciary .  
The budgets provide for the continued deployment of 1,350 military contingent personnel and 24 police officers , supported by an increased civilian staffing establishment of 114 international staff , 111 local staff and 13 United Nations Volunteers , with provisions for the Missions liquidation reflected in the proposed 1999 / 00 budget .  
The revised budget for 1998 / 99 also provides for the replacement of obsolete and damaged refrigeration , water-purification and industrial laundry equipment required to support the MINURCA military personnel after the departure of the French logistical contingent .  
For operational reasons , in view of a substantial quantity of military-pattern equipment provided to the MINURCA military contingents by the Government of France as a voluntary contribution in kind , increased provisions are also made for the supply under letter-of-assist arrangements of essential required spare parts and other matriel required to maintain those assets .  
We appeal to the members of NATO to think before it is too late and to immediately halt their military action which has already brought such untold suffering to hundreds of thousands of people , created a humanitarian catastrophe and thrown Europe backwards into the distant past .  
Further escalation of military action , barbaric bombings of industrial , social , cultural and civilian targets and the peaceful population are all assuming horrible proportions .  
The strategic framework is to comprise integrated and coordinated actions for addressing any combination of political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic factors .  
The unencumbered balance of $ 4,571,900 gross ( $ 4,275,100 net ) resulted from reduced requirements as follows : military personnel costs ( $ 83,000 ) , civilian personnel costs ( $ 4,368,400 ) , operational costs ( $ 2,247,300 ) and staff assessment ( $ 296,800 ) ; these were offset by additional requirements amounting to $ 2,423,600 as follows : other programmes ( $ 19,300 ) and United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi ( $ 2,404,300 ) ( A / 53 / 908 , annex II ) .  
The Security Council must endorse the proposals which , among other things , would pave the way for a verifiable end to violence and ethnic cleansing in Kosovo , the withdrawal of Yugoslav military , police and paramilitary forces , the establishment of an interim administration in the province , the safe and free return of refugees and a political settlement providing self-government for Kosovo .  
We wish to recall the declaration of the Ministerial Meeting of the OIC Contact Group , held in Geneva on 7 April 1999 ; to confirm our strong condemnation of the policy of ethnic cleansing perpetrated by the Serbian authorities against the Albanian Kosovars ; and to demand an immediate halt to all repressive actions undertaken in Kosovo by the Serbian authorities and the immediate withdrawal of the Serbian military and paramilitary forces from Kosovo .  
Notwithstanding its own difficult economic situation , which , in fact , is complicated by economic losses caused by the ongoing military actions in Yugoslavia , Ukraine is contributing to international efforts by providing humanitarian aid to refugees from Kosovo .  
In this regard , progress has been made in many developing countries where public spending on education and health has increased against a background of fiscal adjustment under IMF-supported programmes . 11 At the same time , unproductive public expenditure , such as excessive military spending , should be avoided or reduced ; 
The revised budget for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 is therefore based on the maintenance of 1,350 military contingent personnel , 24 civilian police officers supported by the increased ( from 1 March 1999 ) civilian staffing establishment of 114 international staff , 111 local staff and 13 United Nations Volunteers .  
The former CIA official stated in this article that the National Security Advisor , Samuel R . Berger , justified the action against the factory by claiming that the plant was part of the " Sudanese military industrial complex " , that it was heavily guarded , that it produced no medicines and that its ownership trail led to terrorist chief Osama bin Laden .  
Following these informal consultations , the President made a statement to the media , on behalf of the members of the Council , expressing their concern at renewed fighting and their support for ECOWAS and other international efforts to bring peace ; calling upon all parties to halt military operations and allow the free flow of humanitarian assistance ; and urging all parties to renew their commitments to the Abuja peace process and to respect the ceasefire of 3 February .  
The members of the Council also expressed their support for renewed and urgent diplomatic efforts to reverse this negative cycle on the military , political , security and humanitarian fronts .  
The members of the Council expressed concern over the sporadic renewal of fighting , and called on all parties to halt military operations , respect international humanitarian law and facilitate the free flow of humanitarian assistance to affected populations .  
Thirdly , the adoption of a renewed Strategic Concept by a regional military alliance _ despite the declared end of the cold war _ is bound to generate considerable concern in the wide spectrum of nuclear and non _ nuclear States .  
A staff member , other than one recruited specifically for a mission , who has completed one year of satisfactory probationary service or who has a permanent appointment and who is called upon to serve in the armed forces of the State of which the staff member is a national , whether for training or active duty , may be granted special leave without pay for the duration of such military service , in accordance with terms and conditions set forth in appendix C to these Rules .  
Staff members who have completed one year of satisfactory probationary service or who have a permanent appointment may , if called by a Member Government for military service , whether for training or active duty , be placed on special leave without pay for the duration of their required military service . 
We have to come to grips with some very urgent questions , including the guarantee for the safe and unimpeded return of all refugees and displaced persons who have been forcibly expelled from their homes and villages in the wake of the heinous policy of ethnic cleansing that has been carried out by the Yugoslav military , police and paramilitary forces in Kosovo at the behest of the leadership in Belgrade .  
On the one hand , they are expected to hurt the economy because of the shortfall in revenue and the loss of jobs , while on the other , a more expedient handover of deteriorating facilities on lands held by the military would expedite land development projects , including a proposed free trade zone and the construction of affordable housing .  17 .  According to the administering Power , the residents of Guam have seen many improvements in the islands standard of living over the last several years .  
This includes regular army and naval forces , armed civilian groups , associated paramilitary groups , air forces , national guards , border police , army reserves , military police , intelligence services , federal and Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs local , special , riot and anti-terrorist police , and any other groups or individuals so designated by the international security force ( KFOR ) commander ;  
This process was very complicated from both the legal and technical perspectives and required a lot of resources and international assistance , so for us it seems disgraceful and unjust that in the context of mentioning countries which have abandoned their military nuclear programmes or forsworn nuclear weapons the name of our country is sometimes not even found .  
The fragile peace that has now been maintained in the region for five years thanks to the military and political balance that has been established and to the efforts of the international community must not be made dependent on the nationalist ambitions of Azerbaijan 's present leaders .  
It is not possible to understand this process of gradual but incessant erosion of the indigenous peoples ' original sovereignty , without considering and , indeed , highlighting the role played by juridical tools , always arm in arm with the military component of the colonial enterprise .  
Jurists ( with their conceptual elaborations ) , domestic laws ( with their imperativeness both in the metropolis and in the colonies ) , the judiciary ( subject to the rule of [ non-indigenous ] law ) , one-sided international law ( its enforcement assured by military means ) and international tribunals ( on the basis of existing international law ) were all present to validate juridically the organized plunder at the various stages of the colonial enterprise .  
These included the bringing of armed civilian groups under strict control and the prompt arrest and prosecution of those who incited or threatened to use violence , a ban on rallies by armed groups , the redeployment of Indonesian military forces , the immediate institution of a process of laying down of arms by all armed groups to be completed well in advance of the holding of the ballot and the freedom of association and expression of all political forces and tendencies .  
Plans of action have been established at country operational level , focussing on key areas requiring protection and assistance measures ; sexual exploitation and violence ; under-age military recruitment ; education ; and unaccompanied minors and adolescents ; all of which are fundamental to addressing the needs of girls more effectively .  
UNTAES was created in an environment favourable to its ultimate goal of peaceful reintegration of the formerly occupied Croatian territory : we had the agreement of the parties to the conflict ; recourse to the military option was unattractive to all interested parties ; and the political goal of peaceful reintegration was clearly set and known , as well as supported by the political will of the host Government , the international community and the skilled United Nations leadership in the field .  
This was undertaken in pursuance of resolution 51 / 39 , in which the Assembly had requested the Secretary-General to update and further develop an earlier report dated 17 October 1990 , entitled Scientific and technological developments and their impact on international security ( A / 45 / 568 ) , in order to evaluate the impact of recent scientific and technological developments , in particular those which have potential military applications .  
Following on the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa ( S / 1998 / 318 ) , the Council addressed this question last year in its resolution 1208 ( 1998 ) which , in unequivocal terms , called on all concerned to respect the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and condemned the use of such camps by combatants for the furtherance of military aims .  
Japan , from the first days of its aggression against Korea , especially during the nearly half a century-long period of its military occupation of and colonial rule over Korea from the early twentieth century , pillaged and destroyed a considerable amount of valuable cultural property , which the Korean people had handed down with utmost care generation after generation .  
Firmly announces that all foreign military recruits to be captured by the armed forces of the Islamic State of Afghanistan will be considered as criminals and would be directed to the security authorities of the State for prosecution and punishment in accordance with Afghanistan 's criminal code of 1976 , which prescribes severe punishment against those who are committing crimes against the internal and external security of the State ;  
The CN-235 and the unknown type of Turkish military aircraft violated the national airspace of the Republic of Cyprus , flying over the area of Mesaoria , before landing at the illegal airport of Tymbou in the occupied area of the Republic , from where they departed on the same day , returning to the FIR of Ankara .  
In this connection , there is an obvious need for international legal regulation of the worldwide development of civilian and military information technology , and for the formulation of a coordinated international policy on information safety that meets the needs of international security .  
This provides for the gradual phasing in of an additional 140 military observers , the establishment of a second-line medical capability with 35 medical personnel and the expansion of the Observer Mission by 59 international civilian and 21 local staff as well as for the required logistical support .  
These include : ( a ) a desire by State or non-State actors in conflict situations to disrupt humanitarian operations which they consider undermine their own political , strategic or military goals ; ( b ) a desire to remove actual or potential witnesses to human rights abuses and other violations of international law ; and ( c ) a general mistrust and suspicion of the motives and intentions of humanitarian organizations .  
Furthermore , our feelings of incredulity and indignation are accompanied by the conviction that many of the economic and social problems which overwhelm and cause distress to the majority of human beings could be alleviated in considerable measure if only a fraction of the resources devoted to military expenditures were utilized for the noble objective of the progress and well-being of the peoples of the world .  
Refrain from developing military capacity beyond their legitimate defence requirements , while at the same time reaffirming their resolve to achieve the necessary degree of security and mutual confidence with the lowest possible levels of troops and weaponry , and adhere to the Convention on Chemical Weapons . 12 .  The European Union is convinced that greater transparency in military issues will induce stability at the regional level .  
" The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the deteriorating political , military and humanitarian situation in Angola , at the suffering of the people and at the dramatic increase in the number of internally displaced persons , which has now reached well over two-million people , not including the unknown number of internally displaced persons in areas which are currently inaccessible to humanitarian agencies .  
All these initiatives have been carried out despite the climate of uncertainty prevailing throughout the country , characterized by potential and actual food shortages , a hard-to-reach population scattered throughout Katanga , and a volatile situation in Kasa hindering the effective distribution of humanitarian assistance ( scattered population , heavy military presence , etc . ) . 
In fact , evidence obtained by the military authorities of the Islamic State of Afghanistan on the command and control of military campaigns , the extensive use of heavy artillery and superior air power and the use of night vision equipment to advance in the dark clearly casts aside all doubts about the discernible direct and large-scale Pakistani involvement in Afghanistan and overt military assistance to the Taliban .  
We believe that the renewed military escalation that began at the end of last month , as is the case every summer , is sufficient proof of the repetitive pattern of chronic fighting that is prolonging the political uncertainty and deepening the misery of the Afghan people by causing many casualties among the innocent population .  
The international community and its organizations and , in particular , the Conference on Disarmament , must make genuine endeavours to agree to an international convention on the prohibition of the production and use of depleted uranium for military purposes , and the existing international conventions relating to environmental protection must be strengthened by additional measures to deter parties from failing to respect environmental laws .  
Resources should be allocated to basic priority human concerns , for example , moving away from military towards social spending and shifting the focus to better education , health services and safe water accessible to people living with poverty .  
IMF policy advice , financial and technical assistance has sought to improve the quality of public expenditure by shifting resources away from unproductive outlays , such as excessive military expenditure , to infrastructure , basic education and health care , which build physical and human capital and thus enhance broad-based growth and equity , and to target poverty alleviation programmes .  
Without obviating the need to clarify , refine , update and expand the rules of customary international and treaty law to combat mercenary activity , it should be established as a principle that , in essence , the aim of such rules is to condemn mercenary acts in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to the humanitarian standards that apply to armed conflicts and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
The Special Rapporteurs point of view has already been stated : the international community can not , without undermining the principles on which its very existence is based , allow the globalized market to function as well for the free and unrestricted sale of military assistance and active peacekeeping and peace-building operations that are the province of international organizations .  
Mr . President , even at this late stage , Pakistan is committed to pursuing contacts and consultations with all the members of the international community in order to evolve a broadly agreed approach to deal with the threats to regional and global peace and security emerging from Indias political and military ambitions as revealed in its nuclear doctrine .  
Links are being forged or strengthened with international , regional and sub-regional organizations ; academic and other institutions ; international financial institutions ; the private sector ; members of civil society ; and even military organizations and police structures .  
We are therefore grateful to the Secretary-General for his ideas expressed in the report and for his bold approach to the issues of political and military action in cases of systematic and widespread violations of international law , especially those ideas expressed in paragraph 67 of his report .  
Finally , coordination between the human rights and humanitarian components of United Nations operations , on the one hand , and political and military components , on the other , will help ensure sharing of information needed to assess the likelihood of mass exoduses and formulate and implement strategies to prevent , prepare for and respond to these emergencies in an effective and comprehensive manner .  
The military aspects provide for an immediate ceasefire , the release of hostages within three days ( although this concept is unclear , since those whom RCD regard as hostages are considered by the Kinshasa Government to be protected persons ; the word hostages is not defined in annex A ) , a joint military commission , and an international peacekeeping force administered by the United Nations . 
The Netherlands calls for a coherent and integrated approach to conflict prevention and conflict resolution in which the diplomatic , political , military , economic and humanitarian aspects , as well as development assistance , are treated as integral parts .  
It is indeed very disturbing that , not only are external forces continuing to fuel the fighting inside Afghanistan with deliveries of ammunition and other war-making materials , but an increasing number of other nationals are taking part in the actual combat , as well as the planning of military offensives .  
The Department for Disarmament Affairs has continued consultations with international and regional organizations receiving reporting on military expenditures and has received their views and comments on the recommendations contained in the previous report of the Secretary-General ( A / 53 / 218 ) deriving from the consultations held on 23 April 1998 .  
All international disputes and regional conflicts should be resolved in a fair and reasonable manner through peaceful negotiation and consultation on the basis of equality , rather than through the arbitrary use or threat of force based on the power of military superiority .  
The international community now takes military action to deal with tragedies that only a few years ago would have left us indifferent , and yet we are still influenced by military assessments , strategic interests , regional solidarity , public opinion and the magnitude of any human rights violations .  
In the opinion of Poland , costs borne by the international community in connection with the imposition of sanctions are usually significantly lower in material as well as in human dimensions than potential costs of military or peacekeeping operations that could be needed in cases when sanctions are not imposed or the sanctions regime is not fully observed .  
It also reminded States with a system of compulsory military service , where such a provision has not already been made , of its recommendation that they provide for conscientious objectors various forms of alternative service which are compatible with the reasons for conscientious objection , of non-combatant or civilian character , in the public interest and of not punitive nature .  
It was stressed that international efforts to assist refugees and seek solutions to their plight should be equitable and based on human need , regardless of the nationality , race , geographic , political or military importance of the refugee population .  
The Security Council mission stated in its report ( S / 1999 / 976 and Corr . 1 , para . 14 ) that the violence could not have occurred without the involvement of large elements of the Indonesian military and police , and concluded that the Indonesian authorities were either unwilling or unable to provide the proper environment for the peaceful implementation of the 5 May Agreement ( para . 19 ) , a state of affairs which had not been altered by the imposition of martial law .  
The tasks of the United Nations force would be to maintain a secure environment throughout the territory of East Timor , to provide direct security for United Nations personnel and property , to monitor the prompt and complete withdrawal of any remaining Indonesian military and security personnel , to take measures to disarm and demobilize armed groups and to assist humanitarian activities as appropriate , including the safe return of refugees and internally displaced persons .  
Authorizes the establishment , for an initial period of six months until 15 April 2000 , of the United Nations Office in Angola ( UNOA ) staffed with the personnel necessary to liaise with the political , military , police and other civilian authorities , with a view to exploring effective measures for restoring peace , assisting the Angolan people in the area of capacity-building , humanitarian assistance , the promotion of human rights , and coordinating other activities ;  
Authorizes the establishment , for an initial period of six months until 15 April 2000 , of the United Nations Office in Angola ( UNOA ) staffed with the personnel necessary to liaise with the political , military , police and other civilian authorities , with a view to exploring effective measures for restoring peace , assisting the Angolan people in the area of capacity-building , humanitarian assistance , the promotion of human rights , and coordinating other activities ;  
Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,  
It was therefore truly regrettable that violations of such principles continued to occur , as in the imposition of the aerial exclusion zones in northern and southern Iraq by two permanent members of the Security Council , the continuing military attacks on Iraq and the interference in its internal affairs .  
The Courts inadequate jurisdictional safeguards especially as applied to nationals of States that had not acceded to the Statute might inhibit responsible international military efforts in support of humanitarian or peacekeeping objectives .  
Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
Underscores that , as pointed out by the Commission to Follow Up the Implementation of the Peace Agreements , key reforms remain outstanding , including the fiscal , judicial , military and electoral reforms , and , therefore , stresses the critical importance of continued compliance with the peace agreements in 2000 ;  
You are , of course , aware of the economic embargo of the past nine years and of the fact that these years have been punctuated by constant military assaults , planned and carried out by the United States , targeting all aspects of life and based on the refusal of that country to allow the people of Iraq to live a life of dignity and exercise its free and independent will .  
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,  
As indicated in paragraph 2 of the report of the Secretary-General ( A / 54 / 355 ) , the package of agreements signed by the Government of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca ( URNG ) included detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues , which were consolidated into a comprehensive peace agenda .  
The proposed budget of UNMIK for the period from its inception on 10 June 1999 to 30 June 2000 provides for a total strength of 9,812 personnel , including 38 military liaison officers , 4,718 civilian police , 1,269 international staff , 3,566 local staff , 18 National Officers and 203 United Nations Volunteers , and amounts to $ 456,451,200 gross , inclusive of the commitment authority of $ 200-million already authorized by the General Assembly in its resolution 53 / 241 of 28 July 1999 .  
The tasks of the United Nations force would be to maintain a secure environment throughout the territory of East Timor , to provide direct security for United Nations personnel and property , to monitor the prompt and complete withdrawal of any remaining Indonesian military and security personnel , to take measures to disarm and demobilize armed groups and to assist humanitarian activities as appropriate , including the safe return of refugees and internally displaced persons .  
The military incursions in northern Iraq violated its sovereignty and territorial integrity and had forced a withdrawal of the central administration from those areas , turning them into a breeding ground for factional infighting and bloody conflict .  
The EU stresses its concern at the use of diamonds , gold and other resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to fund military operations in the region , and calls on all the parties to ensure that all commercial dealings of this nature are legal under the relevant domestic and international law , transparent , consistent with States ' arrangements with the international financing institutions , and benefit the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and not private individuals .  
Expressing its grave concern about the continuation of the military confrontation in Afghanistan , threatening regional peace and security and causing massive loss of life and extensive human suffering , further destruction of property , serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure , refugee flows and other forcible displacements of large numbers of people ,  
The Panel finds that expenses relating to activation of the nuclear and radiological emergency plan are , in principle , compensable as reasonable precautionary and preventative measures to protect against a potential spillover effect from Iraqs military operations against the Israeli nuclear reactor .  However , the evidence is insufficient to enable the Panel to verify the claim .  
In response to increasing reports of violence and human rights abuses attributed to Indonesian government forces since the beginning of the year , the Special Rapporteur had repeatedly sent urgent appeals to the Government urging the authorities to protect the safety and integrity of the civilian population in East Timor and to ensure that the police and military were conducting their operations in strict compliance with international human rights and humanitarian law standards . 
Condemning the grave violations of human rights in Kosovo that affected ethnic Albanians prior to the arrival of personnel of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and troops of the international security presence , the Kosovo Force , as demonstrated in the many reports of torture , indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by the Yugoslav police and military ,  
While the military authorities and police had improved their methods and capabilities for combating drug trafficking by acquiring greater logistical , financial and human resources , international cooperation still remained essential , since it enabled the States concerned to exchange reliable information and advanced technologies .  
With regard to accountability of United Nations military and civilian police observers for losses of or damage to United Nations property caused by them , the current common practice in field missions is to withhold two weeks of mission subsistence allowance entitlements prior to the departure of the military or police observers concerned , in respect of cases in which they are involved , pending the taking of a decision by the Headquarters Property Survey Board .  
Underscores the fact that , as pointed out by the Commission to Follow up the Implementation of the Peace Agreements , key reforms remain outstanding , including the fiscal , judicial , military and electoral reforms , and therefore stresses the critical importance of continued compliance with the peace agreements in 2000 ;  
Article 40 of the Military Service Act provides that any person who fails to present himself for the military service medical examination to determine his physical fitness and ascertain whether he is suffering from any contagious disease or disability that would preclude his enlistment for military service is liable to a fine ranging from 30 to 100 dinars .  
It was also printed out that compulsory military service does not consist solely in combat duties ; there are many administrative , technical and clerical posts in which military service can be performed in a manner consistent with every persons physical and mental aptitudes .  
The Permanent Mission of Kuwait also informed the Secretary-General that ( i ) n the few cases in which objection is expressed to compulsory military service , most of the persons concerned are found to be suffering from psychological and nervous disorders and such cases are exempted from military service .  
Although Mexican legislation does not recognize the right to conscientious objection , the Ministry of National Defence is empowered under the Military Service Act and Regulations to exempt those persons who do not meet the requirements for military service , including on the grounds of physical , moral or social impediments as provided in article 10 of the Act and the Regulations .  
The interviews with political , military and police authorities , public officials , accused persons , witnesses and victims of the attacks , and members of the public chosen at random in Havana , formed a body of first-hand material as a basis for as thorough and objective an investigation as possible into the subject assigned to the Special Rapporteur .  
According to the information received by the Special Rapporteur and the observations he has made during his various missions , mercenary activities continue to be carried on both through traditional means of recruitment and hiring and in new forms , including recruitment by private companies offering military security services , which take part in armed conflicts in specific countries by virtue of contracts signed with Governments .  
All training activities carried out under the OHCHR technical cooperation programme continue to include sessions on the human rights of women , with a specific focus on concerns relevant to each professional group addressed by the training - judges , police officers , members of non-governmental organizations , government officials , military , peacekeeping personnel , human rights monitors and others .  
Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
The military authorities specifically reiterated their public pledge not only to support the ongoing peace and democratic processes but also to transform the armed forces into a more professional republican army subordinate to civilian authorities following the elections .  
Georgia , as a democratic State guided by the principles of humanism and strictly adhering to its international commitments , could not deny grant of asylum to thousands of women , children and elderly people fleeing military operations , or deny medical assistance to the sick and seriously wounded . 
The excesses of the so-called military justice , a regular cause of arbitrary detention and impunity for human rights violations , as demonstrated by cases brought before the Working Group , have prompted the Group , in its recommendations in previous reports , to underline the need for an international conference to analyse the subject and seek to limit the actual powers of the military justice system ;  
Meanwhile , short - and medium-term measures include confidence-building at the regional and global levels , transparency in the field of armaments , a steady reduction of military expenditures , the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in the interim .  
We are troubled to see that in a world dominated by a single military and technological Power , we are today less safe than during the difficult years of the cold war .  
This policy has also included the organization and support of armed groups ; air and naval raids against our territory ; the hatching of over 600 plots to assassinate the leader of our revolution ; a military invasion by a mercenary army ; the most serious threat ever of a global nuclear conflict , in October 1962 ; and finally , a brutal commercial and financial blockade and a ferocious economic war against my country that have now lasted 40 years .  
Because of this situation , the world has witnessed a series of deep and rapid-moving changes that have led to the emergence of many areas of political and military conflicts with dangerous consequences reflected in the human , economic and social conditions of many regions in the world .  
As we approach the new millennium , Egypt hopes that international efforts will be directed steadfastly towards the liquidation of established military arsenals , the implementation and universality of disarmament agreements and the achievement of their ultimate goal , which is the welfare of humankind and the provision of a safer world for future generations , a world free of nuclear risks and environmental threats .  
In the context of nuclear energy development , Russia considers the reduction and disposal of nuclear armaments to be connected with the peaceful use of the tremendous scientific and technological potential that used to be the exclusive domain of military programmes .  
In Syria we look forward to a Middle East region where a just , lasting and comprehensive peace prevails , a peace based on international legality , not on expansion , occupation and the monopoly of nuclear military power , which can only lead to increased tension in the Middle East .  
Although humanitarian action takes place in contexts in which political , economic , social and military factors are inextricably connected , it is absolutely vital for humanitarian institutions to preserve the strictly non-political and impartial character of their mission .  
Here we saw the iron curtain descend on Europe , that line of separation which subsequently hung for several decades and embodied multi-faceted confrontation ideological , political , military and economic confrontation between totalitarian and democratic systems .  
The sponsors have included land as a natural resource in this operative paragraph because the Special Committee has been informed of a desire by petitioners from one particular Territory that all unused and excess land not required for military purposes be returned to the original landowners .  
The Second Protocol goes further to develop the Conventions protective powers with regard to military involvement and the need to strengthen the system of protection for those categories of cultural property deemed of vital importance to mankind or whose exceptional cultural and historical value is recognized by national legislation .  
There is no doubt that this report assumes special importance at a time when we are experiencing an increasing need to deepen and enhance cooperation between the two organizations in development , social , economic , military , political , diplomatic and other fields , all of which aim at serving the common interests of the African continent in general , and at upgrading the structure and institutional capacities of the OAU , in particular . 
With a unified currency , with unified political , economic and foreign policies , with defined borders and now with the planned military deterrence force of its own , it is obvious that a regional seat is a logical necessity and consequence .  
While most concepts on transparency in military matters have been developed and implemented in a regional context , progress on the global level has been modest , and much remains to be done by the international community .  
In Europe the only military bloc left over from the cold war , under its new strategic concept , bypassed the United Nations Security Council and bombed , with the worlds most powerful and sophisticated military machinery , a weak sovereign State , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , turning the Balkan region , which has experienced so much misery in this century , into a testing ground for its new strategy .  
The Working Group was concerned at the continuing abusive treatment of women , including custodial deaths , torture , rape , abduction , disappearances , arbitrary arrests , forced abortions and sterilizations , harassment and arson by security forces , including military and police forces , or by other governmental authorities , particularly where separatist movements were reported .  
The enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights is hindered by the absence of the rule of law , the existence in Nigeria of military governments , the suspension of the Constitution in favour of rule by military decree and the concomitant resort to intimidation , and the negative effects of widespread corruption on the functioning of governmental institutions .  
Globalization had taken real power from States and vested it in an apparatus governing the world ' s political , financial , economic and military systems , consisting principally of the Group of Seven , IMF , the World Bank , WTO ( and , by extension , the major transnational corporations ) , the Security Council and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .  
Recalling its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
It is no secret that the Government of the United Kingdom joined the United States administration in carrying out its threats to use force , heedless of the Security Council , the United Nations and world public opinion , in its comprehensive military attack on Iraq from 16 to 20 December 1998 , which destroyed a large number of Iraqi civilian installations and led to the death and injury of a large number of Iraqi people .  
The general trend , noticeable to varying degrees in the provinces visited , was the gradual dismantling of the larger camps for the displaced and regrouped and the creation of smaller , decentralized sites , located near military outposts and inhabited by people from the neighbouring hills .  
Once again he drew the attention of the Burundi authorities to the urgent need to ensure the observance of international standards of humanitarian law and human rights , which prohibited indiscriminate attacks against the civilian population and civilian targets during military operations .  
At the initiative of Burkina Faso , joint military exercises , entitled Kompienga Unity 98 , for the purpose of training personnel for peacekeeping operations was held from 16 to 21 April 1998 ; the armed forces of Benin , Burkina Faso , Cte dIvoire , Ghana , the Niger , Nigeria , Togo and Chad had taken part in the exercises , in which a great deal of attention had been given to humanitarian issues .  
Peacekeeping operations had originally been intended as a means of controlling dangerous regional conflicts and had involved such tasks as monitoring ceasefires , separating hostile parties and maintaining buffer zones , whereas today the proliferation of conflicts stemming from various factors had resulted in more complex missions , involving political , military and humanitarian activities simultaneously . 
While it acknowledged the independence of the mandates of individual organizations , the Republic of Belarus , on the basis of Article 53 of the Charter of the United Nations , considered inadmissible any unilateral enforcement action carried out by regional arrangements , especially in the military sphere , without the relevant authorization of , or circumventing , the Security Council .  
While obviously limited in payload mass , volume and power , but with very real and attractive advantages in terms of cost and response time , microsatellites complemented traditional large satellites by providing an alternative gap-filler for affordable quick-response or exploratory missions with both civil and military objectives .  
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,  
Since the beginning of 1998 , the Serbian military and police forces had launched a military attack against the Albanian population which had left thousands of innocent victims , including pregnant women , children and elderly people.They had deliberately shelled Albanian villages , destroying one third of the houses and forcing more than 300 , 000 people to flee , and had brought about a catastrophic humanitarian situation , with people living in the open without shelter , food or medical assistance .  
Realizing that education was a necessary condition for the protection of human rights , it had introduced universal primary education and had embarked , in cooperation with regional organizations and the United Nations , on a national human rights education programme for all population groups and particularly officials in the judiciary or the executive , legislative and military branches . 
Hiring private companies providing security and military assistance and advice is no substitute for maintaining a collective regional security system and genuinely professional national armed forces and security forces loyal to the democratic legal order.It is a false solution . 
Without obviating the need to clarify , refine , update and expand the rules of customary international and treaty law to combat mercenary activity , it should be established as a principle that , in essence , the aim of such rules is to condemn a mercenary act in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to the humanitarian standards that apply to armed conflicts and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
In the previous report he submitted to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ fourth session ( E CN . 4-1998-31 ) , the Special Rapporteur dealt fully with private companies operating in the international market offering security services and military assistance and advice , normally matters reserved for the State and for which the State must assume responsibility .  
These companies are developing their offers more and more aggressively , putting forward arguments for legitimacy based on military efficiency , cheaper operations , their personnel ' s proven experience and an alleged comparative advantage that would make it feasible or desirable to hire them for peace _ building or peacekeeping operations such as those conducted by the United Nations or ECOWAS .  
The Political Constitution of the Republic of Costa Rica of 1949 , which is still in force , stipulates in its article 12 that the army as a permanent institution is proscribed , that military forces may be organized only through continental agreement or for the national defence and that they shall always be subordinate to the civil power .  
The projection provides for the retention in MINURCA of 1 , 350 military personnel , inclusive of the 35 additional military personnel referred to in paragraph 44 of my main report , and 25 civilian police advisers , supported by 179 international and local staff .  
On 6 January 1993 , the United States , the United Kingdom and France each handed our Permanent Representative in New York a written position in which , after making reference to the imposition of a no-fly zone south of parallel 32 , they stated that Iraqi military aircraft had been recurrently observed in the said zone in violation of the no-fly zone and that Iraq had moved SAM missile batteries to new sites south of parallel 32 , thus posing a threat to the aircraft of those States .  
They demanded that the missile batteries be withdrawn and returned to their original sites within 48 hours of the date of the above position ; that there should be no flights of any civilian or military fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters south of the 32 nd parallel ; and that Iraq should undertake no illumination or tracing by radar of any aircraft and should flash no signals indicating a hostile intention .  
While military observers and most of the international civilian staff left the mission area by 30 September 1997 as scheduled , owing to the unforeseen scope and complexity of residual administrative tasks involving , inter alia , the re-creation of the Missions financial records lost during hostilities in April 1996 , the Missions in situ liquidation was extended until 28 February 1998 , with a small liquidation team continuing work at United Nations Headquarters until 30 June 1998 .  
The basic premise is to encourage bilateral and multilateral dialogue so as to promote international understanding and cooperation on the basis of the concepts identified in the preambular paragraphs of this draft : that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress and science and technology for civilian applications need to be maintained and encouraged.There are two operational components to this draft resolution . 
This is why we will not support proposals that are designed to subordinate respect for human rights in the context of armed conflict , in accordance with international humanitarian law , to questionable military requirements .  
The circulation of press organs is not authorized , permission is not given for the functioning of new non _ governmental human rights organizations , which have been waiting for years to be recognized , the movements of the population within the country are controlled by military checkpoints , there is oppressive supervision of all private activity and in practice political dissent is viewed almost as a crime , particularly by the peripheral authorities of the mainland region .  
A further review during the past six months has focused on bringing UNFICYP into line with the approaches in more recently established peacekeeping missions , while achieving additional efficiencies by integrating civilian and military personnel in terms of sharing responsibilities and decision-making , establishing more transparency and better financial control .  
The scope of such an international document should therefore cover all fissile material potentially usable in the manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices throughout the world , including the military stocks of these materials possessed by all States , on an equal footing .  
Egypt regrets that all the efforts made to expand the scope of the United Nations Register have not yet yielded the required results since the Register remains limited to the annual notification of transfers of seven categories of conventional arms and continues to disregard other sophisticated and lethal types of conventional arms as well as weapons of mass destruction and advanced technologies with military applications .  
A civic training programme , centred mainly on essential aspects of democracy , the South African Constitution , the Human Rights Charter , international humanitarian law , cultural diversity and military ethics , has been published in a manual entitled South African National Defense Force Civic Education Guidelines and is being implemented .  
The Government of the Republic of Zambia wishes to confirm that on 14 January 1999 , it received a letter from the Government of Angola in which the latter alleged that it has in its possession " credible information " confirming substantial involvement of the Zambian authorities in the logistic and military support sent to Dr . Savimbi inside Angola to perpetuate the war and the suffering of the Angolan people .  
In the statement it issued on the occasion of General Ivachov ' s visit , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Azerbaijani Republic indicated that the frank and unambiguous statements by the above-mentioned military official of the Russian Federation strengthened Azerbaijan ' s apprehension regarding the purpose of this new phase of political and military cooperation between Russia and Armenia , which had thus been lifted to a qualitatively different strategic level .  
The visit was an occasion for examining specific technical questions raised by the considerable strengthening of the 102 nd military base established in Armenia , the new aircraft unit to be supplied to that base , the improvement of the operation of the unified air defence system which was to be equipped with modern armaments , including S-300 surface-to-air missile batteries , and questions concerning of the permanent deployment in the territory of Armenia of Russian Mig-29 aircraft .  
I should therefore like to assure you once again that I am determined to proceed with the effective implementation of a whole range of political , structural , economic and military reforms that are required in order to consolidate peace and promote sustainable development .  
This criminal military attack on peaceful regions , which follows constant military attacks by the United States and the United Kingdom on long-suffering Iraq , is indicative of an established policy of those two States designed to achieve their political objectives , their goal being to violate the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of Iraq .  
With the uncertainties associated with the transitional nature of the global order , a tremendous obsession is evident to preserve military supremacy or assume a more prominent global role in the future order through acquisition of more advanced weapons of greater range , accuracy and lethality , something that might quite unravel the progress towards disarmament achieved earlier in this decade .  
In order to achieve the objectives described therein , the plan of operations for the Observer Mission headed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General , calls for the phased deployment , as security conditions permit , of the authorized strength of 70 military observers , a 15 - person medical unit and 5 civilian police advisers supported by 50 international civilian and 48 local staff .  
During the budget period , owing to the poor road infrastructure and prevailing security situation , the MI-8 helicopter would be utilized for the transportation of UNOMSIL military and civilian personnel , logistical support and supply resupply tasking , as well as for casualty and medical evacuation , if required .  
It was therefore imperative that the international community should pursue ways and means of enhancing the safety of all United Nations personnel both military and civilian in order to maintain the effective functioning and timely deployment of peacekeeping operations .  
Our approach is guided by a set of basic principles : the preservation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo ; the belief that there can be no military solution to the underlying problems of the region ; and the belief that the human and humanitarian rights of all peoples in the conflict must be respected .  
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,  
Condemning the grave violations of human rights in Kosovo , affecting ethnic Albanians prior to the arrival of United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo personnel and troops of the international security presence , the Kosovo Force , as demonstrated in the many reports of torture , indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by the Yugoslav police and military ,  
By resolution 1132 ( 1997 ) , adopted on 8 October 1997 , the Security Council , gravely concerned at the continued violence following the military coup of 25 May 1997 and determining that the situation in Sierra Leone constituted a threat to international peace and security in the region , imposed a regime of mandatory sanctions , under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations , against Sierra Leone .  
The upward trend in military expenditures and their impact on national and international development strategies must be reversed , so that States can transfer resources now driving the arms race spiral into socioeconomic development .  
In this era , when there are no natural enemies , and thus no natural allies , some seek to advance their political and military ambitions by playing on racial and religious fears to give life to the dangerous doctrine of an impending clash of civilizations .  
They build on the fundamental norm of the law of armed conflict that military necessity in armed conflict has to be constantly set against the humanitarian objective of preventing unnecessary suffering .  
We understand that it demands coordinated and concerted efforts on the multilateral level and requires a thorough study of the political , military and economic aspects , in particular States legitimate defence and security needs .  
Intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to religion , education , art , science or charitable purposes , historic monuments , hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected , provided they are not military objectives ;  
There remained a huge disparity between military expenditure at the national level and the resources set aside at the international level for preventative diplomacy , peacemaking and peacekeeping .  
Determining actual and reasonable costs is often difficult for troop contributors to do , especially when they move matriel and personnel by military means and can not therefore easily provide documentary evidence of an acceptable national commercial rate .  
Some also expressed concern that not requiring that military firearms be marked and recorded would make them untraceable if they later fell into nonmilitary possession as a result of loss in armed conflicts , theft or other diversions .  
Thus this single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum has been incapable of continuing negotiations on halting the production of fissile material for military purposes , known as cutoff , negotiations which were started in 1998 .  
As the Panel 's report makes clear in paragraph 2 , the underlying objective of the sanctions is to foster a durable political settlement to the civil war in Angola by limiting UNITA 's ability to pursue its objectives by military means .  
The Special Committee stresses the importance of having senior military commanders , police commissioners and key staff personnel selected , prepared and trained prior to their deployment to a peacekeeping operation .  
First , peacekeeping operations must be endowed with a clear , realistic mandate commensurate with the established goals and backed by the necessary political , military and moral decisions .  
The ability of the Tribunal to recruit additional translators is limited by the scarcity of professional translators who are not only versed in legal vocabulary , but also familiar with the terminology of , inter alia , ballistic , forensic and military reports .  
These options could further include voluntary measures regarding weaponsusable fissile material related to military inventories with a view to achieving increased transparency , which could prepare the ground for ultimately agreed irreversible net reductions .  
Some also expressed concern that not requiring that military firearms be marked and recorded would make them untraceable if they later fell into nonmilitary possession as a result of loss in armed conflicts , theft or other diversions .  
Although the full resource requirements of MONUC were yet to be determined and its full deployment was subject to political , military and logistical constraints , the enormous task of the United Nations in the Congo required adequate financial support .  
Decides also that the measures imposed by paragraph 6 above shall not apply to supplies of nonlethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian use , as approved in advance by the Committee established by paragraph 8 below ;  
Decides also that the measures imposed by paragraph 6 above shall not apply to supplies of nonlethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian use , as approved in advance by the Committee established by paragraph 8 below ;  
Preparing comprehensive military operational plans for new peacekeeping operations , participating in fact finding missions to current and potential mission areas and , as required , revising and modifying plans for current operations ;  
Although confidencebuilding measures whether they be military , political , economic , commercial , cultural or humanitarian are no substitute for concrete disarmament measures , they can play an important role in progress towards disarmament .  
The international community should make any assistance political , diplomatic , financial , material or military to parties to armed conflict contingent on their observing standards for the protection of children .  
The preferred collective approach , therefore , should be to concentrate efforts for a political solution based on a robust and credible international military presence .  
The concept of security and stability in the Mediterranean region is not based solely on the military dimension but is a comprehensive concept based on the political , economic , social , cultural and human dimensions .  
The prohibition on attacks against civilians is based on the most fundamental distinction drawn in international humanitarian law between the civilian and the military and the absolute prohibition on directing attacks against the former .  
The proliferation of nuclear weapons and the growing emphasis on military doctrines , missile proliferation and the potential deployment of national missile defence are additional factors that pose alarming dangers to international security .  
At the time of the initial sighting , the location of the submarine was verified by a fishermans global positioning system , and its position inside Republic of Korea territorial waters was later confirmed by military positionlocating equipment .  
Once again , we have witnessed with dreary familiarity a major military offensive late this past summer , with all the consequent displacement and suffering of the civilian population .  
It requires comprehensive strategies involving all relevant actors and embracing multiple sectors of activity , including political , military , diplomatic , development , human rights , humanitarian and many others .  
It can not be separated from the political , military , economic and social situations prevailing in other West African countries , and particularly from the growing instability on the common border between Sierra Leone , Guinea and Liberia .  
With regard to Guinea-Bissau , which is geographically outside the Mano River Union , the prevailing precarious and unstable situation in the country resulted from a lengthy crisis that occurred in three stages the overthrow of the legal Government of President Nino , the establishment of a long period of transition dominated by the military and , finally , the organization of presidential and legislative elections to install a new regime and has left its mark on the economic and social structure of the country . 
First , the peace process in the Congo has lately witnessed a number of consecutive steps that have served to maintain the current momentum aimed at implementing the Lusaka Agreement in both its military and political components and at reaching a final and comprehensive settlement of the conflict , which has been tearing the Congo apart and draining the energies of its neighbours for almost three years . 
Societies in which citizens can openly air their grievances ; choose their governments in free , open elections ; have a say , through elected local bodies , in aspects of governance that touch their daily lives the most ; and get redress when they need it from an independent judiciary that upholds the rule of law , are far less likely to erupt into domestic conflict than those under totalitarian or military rule .  
Sanctions should be restricted to the acquisition of arms , military equipment and dual-use materials as stipulated in relevant Security Council resolutions , especially the resolutions relating to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , be they nuclear , chemical or biological , and of any other military potential that might endanger the sovereignty , safety , security and stability of neighbouring countries .  
In his speech at the beginning of this month at the annual conference of his party , Mr . Tony Blair , Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , referring to a moral duty to provide international military and humanitarian assistance to any country in need , stressed that if the world continued to ignore the suffering of the African nations , like the Democratic Republic of the Congo , ravaged by war , that would incite anger and frustration that could threaten global stability . 
Reinforcement and strengthening of the GCC process in terms of enhanced coordination , cooperation , interlinkage and integration , by adopting a unified strategy in the political , economic , security , military , social , information , cultural and scientific fields based on unity of purpose and a common destiny .  
The Special Rapporteur then examines the differences between traditional and new forms of mercenary activities , the relationship between terrorism and mercenary activities , the problems raised in connection with respect for human rights and international humanitarian law by private security and military assistance companies operating internationally and the limits and shortcomings of the legal definition of mercenary activities .  
The aim of the rules of customary international and treaty law is , in essence , to combat mercenary acts in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to prevailing standards of international humanitarian law applying to armed conflicts and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
These meetings must in particular consider the concepts of operation , which may bear the stamp of concepts developed by military alliances proposing deployments and tasks that can be carried out by relatively small numbers of troops only if , as their national or alliance strategic doctrines also require , they have limitless mobility , seamless cooperation between units , interoperability of the most modern equipment and a range of force multipliers in close support .  
The Missions administrative and technical personnel , military security detachment and logistical support services were required to support the liquidation of MONUA , in particular , in connection with the protracted negotiations with the Government of Angola regarding the disposition of the substantial amount of surplus assets not required by other peacekeeping operations and subsequently handed over to the Government in April 2000 in accordance with the contract of sale concluded in March 2000 .  
Moreover , pending the conclusion of consultations with the Government of Angola and until the establishment by the Security Council in its resolution 1268 ( 1999 ) of 15 October 1999 of the United Nations Office in Angola , the substantive MONUA personnel required to maintain liaison with the political , military , police and other civilian authorities of Angola , as well as its human rights component , were also retained in the country as part of the Observer Missions staffing establishment .  
This inadmissible claim highly simplifies a complex historical and social matter ; it ignores the military and financial autonomy of the paramilitaries and the extremely clear and increasing instances of lethal acts of aggression against public servants .  
The measures provided for under subparagraphs ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) of the present decree do not apply to supplies of non-lethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian or protective purposes , related technical assistance or training approved in advance by the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267 ( 1999 ) or to protective clothing , including flak jackets and military helmets imported into Afghanistan by United Nations personnel , representatives of the media and the staff of humanitarian organizations for their personal use only .  
The provisional expansion of UNOMSIL was supported by additional resources utilized for the deployment of military observers and additional international civilian staff in the fields of political and civil affairs and human rights , as well as for the necessary administrative , technical and logistical support services .  
While UNAMSIL took over the substantive civilian and military components of UNOMSIL , as well as its assets , the significant expansion of the Mission necessitated commensurate strengthening of its civilian staffing establishment , logistical and technical support structures , the provision of additional communications , electronic data-processing and other equipment , acquisition of vehicles and contracting additional air assets .  
In view of the unstable security situation in the country and in order to avoid potential security gaps related to the continuing repatriation of ECOMOG troops , significant resources were utilized for the transportation by air of contingent-owned equipment , stores and supplies , as well as for the strengthening of UNAMSIL air operations capability by enhancing its helicopter fleet with armed military helicopters and commercial heavy-lift rotary aircraft .  
Owing to the development on the ground during the reporting period , additional resources were utilized under the other official travel budget line item to support intensive political negotiations and consultations , especially in the aftermath of the breakout of hostilities in May 2000 , as well as for the travel to the mission area of the United Nations assessment team , military planning , political , public information , administrative , technical and logistical personnel and stress counsellors to provide counselling to the United Nations military personnel released from detention .  
In the light of the developing situation on the ground and particularly the resumption of hostilities in May 2000 , which necessitated the rapid reinforcement of the military component of the Mission and consequently the rapid transportation of contingent-owned equipment to the mission area , 10,635 and 2,057 metric tons of contingent-owned equipment were transported by air and surface , respectively , resulting in the unforeseen additional requirements totalling $ 22,023,000 .  
A provision of $ 337,500 was made to cover the cost of peacekeeping assistance team seminars in South America , training courses for military and civilian police and national trainers on peacekeeping , human rights and humanitarian assistance at the International Training Centre of the International Labour Organization at Turin , Italy , as well as for assistance to national and regional training and to multilateral and multidimensional exercises .  
Those realities were nothing more than the consequences of illegal acts which had gone unpunished and of the unacceptable partition imposed through the use of force and sustained by military strength in violation of every norm of international law ; they presupposed the constant denial of the individual and collective rights of 200,000 refugees ( more than a third of the Greek Cypriot population of Cyprus ) , who had been forcibly expelled from their homes since the Turkish invasion .  
Strongly condemns the continued use of disproportionate and indiscriminate force by Russian military forces , federal servicemen and State agents , including attacks against civilians and other breaches of international law as well as serious violations of human rights , such as forced disappearances , extrajudicial , summary and arbitrary executions , torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment , and calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation to comply with its international human rights and humanitarian law obligations in its operations against Chechen fighters and to take all measures to protect the civilian population ;  
Calls upon the Russian Federation to ensure that both civilian and military prosecutors offices undertake systematic , credible and exhaustive criminal investigations and prosecutions of all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights , in particular of those members of federal forces , federal servicemen and the personnel of law enforcement agencies against civilians allegedly implicated in war crimes and human rights violations and to pursue with rigour the cases which have been referred to them ;  
Encourages Governments , United Nations bodies and organs , the specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as appropriate , to initiate , coordinate or support programmes designed to train and educate military forces , law enforcement officers and government officials , as well as members of United Nations peacekeeping or observer missions , on human rights and humanitarian law issues connected with their work , and appeals to the international community to support endeavours to that end ;  
Proclaiming its agreement to the talks , the Islamic State of Afghanistan , however , in the light of the opening paragraphs of the document , is surprised by the notion expressed in the unnumbered third paragraph , namely that the lack of positive results in bringing about an Afghan settlement is linked to the determination of the warring Afghan sides to settle the conflict solely by military means .  
The committee meets with the Council when any change in the mandate is contemplated , in particular , the broadening or narrowing of scope of the mission , the introduction of new or additional functions or components , or a change in the authorization to use force ; the renewal of a mandate ; significant or serious political , military or humanitarian developments ; a rapid deterioration of the security situation on the ground ; the termination , withdrawal or scaling down in size of the operation , including the transition from peacekeeping to post-conflict peace-building .  
The recent surge in these activities by Pakistan , however , is a mere supplement to its widespread presence in Afghanistan , as Pakistan maintains thousands of military personnel , non-commissioned officers , armed nationals belonging to numerous Pakistan-based extremist organizations and volunteers from religious schools called the Madrassa , fighting alongside the Taliban mercenaries .  
The international community , during the course of last year and still in the year 2001 , witnessed how the Pakistan military junta played host to public mass gatherings of terrorist networks of the region and the extremist religious groups of Pakistan on its soil , who clearly and explicitly proclaimed their agenda and expressed intentions for expanding their realm of influence in the region through setting up extremist and radical regimes in countries of the region .  
The United States of America and the United Kingdom are committing acts of aggression and violating Iraqs airspace and territory on a daily basis on the pretext of allegedly enforcing the illegal and unlawful no-flight zones that were imposed by these two countries in a pathological display of military power that poses a threat to the security and safety of innocent civilian citizens and represents an assault on the sovereignty of an independent Member State of the United Nations .  
It would be quite a different matter , however , if the real intentions regarding outer space were to flout the obligations of international legal instruments and to seek unilateral and absolute military and strategic superiority based on political , economic and military strength .  
It also agreed to the importance of peace-building as a broad-based approach to conflict prevention , and stressed the need to address the political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic root causes of conflicts .  
The occupying power may , then , invoke its long occupancy as proof that its occupation is legitimate and characterize any and all use of force against it as terrorism . [ 115 ] ( b ) There is a situation of nascent civil war - i.e . , a situation where there are armed groups who either do not control sufficient territory , or who engage in military activities that are more than sporadic but less than sustained , or whose actions do not qualify as military actions under the laws and customs of war . 
In view of declining levels of official development assistance , he observed that developing countries would have to depend more on mobilizing their own resources for development and , to that end , they must examine the percentages of their gross national product and central government budgets that are devoted to military expenditures .  
It can not but be recognized that small arms are , paradoxically , those that claim the most victims , both civilian and military , given the nature of the current conflicts afflicting many countries , small arms and light weapons , apart from their undeniable advantage in terms of cost , proving to be the most adapted to the terrain and to the actions engaged in : easily transportable , they can be rapidly distributed and concealed . 
By way of the no-flight zones in northern and southern Iraq , they have been continuing their military aggression against our people on a daily basis since 1991 by virtue of a unilateral and illegal decision taken by their governments in flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
The heightened attention of the Council to the situation in Burundi was dictated by the rapidly deteriorating military situation in the country at the end of February and the beginning of March and the increased violence , including the attacks by Burundian armed groups on the capital .  On 2 March , the Council members , during consultations of the whole , heard a briefing by the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Kieran Prendergast , on the current political , military , humanitarian and socio-economic situation in Burundi and developments in the Arusha peace process in the past months .  
The currently accepted meaning or use of the term mercenary is primarily focused on including in this rubric the hiring of the professional services of persons with a military background who are paid to intervene in an armed conflict in a country other than their own .  
The aim of the rules of customary international and treaty law is , in essence , to combat mercenary acts in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to the prevailing rules of international humanitarian law and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
In addition to continuing with efforts to improve the well-being of the poor , IMF contributes to the monitoring of progress towards international development goals in three ways : disseminating information of growth rates in countries ; reporting the composition of government expenditures with a view to encouraging countries to reduce unproductive expenditures , such as excessive military expenditures ; and tracking trends in social expenditures and social indicators in low-income countries and transition economies .  
Similar provisions protecting religious freedom and prohibiting any discrimination against citizens whether or not they are believers are contained in criminal law , civil law , legislation governing regional autonomy for national minorities and military service , compulsory education legislation , the electoral law relating to the Peoples Congress and the law establishing village committees .  
The Ivorian patriots were just savouring that victory , so dearly yet so proudly won over the military regime , whose rule had been marked by numerous barbaric acts committed against civilian populations , when , to their great surprise , there rang out over foreign radio stations appeals by the Rassemblement des Rpublicains ( RDR ) , calling upon its militants to oppose the victory of candidate Laurent Gbagbo and thereby calling into question the presidential election of 22 October 2000 .  
Finally , blurred lines between the civilian and military character of camps expose civilians inside to the risk of attack by opposing forces , where camps are perceived to serve as launching pads for renewed fighting .  
Member States are nevertheless still reluctant to support the work of humanitarian agencies in these circumstances , because of the perceived security risk to their military personnel and the risk of further exacerbating the conflict by direct confrontations with armed elements .  Ensuring security in camps requires the involvement of police and military forces , not least in disarming and demobilizing militias and transferring them to different sites .  
The Permanent Mission of the Republic of San Marino to the United Nations would like to point out the fact that , given the characteristics of the San Marino armed forces , the Government of the Republic of San Marino deemed it inconvenient to fill out the questionnaire [ entitled Instrument for standardized international reporting of military expenditures ] and preferred to send the attached sheet of information .  
Synergy and complementarity of the action taken by the various agencies will be decisive in mobilizing sufficient funds both to meet the challenges represented by the problems of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to seize the opportunities offered by the new political , economic and military situation .  The strategy for ending the crisis itself must combine humanitarian action and intervention for the purpose of rehabilitation and development .  
In addition to its traditional responsibility for identifying requirements , establishing aircraft technical specifications , evaluating technical compliance , administering air charters , and managing expenditures , its responsibilities now include the development and promulgation of institutional standards and operating guidelines for all types of aeronautical activities , such as the operation of aerodromes , and the integrated employment of civil and military aircraft from diverse regulatory regimes , to ensure that peacekeeping air operations always comply with international standards regardless of the condition of the aeronautical infrastructure within the mission areas .  
Further phases are planned and the eventual decision support system will contain all tactical information required to support the planning assumptions for rapid mission deployment , mission liquidation and redeployment of assets , build-up and deployment of surplus assets , personnel and contingent placements and mobilization , military and civilian mobilization , and financial and administrative information to support budget planning and financial analyses ( $ 150,000 ) . 
To standardize police training and adapt it to the Sierra Leone environment , the Section has finalized arrangements with the UNAMSIL Civilian Police to produce a training manual for the police , internal human rights awareness training for incoming UNAMSIL peacekeepers and military observers occurs on a regular basis and the Section provided training on human rights and humanitarian law for the Pakistani Brigade in Pakistan prior to its deployment to UNAMSIL .  
During the summit , there was a general consensus of the urgent need for the implementation of an immediate ceasefire in the areas of military operation in southern Sudan in order to accelerate the flow of humanitarian assistance to the needy civilian population in those areas , and to facilitate for constructive negotiations between the Government and the rebel movement ( SPLM / A ) , with the ultimate aim of reaching a peaceful resolution of the conflict in the south . 
However , it is now well known that SPLM / A , continuing its intransigent stance , not only vehemently opposed the proposed immediate ceasefire , but also provoked the situation by launching intensive military operations in western Bahr-El-Ghazal state , causing the loss of the lives of a considerable number of innocent civilians and the displacement of thousands of others , thus creating , once again , a humanitarian crisis in the state and its immediate environs , as it did in early 1998 .  
These responsibilities encompass the identification of requirements , the establishment of aircraft technical specifications , the evaluation of contractors technical compliance , the administration of air charters , the management of expenditures , the development and promulgation of institutional standards and operating guidelines for all types of aeronautical activities , and the integrated use of civil and military aircraft from diverse regulatory regimes ;  
It is easy to see that we are dealing with an act devoid of any military objective whose sole aim was simply to spread death , suffering and destruction of our people in the most atrocious way .  
Deeply concerned that systematic rape , sexual slavery and slavery-like practices are still being used to humiliate civilians and military personnel , to destroy society and diminish prospects for a peaceful resolution of conflicts and that the resulting severe physical and psychological trauma endanger not only personal recovery but post-conflict reconstruction of the whole society , as pointed out in the above-mentioned report ;  
After so many years of fruitless endeavours , the intergovernmental organs of the United Nations , in particular the Security Council , might wish to consider adopting a comprehensive approach to the settlement of Afghanistan , in its political , military , humanitarian and human rights dimensions , setting forth the basic requirements for a settlement of the conflict and the principles on which it should be based , together with a coherent strategy to resolve the conflict .  
Calls also for arrangements by all nuclear-weapon States to place , as soon as practicable , the fissile material designated by each of them as no longer required for military purposes under International Atomic Energy Agency or other relevant international verification and arrangements for the disposition of such material for peaceful purposes in order to ensure that such material remains permanently outside military programmes ;  
This resolution , however , representing as it does a dangerous precedent in which the Security Council gives unlimited authorization to States cooperating with the Government of Kuwait to interfere with civilian trade , is not based on Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations and does not therefore make it permissible to use coercive military measures for its enforcement .  
The United Nations must play a crucial role in combating international terrorism by adopting a global strategy that should include clear political , military , diplomatic , economic and legal measures in order to eliminate it . 
The Secretary-General has also recommended the Member States ensure that their military , civilian and police personnel involved in United Nations peacekeeping operations be trained with regard to international human rights , humanitarian law and refugee law , especially as concerns the rights and protection of children and women , in advance of troop deployment to United Nations operations .  
Following these positive changes of the last few years that have strengthened the need for a renewed strategic vision of peace and stability throughout the world , it is necessary that international security be separated from military factors and go beyond security concepts based on nuclear weapons .  
Iraq rejects all the flimsy excuses and pretexts stemming from this illegal decision that are used by these States in engaging in this hostile terrorist action in an attempt on their part to justify their military aggression against our country .  The logistic support made available by the governments of Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and Turkey to the United States and the United Kingdom , which includes the provision of air bases , has made them key partners in the terrorist aggression against Iraq , so that they bear international responsibility under international law .  
Beyond complying with the Tribunal , the Framework Agreement places responsibility on the domestic authorities to undertake crucial measures , including the prosecution , dismissal or transfer , as appropriate , of persons in military , paramilitary and police forces and other public servants , responsible for serious violations of the basic rights of persons belonging to ethnic or minority groups . 2 It is essential to the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina that an adequate legal framework to effect such duties be established . 
The situation of military detentions by KFOR is based on rather more obscure legal grounds . 9 The Special Representative is informed that KFOR routinely arrests and detains individuals on an extrajudicial basis , mostly ethnic Albanians suspected of fighting in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and southern Serbia , citing resolution 1244 ( 1999 ) , the Kumanovo Military Technical Agreement with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and customary international law as the legal sources of KFOR authority for detentions . 
The expected American military action on Afghanistan , backed by the support of the allied States , was launched on the seventh of this month as a response to the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington last month , which shook the whole world with the heavy losses of the lives of innocent people , and the extensive destruction of a number of public and private properties it caused in the United States of America . 
MONUC is also in the process of establishing four coordination centres , which will provide command and control for the military observers in areas distant from the sector headquarters and will improve the logistical support in the interior of the country , in addition to providing an enhanced medical evacuation capacity and increased forward mobility .  
The Missions initial objective in phase III would be to establish a mixed civilian and military presence , as well as a forward support base , in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
The proposed operational and logistics base would be established at Kindu , which is located at the western fringe of an area characterized by many of the military , security , political and humanitarian and human rights problems that MONUC is likely to be confronted with in phase III .  
The radio will provide accurate , credible and impartial information about all aspects of the peace process , including military and political developments , the inter-Congolese dialogue and the many humanitarian assistance programmes operating in the country .  
Preparations are under way for recruitment and deployment of adequate numbers of United Nations civilian personnel to accompany the military deployment , including political , human rights , humanitarian , child protection , public information , disarmament , demobilization and reintegration and logistical personnel .  
Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
The international community continues to witness an accelerated race to develop strategic nuclear reactors for military purposes and increase the range and power of ballistic missiles and rockets with nuclear , chemical and biological warheads despite the pledges of the heads of State and Government at the Millennium Summit last year for , among other things , the gradual multilateral reduction of arsenals of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction .  
In this context , and given the decline in official development assistance , the former Secretary-General of the United Nations , Mr . Javier Prez de Cullar , speaking on the subject of the link between disarmament and development on 11 June at the opening of a workshop in Lima , noted that developing countries needed to rely more on their own resources and , to that end , to re-examine the percentage of their gross domestic product and national budgets used for military spending .  
The plan provides for an integrated peacekeeping mission headed by a Special Representative of the Secretary-General , which would be composed of a military component , a civilian police component , and a small civilian component , including experts who would provide crucial assistance to the emergent East Timorese administration .  The latter component will be essential to the functioning of the government in the immediate post-independence period .  
The widening gap in technological capabilities encompassed by the so-called revolution in military affairs and in the disparity of size of military budgets between the rich and the poor , the big and the smaller nations is increasing the imbalance in conventional force capabilities at the international and regional levels .  
But we are prepared for cooperation as sovereign equals , in accordance with the new realities of a world where the principal national objectives of States can be achieved through economic and political cooperation , rather than military conquest or regional or global domination .  
These are of fundamental importance in assuring that the customary rules of international humanitarian law governing the choice of weapons are faithfully applied to specific weapons likely to have indiscriminate effects and cause suffering beyond military necessity or which simply are abhorrent .  
The revised concept of operation of UNAMSIL is based on the forward deployment , in successive phases and in an integrated fashion , of the Missions military force of 17,500 personnel as well as United Nations civil affairs , civilian police and human rights personnel , representatives of humanitarian agencies and government personnel and assets to establish and consolidate State authority and basic services in areas controlled by RUF , including diamond producing regions , and in some border areas .  
In addition , pursuant to Security Council resolution 1308 ( 2000 ) of 17 July 2000 , and in the light of the potential spread of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection among the population of Sierra Leone as well as among the Missions military and civilian personnel , it is proposed that a post for an HIV / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) policy officer be established at the P-4 level .  
The primary strategic objective of the Missions public information programme is to project , country-wide , the efforts of the military and civilian components of UNAMSIL in facilitating the peace process in Sierra Leone and the promotion of a better understanding of the mandate of the Mission and the activities of other international organizations that are operating in the country .  
The Office of the Spokesman includes a civilian spokesman and a military spokesman who jointly conduct twice-weekly press briefings and speak on behalf of the Mission , aggressively and strategically utilizing the Missions achievements at press briefings ; participating in weekly briefings of members of UNAMSIL civilian and military staff , as well as other United Nations agencies ; organizing and conducting tours for journalists ; providing timely and aggressive responses to negative or inaccurate media coverage ; and regularly participating in local radio and television programmes . 
Shortly after it took off , the helicopter was shot down close to the entrance of the valley , 20 kilometres east of Sukhumi , killing all nine unarmed people on board , including four United Nations military observers , two locally employed United Nations staff members and all three members of the contracted helicopter crew .  
Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile materials and calls for arrangements by all the nuclear-weapon States to place , as soon as practicable , the fissile material designated by each of them as no longer required for military purposes under the International Atomic Energy Agency or other relevant international verification and arrangements for the disposition of such material for peaceful purposes in order to ensure that such material remains permanently outside military programmes ;  
Recalling that international law set strict limits on the use of outer space for military purposes , she said that the issue of ways and means of maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes should be studied in depth by all the bodies concerned within the context of their respective mandates . 
After the so-called end of the cold war , those who continued a military build-up and the development of the most sophisticated means of killing and exterminating human beings were aware that their huge military investments would give them the privilege of imposing their absolute and complete dominance over the other peoples of the world .  
After the shock and sincere sorrow felt by all peoples throughout the world for the atrocious and insane terrorist attack against the people of the United States , the most extremist ideologues and most belligerent hawks , already established in their privileged positions of power , have taken command of the most powerful country in the world , whose military and technological capabilities seem infinite .  
The first victims of whatever military actions are undertaken will be the billions of people living in the poor and underdeveloped world , with their unbelievably serious economic and social problems , their unpayable debts and the ruinous prices of their basic commodities ; their growing natural and ecological disasters ; their hunger and extreme poverty ; the massive undernourishment of their children , teenagers and adults ; their terrible AIDS epidemic ; and their malaria , tuberculosis and infectious diseases , which threaten whole nations with extermination .  
As indicated in paragraph 2 of the report of the Secretary-General ( A / 54 / 355 ) , the package of agreements signed by the Government of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca ( URNG ) included detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues , which were consolidated into a comprehensive peace agenda .  
Underlines with concern that key commitments remain outstanding in the areas of fiscal , judicial , military , electoral and land reform , as well as decentralization and rural development , and therefore urges that those commitments be implemented without further delay ;  
At present the Israeli military aircraft are still continuing their provocative acts , which reached a dangerous level yesterday when , starting at 17.20 hours , 14 military aircraft at once overflew Lebanese cities and regions at low altitudes , causing anxiety and terror among Lebanese civilians , especially children , and terrifying large numbers of tourists who had come to spend the holiday period in Lebanon , owing to the repeated breaking of the sound barrier by those aircraft during the night-time hours . 
In its E2 ( 1 ) report , this Panel considered the meaning of a threat of military action and at paragraphs 158163 , concluded that a threat of military action outside of Kuwait must be a credible and serious threat that was intimately connected to Iraqs invasion and occupation and within the actual military capability of the entity issuing the threat , as judged in light of the actual theatre of military operations during the relevant period .  
Mr . CUMMINGS ( United States of America ) said that the Convention was a strong , integral part of international humanitarian law , whose purposes it served largely by enlisting military , diplomatic and legal experts alike in the crafting of the rules it enshrined : as a result , those who had to wage wars were often also involved in regulating the weapons of war .  
Decides that the measures imposed by subparagraphs and above shall not apply to supplies of non-lethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian or protective use , and related technical assistance or training , as approved in advance by the Committee established by paragraph 14 below ;  
The direct or indirect supply , sale or transfer to the territory of Afghanistan under Taliban control , as stipulated by the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267 , from the territory of the Russian Federation , or using vessels or aircraft carrying the flag of the Russian Federation , of products for military purposes and dual-use goods and technology , as well as spare parts , assembly units and auxiliary equipment for such products and goods , is prohibited ;

In his report an American military scholar concluded that the US military strategy in Iraq is based on a " flawed " logic because it is pursuing two mutually independent goals of changing Iraq 's regime and doing it " quickly and at a low cost . "  
" This week , the entire world was shocked and angry , and the position of America 's moral leadership was damaged because of the terrible pictures of a small number of our US military personal abusing Iraqi prisoners , " Clark said , responding on behalf of the Democrats to Bush 's weekly radio address .  
Kerry , a Vietnam veteran with shining military exploits , is able to be selected as the Democratic presidential nominee , mainly because he is recognized as the candidate with the greatest chance to challenge Bush on the issue of national security .  
Guangzhou Military Region is using test beds as the vanguard to lead its advance .  It is using its focus on difficult points and attacking key problems to promote all-around progress .  It is gradually making S &amp; T training for troops standardized and scientific , and it has seen clear improvements in the quality of unit military training and in the level of combat power of its units .  
At the same time the new Russian military doctrine has conferred on the Russian armed forces the functions of defending the state constitution , and striking at the illegal activities of extremist organizations , organized crime , and terrorism ; the original military doctrine laid down that such tasks should be undertaken by Interior Ministry troops .  
He also severely denounced some countries for putting regional organizations above the UN Security Council or even bypassing the UN Security Council to carry out military intervention in a sovereign country , pointing out that such practice has " severely damaged the existing international collective security mechanism , and the consequences are extremely dangerous . "  
At present , we must further straighten the guiding thought in science and technological training of troops , conscientiously do a good job of making plans , set hierarchies rationally , handle the relationship between common and individual characteristics correctly , as well as strengthen planning guidance and training management .  We must vigorously promote drumming up enthusiasm , promote seeking real results , and promote training solid skills , thereby truly make raising combat effectiveness of military units the objective and result of science and technology training of troops .  
Nowadays , with networks playing a growing role in the political , military , financial , communications , electric power , medical and health , and other fields , hackers ' sabotage activities are becoming increasingly rampant to pose a serious threat to economic order , social stability , and national security .  
His deeds have reflected the mental outlook of the party 's theoretical workers in the new period and provided profound enlightenment and beneficial lessons for conducting ideological and political work in various military units .  
Yu Yongbo pointed out : Unremittingly attaching importance to the weapon of theory and enabling officers and soldiers of the whole army to have a deep understanding in Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought , especially Deng Xiaoping Theory , are the fundamental task and basic project in improving ideological and political work of various military units in the new period .  
The circular states : Personnel departments at all levels should provide preferential policies to meet the personnel needs of state-owned large and medium-sized key enterprises that conform to the state industrial policy , the units that undertake the state 's key construction and scientific research projects for the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , the agriculture , water conservancy , energy , transportation , and telecommunications units that the state strengthens on a priority basis , the units of the pillar industries , and the national defense and military units .  
The " Program on Building Headquarters " upholds the guidance of Mao Zedong Military Thought , Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on army building during the new period , and a series of Jiang Zemin 's important expositions on army building ; is based on the military strategic principle in the new period ; and adopts the principle of building a quality army and strengthening the army with science and technology , thereby making a unified standard for comprehensive construction of our army 's headquarters .  
Ever since the convocation of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , in particular , all the comrades working on the scientific and technological front for national defense and weaponry development have firmly implemented the strategy established by the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission on strengthening the army through science and technology , successfully adapted themselves to the world 's development trend of high technologies and changes in the world 's military field , gone all out to make the country strong , and have attained new achievements of world interest .  
During the theoretical study , the central study teams of the party committees at all levels of the Navy elaborated the major realistic issues in the Navy 's modernization program and preparations for military struggles to more than 100 specific topics for study and practice .  Focused on these topics , they guided the reading , investigations , research , exchanges , and application of the leading cadres at all levels .  
With Chairman Jiang Zemin 's important expositions and the major policy decisions as the guide , the Navy party committee shared the work among its standing committee members .  Through the activities of inspecting and guiding work at the grassroots units , going to sea on the vessels , working and living with the rank and file , and having heart-to-heart talks with them , the party committee introduced more than 30 theoretical research topics , which included political building , military training , equipment scientific research , and logistics supply for Navy building in the new period .  
We must persist in treating war tasks as our ultimate tasks and firmly establish the thought of " doing military construction for future wars . "  In the construction of headquarters , we must truly put the emphasis on winning local wars under the condition of modern technology , especially high technology .  We must strive to improve our military 's ability in planning and directing military construction as well as in organizing and directing troops in fighting .  
They must conform to the requirements of the " Guidelines " and the directives of Party committees , chief officers and higher-level headquarters .  They must strengthen their planning , leadership , urgency and checks and ensure that construction in all aspects is implemented .  They must lay a firm foundation for improving our military 's ability in defense and fighting under modern situations and for striving to promote the transcentury development of the construction of military modernization .  
In line with the current situation and tasks as well as the ideological reality of officers and men , by encouraging officers and men to study , analyze , and discuss theories and to compare and examine themselves with positive examples , this unit has drawn up measures to conduct rectification and correction and concentrated on enhancing officers and men 's sense of responsibility and mission in preparing for military combat with high standards and high quality .

Deputy Zhang Miansheng , an instructor of a certain unit of Guangzhou Military Region , fully agreed with what deputy Zhu Wenquan said : " Whether it is military exercises , or the fight against flood in 1998 , they expressed the interests of the state and people ; ours is an invincible iron army that dares to fight tough battles , is skilled in ferocious fighting , and fears no bloodshed or sacrifice . "  
The important speech given by President Jiang at the Plenary Session of the PLA Representative Troops fully affirms the achievements made by the military and armed police troops and raises clear requirements for comprehensively promoting the construction of military modernization .  The speech emphasizes that the military must further clearly understand the historical mission it shoulders and provide firm and strong assurance of security for protecting the country 's sovereignty , unity and security , for protecting the people 's labor under peaceful conditions and for reform , opening up and the construction of socialist modernization .  
Only our Party has these important responsibilities .  Our military is the people 's military under the resolute leadership of the Party . Whether or not the military 's Party organizations are firm and strong , whether or not they can become firm fighting forces and whether or not they can play the role of the " Three Representations " are significant to whether or not we can solve the 2 historical tasks , " winning wars " and " not changing the military 's nature . "  
It is widely known that , in both wartime and the peaceful period of construction , our military 's writers and artists have from beginning to end considered themselves the Party 's literary and artistic fighters .  They have always been brave in plunging themselves into the life of fiery struggles and created their works with great enthusiasm .  They have played a very important role in inspiring and encouraging the military 's morale and in improving troops ' fighting power .  
They have made glorious achievements and formed an excellent tradition for the military 's work in the literary and artistic field .  The facts prove that only by being closely associated with the great revolutionary struggles and with people 's putting theories into practice can the military 's work in the literary and artistic field make great achievements and establish its proper social position .  
If our military 's writers and artists can achieve these , they can obtain the rich source material contained in various new and typical aspects of society , reflect the real spirit of the times accurately and in a lively manner , and create highly concise , perfect and successful works with clear characteristics of the times .  
Particularly in the new historical period , our military is implementing a new period of military strategies and principles in a positive way , moving along the road of quality construction and of making the military strong with science and technology , and striving to complete two historical tasks of " winning wars " and " not changing the military 's quality . "  Deep changes are taking place in various aspects of military construction and new people , new events and new trends worthy of being recorded with letters of gold have emerged in large numbers .  
Similarly , if today 's new and promising actors and actresses with potential can not find opportunities to exercise or display themselves , it would be difficult for them to spring up , become outstanding successors of the military 's rank of actors and actresses and truly become pillars of the military 's work in the literary and artistic field .  
Facing the coming new century , how can the military 's literature and art be accepted by society , go out to foreign countries and develop into the future with its own unique aesthetic form ?  This is a new task faced by each of our military workers in the literary and artistic field .  
So , improving the quality of creative works and offering a larger quantity of excellent works involving producers ' great efforts is the most important task among important tasks of the military 's literary and artistic work in the future period .  
In recent years , the military 's literary and artistic workers have been conforming to the spirit of President Jiang 's directive that the military 's construction of spiritual civilization must take the lead in the whole society .  Through assiduous efforts , they have created a large group of literary and artistic works loved by troops ' rank and file and the people .  
A few of them do not even want to become close to or understand the lives of the rank and file .  Some of our military 's literary and artistic workers do go into the lives of rank and file , but they mostly gain just a superficial understanding through cursory observation .  
In general , in literary and artistic creativity , the military must continue to carry forth a major theme while advocating diversification .  The military must encourage and support literary and artistic workers to go deep into troops ' lives and into the lives of the rank and file , to create excellent works reflecting the spirit of our times and encouraging the rank and file to go all out to make progress , and to provide more and better spiritual food for the broad number of commanders and soldiers .  
In the group study of the " three stresses " education , Party committee groups and leading cadres received deep Marxist theoretical education ; some prominent problems in the aspects of Party characteristics and Party working styles were touched and solved ; the Party 's excellent traditions and working styles were carried forth ; Party committee groups ' cohesiveness and fighting power were strengthened ; and people 's confidence in building socialism with Chinese characteristics and in the transcentury development of our military 's construction was strengthened .  
Guizhou used to have a relatively weak industrial foundation ; thanks to the construction and readjustment of remote regions away from coastal areas over the past more than 30 years , a military industrial system has been established in Guizhou , with the three major bases of aviation , space flight , and electronics as its main body .  Today , these three major bases have become an important force in Guizhou 's economic development .  
Introducing able personnel from other parts of the country is , no doubt , a major channel ; yet it is more practical and more economical to arouse the potentialities of existing scientific and technological personnel inside the region .  Besides , the large-scale development of the western region has also provided a rare historical opportunity for the able personnel in the military industry to attain greater accomplishments in their career .  
Third , we should bring into full play the roles of the existing assets stock of the military industry in the western region , vigorously push forward the readjustment and the strategic restructuring of both the industrial structure and capability of the western region , take the initiative to incorporate the military industry into the economy of the western region , and step up the work of extricating enterprises from their difficulties as well as the establishment of a modern enterprise system .  
As far as military strategy was concerned , the United States had adopted a new set of operational methods for high-technology limited warfare following the end of the cold war , but NATO 's operational methods and command systems had not departed completely from the operational approach designed for the prospect of fighting big battles with the Soviet Union . Therefore , there was a lack of coordination between them in the operations .  
The United States led NATO to conduct military intervention in the ethnic dispute inside the FRY and to openly support the " Kosovo Liberation Army , " a terrorist and splittist organization .  This created a bad precedent in supporting national splittism and terrorist activities in the domain of international relations .  The national splittist forces in some countries and international terrorists saw their chance and started provoking and making trouble .  
[ Li Dingfan ] In the new century , the CNNC 's entire line of thinking on development is to further cut the new development path of " integrating military and civilian production , developing nuclear energy power generation , readjusting the structure , giving prominence to efficiency , strengthening management , and invigorating the nuclear industry with science and technology . "  
do a good job in diverting redundant workers to other jobs and increasing efficiency with reduced staff ; put it in a prominent place to improve efficiency ; and establish a new-type small and efficient nuclear technology industrial system based on the integration of military and civilian production .  
In his speech , Yu Yongbo , member of the Central Military Commission , and director of the General Political Department , demanded all levels of the military to strengthen ideological and political work , teach the military-turned-cadres to consolidate the concept of taking in the interests of the whole into account , fully understanding the difficulties of local governments and the units that take in the demobilized army officers , and supporting the economic construction and various reforms of the state by practical deeds .  
He said : The friendly cooperative relations between the two armies of Russia and China in the fields of national defense and military affairs have been developed on the basis of strategic cooperative partnership of good neighborliness and friendliness and mutual beneficial cooperation between the two countries .  
2 .  All sides point out that in line with the agreement on confidence-building in the military field in border areas signed by the five countries in Shanghai in 1996 and the agreement on mutual troop reduction in border areas they signed in Moscow in 1997 , the five countries have established for the first time a zone of mutual trust in their common border stretching over more than 7,000 kilometers , where military activities are transparent , predictable , and controllable .  
Defense ministers of the five countries exchanged views on the issues of implementing the consensus reached by heads of the five countries , summarizing the situation in executing the agreements on confidence-building in the military sphere and on the mutual reduction of the armed forces in the border areas , strengthening the trustful cooperation in military , political , and security spheres among the five countries , and opposing the national separatism , the religious extremism , and the international terrorism .  After reaching a broad agreement on these issues , they issued a joint communique .  
The one-man camouflage smoke launcher and assembled false target that they developed and improved won a third-class prize for military scientific and technological progress .  
By 2005 the CSSIC will have formed a military industrial scientific research and production system based on adequate maintenance and supplies and a relatively complete S &amp; T innovation system and a good operation mechanism , under which the CSSIC 's shipbuilding capacity will have been expanded to 2.2-million tonnes ; 60 percent of exported boats and ships will have used home-made equipment ; five to eight brand-name products with a sales volume amounting to over 1-billion yuan will have been developed ;  
This article criticizes that the US advantages in the economic , political , military , and cultural fields are rapidly growing into a burden .  They have created tensions among old friends , weakened the US appeal to supporters , and made the United States face the danger of losing friends .  And this kind of friendly relationship is a " priceless treasure " accumulated over several decades .  
As a result , with the help of our troops in northern Manchuria , which attacked the enemy forces across the Linjiang three times , our troops in southern Manchuria successfully guarded Linjiang in four battles .  Subsequently , we successfully launched the spring and summer offensive and , as a result , our military situation in northeast China changed from strategic defense to strategic offense .  
We should , via this centralized positive education and regular education , try to insure that each Party member can , aiming at winning modern wars in the future as required , be self-motivated to learn and use science and technology , love the army and learn military skills , acquire solid mastery of skills and contribute to national defense reinforcement and to army improvement of combat effectiveness ;  
For medium-sized and small enterprises , we have tried to gradually develop them into professional and special enterprises characterized by being " focused , excellent , unique , and modern " by helping them increase profits and make up losses , and realize investment diversity through adopting such policies as separating the production of military and civilian products , and make full use of merger for the bankrupt , and turning debt to equity .  
In the military reform conducted in Russia in the past few years , the size of various arms and services has been cut by a big margin , but the strategic missile troops alone have been strengthened and they have absorbed the military aerospace troops and the missile space defense troops .  Russia 's strength for launching nuclear attacks and for reconnaissance , early warning and resistance have been strengthened .  
This is the marked difference between reserve forces and active military units .  To counter this , first political commissars of reserve forces must , when doing ideological and political work , embrace an advanced consciousness and must be fast in making judgement , in transmitting instructions , in giving feedback signals , and in tracking the results .  This is the only way to succeed .  
Only if the problems of each system , each subject and each battle line are solved in a deep and detailed manner and if our fighting capacities are strengthened , only then can the entire army be propelled to prepare for military battles on a deeper and more solid basis and the army can honor the sacred mission assigned by the Party and state at any time .  
But over the years , Lee Teng-hui [ Li Denghui ] has repeatedly provoked the " one China " principle , kept trying to solicit foreigners ' support , and hugely increased military spending for armament development .  Since the 1990 ' s , the national defense spending has grown by an average of 6.94 percent , with over $ 12-billion actual budget per year .  Over $ 40-billion has also been invested in purchasing weaponry , in a vain bid to " resist reunification with force " , which is , in reality , an idle dream .  
As Taiwan Island is a narrow and small area , its military targets are relatively concentrated .  Moreover , Taiwan is close to the mainland , these relatively concentrated targets , in time of war , are susceptible to attacks from all directions and in various forms , and will be destroyed very quickly .  It is difficult to conserve the strength for the second attack and decisive battle .  
While urging the international community to exchange experiences , both positive and negative , in promoting and protecting the rights and interests of ethnic minority groups in accordance with the principle of equal treatment , sincere cooperation , and mutual respects , China opposes the practice of exercising armed intervention against other countries by using the nationality issue as a pretext and relying on military superiority and also resolutely opposes the act of carrying out separatist activities under the pretense of safeguarding the rights and interests of ethnic minority groups . 
The barbaric bombing of Yugoslavia by the US-led NATO forces over 78 days from March to June 1999 pushed hegemonism to a new level that is even more dangerous , threatening , and hypocritical .  That is , a new stage in which , in the name of preventing a humanitarian disaster , they have tied human rights diplomacy and military aggression even more tightly together , and a new stage in which hypocrisy and brutality are combined even more shamelessly .  
Just as our Army building is entering the new millenium , the Central Military Commission has promulgated the Essentials for Reform and Development of Military Universities and Schools , describing a grand blueprint regarding the reforms and development of our military universities and schools at the beginning of the 21st century , and setting forth the preconditions for the prosperous development of military education in the future .  It is a project of fundamental significance to the long-term flourishing of the national defense effort and to the military 's development .  
The " Program " has put forward the overall objective and subordinate objectives for the educational reform and development of military academies in the coming decade , clearly defined the guiding ideology and the development principle for the work , drawn the outline of an educational system in military academies which enjoys the special characteristics of our army , and has put forward a series of mutually supporting and mutually dovetailing major reform measures .  
For this purpose , a " key construction project of military academies " will be activated , under which support will be given to the development of selected key areas with concentrated forces : Within 10 years ' time , about 10 military academies and a number of branches of learning are expected to reach or approach the advanced national level , among which some are expected to reach or approach the advanced international level ;  
and we should take earnest steps to strengthen leadership over the ideological and political building in military academies , give priority to selecting highly capable cadres to form the leading bodies of military academies , and see to it that the school-running work can keep to its correct orientation and that the able personnel we bring up are all politically qualified .  
and the United States is constantly mired in scandals of infringing upon human rights in other countries , and marked by numerous notorious records of its engagement in unjust military aggressions everywhere and disregarding the established principles of international law .  
Relying on its super economic and technological strength while possessing a huge nuclear arsenal , an individual military power has vigorously developed the national missile defense system in an attempt to seek absolute security of its own .  
On this globe we live , if rich countries become richer and poor countries become poorer , if one side continues to accumulate wealth and the poverty of the other side aggravates , if some big powers interfere in internal affairs of other countries everywhere and practice hegemony and power politics by relying on their powerful economy , science and technology and military strength , and if many developing countries can not take part in international affairs on an equal footing and receive unfair treatment or even groundless humiliation , the world will not have peace and development .  
Nowadays , professional national defense communications support service units in Xiamen are known to local army units and civilians as " strong and efficient support service teams out of the military establishment " that are " movable , available , and quick at fixing problems . "  
The teaching methods of the American military , besides the conventional military academy , also extend to continuing education universities , local branch academies , learning by mail , off-post paid study , continuing education technical institutes , and many other methods .  It is regulated that all military bases at the company level , or having over 750 soldiers , must establish a " troop training center " , be responsible for setting up an academy , and assist officers and soldiers to study at local academies .  
After that , Japan set its sight on the objectives of becoming a political power and a military power .  It has attempted to use its powerful economic , scientific , and technological strength to speed up the development of its military strength in order to exercise greater clout in global affairs , particularly in the Asian political arena .  
After the Cold War , peace and development have become major topics that are of common concern to peoples of all nations in the world .  In this situation , Japan has not made more contributions to world peace and development , but has instead used all its armed might to indulge in wars of aggression , expanded its armament without restraint , and attempted to elevate its international status and political and economic interests as a military power .  This obviously runs counter to the historical trend .  
By means of virtual reality , we can transform the future into the present as the direct subject of thinking and achieve the " seamless linkage " between the past , the present , and the future in the realm of thinking .  This brings the mode of thinking more in sync with the systematic , comprehensive , and multidimensional characteristics of military thinking .  
Using network resources and conducting research on the question of launching a people 's war on the net are of strong practical significance in making good preparations for military struggle .  In addition , they are also of profound and far-reaching historical significance in developing the strategic ideology of launching people 's war .  
Our military 's scientific and technical strength lags fairly far behind that of the western armed forces , therefore , the scientific and technological resources in the masses of people will be the essential supplement and effective support for our military to win a victory under inferior conditions during a high-tech war .  
Wei Ziqing ( researcher and member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering ) : The use of satellite navigation is extremely widespread , from outer space to the land and sea , and from military and economic activities to our human and social lives , it reaches every trade and industry , e.g . , space navigation , determining satellite orbits , space surveys and mapping , weapons guidance , traffic and transportation , agriculture , forestry , and mining , geodetic surveys , and rescue and disaster relief , etc . 
The spatial data infrastructure is the key to building the digitized battlefield .  There is a great deal of intricate and complex battlespace data related to military operations , but the primary spatial data includes geodetic references , digital orthographic projection maps , digital elevation models , and digital topographic maps , etc .  
Over a long period of time , our military academies have integrated basic education with professional training .  As a result , our military academies have been vacillating between building a solid foundation for their students and meeting the need of students ' first job after their graduation .  This practice has made it difficult to enhance students ' quality and achieve economic performance of scale .  
The authorized sizes of our military academies are rather irrational .  It is necessary to make great efforts to enhance students ' scientific and cultural foundation as well as their ability in commanding and management .  We should run well the National Defense University , which aims at cultivating senior commanders who participate in the joint training program for officers of the three forces .  
Over the past years , our military junior colleges have provided different training programs for commanding skill and technical skill .  Military academies at the intermediate level have offered different programs for their students in accordance with their professional specialties , for example , military affairs , political affairs , logical affairs , and general staff .  Officers from artillery , armament , engineering , and communications branches have had to learn at different schools to acquire the skill for commanding a particular military branch and the skill for commanding joint operations .  
We should concentrate our manpower as well as financial and material resources on building a group of high-ranking academies and universities that have clear-cut military characteristics .  We should give priority to supporting a group of academic departments and laboratories that have utmost bearing on future wars .  These academic departments and laboratories will play a role as an initiator and demonstrator for all military academies .  
In upholding the new thinking of running schools with an open-minded spirit , we should make the following efforts : We should gear education of military academies toward society , dovetail it with the state 's higher education , learn from the reform experiences gained by local universities , extensively carry out cooperative exchanges , rely on the solid strength of local colleges and universities , and cultivate military officers through joint efforts made by military and civil sectors .  
They should make joint efforts in running schools and in tackling key technical problems .  We should enable military schools gear toward the world by gradually expanding their exchanges and cooperation with their foreign counterparts .  We should make bold efforts in learning and borrowing advanced ideas and useful experiences from foreign military academies by exchanging students and conducting scientific research cooperation with them .  
The reflection of knowledge economy and innovative ability in military domain can be seen in the emergence of intellectual weaponry , informationized warfare , and military units that are equipped with digitized equipment .  This is a fact , which proves that the first and earliest application of advanced and new science and technology is in the battlefield .  Therefore , the innovation of military knowledge , the innovation of military science and technology , and the innovation of strategy and operational method are necessary for defeating the enemy and winning the victory .  
In order to deepen the teaching reform , we should strive to achieve this goal : We should cultivate personnel who are qualified politically and ideologically , who have a top-notch military quality , who have a solid foundation in science and culture , who have a profound understanding of professional skill , who have a rather strong innovative ability , and who have a fine physical and mental quality .  
Chen Xiaojin : Over the past 20 years since reform and opening up , in accordance with a series of important instructions issued by Comrade Deng Xiaoping , including " China-made vessels should fight into the international market , " China 's shipbuilding industry has adhered to export as its orientation ; has forged ahead with pioneering efforts ; has realized such a strategic transformation from " building vessels for military use in the main " to " turning vessels for military use into vessels for civil use and building vessels for civil use in the main " ;  
The fundamental task of the ideological and political construction in military academies and universities in the new situation is , on the basis of winning wars and opposing corruption , to insure constructing high-quality military academies and universities in the correct direction and to insure realizing the purpose of cultivating high-quality talented military people .  
On the one hand , the ideological and political construction should push forward military academies and universities to further emancipate their thinking , change their perceptions , face modernization , face the world , face the future , catch up with the world trend of scientific and technological advances , of military revolution and of educational advances , create famous brands and struggle to be first class .  
In the process of ideological and political construction , we must take improving ideological and political qualities as the first task in cultivating high-quality talented military people ; meanwhile , we should insure students are competent in such aspects as science and culture , professional military skills , physical abilities and psychological qualities .  
At present , our military 's political and ideological work is facing many new problems like how to correctly understand and appropriately handle the relationship of honoring modern educational laws versus bringing to full play our military 's political advantages , teaching scientific and cultural knowledge versus cultivating military people 's ideological and political qualities and stimulating an academic and research atmosphere versus maintaining high ideological unity .  
As in-depth changes in the military fields in the world are caused by the development of modern science and technology , especially high technology , the scientific and technological content of army building and modern warfare has been increased to an unprecedentedly high level .  This has put ever higher demands on the scientific and cultural qualities of our officers and men .  
As far as the present situation is concerned , making full preparations for military combat ( jun shi dou zheng ) is the most realistic and urgent strategic mission for the whole army .  This will have a bearing not only on the realization of the great cause of reunifying the motherland but on whether our army will be able to have the strategic initiative in hand in the future .  
The proliferation of information technology and the trend toward global economic and technological unification have further heightened the speed of technological propagation .  This has moved forward our starting point , skipping certain developmental stages , and providing innumerable opportunities for realizing generation crossing developments in military construction .  
To ensure uniformity with the task of preparing for a military struggle , informationization should be matched with the technical level of troop equipment .  The aim of informationization development of China 's army must keep the world military development in large reference , based on the possible developments in future warfare , particularly the possible operational opponents that might be faced .  We must find exact positions in accordance with the integration of the required and possible , evaluating whether they fit with the highest criteria of future war for integration .  
We need both an overall objective for the entire military and focused practical missions for all military branches and theater troops , confirming different separate goals , remembering not to blindly push for expediency , or go into grandiose projects .  
Instructions , requirements , and working plans from superiors are transmitted through computers , entrusted tasks and work arrangements for the lower levels are received and processed by computers , work implementation progress reports and proposals are also submitted through computer systems , and electronic mail is gradually replacing official documents and the telephone .  Network mechanisms have become an indispensable unified operating method for integrating the American military .  
The present training revolution in the American military is primarily embodied in the use of information , simulation , network , and artificial intelligence technology , and the methods and process in changing training have enabled the troops to receive " full physical and mental " training in simulating the " combined man and machine environment " of real combat .  Before engaging in real fire exercises the troops are already prepared with a fair amount of practice in operational skills , even using simulation to train for weapons systems that have yet to become operational .  
On the basis that an all level network will gradually become familiar with office , strategic , and technical exercises , we should strengthen the joint communications connections of the information networks of all military branches , taking the theater level as the base unit .  In particular we should pay attention to applying computer network technology and satellite technology , gradually expanding the three branches joint network training avenues by forming into one entity the training among combat , support , and logistics systems among the various military branches .  
At present , the most pressing is to cultivate a unified military and technological database to develop talent , and timely extension of investigation of military strong points and survey of large military areas , constructing precise military-use digital mapping .  Thus we will lay a fine foundation for network troop training and operational simulation .  
The regiment commander took his staff officers in charge of training to the company where they set up a group to tackle training bottlenecks with regard to the new equipment .  The group was formed by three platoon leaders , who had just been assigned to the company by a military academy , as well as some of the company 's backbone training personnel known for better education .  After working hard for two months , the group compiled a user-friendly training program and some teaching materials complete with detailed contents and scientific standards .  
We should carry out and implement the Program from the heightened perspective of strategy and the overall situation , should understand at a profound level the important significance of emphasizing the construction of command automation for accelerating our military 's modernization construction and for winning high-tech wars , should strengthen our sense of mission and sense of urgency , should conscientiously follow the principle that local interests are subordinate to overall interests and current interests are subordinate to future interests , and should improve the construction 's overall effectiveness and benefit .  
We have taken the complementary paths of pre-study and modeling , import and self-development , scientific research and production , military products and civil products , and scientific and technological development and nurturing of human talent for scientific research units being brought into the marketplace in order to implement high starting points for development and a name brand strategy and advance into the " open " market seeking new points for profit increase .  
If we combine requirements and possibilities in our considerations , we discover that our army and those of developed Western countries show remarkable differences .  Our army 's equipment development has been carried out in a larger context , ensuring that economic development is the center , and has developed under an increasingly constrained situation .  National conditions , military conditions , and the requirements of the " three steps forward " strategy have all determined that our army must pursue equipment development in strides .  
Operations under high-tech conditions are the combined operations of all the military branches ; and in adapting correspondingly , equipment support can only be planned overall after going through the three branches ' joint support , and only then will there be a rational distribution of resources , organizational chaos be overcome , waste of materials and equipment be overcome , work procedures be simplified , and non-support consumption be lessened , fully putting into play the capability of existing resources .  
In line with a civilian market having abundant technology and products that are suited to the requirements of military equipment , many civilian-use technologies such as electronics technology , information technology , production technology , and materials technologies , all of which have developed rapidly , our army has instituted several " joint logistics reforms " and logistics reforms with " socialized support " as the main content , thus decreasing the burden and lengthening the strides forward .  
From this , our army 's development , based on support , has proceeded only on a shrunken scale , weakening the military 's function in managing society ; the larger development trend has already gradually realized self-support capabilities integrated with socialized support .  
In the face of the " Taiwan independence " forces that are running wild and an adverse international current against China in particular , we must pay close attention to making preparations for a military struggle , keep increasing our defense capacity , do our utmost to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland and to safeguard our state sovereignty and the interests of the people , and ensure that our armed forces are capable of fighting and winning when the motherland and the people need them .  
In the United States , debates revolving round the NMD program are turning hotter , and voices of opposition to it getting louder , in the military and academic circles .  In their public comments , many " celebrities " and knowledgeable personages in society have noted that technically this program has its inherent flaws and poses national security and political dangers .  
We must regard the study and implementation of this important thinking a fundamental approach to and a long-term strategic mission for enhancing party organizations ' cohesion and combat strength , for ensuring the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces , and for accomplishing the two historical tasks of " winning the war " and " preventing degeneration . "  We must make unremitting efforts to study and implement this important thinking so as to improve party building in the armed forces and raise the standards of military construction in all areas .  
The General Staff , Political , and Logistics Departments and major military units held party committee and standing committee meetings on numerous occasions to study and grasp the important thinking .  The principal leaders of these departments and units were personally involved in the mobilization efforts and took the lead in discussing their personal experience and in attending lectures .  
In the course of studying the " three represents , " party committees of the armed forces and armed police units at and above the army level felt that party committees and leading cadres not only should act as model practitioners of the " three represents " but they should also shoulder the responsibility of guiding the party committees of subordinate military units in meeting the " three represents " requirements and advance party building in the military units in an all-round way .  
In recent years , the Chinese military has greatly improved war readiness , training , routine work , living conditions , and other infrastructure conditions .  Basic construction in operational command at the army corps level organs , in war readiness duty , and in automatic network centers has taken initial shape , reached a relatively advanced level , thus providing excellent conditions and effective guarantees for leading organs to practice effective organization , command , and routine management over the troop units .  
We should put special stress on the scientific and technological projects that are of crucial strategic , fundamental , and key significance to our national defense and to our military modernization development , should accelerate our measures for solving key problems in these projects , should make painstaking effort and should work in an independent and innovative manner .  
This division also collected information on a topology of rivers , lakes , bridges , and important military sites , tactical diagrams , and other software systems , totaling more than 100 sets .  Using on-line confrontation and other methods , they probed cross-river , aerial , and railway transportation exercise ; loading of landing craft ; as well as resisting and attacking enemy forces , and accumulated a host of material and laboratory data for mobile combat .  
First , the final document avoids a grim aspect of the current international security situation in order to achieve unanimity in consultations .  In recent years , military factors have increased in international relations , with some military groups being expanded and strengthened .  
This is an important measure that the General Department of Politics took to carry out and implement Chairman Jiang 's important directive on improving the purposefulness , efficiency and creativeness of the military 's ideological and political work , and it is a lively and vivid textbook for the military to deeply promote the ideological and ethic education .  
It is one of our military 's excellent traditions in ideological and political work to help the broad number of officials and soldiers to strengthen their conviction , mold their sentiment and inspire their fighting spirit by singing revolutionary songs .  
In the new situation of reform and opening-up and developing a socialist market economy , when the historic topic of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " lies ahead , it is both the earnest expectation of the Party and the masses and the objective requirement for implementing our military 's sacred mission to strengthen the military 's ideological and morality construction and to cultivate revolutionary military professions with the " Four Haves " .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " firmly takes hold of this critical topic , retells in artistic form that officials and soldiers like to hear and see the brilliant history in which the people 's military united to struggle under the Party 's leadership , reflects the fundamental moral requirements for revolutionary military professionals in the new phase and displays the vigorous and progressive spiritual outlook of modern military professionals , having developed a new thinking on reforming the military 's ideological and political education .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " including not only the booming and forceful songs for marching drills but also the cordial and moving songs for expressing one 's feelings and the lively and impassioned songs for collectively singing in a sing-and-response style , displays through many forms the spiritual outlook and the plain but heartfelt feelings that are unique in our military officials and soldiers .  The words and music of these songs directly relate to the lives of grassroots officials and soldiers and are concise , easily understood , musical and easily disseminated .  
Adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership over the military , improving the competitiveness of winning high-tech wars in the future , loving and devoting oneself to the motherland , making painstaking efforts , officials and soldiers being friendly and loving each other , and maintaining the revolutionary moral integrity and so on are all critical issues that Chairman Jiang has been paying close attention to and has repeatedly laid stress on in recent years .  
By learning and singing these songs , we aim to strengthen the spiritual backbone of revolutionary military professionals , to improve the moral quality of the broad number of officials and soldiers , and to enable them to receive education , to purify their spiritual world , mold their attitude and improve their conscientiousness through aesthetic educational activities conducted in a way that influences their environment .  
All troops should associate singing these songs with ideological and political education , enthusiastically respond to Chairman Jiang 's call that " the military 's civilization construction should proceed at the forefront of the whole society " , make effort to become exemplary figures who put into practice , and enthusiastically spread this advanced ideology and culture .  
We should sing aloud the " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " to enable these songs that are revolutionary , advanced , healthy and progressive to echo in military camps , to enrich our lives , to inspire our spirit , to serve our strengthening and accelerating our military 's fighting strength , to serve our strengthening and improving ideological and political work , and to serve our constructing a socialist spiritual civilization .  
The group of songs reflects the basic ethical demands on the revolutionary military personnel in the new period and is the vivid teaching material to enhance the troop units ' ideological and political building .  
Conscientious organization of the singing of these songs by military personnel is of major significance to nurture high ethical standards for officers and men , to carry forward the excellent tradition and style of the people 's army , to build an excellent image for a powerful and civilized army , and to promote reform of ideological and political education .  
The rich ideological content of those songs realizes the spirit of Chairman Jiang 's major instructions on enhancing the Army 's ideological and political education , warmly eulogizes the nature and purposes of the people 's army and the glorious chapters of unity and struggle under the Party leadership , and displays the spiritual outlook of the vigorous and high-fighting spirit contemporary military personnel .  Songs are varied in style .  
The circular also called on various units to make good use of the compact discs distributed by the General Political Department to teach the singing of those songs , to organize literary and artistic workers to go deep among the troops to help train key cadres , to provide guidance for officers and men in learning to sing , and to bring about the singing of the songs to uplift the ethical standards of military personnel resonate in all barracks via organizing singing contest , holding evening parties , closed circuit television , and cable television .  
The entire army turned righteous indignation into the concrete action of undergoing scientific and technological military training in protest of the flagrant use of guided missile by the US-led Nato to attack our embassy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
In line with their sacred missions and tasks , officers and men adhered to high standards and strove to set first-class standard .  They comprehensively improved their ideological and political quality ; quality of military professionalism ;  
scientific , technological , and cultural quality ; and physical and mental quality .  All these also reflected an important trend in the implementation of the conference spirit by all units : The units closely integrated theory with practice , and always focused on major issues such as direction and strategy , so as to earnestly strengthen ideological and political work , and actively promote military modernization .  
Located in border and coastal areas , Dandong city has many chemical plants .  To step up preparations for military struggles and prevent sudden environmental pollution incidents , the Dandong city government and the army units stationed there gathered materials relevant to the urban unclear and chemical plants attacked during the Gulf War and Kosovo War and drew up a meticulous and thorough emergency plan .  
Strengthening the Party 's and the military 's aims should be taken as the basic requirement for such study programs as Party committees ' central groups , the Party 's life , theoretical learning programs for cadres and ideological education periodically held in the military .  We should devote unswerving , profound and permanent efforts , brand it and root it through periodic and repeated and effectively find answers from the bottom of their heart for the questions of " Why did we join the Party ?  What do we work for ?  
As far as the military is concerned , a very important aspect in adhering to the Party 's basic line is to implement of the strategy of building up the military in quality and to consistently conform to the combat strength standard , with comprehensively strengthening the military 's combat force and making sufficient preparations for winning high-tech wars in the future as both the starting point and the end-result of all our work .  
In leading our army 's modernization , Comrade Jiang Zemin is applying Mao Zedong 's military thinking and Deng Xiaoping 's army-building thinking for the new period while adopting some new practices .  He has put forward the task of " ideological and political education " which is of great importance and epochal significance , emphasized the necessity to put ideological and political education above all else in the army , discussed in many ways how to strengthen ideological and political education , and advanced a series of important thinking .  
Upholding the party 's absolute leadership over the army is always a main subject of our army 's ideological and political education .  After they join the army , the most important education service members receive is " military spirit " .  In the final analysis , when troop units hold lectures , publish blackboard newspapers , show motion pictures , stress traditions , and organize visits to sacred places of revolution , all such activities are closely linked to " the gun obeying the party " .  
Everywhere , from South China Sea outposts to northern borders , from east coasts to snowy plateau , headquarters offices , grass-roots companies and other units have done a great deal of arduous and meticulous ideological education work , focusing on " forever unchanged military spirit " .  Some generals personally give political lectures .  
Faced with the new situation where science and technology are developing rapidly and high technology is being applied extensively in the military field , our army should train a large number of new-type military personnel who are militarily and politically competent and who have acquired good command of modern scientific and cultural knowledge .  This is the key for our army to gain the initiative in future military struggles and shoulder the historical missions entrusted by the party and the people .  
The general goal of relying on regular higher education to train military cadres is , in line with the principle of formulating overall plans , making steady progress , and ensuring quality , to adopt various measures to encourage and attract students of regular schools of higher learning to work in the military after graduation and to establish systems and formulate and improve policies and rules to gradually increase the number of students selected to receive the training and improve the training quality so to secure stable and reliable sources of high-quality personnel for the military .  
By 2010 , military specialized technical cadres competent for both military and civilian services should basically be trained mainly by regular schools of higher learning , and a proper number of graduates from regular schools of higher learning should be selected to fill command posts , so that the knowledge structure and scientific and cultural levels of military cadres can be improved fundamentally and a military personnel training system compatible with China 's national conditions and our army 's characteristics can take shape .  
and for regular schools of higher learning to recruit regular senior high school graduates who are excellent both in character and learning in line with the directional enrollment plans of relevant state and military departments , make sure that they receive necessary military and political training while completing their college courses , and assign them to work in the military according to what they are trained for .  
Relevant State Council departments and provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments are responsible for giving guidance to their subordinate regular schools of higher learning designated to train cadres for the military .  
Units at the military region level will establish offices composed of various functional departments to take charge of the training of reserve military officers .  Major duties of the offices are to organize and guide their subordinate units to select and train students of regular schools of higher learning , provide military and political training , and examine and recruit these students .  
Provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments and relevant State Council departments should clarify the responsibilities of their subordinate functional departments and strengthen guidance for their subordinate regular schools of higher learning to train high-quality personnel for the military .  
We should combine that basis with the thinking of officers and men , carry out psychological adjustment education , provide guidance to officers and men to cultivate lofty ideals , for good mentality , for living well , and to help lay a solid ideological foundation for training " four haves " military personnel .  
The city has developed , in a selected and planned manner , more than 130 projects that can manufacture products both for military and civilian purposes .  To meet the need of military maneuvers , the city has repeatedly made such a conversion in an effort to turn sci-tech achievements into combat capability .  Now a total of 16 high-tech industrial enterprises are able to manufacture military articles to meet various needs at short notice .  
In the meantime , to meet the need of military combat readiness in the new period , they have integrated wartime and peacetime work , coordinated military and civilian affairs , and worked out an overall plan on building regional battlegrounds in cooperation with the troops stationed in the relevant region , by focusing on port , communication , and ship building .  
China 's funds for national defense construction are all used for protecting state security and territorial integrity .  China keeps the army in condition but will not engage in unjust military ventures .  The limited military expenditures are used to raise the living standard of officers and soldiers and improve weapons and equipment .  
This important policy decision contains a scientific summing-up of our army 's practice in qualified personnel cultivation in last several decades , a creative exploration of a way to attain the grand objective of cross-century development in our army 's modernization , and a farsightedness which has a bearing on whether or not our army can march in the front ranks of the world military development in the future .  
He said that our army 's cadre ranks must be developed in an allaround way and up-to-standard ideologically and politically and in terms of scientific and educational level , military occupational specialty , and physical and mental conditions , and they must have a good overall quality .  
After a certain number of years ' efforts , the army 's technical cadres with specialties of both military and civilian applicability will be cultivated mainly through regular higher education , some outstanding regular college graduates will fill the commander 's position of the army 's grass-roots units , and around 40 percent of the army 's annual cadre replenishment will be those trained through regular higher education .  
A constant flow of vast numbers of high-quality personnel with modern science and general knowledge into the army will further optimize the knowledge structure and greatly raise the scientific and cultural level of military cadre ranks , and will provide a strong knowledge , science and technology backing for army building .  
Cultivating military cadres with the assistance of civilian colleges and universities is an inevitable choice made to adapt to the world 's military development trends , to the " Two fundamental changes " in our military construction and to the needs for " winning wars " in the future .  It is a practical step in carrying out and implementing the essence of Chairman Jiang 's directives .  
Judging from the craft 's own characteristics , they can be used for powerful surprise attacks in a short period from its good mobility , easy concealment nature , accurate firing power and strong antipersonnel force .  Therefore , Taiwan 's military considers those crafts as an important component part in fighting at coastal waters .  
In a new historic stage , the construction of the ranks of cadres faces many new cases and new problems , among which is the conspicuous contradiction of the scientific and technological qualities in the ranks of cadres failing to conform to the requirements for constructing our military modernization and for winning regional wars under high-tech conditions .  
We should take a strategic view of being responsible for the future of our military construction .  We should devote efforts to doing well the work of cultivating , using and improving college-graduate cadres .  We should change our thinking , make reasonable arrangements , and create the conditions so that they , in military construction , can make great achievements that are worthy of this great epoch .  
Among these innovations , the solar-energy chargers for three kinds of practical storage batteries that are easy to carry , can be carried in vehicles and are movable were developed by the military transportation and traffic section that took the lead in the whole army in using solar energy batteries to replace the charge of batteries with electricity .  They were developed in line with the characteristics that they are used for air force vehicles and for supporting purpose .  The development has resolved the major difficulties in providing support for air force vehicles for many years .  
With an aim of ensuring " victory during the fight " , these achievements were completed in line with the existing equipment and future tasks .  They demonstrated not only strong support capacity during the troops ' routine flight training but also outstandingly supported major military operations such as war tactics drill in the Western region and national grand military parade in the capital .  
Firepower warfare has lasted a long period in the history of modern wars .  As people have entered into the period of high technologies , brand new contents and characteristics have been added to firepower warfare .  The long-range , accurate , highly efficient , and rapid reaction natures of firepower call for profound changes in the military 's principles and types and methods of fighting , and also set new tests and demands on a country 's war preparations and building of armed forces .  
In local war , one strictly selects military and non-military targets and employs the most accurate and " humane " attack .  This tactic itself shows the political nature and purpose of war , but more and more economic targets of the other side with war potential will be included in targets for attack by firepower .  
Even more serious , the " ABM Treaty " is built on the basis of the theory of relative security ; it brought about relative balance of US and Soviet nuclear offensive and defensive forces through " mutually assured destruction " and prevented either side from carrying out a preemptive nuclear strike , while the US NMD is aimed at achieving its unilateral absolute military superiority and absolute security .  
In the light of glorious achievements attained in military logistical building and reform in the past decade , leaders from the logistics departments of major military units and the Armed Police Corps as well as experts and scholars from some universities and institutes had an in-depth discussion .  Their discussion focused on the epochal background for Chairman Jiang to give major expositions on logistical work , and characteristics and guiding position of his theory .  
Participants unanimously held that Chairman Jiang viewed military logistical building in a new era from the angle of time and strategy , applied Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's ideology on military logistical building , scientifically analyzed new contradictions and problems in logistical work under a new situation , and guided the military to great progress in logistical adjustment and reform by integrating theory with reality .  As a result , the level of our logistical building has been raised markedly and a new trail for military logistical building with a Chinese characteristic has been blazed .  
Evolving around the main theme of " strong support " , the meeting put forward concrete measures for carrying out Chairman Jiang 's expositions on logistical work in terms of fundamental targets , key links , and major methods , making suggestions for military logistical building and reform .  
We should adjust the military 's logistical structure in a scientific manner based on the principle of being qualified , combination , and high efficiency , perfect the support system , strengthen mobile support forces , and enhance the strategic support function .  
In his speech , Wang Ke pointed out that Chairman Jiang 's major expositions on logistical work , which closely evolve around the national and military conditions and address such basic questions as what logistics should be built and how to develop logistics , represent a new development of Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's military logistical ideology , a scientific summary of logistical work 's features and patterns under a new situation , and a powerful ideological weapon and an action guidebook for military logistical modernization in a new era .  
Today the international political situation is becoming multi-polarized and revolutionary innovations have emerged in international military sectors .  Our military bases its fundamental preparation for military struggle in winning local wars under the conditions of modern technology , especially high tech conditions .  The priority of military production is changing from quantity to quality and labor-based to technology-based methods .  
We should depend on ourselves and be innovative .  We should try to make significant breakthroughs in strategic , fundamental and crucial sectors and should devote great efforts to accelerating measures for transforming achievements in scientific research into combat strength and productive forces .  These are urgent and significant issues confronting the colleges and universities of our military .  
In accordance with such a regulation that " the Hong Kong Garrison shall inform in advance the Hong Kong SAR Government before conducting training , exercises , or other military activities as well as activities concerning the public interests in the Hong Kong SAR " , the garrison has informed in a timely fashion the SAR Government or published in advance a public notice in the SAR Government Gazette in accordance with the provisions of the Hong Kong law before conducting an outdoor live-fire shooting exercise .  
An absolute majority of the social organizations or people in Hong Kong have supported or cherished the garrison in a variety of ways ; have agreed that the Hong Kong Garrison is entitled in accordance with the law to all rights , interests , or exemptions as demanded by its duties ; and have shown full understanding for the training , exercises , or other military activities held by the garrison in line with its defense duties .  
Specifically , it is necessary to achieve actual effects in correcting the guiding ideology for work and overcoming the formalism , in enhancing the unit 's level of training the military with science and technology , in strengthening the ideological and political building of the unit , and in resolving the hot and difficult issues which have confounded the grass-roots level over a long period of time .  
For instance , after the Central Military Commission decided the military troops " should not be involved in doing business " but " live on royal food " , the military cut down the real estate scale and stopped its real estate business .  In this situation , how should the military implement an effective administration and prevent its assets from flowing away ?  
Training for our army 's mechanized troops has entered a new phase because we have inspected our science-and-technology military training achievements in a " stage " of war that resembled modern war , and departed from previous " playacting " exercises that were based on wishful thinking .  
First , national independence and liberation of the people had to be achieved - - this was the biggest liberation of the productive force and required opposition of the imperialist and feudal military forces as well as unification of the petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie classes to establish a broad , united revolutionary battlefront .  
When the soldiers ran down the hill , they were already wet and exhausted .  As soon as the exercise ended , cadres of the company promptly exhorted the soldiers that the new equipment training was aimed at testing the comprehensive military quality of soldiers .  They said that even though they had four-wheeled armored vehicles , they still needed to train their two legs , and that only when the strong skills were maintained and new skills were not weak could they realize a new leap in combat strength .  
Amid a wave of criticisms , Tang Yao-ming , chief of the general staff of the Taiwan military , had no choice but to hold an urgent news conference on 7 July . Using fallacious reasoning , he claimed : The so-called " fighting a decisive battle offshore " is very different in meaning from " fighting an offshore decisive battle " .  
Therefore , the unit , relying on its own efforts in the face of these difficulties , took the initiative in carrying out coordinated training with a transportation regiment of the military region , a helicopter wing , and a naval test base under the support of the military region 's relevant department .  For the first time in the entire armed forces , it conducted a long-distance three-dimensional maneuver for its troops by four transportation methods - - " sea routes , air links , railways , and highways " .  The maneuver was a success .  
The general drilling site commander , with a sun-tanned face , declared : This combat drill indicates that , as a number of effective methods of scientific and technological troops training have been converted into combat strength , our army has made substantial progress in rapid barrier-breaking landing , operations to hit strongly built enemy targets , operations to counter precision strikes , camouflage of important military facilities , electronic countermeasure , and computer network protection .  
For instance , there are many outstanding or top-notch people of great academic attainments in society who have attained a high level in scientific research and professional skills , but military units can not enlist them because of their age and physical conditions ; in such a case , we can adopt a measure for employment under contract so that we can use their knowledge , technology , and other intellectual resources and that they can provide services for us in a certain way and at a definite time .  2 .  
The most visible intention was the new Taiwan leader 's public putting forward the military strategic concept of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " in an attempt to turn defensive into offensive and to issue a military threat to the mainland .  
But due to Russia 's stiff resistance , the United States dares not make the plunge outright and is compelled to constantly enhance political , economic , military , and diplomatic relations with Ukraine and with other neighboring countries of Russia and to realize its strategic purposes gradually through " contacts " and in a " trot-like " manner .  
In addition to infiltrating Russia 's neighboring countries , the United States has also accelerated the pace of developing diplomatic and military cooperation relations with Mongolia in a " leapfrog " fashion in an attempt to take advantage of the unique strategic position of Mongolia and to place " an outpost " between China and Russia to monitor and control the movements of China and Russia and to deter Russia from the south and to carry out " peaceful evolution " against China from the north .  
Meanwhile , military lawyers , as political workers , should consider the ultimate goal of their legal services as one of serving the armed forces ' political and ideological construction and increasing the relevancy and effectiveness of ideological and political work in the new period while performing their professional duties .  
Like their civilian counterparts , the legal affairs that military lawyers have to handle involve those relevant to criminal , civil , economic , administrative , maritime , and financial laws , and so they must be totally familiar with the laws and regulations of the country so that they can properly handle the legal affairs in the armed forces and legal affairs that involve both military and civilian departments ;  
Only when military lawyers are fully familiar with the country 's laws and regulations as well as military regulations and rules and understand the spirit of their legislation can they provide military leaders and organizations at different levels with proper legal advice , differentiate competent and incompetent servicemen , differentiate lawful and unlawful behaviors , and help servicemen perform their duties more competently .  
The college conforms to its motto of " dedication , strictness , struggling for might , and being realistic " and creatively promotes education using the name of the " blue Project " , with its theme of loving battleships , loving islands and loving the sea .  This education has reinforced ideals and conviction , the sense of the military soul and the spirit of dedication .  This is compared to rooting " three pillars " so that students will become revolutionary military professionals loyal to the Party and to the people .  
On a military training base in the northern frontier where the winds were strong and grasses were robust , a combined real-troop and live-ammunition military exercise engaging in various arms of the services turned the vast grassland into a spectacular painting of a battlefield .  
In addition to making great efforts to strengthen ideological and political construction , all military colleges and universities should face modernization , face the world and face the future .  All military colleges and universities should be motivated to update their concepts of education , further update curricular content and methodology , continuously add new aspects to existing theories , knowledge , technology and tactics , and form a curriculum oriented toward the 21st century .  
Through reform , all the military 's colleges and universities should enable our military 's colleges and universities to catch up with the world 's technological progress , military revolution and trends in educational development with respect to educational concepts , infrastructure , curricular and research capabilities , and academic levels .  All military colleges and universities should create famous brands , try to be members of the first class , and make greater contributions to cultivating and supplying talented military professionals of high quality .  
It is a major political advantage of our Party and state.Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech is not only a powerful ideological weapon to strengthen ideological and political construction in the military , but also the fundamental strategy for devoting efforts to doing well the positive " Three Stresses " education in grassroots organizations and for correctly handling the relationship between the education and work .  
Long fed up with noise caused by flight training of US military planes , some 5,500 Japanese citizens living near Kadena Air Base in Okinawa angrily filed a suit in Okinawa Prefecture Court on 27 March this year accusing the Japanese Government of an " illegal act " in allowing US forces to set up military bases in residential areas , calling on US forces to immediately cease night flights , and demanding 6 billion Japanese yen in reparation to victims .  
On this foundation , the Guangzhou military area artillery group continues to deepen the trial .  They expanded the " rapid reaction " system to a digital system that is command motor agile , correspondent network convenient , message current , reconnoiter measure diversity , which brings about the entirely digital automation from reconnoiter goal , message handle and assistant determination to the whole process of shooting .  
In the face of air threat under the modern high-tech conditions , the most practical issues lying before the air defense forces in making sound preparations for the military struggle are to create a new theory of operation , new contents of training , new methods of training , and a new ground antiaircraft operational command system by centering on " winning " the future war with anti-air raid as its main aspect so as to meet the needs of future anti-air raid operations .  
Dependents of military cadres are a special occupational group .  Realizing the objective of " people having jobs and jobs being profitable " depends first on favorable policies and second on personal quality .  The latter is more important .  
This sub-section has taken the lead in conducting this new method of joint tri-service transportation under modern operational conditions in the whole army to meet the needs of future military struggles since the formal initiation of the combined service system .  
During recent years , they " sharpened " themselves with the tasks of dealing with the priorities and difficulties in information operations and electronic countermeasures , established more than 20 tasks to tackle difficult problems in science-technology military training , including acquiring new knowledge , mastering new equipment , studying new military tactics and training high-quality personnel .  Through taking specific measures such as fixing the training content , measures , levels , and steps , they institutionalized and standardized science-technology military training .  
The regiment successively built a comprehensive military tactics training ground which integrated the strategy of railway loading and unloading tactics , shooting with light weapons , and positional defense training , and a military officer training center with all functions , built a language teaching room and a simulation training room , introduced a simulation training system with electronic countermeasures and provided a good service guarantee and technical support for reforming the training methods and studying operational methods .  
This regiment was equipped with certain advanced anti-tank self-propelled guns and anti-tank missiles , but some battalions and companies failed to concentrate their main energies on the development and application of the property of the new equipment and the mastery of weapons in hand .  Instead , they put a lot of financial , material and human resources into learning English and microcomputer technology , and making multi-media software .  All battalions and companies of this regiment reported more than 30 science-technology military training achievements to the regiment in a year .  
They sought high-level and large projects , blindly scaled " heights " , and hankered for large projects and " modern methods " .  Some units focused their thinking on making achievements and exploring new spheres and neglected the mastery of existing equipment .  As a result , science-technology military training deviated from the track .  
The thinking of persisting in the " three represents " under the new historical conditions has clearly defined the political direction , political standard , and political requirement for the building of our military ; and is of an extremely important and far-reaching significance to strengthening the party 's ideological leadership , political leadership , and organizational leadership over the military , and to ensuring that our military can forever march forward under the banner of the party and can always retain the nature and the aim of a people 's military .  
We must make bold explorations , and have the courage to carry out implementation in such aspects as the policy system , the organizational mechanism , incentive measures , and means for ensuring a sufficient logistical supply , and constantly enhance the vigor of the military work .  In our innovation of the methods of operation , methods of training , and methods of management , we should set our eyes on improving the quality of our military ;  
and guide the vast numbers of our officers and men to establish a correct outlook on the world , life , and values so that they can always retain the true political color of revolutionary military men .  Third , we should keep to the correct direction , and never waver in upholding the principle that the party should command the gun .  To strengthen the ideological and political building in line with the requirement of " three represents " , the heart of the issue is to uphold the party 's absolute leadership over the military ;  
The grand military review in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the founding of China , and the successful taking over of defense affairs of Macao by the PLA Macao Garrison troops demonstrated to the whole world the fine qualities and new image of a mighty army , a cultivated army and a triumphant army .  
The state security and the people 's interests lie in building up a powerful , modernized , standardized and revolutionary army , in fully preparing for military struggles in the new stage and in winning possible future high-tech regional wars .  
During the combined " circum-Pacific " military exercises staged in June and July , the United States took the lead in conducting a one-week humanitarian rescue operation code-named " Strong Angel " .  Their idea is : If two neighboring nations resort to arms , a third nation ( and its allies ) will send naval forces and marine corps to prevent the war from escalating and thus ensure regional " stability " .  They will also send food , tents , and other necessities of life to the invaded nation .  
A Japanese reporter said in the Tokyo Shimbun that the circum-Pacific military exercise in which the United States plays a leading role was designed to enhance the technological level of naval vessels in a decisive battle , but its nature has changed a great deal " .  " The recent military exercises are a part of the ' non-war military operations ' strategy drawn up by the US Army " .  
The implication is that the US army will take part in military actions not relating to wars staged in all places throughout the world .  These actions serve as an important complement to the strategy by which the US army has won two massive regional wars .  The action comprises keeping peace , achieving peace through mandatory measures , humanitarian assistance , rescue operations at home and abroad , providing disaster relief , and fighting terrorism and narcotics .  
In the 1999 Kosovo war , the United States further turned " humanitarian assistance " into a pretext for interfering in the internal affairs of a sovereign state , raising the " non-war military operation " to a strategic level .  
Sometimes maybe only units of a certain armed service are needed , but usually combined forces including active units and reserve forces are needed " .  " In the meantime , the skills and resources provided by multinational forces , regional organizations , international bodies , non-government organizations , voluntary organizations , and private organizations should be adequately made use of , if possible " , to ensure that the US army 's " non-war military operation " will achieve the intended objective .  
The training exercise command center on board the vessel , which had been jointly set up by the units of the state organs or military units concerned , had found out or tackled problems through coordination ; had revised in a timely fashion both the measures and steps for the wartime emergency mobilization and requisition of civilian vessels ; and had built a faster and highly efficient operational mechanism during the training exercise .  
Due to people 's being tired of and paying less attention to the conventional battle with firepower , confusion has emerged in military theory and the study of military theory on fighting with firepower has seriously lagged behind .  The situation will influence our judgment and selection in the types of a future war and affect our understanding and policy-making in the structure and building of the armed forces .  
Fighting with firepower has lasted a long period in the history of modern wars .  When people have entered into the period of high technologies , brand new contents and characteristics have added to fighting with firepower .  The long-range , accurate , highly efficient and rapid reaction natures of firepower call for profound changes in the military 's principle , types and methods of fighting , and also set new tests and demands on a country 's war preparations and building of armed forces .  
A limited war is to strictly select military and non-military targets and employ the most accurate and " humane " attack .  The tactics itself shows the political nature and purpose of war , but more and more economic targets of the other side with war potential will be included in targets for attack by firepower .  
Relevant military and civilian personnel generally think that frequent exercises not only have rigorously trained the front-support contingent participating in sea battles , but also have strengthened the military-government and military-people relationships in coastal regions and raised the national defense awareness of the masses in these regions .  
At the close of the century , the US accelerated the development of its National Missile Defense ( NMD ) plan , all in the name of defense .  However , the true nature of the plan is to destroy the existing global strategic balance , and to seek to establish a kind of absolute military advantage in both attack and defense .  
The General Department of Politics proposed the education 's objective , composed of four aspects , including " strengthening ideals and convictions , putting into full play exemplary models , improving the atmosphere of the grassroots units and fortifying the role of Party organizations " .  This objective embodies the fundamental requirements of the " three represents " imposed on the Party 's basic-level organizations and its members throughout the military .  
However , when noticing the actual strength and the military movements of the United States , people tend to overlook the fact that the strategic goal of the United States does not simply lie in its pursuit of a military and economic dominance , or in the need for acquiring a guarantee for its national security interests .  Rather , the strategic goal of the United States has another ultimate value , that is , it wishes to " mold " the future world according to its own ideal design .  
The US strategy of human rights and values that we are talking about here is not simply a " soft " power , because it actually interacts with the strong superiority of the United States in the scientific and technological as well as economic fields , and also interacts with the active military presence of the United States in regions concerned .  
In view of the some 100 specialties that had emerged under the new structure , the " leading members " of the brigade 's party committee focused their attention on a " combined capability " which proved to be a key link in the generation of fighting capacity , and issued a " written pledge " : Vying with one another to become " an expert in making a combined use of weapons " in studies , research , training , appraisals , and military exercises .  
The party 's central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core not only consistently upholds Deng Xiaoping Theory and holds high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , but has also enriched and developed Deng Xiaoping Theory in combination with the new conditions and new experience in the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnical policy , military , diplomatic , united front , and party building fields , and added new contents to scientific system of Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
The most fundamental requirement of these is the explicitly stated task for doing ideological and political construction well at military schools in the new situation .  That is : based on " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " , we should ensure the correct direction to build up high-quality military academies and ensure the objective of fostering high-quality military professionals is realized .  
To make it simple , that is to " ensure the correct direction and to produce skilled students " .  This task is based on basic requirements and the historical mission that Chairman Jiang imposed on military schools for ideological and political construction in the new stage .  
It also means and is most crucial to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , adhere to the absolute leadership of the Party , comprehensively implement both the Party 's guiding principle on education and the Central Military Commission 's requirements on running military schools , and maintain the original nature of these schools . " producing skilled students " means to foster high-quality military professionals with a comprehensive training in moral , academic , military and physical aspects and with superior qualities in all other aspects .  
Global interests and responsibilities are the theoretical textbook carefully cooked up by the United States in order to pursue global hegemony , build a geopolitical framework with the Eurasian continent as the main body , and achieve its unipolar strategic goal .  Guided by this strategic goal , the new vision emphasizes joint or combined operations when taking military action , in order to maintain military superiority and create a favorable environment for the United States ;  
The gaining of all-round superiority in Joint Vision is drawn up in light of three changes .  First .  In the wake of the development of transport , telecommunications , and information technology , the trend of economic globalization has markedly speeded up , with the result that US interests and the international environment are closely linked , and this demands that the US military take military action in other regions of the world in joint ( combined ) form ;  
The main aim of Joint Vision in proposing " mutual compatibility " is focused on independent combat by the US military overseas or joint action with allied ( multinational ) units .  
Currently we should put our efforts into in-depth understanding of the specific meaning of preparations for the military struggle in the new period , clarifying the possible specific operational tasks and operational modes we might carry out , and completing training and training the troops to elite status .  
Applying all kinds of advanced simulation equipment and methods ; simulating an almost real combat situation ; putting trainees onto a lively , specific , complex and changing modernized battlefield ; creating a rich battlefield environment ; and allowing the trainees to train in technology , tactics , strategy , and command in a near-real combat situation ; this is the necessary trend for military training development in all nations of the world , and is also the resting place for China 's science and technology to train the troops .  
Base-oriented training is the main mode for functional training .  Possessing the unique characteristics of even more real battlefield simulation , even more normalized organization and implementation , even more scientific training evaluation , and even clearer training results , this mode has already become the development trend in global military training , and is the training mode that must be selected for the Chinese army 's " battlefield " and " market " changes .  
Especially when we face the corrosion and influence of false ideas prevailing in society , constant adjustments in the relationships of public interests and the urgent task of preparing for military struggles , we should find an answer to and resolve the historical issues of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " and should have new and more demanding standards for implementation of the " program " and for the strengthening of grassroots construction .  
Enterprises or local labor and social security departments should help military cadres ' families who were laid off because their enterprises gone bankrupt or suspended production .  Enterprises or local labor and social security departments should follow relevant policies and regulations to protect their basic livelihood condition .  Meanwhile , they should provide them with free professional guidance at least once in a year and free employment recommendation three times a year .  
For military cadres ' families who can not find employment for reasons other than personal one , labor and social security departments can allow them to pay , on a voluntary basis , basic pension insurance fees in accordance with a ratio based on local average wage .  Their pension insurance records can be kept at local employment service organizations .  In addition , they can enjoy exemption or reduction of various management fees .  
With only three years of effort , a common automotive technician has become a " missile expert " The road that Xu Guangfeng has covered is but a detailed embodiment of the pioneering spirit with which officers and soldiers of our military have been trying hard to realize the " two fundamental changes " . 
Under the new international and internal situations , whether or not the Chinese armed forces can keep pace with the military developments in various parts of the world , can win the high-tech wars that might occur in the future , and maintain the character , true color and work style of the people 's armed forces rest primarily with the construction of party organizations in the armed forces ; and also with the mental state , work style , discipline , organization , fighting capabilities and leadership of party organizations in the armed forces .  
Following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the Chinese armed forces ' guiding thought for construction underwent a strategic change .  We have reduced the number of personnel , substantially restructured our sizes , drawn up a strategic policy for military affairs in the new period , and achieved the " two fundamental changes " .  The successes we have achieved have attracted worldwide attention .  
During the process of deepening reforms , we must not waver in upholding all the basic rules governing the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces - - such as the rules on the division of military leaders ' responsibilities and the establishment of political leaders and political bodies in the armed forces - - or rules that the supreme leadership and commanding authority belong to the collective leadership of the party Central Committee , the Central Military Commission , and party committees ( party branches ) .  
Japanese-US joint military exercises have seen great changes in content , form and scale in recent years .  Their advance combat planning has been perfected and their combat capability and level of coordination have been further improved .  The trend of the two sides joining forces in military intervention in the security affairs of the Asia-Pacific region and in the handling of the surrounding situation is becoming more obvious , and this is bound to become a new destabilizing factor in security of the Asia-Pacific region .  
After the cold war ended , the U.S . military 's traditional opponent has gone out of existence .  Driven by its strategic need to assert sole hegemony over the globe with its " new cold-war thinking " and its narrow interest in expanding the increasingly shrinking survival space for military forces , the U.S . military has always been concocting a virtual opponent .  
Third , complexity and uncertainty is constantly growing in the international security environment .  Along with economic globalization , the current rapid development of modern information technology , and the deepening of the new military revolution , both conventional and unconventional security problems have come to the front at the same time ; and the security environment of many countries , especially developing countries , has become more severe and more vulnerable .  
Blair has pointed out at US hearings on numerous occasions that the west Pacific situation does not make one optimistic , and the US forces in the Pacific must therefore be prepared for the worst , and one of the most elementary steps they should take is to deploy cruise missiles on Guam , so that US military response in the west Pacific can be faster and more effective .  
However , the understanding of Klauswitz on purpose and means of war is obscure .  He maintained that there were varied means to achieving a political purpose in war ; however , only combats were " real military actions " , and everything had to be submitted to the highest law of resolving problems by use of weapons " , which finally moved toward the " theory that weapons alone decide the outcome of war " .  
In the local wars that are likely to take place in the future , our military must fully take into consideration the combat power of our military and the demand of a set strategic goal , and strive to achieve the goal of " winning " at a relatively small price when it comes to making a choice regarding the pattern of a firepower combat at the strategic level .  
The creation of military-oriented literary and artistic works that we require means to reflect the mainstream of military life and to keep a lively and vivid record of this great age and the military 's modernization construction instead of generally reflecting the trivial issues in daily life in military camps .  
This requires that creators of literary and artistic works should persistently focus on realistic topics when choosing between historical and realistic ones , and focus on military-oriented topics when choosing between military-oriented topics and non-military ones .  These creators should be enthusiastically concerned about the great process of military construction , firmly take the pulse of life in military camps , and make our excellent spiritual products the satisfactory guide in creating literary and artistic works .  
This requires that we , through profound and solid good work in the grassroots and in close association with the military 's reality , carry out the detailed implementation of the requirement of the " three represents " through a comprehensive improvement of the military 's fighting strength .  Only in this way can we lay down a solid foundation for our military to win modern wars based on technology , especially high technology .  
We should focus on current work assignment and future development all at the same time .  We should ensure that our military talents are equipped with one specialty and many supporting skills and that they are capable of performing alternative work assignments and have a basis for future development .  While focusing on cultivating military talents by using all the facilities and resources the armed forces have , we should also be good at encouraging other sectors to run institutions of higher learning .  
The method of citing examples as a proof and the functional method are both scientific methods for studying a problem .  If we can comprehensively use various advanced methods for the studies of social sciences and natural sciences , then we certainly will have more innovative and advanced elements in our research .  We can avoid the tendency of " paying more attention to the studies of military arts than to the scientific and technology foundation " .  
Meanwhile , we should ensure that military talented personnel have a general understanding of literature , history , philosophy , economy , mathematics , science , engineering , chemistry , biology , and other aspects of knowledge .  With such a background as well as with hard work in practical fields , these people can be all-round persons who can comprehensively utilize various fields of modern knowledge and are equipped with command , professional , and other skills all at the same time .  
The Beijing Military Representatives Bureau has cooperated with five national defense departments of five provinces and cities in northern China , as well as local colleges , universities and scientific research institutes in establishing regional cooperative relations with multiple layers and professions and formed a new pattern of developing military products and scientific research by leaps and bounds .  
The new leading body of the Beijing Military Representatives Bureau conducted in-depth investigation and held a " forum on weaponry development " in late August with the participation of leaders and relevant experts from the offices of science , technology and industry for national defense , in five provinces and cities in northern China , all military enterprises , and military representatives offices stationed in various enterprises and jointly discussed plans with them on scientific research and development of military products .  
Beyond controversy , electronic warfare , military deception , operation secrecy , and psychological warfare are the typical " soft " methods of attack .  And real object destruction is a goal of firepower warfare , in which adjusted firepower weapons are used to hit the enemy 's command posts , command control centers , intelligence centers , and other key places .  
The reason is that if a military attack fails to produce the desired result , especially if casualties of US troops are incurred , it will have a big negative effect on Vice President Al Gore 's quest for the presidency .  On the other hand , the American public has accepted Saddam as the " tyrant " who must be severely punished .  If no action is taken , the Clinton administration will appear weak , which is also not conducive to the creation of an image of authority for Gore .  
Since the beginning of the new stage , especially since the 14th National Party Congress , and facing the complex international situation and profound social change , our military can live through all tests with ideological and political education serving as an important guarantee .  
These changes will exert an extensive , profound and comprehensive influence on the military 's thinking , and challenge ideological and political education in fundamental and temporal ways .  
The " Decision " by the party committee of the PLA General Staff Headquarters pointed out : With a strong sense of dedication to the revolutionary cause and a highly developed sense of political responsibility , Comrade Liu Yixin has brought up large numbers of outstanding talents for the modernization building of our army , and has achieved fruitful results in teaching and scientific research ; and his devotion to the military academic and educational undertaking has set an example for us .  
We should learn from his innovative spirit of " winning the war " and boldly scaling new heights , with which he has developed a strong awareness for guarding against future mishaps , for promoting the country 's scientific and technological development , and for making innovations ; strived to seize commanding heights in the fields of military theories as well as scientific and technological development ; and has achieved tangible results in comprehensively enhancing the ability of our army to " win the war " .  
Party committees at all levels must uphold a strong sense of being responsible for the party 's cause and the military 's construction , think of the future , make long-term plans , devote prolonged effort , and be responsible to generations to come even if they themselves are only in the position for one term .  Party committees at all levels must devote meticulous , long lasting , and permanent effort to building up the foundation and to daily implementation so as to realize overall improvement through overall consolidation and pursue comprehensive implementation through comprehensive progress .  
In the broad sense , saving oneself means to save your side 's material and mental strength , specifically including your side 's land , people , and actual political , military , and economic strength , as well as the nation 's or people 's will to resist , etc . , i.e . , what is commonly known as overall national strength .  
Through military training , students have enhanced concept of national defense and sense of organization and discipline , raised their ideological and political consciousness , received education on patriotism and collectivism , promoted their all-round development of morality , intelligence , and physique , and laid down a firm ideological and political foundation for becoming a generation of new people with lofty ideals , moral integrity , education and a sense of discipline .  Military training of students has cultivated high quality reserve people for national defense .  
Chen Mingduan demanded that through the forum , all units popularize the experience and practice of advanced units in light of actual conditions and fully strengthen the building of grass-roots party branches of provincial military district units , so as to push forward the implementation of various tasks .  Chen pointed out the need to step up grass-roots party branch building ; properly select cadres and form leading bodies ; enhance training in the military and political quality of party branch members ; implement well party rules and regulations ;  
have built an omnidirectional stationary civil telecommunications network in light of needs of economic construction and market ; and have built an optical-fiber telecommunications network linking up some rural villages or small towns .  Thus in staging military exercises ;  
As to making our civil air defense project construction more efficient , the government and military sectors need to make the building of underground bomb shelters a key part of urban construction , insisting on " mostly construction " .  We need to set growth rates in line with local realities to build a number of underground bomb shelters and integrated peacetime-wartime projects suited to new tactical and technical needs .  
The regulations fullyreflect the great importance that the CMC and headquarters have attached to the development of military colleges , and their concern and care for their teaching staff .  The regulations certainly will play a positive part in enabling the armed forces to bring in outstanding personnel , retaining the mainstay teachers , stabilizing their ranks , and improving the system of establishing specialized and technical positions , and strengthening college construction in all respects .  
They have shown their spirit of persistent struggle and demonstrated excellent sports techniques and displayed the lofty morality of sports .  They have shown the Chinese nation 's outlook of being inspired , struggling for progress , and being vigorous and enthusiastic .  They have contributed to the promotion and development of the Olympic spirit and greatly inspired all ethnic groups of people throughout the country and officers and soldiers throughout the military , who are marching into the new century with their chins up .  
They should learn their lofty passion of fighting for the motherland , their fighting will for struggling persistently and their spiritual attainment of continuous pursuit .  Officers and soldiers throughout the military and the armed police forces should , as the athletes have done , work hard in training , make unswerving efforts , be brave in struggling for " gold medals " in their own posts , and accomplish more magnificent achievements for the People 's Republic of China .  
The military and citizens of the entire country have employed the important words of General Secretary Jiang Zemin to unify their thinking , with each blazing patriotic heart being transformed into a concrete action for supporting and sacrificing to national defense modernization .  
Over the last two years , the scientific and technological military training has brought about profound changes in the guiding principle , contents , means and methods of military training , as well as in military tactics ; and has played an important role in enhancing the troops ' ability of winning in future high-tech war .  
" Let 's see who has won the most awards of reform success and who has scored the highest mark in scientific and technological knowledge contest " .  This was the earlier criterion of some units for appraising and selected advanced units and individuals in scientific and technological military training .  
During the course of scientific and technological military training , more and more commanders and fighters are seeking truth and practical results , emphasizing applicability , wholeness , and actual combat application , and improving their real ability of winning in future high-tech war .  
The Guangzhou Military Region has adopted strict measures to correct once and for all the formalism practiced by some units during scientific and technological military training .  It has issued the following clear and definite instructions : All reform achievements concerning operations must be repeatedly tested in a realistic battlefield environment with actual troops , actual equipment and live ammunition ; to ensure truthfulness , stability and reliability of an achievement , the commanders and technicians who take part in testing it should be charged with clear and definite responsibility ;  
The efforts to seek truth and practical results have made each and every flower of reform in the scientific and technological military training bear the fruit of enhancing the troops ' ability of " winning in war " .  Some difficult questions concerning fighting under high-tech conditions have been effectively solved .  
In guiding the scientific and technological military training of troop units , the Guangzhou Military Region has closely integrated learning new knowledge with studying and mastering new equipment , new skills and new tactics , incorporated them into specific technical and tactical subjects , and turn them into applied training courses which combine knowledge with skill .  In this way , it has had feasible training methods and appraisal criteria and made battlefield application of high-tech knowledge a required course which must be tested .  
Military units have been supplied with some new equipment now .  To make the equipment combat effective , leaders at all levels should first make theoretical breakthroughs , master the operational theories and detailed rules for examining the new equipment , and lead the military units to complete basic training and explore new experience .  
In order for command posts to become more efficient in organization and command in field operations , our department has made new trials .  We have designated pilot units for improving command in field operations , explored command equipment , optimized command groups , made command materials , improved command methods , developed command software , and trained command personnel .  This has made command organs combat effective ahead of the military units .  
To meet the requirement for " being armed in two aspects " , members of party committees at all levels have continuously intensified their study .  However , in both the range and quality of their study and the conversion and application of the study results , they still fall short of the demand for " winning the war " .  More conspicuous are the inadequate study of military theories and military high-tech knowledge and the lack of versatile personnel .  
He regarded political work as the lifeline of Army building and conscientiously organized units to study the resolution of the Gutian Conference and the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention . He promoted democracy in the three main fields , inspired the political consciousness of officers and men , worked hard to raise the military and political quality of the units , and educated them to forever preserve the true colors and fighting style of a people 's Army .  
The training quality will directly affect the implementation of work related to combat readiness .  In giving training guidance , this department persisted in guiding the equipment training practice with scientific and technological achievements , and chanted the slogan of " conducting training with science and technology and doing everything for the sake of winning the battle " during the training .  It also probed into the law governing military training with science and technology in order to seek development in equipment training .  
In view of the " shortcomings " and weak points in the building of equipment department , this department vigorously carried out , organized , and directed the training while selecting personnel and grasping professional basic training .  It also cultivated equipment commanders at all levels who have military theoretical accomplishment and macro decision-making awareness , and raised the organizational and planning ability of equipment organs .  
A military simulation system of the current advanced international level in the form of an online exercise technological platform has been manufactured after six years of development jointly carried out by dozens of the whole army 's academies and schools and scientific research units .  
Fu Quanyou gave a speech after watching the achievement-exchanges in online drill till its finish .  He said , at this crucial juncture when our army 's modernization drive is advancing toward the 21st century , President Jiang Zemin noted with great foresight : " Using computer technology to carry out simulated training is a prominent characteristic of military training in the developed countries .  
The " opinion " also proposes explicit requirements on solutions to many realistic problems in ideological and political construction throughout military academies and universities .  These five documents were formulated in accordance with the " Opinion " on the basis of extensive investigation and study , sufficient solicitation of opinions from every field and repeated study and proof .  They are targeted and practical .  
Practice has fully demonstrated that Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking of revitalizing the military through science and technology is wise and correct .  Practice has sufficiently proven that troop training in science and technology is the fundamental way for improving our military 's ability in winning high-tech wars .  Practice has eloquently shown that revitalizing the military through science and technology and troop training in science and technology are of vital importance for the overall situation of our military 's modernization construction .  
These heroic units have demonstrated their new graceful bearing in operating new equipment and applying new technology in scientific and technological military training .  
All the achievements in military theory research presented this time deal with major practical questions concerning preparation for military struggle and furthering of scientific and technological military training , with focus on key and difficult questions concerning combined-arms joint operations , air assault and air defense .  They are the result of thorough exploration of the characteristics and law of fighting and scientific and technological military training under the high-tech conditions .  They serve specific purposes , and they are highly directive and feasible , reflecting the latest achievements made by the PLA in military theory research .  
An online long-distance teaching was demonstrated , with main classrooms at the University of Science and Technology for National Defense and branch classrooms at the University of Science and Engineering . The online teaching is adapted to the educational trend of the information era ; and it is an advanced teaching method and a new way to realize independent studies , share resources and train high-quality military personnel .  
The PLA 's success in carrying out the activities of exchanging successful experience of scientific and technological military training will yield an important effect on furthering the scientific and technological military training .  The participants in the activities included the leaders in charge of training and education of major participating units ; the leaders of the air force , naval fleets and second artillery bases under various military regions ;  
By observing the on-the-spot demonstration , exchanging experience and conducting research and study , they have enhanced their understanding of the strategic significance of scientific and technological military training , and they have also added a new motive force to scientific and technological military training .  The scientific and technological military training achievements on display have shown a new direction for military training .  The efforts to sum up and exchange the experience and practices of scientific and technological military training have led us to a new concept for scientific and technological military training .  
The long-standing logistics support pattern , under which the three armed forces had their individual systems and under which barriers existed between different departments and between different regions , was replaced by a joint logistics system , with military regions serving as a foundation .  As a result , logistics support has been put in place in a timely manner , supplies have never been suspended , none have ever been left out or under-supplied , and logistics resources have been reasonably distributed and effectively utilized .  
To better prepare for military struggles , all the company 's officers and men have focused their attention on the magic of science and technology .  With the assistance of their superiors and scientific research departments , they have worked hard and searched for countermeasures to overcome problems , and ultimately developed the simulated ship-based missile launch platform .  This has solved missile launchers ' difficulty in taking aim and launching missiles because of the disturbance by winds and waves while working on the sea , and formulated a complete set of methods for combat and training .  
With the growing high-tech content in modern armaments , there are increasingly high requirements on our armed forces ' officers and soldiers in connection with scientific and cultural knowledge and military technological qualities .  
Therefore , we must scientifically design and plan the work of personnel training in a strategic manner , on the basis of the conditions of our country and our armed forces and objective requirements of future warfare , in an effort to substantially improve the quality of our armed forces ' military personnel quickly and to develop large numbers of high-quality military personnel ready to be used at critical moments .  
The great development of the industrial revolution early in this century made the organization of the military move away from the traditional model of having the infantry ( cavalry ) forces as the dominant forces , with the structure of the military coming to encompass such elements as artillery , armed , engineering , air defense , and naval forces ; the availability and quantities of the new services and arms of the military , characterized by high technological contents , became important indicators of the level of modernization and combat effectiveness of the military .  
Before joining the war in Korea , our armed forces already had artillery , armored , and engineering units , but such units accounted for an extremely small portion of the military as a whole , with the force structure model based on the dominant position of infantry forces remaining unchanged .  
It was because of the recognition of this point that the CPC Central Committee and Central Military Commission timely showed their determination , organizing and strengthening air force , naval and technical army units on the basis of carrying out fighting and force construction simultaneously , and thus achieved the change from a undiversified military into a composite military , thereby greatly improving our armed forces ' force structure and capability for coordinated operations and providing the equipment and technological foundation for prevailing over a strong enemy .  
Guangzhou Military Area Command devoted firm and resolute effort to formulating fighting strength and logistic supply abilities on the basis of military units as a whole .  This measure focused on the crucial point in the current construction of fighting strength throughout the military .  It is of great significance for preparing for military struggles according to higher standards and quality criteria .  
The flames of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea disappeared nearly 50 years ago .  Unprecedented changes have taken place in the international political structure and the world military arena .  However , the valuable experience gained from this war cuts through space-time , exceeds national boundaries , and becomes an extensive and precious historical textbook .  
After viewing the experimental demonstration on management of computer network security conducted by the PLA Security Committee at the Jinan Military Region and after hearing the experiences introduced by various military units , Deputy Chief of General Staff Qian Shugen emphasized that ensuring the network security is by no means a simple issue of security , but is an essential mission to prepare for " winning the war . "  He added that ensuring the network security is a key guarantee for winning the future wars , and therefore maintaining secret means " winning the wars . "  
Designated as the " blue army " in a combined tactical training base , a certain armored brigade of the Beijing Military Region has conducted confrontation exercises with several " red army " divisions and brigades in succession , thus playing an important role in inspecting the military region 's achievements in training with science and technology and raising the quality of the training .  
In accordance with the requirements laid down in its five-year program , the division 's party committee has divided fighting capacity building into four major aspects , namely , political work , military work , logistical support , and equipment and technical support ; has tackled bottlenecks which prevent new-type equipment from turning into all-round fighting capacity by focusing on key and thorny issues ; and has laid a solid foundation step by step .  
It is notable that while continuing to deepen bilateral military alliances with Japan , Australia , and the ROK , the United States is restoring and developing military ties with countries such as Thailand , the Philippines , Vietnam , and Singapore through a variety of military cooperation forms , such as gaining the right to use military facilities , agreements on military unit visits , joint military exercises , and so on , thereby markedly expanding its military presence in non-alliance countries and further increasing its military capability for intervening in Asia-Pacific affairs .  
With regard to strengthening mutual trust and cooperation in the military sphere , although Sergeyev 's visit has avoided another storm arising in bilateral military cooperation ties on account of the espionage affair , the hard ice that has long formed between the two countries can hardly undergo a complete thaw in one or two visits , and " a still more difficult path lies ahead . "  
Since our army 's network and website building is still at such a primary stage as network personnel handling military issues and the majority of our army 's qualified personnel are still of technical support in nature and have yet to extensively develop or apply the existing hardware or software system in terms of functions and in light of operational decision , command , and tactic , faced with the fast advent of information warfare and network warfare , our army should make further efforts to carry out follow-up research ; explore countermeasures ; 
and so on , and should devote more efforts to changing structure of qualified network personnel and training qualified military personnel for fighting a battle on an information network , including qualified command and control personnel at both intermediate and senior levels , qualified personnel who can operate , organize , or manage an information network system , and qualified scientific and technological personnel or groups of personnel who can operate an information network at a higher level so as to bring about such transformation as qualified military personnel operating a network .  
The equipment for the mass defense of military units is in the main complete with quality reaching a good standard .  The preventive capability by specialized anti-chemical warfare units and the overall preventive capability of the Army , the Navy , the Air Force and the Second Artillery Corps have all been significantly improved .  The military units ' fighting capability under the threat of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons has been significantly strengthened .  
We should lay stress on solving urgent subjects in the protection against chemical warfare in main battles and further improve military theory on anti-chemical warfare .  We should gradually establish a scientific and effective research system and provide theoretical guidance for training military units with science and technology and the development of anti-chemical warfare .  
During the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea in the early 1950s , Chinese military personnel had to fight against poison gas .  To meet the need of such an extremely severe situation , China 's anti-chemical scientific research institute , which was still being organized and established then , urgently began to develop the most needed poison-detecting equipment .  The curtain was then raised on the development of anti-chemical equipment for our armed forces .  
Our military personnel also had to rely on domestically made gas masks .  As far as this aspect is concerned , our armed forces now have a series of advanced protective equipment , which is suitable to the physiological feature of all ethnic groups in China and which meets various operational needs .  In addition , China also has a group of world-renowned experts on poison protection .  
At present , our military units have composite decontamination equipment , multifunctional and rapid decontamination equipment , and one-man decontamination equipment , thus forming a complete equipment system .  Such a system , which is comprehensive in function and in technical means , can do a good job in decontaminating the pollution caused by nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons .  Our military units can enter an area contaminated by nuclear and chemical pollution to carry out decontamination work .  
The whole military and armed police forces have meticulously been carrying out and implementing Chairman Jiang 's " five-sentence " general requirement , and grassroots construction has been consistently strengthened and developed in a healthy manner of comprehensive progress and overall improvement .  From this implementation and construction have emerged a large number of advanced examples with outstanding achievements and moving deeds .  
In the 1990 ' s , after the end of the cold war , under international disarmament pressure and opposition from peace forces in Japan , Japan instituted the guideline of " reducing armaments on the one hand while improving the quality on the other " in its military building , and worked to build modern armed forces of " the right scale and ample quality . "  
The current national security concept was put forward by Clinton in 1993 .  Clinton held that as the United States holds obvious military strength and military technology superiority over any other potential rivals , it is completely possible to effectively respond to certain crises and to deal with uncertain factors anytime in the future .  
It has been proved through practice that the military school activities for young people developed in elementary schools and junior middle schools and the military training activities developed in high schools and universities are effective means for conducting national defense education for the youngsters ; therefore , the activities have won common recognition from the students , parents , schools , and society .  
The draft has dedicated an entire chapter to the issue of national defense education for society , and formed stipulations respectively on the formats and demands for developing national defense education by state organs , enterprise units , social groups , committees for city residents , and committees for residents in rural areas ; and the formats and demands of conducting national defense education on militia and people on reserve duty by relevant military organs .  
It has also listed " enlisting graduates from an ordinary higher learning institution for military service " as a principal channel for recruiting officers and has further clarified or standardized the two other channels for recruiting officers , namely , " appointing office cadres as officers " and " recruiting professional , technological , or other types of personnel from outside the armed forces as officers . "  
Even when China is developed and powerful in the future , China 's military capability will always be defensive in nature and be limited to satisfying the minimum security requirement of being able to defend the country 's sovereignty , territorial integrity , and legitimate interests .  
Therefore , they should accord to the requirements for specialized knowledge and skills of cadres , choose correct majors and courses and scientifically arrange their curricular activities .  They should diligently study what is needed in their jobs , what is needed for their working positions and they should pay special attention to learning high-tech knowledge and military skills that are urgently needed for winning wars in the future in an effort to strengthen their abilities to lead soldiers in fighting modern wars .  
Issuing and implementing the " armament regulation " will play a positive and important role in profoundly carrying out the strategic military principles in the new period , reinforcing the centralized leadership in the armament work , standardizing the operating mechanism in armament work and establishing and completing the legal system of armament work .  
We should base its implementation on winning modern regional wars , particularly high-tech regional wars , and closely center its implementation on preparing for future military struggles .  We should take needs as the drive , regard technology as the boost , and consider systems as the insurance .  We should strictly carry out the principles , procedures and methods stipulated in the " armament regulation , " comprehensively complete every task in armament construction , reinforce the quality of our military construction and strengthen the military through science and technology .  
Since the cold war , Japan has been more active in pursuing its diplomatic line in seeking to become a world political power ; in military affairs , therefore , it has gradually changed its relatively passive and inward-looking military strategy and army building guidelines of the cold war period , in order to shake off Japan 's international image as a country with imbalance of economic , political , and military status , in a bid to play a greater role in a multipolar world .  
Despite the past 50 years and especially the last 10 since the end of the Cold War , the international environment the US faces has undergone tremendous changes but the " support system " the US established and runs has not changed .  Post-Cold War economic and military conflicts between the US and European Union have not caused any bilateral or multilateral damage .  
Based on the Law of Officers on Active Service in the People 's Republic of China , by implementing systems of officer selection from ordinary universities and colleges , promoting outstanding soldiers and graduates through military academies , the practices have broadened the selection resources of military officers through both channels of internal promotion : military training and external recruitment from ordinary schools of high learning .  In this way , the basic qualities of prospective officers have a sound basis .  
Facing the challenges of the global military revolution and the rapid development of science and technology , only by incessant knowledge refreshment and quality enhancements can officers meet the requirements of winning future high-technology wars .  
With the curtain of the 21st century slowly opening , the incoming tide of economic globalization is surging into every corner of the world .  Economic globalization is sure to have widespread and profound effects on tomorrow 's world , including the economic , social , cultural , and military spheres .  
The new century has only just begun , and with the surging tide of economic globalization , the new arms race about which people are continually concerned is exhibiting a growing momentum which is difficult to check .  It is not easy to be optimistic about the prospects for arms control .  This has cast a dark shadow over the world 's military security .  
To make these means and methods be specific , systematic , and scientific , we must give full consideration to the characteristics of military personnel and the feasibility of these means and methods under current conditions .  We must handle correctly the relationship between " theme " and " variety , " and we must uphold the relationship between the special nature of the Armed Forces and the borrowing of successful local experiences .  Efforts toward structural innovations must move forward along the correct path .  
When moving close to the missile launching front , temporary military airfield , and armored targets of the enemy , the squad immediately made use of the wireless communication equipment to report rapidly and accurately to the commanding headquarters in the rear area .  
Because the United States has become increasingly dependent on satellite support for conducting its political , economic , military , and diplomatic affairs in the past 50 years or so , it feels the pressing need to protect its vested interests in space .  
Starting in the late 1980 ' s and the early 1990 ' s , the US military has stepped up studies and practice in joint training , carried out exploration in the structure , content , order , rules , and means of joint training , and gradually formed a complete set of joint training structures with marked characteristics .  
The US military 's joint training is guided by national security strategy and military strategy and based on joint operations theory ; it strives to gradually make the armed forces into a flexible integrated joint force through carrying out joint training based on requirements , to facilitate the completion of multinational , joint , and multi-institutional missions in wartime or non-wartime military actions , and first of all to be prepared to deal with a large-scale and preemptive regional conflict .  
In order to meet the needs of future combined operations , the US military emphasized that more joint or combined exercises should be organized in future , and in particular the proportion of political military exercises should be increased .  
Political military exercises are a new type of training which the US military has added in recent years ; these can be either joint or combined , and the main characteristic is that many departments take part in such exercises and the grades are high ; apart from the military , relevant academic institutions and government departments concerned also participate .  
For this reason , the US military has assigned the units concerned the task of carrying out extensive legislative investigation and studies and of setting to work to implement the issues that need defining in the leadership structure , theoretical setup , and the relevant rules and regulations involved in joint training , and will continue to produce a series of regulatory documents to ensure that joint training proceeds in a regular and orderly way .  
Look !  In the cyber warfare drill room of the training center of the brigade , a " nuclear warfare " broke out on the screen .  The " blue army " took advantage of its strong military force to give a sudden nuclear attack against the " red army , " thus bringing myriad changes to the battlefield .  
In recent years , following its sustained economic growth , India has become more eager to have its position as a big country recognized .  Therefore , it has continuously increased its national defense budget ( The 2000-2001 national defense budget increased by as much as 28.2 percent . ) and strengthened its military strength in quantity and quality .  
Some Western capitalist countries are trying to bring the process of historical development in the world onto the path they design by making use of the increasingly frequent and close international relations and exchanges and by making use of their political , economic , scientific , technological , and military advantages .  
While failing to achieve their purpose , they began to change their strategies .  While maintaining their economic , political , and military pressure , they shifted the focus onto making ideological infiltration against the socialist countries and took this as an important means of pursuing their " peaceful evolution " strategy .  
Such infiltration is not limited to the ideological and cultural fields , but has also be extended to the economic , political , military , scientific , and technological fields .  In their exchanges with us , they also brought ideological things along with them .  
Leaders and institutions at all levels should strengthen their contact with administrative departments in civilian governments at all levels , properly handle cases in which economic construction projects involve military facilities , crack down on conduct which results in damage to military facilities , and make positive contributions to protecting military facilities and maintaining national security .  
Japan recently published its " Medium-term Reorganization and Equipment Plan for the Defense Force for 2001-2005 . "  It is not difficult to see from this that , to fit in with its strategic goal of becoming a major political power , Japan is now making efforts to develop in the direction of becoming a strong military power , and will build the Japanese Self-defense Force into a new defense force with stronger capability , faster reaction , and more capable of dealing with " peripheral events . "  
The military , as an armed group responsible for carrying out special political tasks , should not only be ready to physically fight in battlefields to complete urgent , difficult , dangerous and heavy tasks given by the Party and the people , but also live through various tests and make mental and physical contributions to the reform and construction .  
The military should reinforce Party-building in the military according to the requirements of the " three represents " and strengthen ideological and political construction in light of the assurance of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption . "  The military should be ready for military struggles with the military strategic principle in the new period as the guideline , profoundly study characteristics and rules regarding not only the military administration in the new situation but also high-tech regional wars , improve leadership skills and devote efforts to solid implementation .  
All in all , to continuously accelerate reform and construction in the military and fulfill the sacred mission , the military must vigorously promote the spirit of emancipating their thinking and seeking truth from facts , the spirit of closely following the development of the era and innovating courageously , the spirit of unswervingly marching forward despite difficulties , the spirit of struggling with painstaking efforts and pursuing effectiveness , and the spirit of disregarding personal fame and interests , being unselfish and dedicating oneself .  
should firmly grasp and successfully conduct training of units of various services or arms in a coordinated way , in such a background as launching joint operations , and by firmly focusing on the needs of a military struggle in the future ; should step up research and training by integrating firepower warfare with information warfare ; should make redoubled efforts to explore coordinated combat command methods or fighting methods in a complicated electromagnetic environment ;  
The spirit of marching forward despite difficulties and advancing with an indomitable will is the precious spiritual wealth made by the Party and the military through prolonged revolutionary and construction practices as well as the embodiment of the positive spiritual state of both Party members and revolutionary military professionals .  
Therefore , the military is facing considerable arduous tasks and many obvious difficulties : the military construction and development lack sufficient funds and their weaponry and armament are still yet to be modernized ; the military also faces great changes in its historical , social and objective environments ; the quality of military professionals is far from meeting the requirements for the modernization construction ;  
As students of military academies , we shoulder the historic mission of relying on science and technology to build a strong army and accelerate the modernization of our army 's armament and equipment .  We must more consciously strengthen our cultivation of Marxist theories and scientific spirit , arm ourselves with modern scientific knowledge , and exert to spread the fruits of socialist spiritual and cultural progress .  We must never allow fallacies of " Falungong " to contaminate our sacred school campuses .  
Since hostile forces and saboteurs at home and abroad seize every opportunity and try by hook or by crook to steal China 's political , military , economic , cultural , and educational intelligence , cases of leakage of secrets are frequent and startling , posing a serious threat to the information security of the party , the state , and the military .  
These leaders and institutions should make full use of every modern news media to propagate the grand prospects of our military modernization project in an effort to attract more outstanding scientific and technological specialists who must be patriotic and determined to strengthen the motherland so that these talented individuals can achieve merit in their military careers .  
In short , every division of the armed forces should like the Party Committee of the Air Force emancipate their thinking , update their conceptions and promote a reformative and innovative spirit by launching as many competitive policies and measures as possible so that the military will really become a " warm land " attracting the majority of China 's excellent scientific and technological specialists .  
These provisions on the basis of reviewing our militarys experiences in information security and confidentiality in the new situation and learning positive practices from foreign countries and foreign military forces not only provide explicit requirements on some crucial issues , but also systematically specify the basic principle , duty and authorization , preventative measures and administrative procedures regarding information security and confidentiality .  These provisions are the fundamental basis for further strengthening the work of information security and confidentiality throughout the military as a whole .  
Leaders and Party commissions at all levels should pay greater attention to the construction of ranks of high-quality military professionals , set up and complete a mechanism of cultivating , attracting , using and encouraging these professionals , and strive to build up a contingent of high-quality military professionals within a reasonable structure , a sufficiently large number of these people and a scientific configuration .  These people should provide a powerful personnel and intellectual guarantee for satisfactory preparation for the military struggle in the new period and thus accelerate military modernization construction .  
Strongly aware of future dangers , allowing no opportunities to slip , and seizing every minute , we will fulfill our work in all aspects , strive for a leap in China 's military modernization in the new century , and comprehensively enhance the armed forces ' defensive combat capability under modern technological conditions , particular high-tech conditions , so as to better perform the sacred mission entrusted by the party and the people .  
On 20 April 2000 , Japan 's House of Representatives approved " Amendment to the Law on Formation of Defense Agency " and decided to set up several new research posts in the Defense Agency , including those for research on nuclear weapons , biological weapons research , and other special weapons as well .  It also decided to set up a research forum for nonmilitary experts on medical science and military science .  
Second , the US military may plan to use Guam as an experimental site for US nuclear submarines in the new century .  For instance , a submarine 's deep-water communications and data image transmission and the suitability of undersea launching of missiles under new fighting conditions can all be tested at the base in Guam .  
It was reported that the circulation line of US nuclear attack submarine has the problem of metal embrittlement and so it has been criticized by the people .  If nuclear submarines are reinforced in Japan , local people are expected to show objections .  Therefore , Guam has become the best choice of the US military .  
Since Iraq recovered its domestic and some of its international air routes , more than 40 foreign planes have flown to Baghdad carrying ranking government officials and humanitarian materials , including even some US political figures , and the " no-fly zone " set up by the United States and Britain in fact exists only in name ; the United States has felt all the more that it " has no face at all " and seeks to demonstrate its powerful military strength and Gulf presence by bombing Iraq .  
Through the long-term revolution and construction , our Party and military have been adhering to their lofty ambitions despite miseries .  They have upheld their great righteousness despite dangers and difficulties and have continuously maintained their mighty strength to unite and fight .  An important part of this is that countless Party members and revolutionary military professionals have been indifferent to personal interests and fame as if they were tasteless boiled water while regarding their careers as being as weighty as a mountain .  
Countless Party members and revolutionary military professionals would dedicate everything in them to liberating the Chinese nation , bringing happiness to the people and revitalizing the country .  The reform , opening up and the development of the socialist market economy have added enormous vitality and historical progress to our construction of material and spiritual civilizations .  
The reporter has learned that these units that were evaluated as tops in training have several clear features : Their major military and political officers are all outstanding commanders , having top overall comprehensive quality , and very strong command and control training ability .  
They have achieved marked S &amp; T troop training results , sharply cultivating high-quality military talent , daring to reform and innovate , adhering to scientific objectivity , reforming training content , improving training methods , and creating innovative training means , to have made a prominent contribution to the in-depth development of S &amp; T troop training throughout the PLA .  
" Small , remote , scattered and directly administered " military units work in such posts as telecom , piloting , scientific and technological studies and logistics supply , and carry out such tasks as fighting , training , military duties and logistics supply .  Most of these units call for high technological levels , shouldering important responsibilities , work in crucial posts , and play a vital role in grassroots construction .  These units are also a difficult issue to handle in grassroots construction .  
To satisfactorily answer and solve the historical topics of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " in the new situation , our military must construct all grassroots units including " small , remote , scattered and directly administered " units into strong fighting groups .  
The Russian President , foreign minister , defense minister , and many other political and military leaders have recently pointed out in speeches or articles that the key factor determining international security in the new century is to maintain strategic stability , and the basis of this strategic stability is the ABM Treaty signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1972 .  
The starting point of this assumption ( namely , guarding against the threat of missile attacks ) of the United States failed to convince Germany . A considerably large number of personages from the military and political circles believed that this is not reasonable .  Because during the Cold War period , the threat of the nuclear arsenal of the Soviet Union to West Europe was many , many times bigger than it is now , did not the East-West balanced posture based on nuclear deterrent ensure the security of Germany ?  
In just three weeks after President Bush entered the White House , he was anxious to increase military spending again .  The objective is to make the United States , which presently holds the largest store of nuclear weapons and the world 's most advanced and strongest standing military , always capable of maintaining its absolute military dominance , as well as further distance itself from all other major countries ' military capacity and consolidating the US position as the world 's " only superpower " .  
During the Clinton years , as the US economy was steadily strong , and salary increases for the non-military sector rose faster than did the military 's , making the military less attractive .  This made many talented people reluctant to serve in the armed forces , and various armed forces personnel in key positions to decide against making it a career .  This affected the overall quality of the US armed forces .  
These Interim Procedures were formulated to meet this urgent need taking the national and military situation at the present development stage into consideration so that these procedures are in harmony with national economic and social development , military construction and the direction in which procedures on resettling retired military cadres will develop .  
The Interim Procedures are more all-compassing , standardized and reasonable than the previous procedures , but since each national and military reform must advance step by step , the establishment and completion of the socialist market economy takes time and the Interim Procedures should be implemented in an enthusiastic , reliable and gradual manner .  It is impossible to thoroughly resolve all contradictions and problems at once that have arise since the implementation of reform and opening up .  
Party committees , political institutions and leaders at all levels should profoundly and satisfactorily do this ideological and political work , guiding retired cadres to think from a strategic perspective of the reforming , dynamic and stable overall situation of the country and the military construction .  
The majority of retired military cadres should maintain and carry forward the excellent traditions of our military , conscientiously be considerate of difficulties faced by governments at all levels , align personal interests with overall ones , embrace and support reform in ones behavior and make new contributions to strengthening the country and revitalizing the Chinese nation .  
After the cold war , when the balance of power tipped toward the West , the United States went one step farther in politicizing the above-mentioned concept of human rights , using military , economic and technological power as a shield and scheming to put respect for human dignity in an unassailable position , making it the starting point and final resting place of peace and development .  The United States imposed her own standard of human rights on all the nations of the world , and changed the human rights question into a political tool for hegemony .  
Firm ideals and convictions are the ideological basis of assuring our revolutionary military professionals are politically qualified and maintaining their essential qualities and the spiritual backbone and resources for these professionals to live through tests , overcome difficulties and make achievements in their careers .  
In promoting the campaign to learn from Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun in the new century , young military professionals must keep our military 's fundamental duty firmly in mind , vigorously promote and develop the " five-point spirits " of struggling with persistent efforts , create endurable ideological styles and acquire competent qualities for " winning wars " through completing ordinary tasks in grassroots construction , through hard work and hardship and through tests of life or death .  
The third generation leadership group with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has the vision and leadership skill to handle various complex situations , face various risks and resolve various difficulties .  This leadership group , which has won sincere support and admiration of the whole Party , the entire military and all ethnic groups of the country , is the loyal , reliable , diligent and promising successor of the cause of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Our military is an armed group for carrying out revolutionary political tasks .  This group should consistently uphold and support the reform , align its interests to the overall interests of national economic construction and serve this construction .  This group should also satisfactorily fulfill its sacred duty of protecting national security and maintaining social stability .  
To continuously advance military construction and reform , fulfill the sacred mission placed on the shoulders of our military , we must carry forward the spirit of emancipating thinking and seeking truth from facts , the spirit of keeping up with the times and courageously innovating , the spirit of marching forward despite difficulties and advancing with an indomitable will , the spirit of struggling with painstaking efforts and pursuing effectiveness and the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career .  
Cadres should consistently educate themselves on Marxist theory , Party members ' ideals and convictions and the excellent traditions of our Party and military .  Cadres should utilize a wartime work style , revolutionary spirit and be fully dedicated to their career to inspire themselves .  As long as they can , they will be struggling for the interests of the Party , the country and the people wholeheartedly and carrying out our military 's sacred mission , as dictated by the times , to the highest standards and to the highest level of quality .  
Under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the CMC with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , the whole army persisted in being guided by Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on army building in the new period and Chairman Jiang Zemin 's series of important expositions on army building , and implemented in depth the military strategic guidelines for the new era ; closely centering on the two historic topics of " winning when fighting " and " not degenerating , " we achieved very great success in vigorously enhancing overall construction centered on modernization .  
Ideological and political building has been further enhanced , preparations for military struggle have been thorough and sound , notable success has been achieved in national defense scientific research and armament modernization , all-round backup capability has been markedly strengthened , and there has been a very big improvement in the army 's all-round combat capability in hi-tech conditions .  
As China is a large country , with an uneven distribution of demobilized military cadres and regional differences in economic development , governments at all levels may face new issues and new problems in carrying out and implementing interim procedures .  This requires we pay attention to the fundamental interests of the Party and the country , correctly handle the relationship between regions and the overall situation , work in a creative manner and ensure solid implementation of every resettlement policy .  
In addition , local governments at all levels must ensure the formulated , detailed rules are beneficial to implementing interim procedures , reinforcing national defense and military construction , appropriately resettling demobilized military cadres , and boosting economic and social development .  
Military cadres at divisional and regimental rank , as the crucial and important motors of military construction , have lived through tests as leaders , accumulated rich experiences in being leaders .  They are loyal to the Party , have a strong sense of professionalism and responsibility , and possess a high , comprehensive quality : of theory , of innovation and discipline .  
I propose that military units stationed in western China should be authorized to take special preferential measures for retaining and attracting useful personnel .  There should be stronger leadership over the programs by which military and civilian authorities will support each other and work together in promoting the construction of a civil society ; and the military should support local economic construction projects with its advantages in terms of personnel , technical , and information .  
Just as the three old military groups " China Returnees Union " , " Sino-Japanese Friendship Association of Veterans " and " Association of Citizen Non-Fighting Soldiers " said in their declaration , this problematic textbook " seeks to nurture people just like those who created an enormous harm on the people of Asia some 55 years ago . "  This type of reactionary education directly influences the future developmental direction of Japan .  
Deputy Chen Jinbiao noted : Under the present new historical conditions , to judge whether the building of party organizations in the military has been reinforced , our ultimate criterion is to see whether the coherent force and the fighting capacity of the party organizations at all levels have been reinforced ; and whether the role of party committees as a leading core , the role of party branches as a powerful fighting force , and the exemplary vanguard role of party members have all been brought into full play .  
Deputies Zhao Yuexin and Liu Jiujun from the basic level indicated : To uphold the party 's absolute leadership over the military , both the senior cadres of our military and the party members at the basic level of the military must take the lead in establishing a sound image for party members , so that the vast members of officers and men can see from the conducts of party members the future and hope of our party , our country , and our military ; and can therefore consciously answer the calls of the party .  
As early as when the clarion call for military training through science and technology was sounded at the " Liaoyang centralized training program , " Chairman Jiang noted that military training through science and technology is an important measure for adapting the military to the trend of worldwide military development , this training was advancing in the correct direction and we should devote consistent and unswerving efforts to this training .  
High-quality military professionals need to be cultivated through military training through science and technology , military professionals need to master high-tech armament through this training , the highly efficient personnel quota system needs to be tested and completed through this training , and advanced military theories need to be innovated and developed through this training .  
With a comprehensive and dialectical understanding of these principles , leaders will not forget to be scientific and pursue effectiveness , take initiatives to use the standard of winning wars and scientific standards to examine and measure every campaign that is aimed at reform and innovation in the process of military training through science and technology and ensure that these campaigns are scientific , feasible and able to live through the test of practice .  
In addition , these leaders should pay attention to following scientific rules , and should not stop at existing theories and understandings when considering the objective reality but rather , in light of the need for winning wars , courageously explore unknown fields , deepen military training through science and technology by means of continuous reform and innovation , and make achievements in this process .  
Therefore , for party organizations at all levels of our army , a most essential and most direct task in their implementation of " three represents " is to conscientiously implement the strategy of reinforcing the army and invigorating military training through science and technology , a strategy that has been put forward by the Central Military Commission ; strive to meet high standards in enhancing the fighting capacity of the troops ; pay close attention to training the troops through science and technology ;  
Since atat present and for a certain present and in a given period of the future , our country will continuously focus on the economic construction , it is impossible for our country to substantially increase its investment in the military spending while the military faces complex and arduous tasks in the military modernization construction which does require an increased of the investment in the military spending .  The contradiction between the affordable practicality of and the need for demanded mmilitary spending will exist for a long time .  
Our military 's current budget-making method was based on the planned economy .  It is true that this method has played a positive role in ensuringassuring the all aspects of military in every construction , but this method has such problems , such as being too general in contents , not being transparent and being too weak to bein binding .  
All Tthese reform all conform to the objective rules of the military 's economic administration under the socialist market economy , and meet the requirements of the national financial reform .  The implementation of these measures will substantially improve the scientific nature of the military spending budget administration and more fullyer allow the military spending budget-making to work as a macro-adjustment and control in our military modernization construction .  
Party committees at all levels should use Chairman Jiang 's important directives on the financial work and the decision made by the Central Military Commission to unite thinking .  They should , from the strategic perspective of the overall situation , clearly understand the great significance of the the military 's budget-making reform , understand relevant policies and regulations , hold the correct attitude towards a possible adjustment of regional interests , and implement the decision made by Chairman Jiang and the Central Military Commission in a resolute and solid manner .  
It is necessary to use the rich knowledge , human resources , and advantages of the scientific and technological strength of military institutions and scientific research institutes to further support science and technology and qualified personnel as well as strive to provide intellectual and personnel support for the great development of the western region .  
In view of the need for developing military science research in the new century , the " regulations " summarize and draw on the successful experience of our army in military science research , emphasize the need to focus military science research on defense construction , army building , and preparations for military struggles in the new situation , conduct perspective study on the issue of winning a local war under the conditions of modern technology , especially high technology , and thus provide powerful theoretical support for the military 's modernization drive .  
Although the " 17 August Communique limits the quality and quantity of weapons and notes that sales will be reduced , leading to " a final resolution " , this is based on the principle that Communist China will adopt a " peaceful solution " to the Taiwan issue .  If this basis is shaken or nonexistent , the United States will have sufficient reason to sell weapons to Taiwan according to the cross-strait military balance and Taiwan 's need .  
Therefore , our military 's attitude toward the recent international focus of topics on Aegis frigates is of a very low key , thinking the heated debate of this topic will not help Taiwan obtain the Aegis frigates .  Furthermore , the Ministry of National Defense indirectly expressed its hope that the domestic military media will lighten the report on this issue .  
We should unite comprehensive efforts from both the military and colleges and universities , give priority to cultivating senior specialists , and cultivate and mold ranks of commanders with comprehensive abilities , contingents of staff with strategic ideas , groups of technological specialists and a larger number of coaches with " capabilities in the four aspects " .  We should focus on improving their abilities in project planning , organizing , administering and teaching .  We should rely on new military professionals of high quality for boosting development of military training through science and technology at deeper levels .  
The majority of military scientific research workers should adapt themselves to the general development trend of the global military revolution , consistently carry forward our military 's excellent valuable resources , enthusiastically learn advanced experiences from foreign military forces and make greater contributions to bringing further prosperity and development to our military science and to boosting national defense and military modernization construction .  
In recent years , leaders of the missile brigade , in order to meet the requirements of future war , have worked hard to master military skills , winning the reputation as the " bellwethers " in scientific and technical drills .  
The leading body invited military technology experts to teach its members the military space technology , guided missile precision control and guide , automatic commanding technology , and other frontier military knowledge of the contemporary world .  Members of the leading body went deep into the training fields and launching pads to carry out technical practices and scientific and technological research , and to guide troops in completing a number of projects on scientific and technical drills .  
Article One These " Regulations " has been formulated in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Law of National Defense , in light of the needs of a future military struggle , and with a view to further developing the Chinese People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) ' s military scientific research cause ; stepping up military theory building ; and raising the armed forces ' fighting capacity .  
Insofar as basic tasks are concerned , military scientific research aims at exploring the law of war , the law of directing a war , as well as the law of national defense building and army building and at offering scientific and theoretical guidance for checking a war ; winning a war , or furthering national defense building and army building .  
( 2 ) Implementing a military strategic principle for the new period ; meeting the requirements of " fighting and winning " and " remaining unchanged in nature " ; facing a modernization drive , the world , and the future ; further developing military practice ; and serving national defense building , army building , and a military struggle .  
( 3 ) Proceeding from the realities in the country and in the armed forces ; drawing upon beneficial experiences from foreign forces ; emancipating the mind ; seeking truth from facts ; boldly furthering explorations ; bravely blazing new trails ; comprehensively adopting modern scientific methods or means ; and developing a military theory with Chinese characteristics .  
After receiving the application from the leader of a topic group , a military scientific research management department of an individual unit may make a plan for appraising , testing , or accepting the relevant research results before sending personnel to do the work and shall submit in a timely fashion a report to a military scientific research management department at a higher level after deeming a research topic suitable for listing in a military scientific research plan for a unit at a higher level .  
Article 36 All units shall support mass activities of military scientific research ; urge or encourage personnel with research capabilities to conduct military scientific research in light of their work ; train or foster backbone personnel for academic research ; or make things convenient or create conditions for the personnel concerned to conduct research .  
Article 37 All units shall do a good job in selecting , assigning , training , or appointing military scientific research personnel ; introduce or refine an incentive mechanism ; give full scope to enthusiasm or creativity on the part of research personnel ; and work hard to build a high-quality contingent of military scientific research personnel , including both full-time and part-time personnel , who are known for political integrity , professional proficiency , a rigorous style , and a rational structure .  
While entering into the new historical era , Chairman Jiang showed great foresight and stood on the high altitude of strategy and overall situation to have put forth the general requirements of five phrases of " being up to standard in politics , perfect in mastering military skills , excellent in work styles , highly disciplined , and effective in safeguard " , which has clearly pointed out the forward direction for strengthening the all-round grass-roots building .  
In conducting major military exercises , combating floods of three rivers and going to the rescue hurriedly in 1998 , holding the grand military parade of the century , marching into Hong Kong and Macao and stationing there to perform defensive duties , our army has demonstrated its spiritual outlook of being courageous , indomitable , and invincible and the good image of being a mighty and civilized army .  
It is necessary to firmly establish the idea of strengthening grass-roots units by science and technology and prospering grass-roots units by talented people .  While improving the ideological and political , military professional , and physical and psychological qualities , efforts should be made to improve their scientific and technological quality .  
Military exercises have been held without interruption .  What is different is that these military exercises have not been conducted in the areas sensitive to Taiwan and have been announced , as were before , by Beijing 's official authorities in a low key through the sensational Hong Kong media .  
Chi Haotian fully affirmed the achievements made by military units and armed police units in participating in and supporting the development of the west .  He emphasized the necessity of gaining a thorough understanding of the strategic policy-decision made by the party Central Committee and CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin and of earnestly strengthening the sense of mission in participating in and supporting the development of the west .  
Currently people generally believe that information security and the task of keeping information confidential is no longer an issue of simply maintaining secrecy , let alone an issue of pure technology .  It is instead a major strategic topic that has to do with national security , economic development , social stability and the success and failure of military struggles .  
Today , as the world moves toward globalization , and more and more nations are resolving international disputes through international institutions or multilateral diplomacy , the American style of wantonly engaging in military ventures is a bit ironic : a great nation that promotes globalization , the nation with the most speaking privileges in the world 's largest international institutions displaying this kind of outdated militaristic view of national security and unilateralism in its diplomacy that rejects multilateral negotiations !  
In recent years , Communist China has rapidly promoted military modernization and its national strength has continued to grow , while economic and trade relations between the two sides of the strait have become increasingly closer .  Besides , the succession of Communist China 's leading power will also take place in the near future .  All those factors have increased the attention of people at home and abroad to the question of arms sales to Taiwan by the United States .  
This Opinion regards Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of the " three represents " as the guideline , gives an eye on the reality of the party-building in the military and explicitly proposes the guiding principle , fundamental objective , major tasks and detailed requirements on extensively promoting throughout the military an educational campaign to maintain the advanced nature of party members .  
An important experience we have accumulated in administrating military units at grass-roots level lies in sticking to " one group and two contingents . "  Practice has shown that every military unit with a solid contingent of party members is strong .  This unit can stand forward at crucial moments and confront difficulties and dangers .  
The party organization of this unit is strong in uniting and inspiring people .  Now that party members account for a considerable percentage of the military and armed police forces , if this contingent is satisfactorily administered , we will provide a solid foundation for the party 's absolute leadership over the military and provide a reliable guarantee for assuring the completion of every task .  
In the process of accelerating and advancing military modernization , if our military 's party members uphold obsolete ideas and concepts , lack high scientific and technological attainment , and lack the ability to skillfully use modern weapons and armaments and to give appropriate commands in modern wars , it will be difficult for these party members to embody the advanced nature of the party members and make great achievements in the military 's reform and construction .  
It is very difficult see the embodiment of the advanced nature in party members like these .  Promoting this educational campaign for maintaining the advanced nature of party members is of great significance for implementing the requirement of focusing the minds of party members on the correct theory , spurring the real work of the military , solving existing problems in the contingent of party members , advancing the military 's party-building in the new period and pushing forward the military modernization construction .  
Powell was the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff . And his thinking for directing military operations is characteristically built on clear principles of national interests , superior military forces , and minimum casualties and the explicit principle of withdrawal .  
Although overseas media vied with one another in carrying " disclosures " on issues such as when Xu Junping defected , what post he assumed in the military , what were the motives for his defection , and what impact his defection would have on the Chinese Communist military , no conclusion had even been drawn .  Moreover , there were even many contradictory stories circulating around , making the already mysterious and unpredictable case more complicated and confusing .  
This former government official , who is unwilling to disclose his name , believes that because their military aircraft crashed in the incident , the Chinese communists will certainly take advantage of this incident to force the United States to apologize , despite the fact that the US Armed Forces Pacific Command announced that the EP-3 plane was performing its mission over the international open sea and did not intrude the Chinese communists ' territorial airspace .  
The readings he finished in six months piled up to over 2 meters high .  He believed that those who are not proficient enough at maneuvering modern equipment can not be counted as qualified military commanding personnel , and only by optimally integrating high-quality personnel with hi-tech equipment , will it be possible to explore the equipment 's utility to the maximum and thus gain dominance in future hi-tech warfare .  
We are ready to make common efforts with Australia to increase mutual understanding and trust , promote friendship and cooperation , and push forward the continued steady and healthy development of bilateral military relations in the new situation .  
" Hong Kong Shang Pao " pointed out in its editorial : The pernicious incident of US military reconnaissance plane colliding with and crashing our military plane has caused an extremely great concern in the international community and particularly in Asia , and it has also aroused a strong indignation among the Chinese people .  
In answering questions from reporters at a press conference today , Zhu Bangzao stressed that the US aircraft that caused the incident was no ordinary plane , but was a military reconnaissance aircraft which , after crashing into the Chinese military aircraft , illegally entered Chinese airspace without the consent of the Chinese and landed at a Chinese airfield .  
Chi Haotian said : Both China and Gabon are developing countries .  The two countries ' cooperation in the political , economic , military , and cultural areas has been remarkable ; and the two countries share common views on a wide range of important international issues .  
He said , international law applies to every country , and this US plane we are speaking of is not an ordinary plane but a military reconnaisance plane which entered China 's airspace without permission after colliding with and destroying a Chinese plane due to carrying out maneuvers contrary to regulations over China 's coastal waters , and landed at a Chinese military airfield .  
Personalities here believe that the benign interaction of the Chinese and Australian senior military officers will be beneficial to developing a friendly and cooperative relationship between the two countries and armies and to maintaining regional security as well .  
Chi Haotian said that China and Qatar established diplomatic ties in 1988 , and relations between the two countries as well as exchanges between the two countries ' military forces have developed ever since .  Chi Haotian said that he is confident this visit from the premier will take the friendly and cooperative relationship between China and Qatar to a new level .  
Fu Dunchun , associate professor of Hainan University , said : a US military reconnaissance plane gathered intelligence in air space over the South China Sea , bumped and damaged our military aircraft , and illegally landed on our territory .  The US side has felt no regret at all , made false countercharges and claimed that " China should be held responsible for the incident . "  The United States has totally exposed its hegemonism .  
In the China-US military aircraft collision accident that took place in the airspace over the coastal area of Hainan Island , the US military surveillance plane in China 's Hainan airspace bumped into and damaged a Chinese fighter and illegally landed on Chinese territory .  The United States did not feel slightly ashamed and uneasy for this but shifted the blame to China . It claimed that " China should be responsible for the accident " and that " China 's fighters should not monitor US surveillance planes that came to spy on China . "  
Sources told us that this large-scale exercise in the South China Sea was based on the background of an incident in the Taiwan strait , with the United States as the main imaginary enemy ; it was imagined that , given the intervention of the US Pacific Fleet , one of the focal points of the exercise to " resist the enemy outside coastal areas and territorial seas " was to counter US military information warfare and reconnaisance .  
Military sources in Beijing have revealed that the military exercise under way in the South China Sea has been affected by the collision incident and been forced to make a major readjustment ; a number of scheduled maneuvers have been cancelled and the focus has switched to dealing with the aftermath , including the order to the exercise units to repeatedly search for the missing pilot and recover the plane .  
During the 1950s , along with a high-degree synthetic development from a unitary structure of the Army to a combined structure for all services and arms , including the Navy and the Air Force , and following its coordinated air-ground operations on the battlefield in Korea as well as its preliminary practice of a joint landing operations at Yijiangshan Island , our military started to put on its work schedule the theoretical study of coordinated operations involving all services and arms , and attained major achievements in this aspect .  
The US military , which was the first to advance and put into practice the idea of joint operations , was also once restricted by the thinking a " unitary service " ; yet through academic debates and the run-in of a series of war practices , a fairly complete system of principles and theories on joint operations has finally taken shape , and is now undergoing constant development .  
As the foremost principle in joint operations , " unified action " requires that all actions be focused on achieving a common goal .  At the national level it requires the integrated use of political , diplomatic , economic , intelligence , and military power to achieve the strategic goals of the state , as well as specific strategic goals which result from that .  
The US military believes that , based on its technical superiority , in future joint operations they " will be able to achieve decisive superiority through asymmetric actions using the power of joint forces to strike at the enemy 's weak points and the skillful use of troops in terms of time and space . "  
The operational concept of " full dimensional protection " which was proposed by the US military in 1996 calls for the establishment of both offensive and defensive measures to deal with information warfare , guided missiles , and nuclear , biological , and chemical weapons of mass destruction .  
If this posture is insufficient to achieve the strategic scheme , then full-dimensional protection will be used to keep one 's own losses to an absolute minimum , maintaining military action freedom and , at the same time , bringing to bear the operational might of integrated C4ISR systems and strike systems to carry out controlled strikes against the enemy 's center of gravity to achieve a decisive victory quickly .  
According to an earlier report in Jiefangjun Bao , since the Taiwan strait crisis broke out , the United States has frequently sent reconnaisance planes to come and go close to China 's coastal airspace in order to step up its gathering of military intelligence on China , and they have even waited for opportunities to sneak into China 's airspace ; Chinese and US warplanes have frequently engaged in midair confrontation and chases , and this collision was by no means a case of accidentally " going too far . "  
The unexpected collision of US and PRC military aircraft at a point 140 km southeast of Hainan , leading to the PRC F-8 fighter plane crashing , and the US EP-3 reconnaissance plane making a forced landing at Lingshui Airbase , is a test of the crisis management ability of both the PRC and the US . It also makes it clear that the strategic partnership relationship is finished , and determines even more how the two regard each other as strategic competitors .  
If it is said that in the era of industrial economy , knowledge could find expression in a combatant 's skills or a commander 's tactics , in a future war , intellectual fighting capacity and knowledge confrontation will respectively constitute a major symbol of military strength and a fundamental characteristic of military confrontation .  
Russia has also merged some of its higher command schools with some of its engineering technology schools and increased courses on engineering technology for its postgraduate students studying in the command specialty by a large margin with an eye on training qualified high-level military personnel who are well-versed in scientific and cultural knowledge and proficient in various military specialties .  
It is the belief in being brave and fighting and defeating competitors and the working style of persistent struggle that was created by our military a long time ago .  It is the teamwork characterized by aligning oneself with the interests of the entire situation and being cooperative .  
During the meeting , relevant consular officials of the Chinese Foreign Ministry pointed out to the US Embassy and Consulate officials mentioned above that after the US military reconnaissance plane bumped against and destroyed a Chinese military plane in the airspace over the coastal waters of China , it , without the permission of the Chinese side , intruded into China 's territorial airspace and landed on an airport in China . This has violated relevant provisions of the international law and relevant Chinese laws .  China has the right to investigate the entire incident .  
The editorial says : The United States claims to be a country being most respectful to democracy and legal system in the world and always talks about human rights and law .  However , its military plane wantonly violated international law and paid no attention to the territories and sovereignty of another country .  
Evidently , it was the US reconnaissance plane that violated flying rules , bumped against and destroyed a Chinese military plane , and illegally intruded into China 's airspace and landed on an airport of the Chinese side , thus constituting a serious violation of China 's sovereignty and territory and threatening China 's national security .  
In the 1990s , he organized the military units to successfully fulfill the tasks of foreign friendly exchanges , equipment and technology imports , academic and technological exchanges , multilateral military diplomatic activity , and maritime military safety negotiations .  
The US military reconnaissance plane 's spying activities in the airspace over China 's exclusive economic waters actually overran the scope of " free over-flight " allowed by international law , and violated the relevant stipulations of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea .  
The Chinese side has also pointed out that when the surveillance aircraft that caused the trouble flew into the airspace over China 's special economic zone , it should respect the provisions concerning the rights of this coastal country .  This act , which is very unfriendly to China , has seriously threatened China 's national security and severely damaged the consensus reached in May last year between China and the United States on avoiding dangerous military actions at sea .  
The reconnaissance behavior of the US military surveillance plane violated the provisions of the " UN Convention on the Law of the Seas " concerning the necessity of respecting the rights of respective coastal nations in overflight of exclusive economic zones , thus posing a serious threat to China 's national security .  
In the past few days officers and men of the PLA units and armed police stationed in Hainan have expressed strong indignation at the incident in which a US military reconnaisance plane collided with and destroyed one of our military planes , intruded into Chinese airspace without permission , and landed at Lingshui airfield .  They have resolutely supported the Chinese Government 's solemn and just stance and directed their fervent patriotism into training and execution of duties .  
The " Plan and Program " points out that by the year 2010 , the whole Army will establish an integrated auditing system in keeping with the joint logistics guarantee system and equipment guarantee system .  The auditing duties and functions will be explicitly defined .  The supervisory mechanisms will be set to work effectively .  The auditing regulations will be improved according to the requirements of military economic reforms .  
In the period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , marked results were achieved in the archive work of our army : In the whole army , an integrated military archive system with full categories , reasonable structure , scientific management , good facilities , and efficient services was set up basically .  Corresponding rules and regulations for archive building and management were also formulated and improved .  A batch of high-quality archive management software was developed .  
It has been learned that , in his recent statement issued to the press inWashington , US Secretary of State Colin Powell for the first time expressed hisregret over an incident in which a US military reconnaissance airplane collidedand damaged a Chinese fighter plane , resulting in a missing pilot whose destinyis still unknown .  
The Chinese Government and people have the right to know why the US sidefrequently dispatched military surveillance planes to China 's coastal waters tocarry out activities , why the US plane violated operational rules and suddenlyveered , bumped into , and destroyed the Chinese plane , and why the US planeintruded into China 's territorial airspace and landed at a Chinese airportwithout permission . 
The entire officers and men of Hainan 's publicsecurity and border defense units , who are shouldered with the security task ofguarding the 1,700-km coastline and 2.1-million square km of ocean , are filledwith righteous indignation at the incident in which a US militaryreconnaissance plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese military plane inmidair over the South China sea and entered China 's airspace withoutauthorization .  One after another , they indignantly condemned the US hegemonicacts .  
Over the past 100 years , the world underwent untold tribulations caused bywars , diseases , hunger , crises , and disasters ; but more importantly , the peopleof various countries carried out momentous social and natural struggles on amagnificent scale , and thus made unprecedented progress in the political , economic , ideological , cultural , scientific , technological , education , military , and medical aspects .  
Reporters Li Kun and Wang Weiping report : Ma Man Kay , president of theMacao China Chamber of Commerce , pointed out that the incident in which the USmilitary reconnaissance plane ramming and damaging China 's military aircraft inairspace above China 's exclusive economic zone and entering China 's territorialairspace and landing at a Chinese airport without permission is a serious onethat has violated international law and violated China 's sovereignty andterritorial airspace .  
Ignoring the international law , the US plane had intruded intothe special economic zone in China 's coastal area , and made a turn to bump anddestroy a Chinese military aircraft .  This is an ironclad fact and can not bedenied .  However , what has been hard for people to understand is that after theincident , the US side has refused to admit its fault .  
The United States has for many years kept conducting military reconnaissance activities along China 's southeast coastal areas , and US military planes have repeatedly appeared in the skies of China 's coastal areas and have even intruded into the line of China 's territorial waters for reconnaissance .  The US plane that bombed into and destroyed China 's fighter this time is a US military reconnaissance plane equipped with sophisticated electronic reconnaissance devices as well as military intelligence gathering professionals .  
The frequent military reconnaissance activities that the United States have conducted in China 's coastal areas despite the repeated solemn representations from the Chinese Government are never out of a good peaceful purpose , but have an obvious nature of hostility and have posed a serious threat to China 's security and interest .  Meanwhile , these reconnaissance activities have obviously surpassed the scope of " overflight freedom " and violated the principle of " overflight freedom , " as stipulated in the " UN Convention of the Law of the Sea .  
China 's military plane tailed after and conducted surveillance over the US military reconnaissance plane , which intruded into the airspace of our coastal exclusive economic zone to conduct military reconnaissance activities , according to the international law and China 's law .  Exercising sovereign right in the exclusive economic zone , and safeguarding the national defense security is just and legal behavior .  
This consensus confirms : The " International Civil Aviation Convention , " signed in Chicago in 1994 , is definitely not applied to military aircraft and national aircraft , but respecting and observing the related rules and the basic demands of the Convention is conducive to ensuring the safety of both sides ' military and civil aircraft flying over the international airspace .  
It is a serious violation of the international law that the US military reconnaissance plane conducted military reconnaissance activities in the airspace above China 's exclusive economic zone , bombed into and destroyed China 's military plane that was carrying out the regular surveillance task , intruded into China 's territorial airspace , and infringed on China 's territorial sovereignty .  
If they carry on a reconnaissance mission near China , they are most likely to be viewed as invading the Chinese communists ' territorial air space , the direct result of which will be the United States and China resuming a dangerous game they had played in the Cold War era with the US military aircraft going on reconnaissance missions .  If so , the US forces are likely to face higher risks .  Moreover , if a similar unfortunate incident occurs in future , no one can guarantee that the US forces will suffer no casualties .  
When our country was conducting military exercises in the East Sea and you , the United States , were engaging in reconnaissance activities , we just ignored you , and you thought that this was very " normal . "  But on this occasion , this incident occurred in an exclusive economic zone of China , or at the doorway of China ; you regarded it as " abnormal " and adopted a tough attitude .  
In recent years , with the gradual establishment of the socialist market economic system , the party central leadership and the State Council adopted more concrete measures for dealing with the prominent problems that were affecting the order of the market economy and for effecting a fundamental turn for the better in this regard .  The measures included the banning of party and government institutions , military units , armed police force , judicial and law enforcement organs from running enterprises ;  
The Pentagon is still sticking to its hardline stance , and has even again sent reconnaisance planes to carry out provocative activities ; apart from showing that the United States is unable to advance any further arguments to justify itself , it shows all the more the current US administration 's blind spots and total ignorance in foreign policy - - at least we have already seen that the diplomats involved in this affair are all military men who lack normal knowledge of foreign affairs , and even lack essential knowledge of Chinese humanity and history .  
Fu Quanyou expounded the development process and historical causes of the world 's new military revolution , analyzed the essential features and profound impact of the revolution , and explicitly put forth our Army 's major counter measures to meet the challenges from the world 's new military revolution .  
Overseas Chinese leaders expressed indignation at the hegemonic act of the U.S . spy plane 's collision with a Chinese military aircraft and the illegal invasion by the American plane of Chinese territorial air space and territory .  They reproached the United States one after another , saying that overseas Chinese and the Chinese people commonly consider this incident to wholly be the legal and moral responsibility of the United States , that the attitude of the United States is unreasonable , and its way of handling the situation inferior .  
It is necessary , in line with the requirements of maintaining the advanced nature , to vigorously step up ideological and political building , constantly enhance our steadfastness and consciousness in carrying out the party 's line , principles , and policies , energetically endorse and support reform , subordinate ourselves to and serve the overall interests of the state 's economic construction , conscientiously fulfill the fundamental functions of the armed forces , ensure unimpeded implementation of military orders , and provide a powerful security guarantee for the state 's reform , development , and stability .  
An analysis by a military expert of Taiwan Gao Xiongbo says : " Arms race is very costly .  Because Taiwan 's enterprises have a special background of relationship between the government and the commercial sector , most of them are leaning toward shortsightedness for immediate gain .  Taiwan 's industry is narrow and shallow and is fundamentally insufficient to support a wide-ranging and a long-term arms race .  
The US plane 's actions violated international law and relevant Chinese laws and regulations , damaged the consensus reached by China and the United States last May on avoiding dangerous military activities at sea , infringed China 's airspace and sovereignty , and threatened China 's national security .  
Tang Jiaxuan emphasized that ever since the US reconnaisance plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese military plane , the Chinese side has all along handled this incident with calmness and restraint and in accordance with international law and the provisions of relevant laws of China .  
He said the US plane intruded into China 's territorial airspace and encroached upon China 's sovereignty in violation of international law and the provisions of relevant laws of China , as well as the consensus that China and the US reached last May on avoiding dangerous maritime military activities .  Its act has thus constituted a threat to China 's national security .  
Chen Ci held that ever since the US military reconnaissance plane rammed into and destroyed a Chinese military plane , the Chinese side has all along handled this incident with calmness and restraint and in accordance with international law and the provisions of relevant laws of China .  
The spokesman said : In accordance with international law and China 's relevant law , the Chinese side absolutely has the right to carry out an overall investigation on the foreign military reconnaissance plane that damaged the Chinese plane , illegally intruded into China 's territorial airspace , and landed at China 's airport .  
Tang Jiaxuan emphasized that ever since the US reconnaissance plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese military plane , the Chinese side has all along handled this incident with calmness and restraint and in accordance with international law and the provisions of relevant laws of China .  
According to international law and the relevant laws of China , the Chinese side has every right to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the foreign military reconnaissance plane , which has rammed into and destroyed a Chinese plane and illegally intruded into China 's airspace and landed at a Chinese airport .  
It was a serious incident that the United States sent a military surveillance plane to conduct spying activities over the exclusive economic zone of China 's Hainan , bumped into and destroyed a Chinese military plane , leaving the Chinese pilot missing , and then entered China 's territorial airspace and landed at Chinese airport .  
The act of the US plane violated international law and provisions of relevant Chinese laws , jeopardized the consensus on avoiding dangerous maritime military activities reached between China and the United States in May last year , infringed on China 's territorial airspace and sovereignty , and threatened China 's national security .  
The incident where the US surveillance plane repeatedly infringed on our coastal waters , and rammed and destroyed the Chinese military aircraft , made the Chinese people further understand that hegemonism truly exist in the world , and aroused their fighting will to make China strong and their determination to seize the opportunity to accelerate economic development .  
In the wake of former president Lee Teng-hui 's visit to the United States in 1995 , communist China 's air force overturned the decades-long tacit understanding that its fighter aircraft would not venture far over the sea .  After the two-state theory incident in the summer of 1999 , the communist military aircraft even considered west of the strait 's central line as the scope of their free movements .  
In a short space of several years , Taiwan 's depth of defense has been drastically reduced .  Each time the military aircraft of our navy and air force , dispatched to defend our air space and territorial sea , confront communist China 's military aircraft flying close to the central line , they begin to worry whether the other party will suddenly cross the line or take more hostile action .  
In one way or another , overseas Chinese and Chinese nationals living in different parts of the world condemned the conduct of the US military reconnaissance plane of ramming into and destroying the Chinese aircraft .  They firmly supported the Chinese Government 's just stand , and they extended their respects to heroic pilot Wang Wei , whose whereabouts were still unknown .  
They should unite more closely around the party CentralCommittee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner ofDeng Xiaoping Theory , seriously implement the important thinking of " threerepresents , " strengthen the party building and improve the ideological andpolitical levels of the military , and provide a powerful spiritual motivationand reliable political guarantee for " winning in wars " and " neverdegenerating . "  
Judging from relevant reports , the diplomats played a negotiator role over the counter , and military leaders such as Chi Haotian and Jiefangjun Bao acted in an organized and planned manner , but not , as reported by some US mainstream media , that " Chinese generals " were asked not to get involved and not to be that tough .  
The plane collision incident provided an opportunity for the military and the hardliners inside the regime to affect the transfer of power with the impact of the people 's nationalist sentiments .  Jiang did not want to see that the incident developed to a degree that might seriously harm the Chinese Communists ' diplomatic relations with the United States , but neither could he openly show a sign of weakness and be outdone by the US side , because this would affect the legitimacy of his power status at home .  
When the news reached Huzhou that the US Government had offered an apology to the Chinese people for the incident in which a US military surveillance plane caused the crash of a Chinese military aircraft , the parents of missing Chinese pilot Wang Wei felt relieved ; meanwhile , they voiced their resolute support for the way the Chinese Government had handled the incident as well as the stand clearly stated by Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan when he accepted the US apology-giving letter .  
During peacetime , such military activities conducted by the United States have the obvious characteristic of being hostile to China . They are a threat to China 's national security and peace and order , and a provocation against China 's sovereignty .  They violate a basic principle of international law , which says that countries should respect each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
Apart from similar stipulations on a country 's territorial airspace and legal status , the " International Civil Aviation Treaty , " concluded in Chicago in 1944 , in order to strictly classify the different legal status between civil and military aircraft , clearly stipulates in Article 3 : " The national aircraft of a signatory must not fly over the airspace of another signatory or land on its territory without special permission or other form of permission and abide by its rules . "  
The Chinese side absolutely could have taken necessary coercive measures in accordance with the right for self-protection stipulated in international law against such a foreign military plane that illegally entered China 's territorial airspace and landed on an airfield inside a military prohibited zone in China .  
In order to legalize this rude and unreasonable demand , the US side even made up the absurd argument that the US military plane causing the incident was a part of its territory and US state property and therefore , was eligible for sovereign immunity .  
A Recount of the Foreign Relations Act of the United States ( third edition ) , the most authoritative international law document of the United States , even says the agreement of the accepting state alone is not enough .  On the basis of such an agreement , the accepting state and the foreign country must also reach a special agreement on relevant community before the foreign military forces are eligible for sovereign immunity in the accepting state .  
As mentioned above , the US military reconnaissance plane abused free overflight in airspace over China 's coastal waters , violated flying rules , bumped against and destroyed a Chinese plane , and entered China 's territorial airspace and landed on China 's military airfield without authorization .  That already constituted an incident of serious violation of international law .  
The large-scale Chinese military and civilian action of searching for Wang Wei , the missing parachuting pilot , was concluded at 18:00 yesterday .  The people of all walks of life in Hainan Province expressed deep sorrow at the fact that there is no possibility of Wang Wei returning alive , and acclaimed him as a hero in defending the motherland .  
The entire process of the incident was connected to historical , legal , cultural , language , and religious issues , and the only thing that was conspicuously absent was its military aspect .  US Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld did not even appear in public during the development of the incident .  It was not until 13 April that he held a news conference at which he complained that it was only the Chinese Communist plane 's provocative act that was the underlying cause of the collision .  
First , the establishment of mechanisms for military mutual trust must be based on a framework of bilateral or multilateral ties , that is , the parties concerned must have existing basic mechanisms to hold dialogues and channels to facilitate cooperation , and one of the most important preconditions is that they have a certain level of political mutual trust .  Without political consensus and trust , a mechanism for military mutual trust will be infeasible both theoretically and in practice .  
While performing the flying duty of tracking and monitoring the US military electronic reconnaissance plane this time , he displayed determination , courage , calmness , cool-headedness , heroism , and tenacity .  By sacrificing his life , he composed a glorious victorious song of patriotism and revolutionary heroism .  
Comrade Wang Wei had high revolutionary aspirations and a lofty spirit of selfless devotion .  He put into practice our military 's fundamental objectives in an exemplary manner , and fulfilled our military 's fundamental functions in a faithful way .  He was an outstanding representative of the new generation of revolutionary military servicemen .  
The decree urges all officers and men throughout the military to rally still more closely around the party central committee , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , consciously study and practice the requirements of the " three represents , " work in a down-to-earth manner , wage unremitting struggles , step up preparations for military struggles , and constantly raise our military 's defense and combat capabilities under modern conditions , thereby making even greater contributions toward realizing reunification of the motherland and defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
A combination of operational forces has been accelerated further through the wide use of microelectronic and software technologies with computers at the core , remote and sense technologies dominated by battlefield monitoring and target detection , and military high-tech , such as military engineering , antichemical , and military command and management technologies .  Meanwhile , a new situation of joint operations , with coordination between frontline and rear units , among three armed forces , and between the military and civilians , has taken shape .  
and difficulties in organizational coordination , modern joint operations can not compare to previous wars .  Relatively speaking , the joint logistics service levels of our military are fairly low .  Thus , joint logistics subunits should make a breakthrough in changing the current situation where logistics units and the units that they serve do not coordinate with each other in terms of planning and supplying and in the aspects of command and support .  
Wu Quanxu , deputy chief of the General Staff Department , who had come to direct the training exercise , told us reporters : In order to protect people 's life and property and reduce to a minimum possible losses during a nuclear accident , the PLA has established and refined a rescue command system marked by integration of military forces with civil forces , peacetime needs with wartime needs , and forces of three services and have cultivated capabilities of launching an emergency rescue operation in all types of nuclear power accidents .  
We are determined to bear in mind Chairman Jiang 's instructions , carry forward Wang Wei 's spirit of fearing no sacrifice and dedicating ourselves to the motherland 's interests , continue to enhance the revolutionary character of the troops , quicken the pace of modernization and regularization , work hard to practice and master military skills , guarantee the winning of the future war , and guarantee that the character of the armed forces will never change .  
If the target firing tests of the unmanned Stealth fighter are successful , and the program for development of the new type of nuclear weapons is approved , this will mean that the Bush Administration will pour more and more funds into developing futuristic military technology in the hope of maintaining the US hegemonist status in the world through pursuing absolute superiority in military technology ; and still more , it will mean that the United States will make the world still less peaceful and secure , and this is bound to trigger a large-scale arms race worldwide .  
Robert Wilson , a thermonuclear weapons expert at Princeton University , warned that the US military has simply got dizzy , as there can not be any such thing as a nuclear weapon that can destroy enemy underground bunkers without threatening the local inhabitants .  
While enforcing the task of flying to tail and monitor the US military reconnaissance airplane , Comrade Wang Wei was resolute and decisive , calm and cool-headed , and courageous and indomitable .  In order to safeguard state sovereignty and national dignity , he dedicated his valuable life , thus putting the aim of our army into practice with his utterly fearless revolutionary behavior .  
Our military has made noticeable achievements in these efforts , but we should understand that , as sources of military professionals have been continuously changing and we are facing complex circumstances and vital struggles , unswervingly adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership of the military and using this military spirit to unite officers and soldiers , is still a significant and serious topic for our military 's ideological and political construction in the new situation .  
However , the US military plane , disregarding the international rules for flight safety that flying vehicles must not fly in opposite directions and must not cross each other , changed course abruptly , causing the collision .  
The former official said the debriefings of the 24 crew members after their return to the United States conform to the information disclosed by the US military when the incident first broke out .  Both indicated that the US aircraft was on autopilot , and a fighter of Communist China made a quick forging ahead and pulled up from beneath the US plane , which led to the collision .  
The vast numbers of officers and men of all of the armed services and the Armed Police have been greatly inspired by the report that Central Military Commission Chairman Jiang Zemin signed an order to confer the honorable title of " Guardian of the Sea and Air " on Wang Wei , and vowed to emulate Wang Wei and turn their patriotic passion into deeds to build up the military and to worthily serve the country and to work diligently for the building of modern and regularized revolutionary armed forces .  
The " three represents " advocates the realm of a communist 's lofty thought , which is going with development of productive forces , advocating advanced cultures , and giving primary consideration in all ways to the interests of the people .  This spirit is a powerful spiritual driving force for us to ensure thorough implementation of all work and to truthfully realize the demand that the party exercises absolute leadership over the military .  
We are happy to see that since the normalization of the two countries ' relations , high-level leaders of the two parties and two countries have conducted frequent mutual visits , and both sides ' exchanges and cooperation have expanded and developed in a more in-depth manner in the political , economic , military , scientific , technological , and cultural fields .  
The General Staff Headquarters made a decision a few days ago on setting up coordination centers for protecting the legitimate rights and interests of military units , servicemen and servicemen 's family members in provincial capitals where there are many military units under the General Staff Headquarters on condition that the authorized size of the armed forces is not expanded .  
It has been learned that the major tasks of these coordination centers are : to coordinate work in handling legal issues involving units under the General Staff Headquarters , their servicemen and servicemen 's family members and to assist local governments and judicial departments as well as provincial military districts and sub-districts and the people 's armed forces departments of respective provinces to properly handle in good time legal issues involving the military and local people and to provide legal service for military units , servicemen , and servicemen 's family members .  
During the four-year-long training in the military school , he interpreted the meaning of responsibility with his loyalty and acquired the pass certificate for hovering in the blue sky with excellent scores in all subjects .  On the road to an ideal , there are hardships to accompany one 's dedications .  
Top level leaders have frequently exchanged visits , while contacts and cooperation are increasingly expanded and deepened in the political , economic , military , scientific , technological , and cultural fields .  
Having pretty much tried all the economic revival programs to no avail , a succession of undercurrents is appearing in Japan involving the use of " an arms buildup and expanded military industry production to stimulate an economic recovery , " attempting to shift Japan toward a model in which " arms stimulate the economy " and thus achieving the goal of " killing two birds with one stone , " that is , getting the economy to take a temporary turn for the better and also achieving the goal of becoming a great military and political power .  
After the crew 's safe return , however , senior US military and political officials immediately turned around and went back on their word , reversed right and wrong , produced lame arguments , and even put the blame on others ; they publicly declared that military reconnaisance operations against China are " for the purpose of ensuring our security interests and protecting the security of our allies , " " preserving world peace , " and so on .  
Obviously , for the United States to engage in this kind of military activity in peacetime contravenes the basic principles of international law regarding mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , and is markedly characterized by hostility to China ; it is a threat to China 's national security and peaceful order , and an open provocation against China 's sovereignty , and it has caused a tense atmosphere affecting regional security .  
Proceeding from their hegemonist aims , they desperately cling to their cold war mentality , always wanting to set up some " enemy " or " opponent , " and proceed to regard socialist China as " the main threat " ; they continually use the Taiwan , Tibet , and human rights issues as pretexts for interfering in China 's internal affairs , persist in developing Theater Missile Defense , which jeopardizes China 's security , plot to step up arms sales to Taiwan , and regard China as the assumed enemy in military exercises .  
The western region 's economic development has been relatively slow ; the condition of its social base is poor , and the strategic logistical facilities have always been a weak link and have never been able to meet the new demands of military combats .  
As the great western development moves forward , and under the close cooperation among the state , the local governments , and the military , the western region 's infrastructure will be able to meet both social and national defense needs , so that the Chinese military 's strategic logistical facilities will have a solid foundation for achieving great development .  
Looking ahead into the future , the western region 's scientific and technological standards no doubt will be raised to a much higher level , and the west 's scientific and technological vitality no doubt will propel the military 's work to invigorate logistics with science and technology to new heights .  
We must insist on putting the military economy in the context of the national economy and combining strategic logistical construction with local infrastructure construction .  In the construction of railroads , highway , airport , docks , telecommunications , pipelines , urban construction and other basic construction , we must take into consideration the military needs and make sure they can be taken care with little or no extra spending .  
We must take advantage of the western great development to promote military economic construction and make scientific and technological innovation and the propagation of results the focal point as we resolutely embark on the road of using science and technology to invigorate rear services and find ways to raise the scientific and technological contents of logistical work .  
We should target the characteristic that most logistical science and technology have military and civilian applications as we vigorously bring in local advanced and practical scientific and technological results , put civilian work to military use and promptly turn them into a military economic benefit , so that they can provide a service and boost our safeguard capability .  We should pay attention to using society 's R &amp; D capability to accelerate the strong pace of using scientific and technological advancement to achieve security .  
Matters that can be taken over by society should gradually be handed over to society ; security organs with nonmilitary functions should be handed over to the localities , and security organs that shoulder military functions should be streamlined and augmented to create a new logistical security system with operating mechanisms consistent with the Chinese military 's quality construction and the western region 's economic development .  
We must firmly uphold the concept of the whole situation and the concept of long-term construction to actively immerse ourselves in the western great development , work with a will to make the country strong and a spirit of arduous struggle to build an enterprise , and push forward the western region 's military economic construction step by step to make our due share of contribution to raising the country 's comprehensive national strength and increasing our national defense capability .  
The decision further urges them to emulate Wang Wei 's dauntless spirit of not fearing strong enemies , not evading difficulties and dangers , and daring to conquer all enemies , so that they will constantly temper their military style of being heroic and indomitable , making decisive struggle , and winning decisive victory .  This will also enable them to strenuously learn modern knowledge of science and technology , become versed in using the weapons in their hands , and truly raise their ability to defend the country under modern conditions .  
They should also emulate Wang Wei 's lofty ideological character of making selfless dedication , loving and respecting his work , disregarding personal gains and loses , and being indifferent to fame and profit so that they will be able to take the initiative to subordinate themselves to and serve the cardinal needs of reform and construction , cultivate a fine moral character , establish a lofty goal of life , and maintain the unchangeable integrity of revolutionary military personnel .  
Yu Yongbo presided at the gathering .  He demanded that the units of the entire armed forces take Comrade Wang Wei as their example , consciously practice the important thinking on " three represents " proposed by Chairman Jiang Zemin , vigorously promote the modernization of the armed forces , do a sound job in preparatory work for military struggle , comprehensively enhance our army 's capability to successfully fight a modern war , especially a partial war under hi-tech conditions , and make new contributions to defending and building the motherland .  
Relying on its strength in science and technology and its powerful armaments , the United States has set up a worldwide intelligence system for collecting from land , air , below the sea , and indeed from space political , military , and economic intelligence on all parts of the world , so as to serve its pursuit of global hegemony and creation of a unipolar world .  
" It has always been my dream to wear the green military uniform .  I want to fly a fighter plane and take to the wild blue yonder .  
Before we came to the Military Representative Office to gather news , we already learned that the military representatives here enjoyed very high prestige .  By the time we went round the military plant , we were surprised at what we found .  If a military representative discovers a minor problem , he can issue a white feedback note demanding an immediate measure to make correction .  
However , in view of existing weak links in the plant 's quality control work , the Military Representative Office proposed to solemnly deal with the matter in order to strengthen the sense of the quality of military products among intermediate-level leading cadres .  Following careful consideration , the plant 's party committee finally decided to dismiss the director of a branch plant , who was in charge of the production of that product , from his post .  This caused strong repercussions in the whole plant .  
Following several days ' hard work , a young military representative finally fulfilled his task of providing technical support .  However , when he returned to the Military Representative Office the following day feeling he was relieved of a heavy load , he was unexpected criticized .  He wept and felt he was wronged .  
Both the " offshore decisive battle " and the " crippling battle " are ideas developed from the same strategic concept of " effective deterrence and solid defense , " but the actual intention is to internationalize the Taiwan issue , stretch the battlefield to the mainland and even the Pacific region , create the pretext for intervention by external forces , and then launch an attack first if the mainland shows signs of using military force , thereby crushing the mainland at one go .  
Most of the weapons tested were long-range attack weapons , underscoring the Taiwan military 's new " offshore decisive battle " strategic concept .  The exercise also stressed the combined tactical applications of new types of weapons , in order to test the tactics and the weapons ' technical performance and give full play to the overall combat capabilities of various types of weapons .  
Ideological and political education is not an ordinary job , but rather an essential and fundamental task in adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership over the military and the key to strengthening the military 's comprehensive construction and carrying out every task .  
In light of the many and heavy tasks faced by brigades and regiments , their Party committee secretaries should pay special attention to observing and analyzing the situation from the political perspective , adhere to the correct direction of military construction , give top priority to ideological administration and education .  They should rely on correct education and instruction to assure that the military is under the Party 's effective control and rely on the powerful spiritual backbone to unite military professionals and inspire their fighting spirit .  
Party committee secretaries should take the lead in studying and understanding the major contents of this opinion , straighten out the main theme of their work , and firmly stick to ideological and political education , the key to their work .  In this way , they can pool effort , coordinate relationships between different sectors and tasks and advance the overall situation of military construction .  
A senior personality from Taiwan 's military even declared in public : " We monitored the entire process of the incident and recorded the mid-air conversations made by the Chinese communists ' pilots . "  " We have handed over the tape recordings to the US side . "  
Some of the right wing figures in the moderate group even believed that , based on this , trade contact is helping to increase China 's overall national power and leading to an increased military threat of Taiwan by the mainland , and that the risk of the United States being involved in a regional conflict is even greater .  
The procedure also stipulates that no Internet online service business sites are to be set up within 200 meters of such places as key central party , political , and military organs , within 200 meters of middle and elementary schools , and in residential buildings .  
The military training for the students of an institution of higher learning , a senior middle school , or a school equivalent to a senior middle school shall be organized and executed by the organization within the school responsible for military training or its military instructor in accordance with the relevant stipulations of the state .  
Article 20 .  Military regions , provincial military districts ( including Beijing Garrison and other garrisons ) , military subdistricts ( including sub-garrisons ) , and the people 's armed forces departments of counties , autonomous counties , cities , and municipal districts shall conduct national defense education for militiamen and personnel on reserve duty in combination with political education , organizational rectification , military training , performance of services , conscription work , and activities on important festivals and commemoration days .  
The fine traditions and the fine work style of our army are the precious spiritual wealth , as well as the source of the invincible power , of our army ; and this military history is therefore required to fully embody the glorious traditions and the fine work style of our army , so that it can be used as a good teaching material for our education on traditions among our troops .  
Meanwhile , the book must also make a comprehensive , profound , and accurate summarization of the historical experiences and lessons that our army has gained and learned from its building , so as to serve as an important historical reference in the course of strengthening national defense , promoting army building , and making sound preparations for military struggles .  
Chi Haotian urged the compilers of the military history to ensure a sound quality for the entire book by taking the attitude of holding themselves responsible for history , the party , the people , the officers and men , and for the revolutionaries of the older generation ; and to make sure that the military history they are compiling is a faithful historical account , as well as an accurate " Historical Record , " of our army that can be handed down to future generations .  
The laser guns , deployed in fixed positions or installed on mobile vehicles , can effectively shoot down and destroy attacking ballistic missiles , high and low altitude supersonic cruise missiles , ultra high speed stealth planes , and military targets at sea .  
Since the implementation of the new system governing noncommissioned officers over a year ago , noncommissioned officers have been playing a very prominent role at the basic-level units .  They have become backbone forces in military units ' combat training , education , and study of specialized technical skills , playing a decisive role in military units ' basic and long-range developments .  
Through this education , we should arouse the patriotic enthusiasm of officers and soldiers of the military to love and serve their motherland and strengthen their convictions in winning wars and eradicating corruption so that they will have the full political enthusiasm and great fighting strength for being ready to carry out the sacred mission given by the Party and the country - - maintaining the territorial unity of the motherland and protecting the sovereignty and dignity of our country .  
We believe that , with joint efforts of both the military and the people throughout the country , the law on national defense education will be carried out and implemented in a comprehensive manner , and China 's national defense education project will advance in a healthy manner .  We believe that the sense of " all-people " national defense and the cohesion of the Chinese nation will further be strengthened , and the peace-loving Chinese nation will certainly create a stronger national defense .  
Extensively promoting the educational campaign to study and put into practice the important thinking of the " three represents " and maintain the advanced nature of Party members is an important task of the military 's political work for this year , which was decided in accordance with the directive of the Central Military Commission . It also is an important measure and realistic procedure for improving the quality of Party members and strengthening Party-building throughout the military .  
In recent years , India has formulated a military strategy of " guarding against China northward , fighting against Pakistan westward , dominating the Indian Ocean southward , and expanding its sphere of influence eastward " in addition to its efforts to build nuclear deterrent power .  Expanding its sphere of influence eastward means extending its sphere of influence to the South China Sea and a part of the Pacific region .  
Ding Jiye ; A whole series of reforms of our armed forces ' finances have been carried out in recent years , and military expenditure management is now being moved from the traditional empirical and extensive style to modern , scientific , and meticulous management .  This reform of drawing up the armed forces budget is a key step in this process .  
Ding Jiye : Mainly in three aspects : First , we institute categorized budget management , that is , military expenditure is divided into two main categories , sustained expenditure and construction expenditure , according to the nature of the use of the funds ; these two categories are budgeted separately , macroeconomic regulation and control is stepped up , and different focal points to be ensured are set down ;  
Ding Jiye : This reform stresses improving the method and procedure in drawing up the budget .  The main special features are : The reform itself does not require increased input , while the regulation and control function of the military budget is markedly strengthened , the economic returns on military funds will be markedly enhanced , and funds can be concentrated on ensuring preparedness for military struggle ;  
The DPRK Nodong Sinmun published a commentary condemning the US-ROK joint military exercise as a " strategic provocation . "  It pointed out that the United States is attempting to continue to carry out its hostile policy of strangling the DPRK " by power , " and the US adventurist actions have poured cold water on the people of the Korean peninsula who earnestly desire national self-determination and reunification and a beautiful future .  
and it is also feasible to cooperate with the electronic confrontation squad of our side to mock an SOS sent by the pilot of the enemy plane in such a way that the enemy can not distinguish whether the signal is genuine or fake , and once the enemy 's military strength is dispersed , our side can annihilate the enemy .  
Social development , especially in the modern era , has enmeshed military action more closely into the political , economic , diplomatic , and scientific and technological arenas .  More military means are now available for achieving specific politic goals , and the range of activities covered by military struggles is gradually widening .  
An important mission in warfare research is to study new rules for commanding war in light of changes in the form of warfare , with special emphasis on the way operational guidelines and strategic military operations are prepared and executed .  
It is essential that strategic studies cater to the objective requirements of future military struggles and involve planning for building up military strength , with special emphasis on putting forward overall requirements for promoting rapid progress in building up military strength .  
Of more than 10 strategic principles , the US authorities determined on measures for subverting China in various fields of social life including the political , economic , diplomatic , military , trade , cultural , and educational fields .  
[ passage omitted ] In the 10 years beginning in 2001 , based on their yearning for an American century , extreme rightwing American politicians , tycoons , the military industrial complex , the media , and its ideological wildness will wallow together in the mire , and unscrupulously stir up the " theory of the China threat " ; in coordination with a psychological offensive , they will carry out a new " physical offensive . "  
Lai Changxing at that time relied on the network of connections he had woven over many years in key Party , government and military organs by wearing the hat of a private entrepreneur who was famous all over the country , a member of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference of Fujian Province and an honorary citizen of Xiamen City , among other political glories .  
The incident which occurred on 1 April in which a US military reconnaissance plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese fighter plane and then landed on Chinese territory - - the Lingshui Airport on Hainan Island - - had its first phase settled after US President Bush expressed " deep regret " and US Ambassador Preuher delivered a " letter of apology " to the Chinese foreign minister , and then the Chinese government allowed the American crew members to leave for home before Easter because of humanitarian considerations after completing some necessary procedures .  
In light of the rapid development of the revolution in the military field throughout the world , the complex and dynamic international situation and profound social revolutions , the youth of officers and soldiers must devote great efforts to becoming high-quality military professionals through diligent study so as to carry forward and promote the glorious tradition of the May 4th Movement , and fulfill their sacred mission .  
Only when the majority of young officers and soldiers have a sense of urgency being aware that time waits for no man , making diligent efforts to become high-quality military professionals and striving to improve their own quality can they keep up with rapid development in the global field of military science and technology and genuinely fulfill their sacred mission of revitalizing the military and serving the motherland .  
According to the experienced Indian military analyst ( Kapil Kaq ) , " this joint military exercise is multilevel and is also the first time that India has shown that it has already made preparations in pragmatic fashion for fighting a limited conventional war ; India 's conventional military forces remain in a high state of combat readiness and will sternly retaliate on a large scale against an enemy . "  
Thus apart from laying a solid foundation of knowledge , especially by taking a " general course " on directing joint operations in a military academy or school , our commanding officers should also devote more energy to learning and applying knowledge on different services and arms through peacetime campaign training exercises ; should work hard to learn about the basic formations of different services and arms as well as the functional features and operational principles of different types of weapons and equipment ;  
should be resolved to turn more demonstration exercises into real training exercises , which may test and examine the units involved .  Whenever conditions allow , we should stage training exercises involving students from various military academies and schools , commanding officers from various units , and command organs from the units set to play a key role in such exercises , thus enabling all personnel concerned to handle the same situation together , and the general departments should organize and send personnel to examine and appraise training results .  
The US , Japanese , and British forces have all stressed the following two requirements : First , a senior commanding officer shall have received training in various military academies and schools before taking office ; Second , a senior commanding officer shall have served in different posts in different services before taking office .  These two requirements have laid a foundation for a senior commanding officer to direct joint operations .  
The task of reinforcing the army through science and technology is a grand and complex system project ; and we need a series of thorough and scientific plans , theoretical demonstrations and verifications , as well as policy decisions to cope with a multitude of complicated and confused problems in the fields ranging from weaponry development , military establishment and structural changes , to training reform .  
Thanks to all these efforts , batches after batches of high-end cadres with high educational backgrounds have been recruited into the military , and have gradually become a main force in the contingent of cadres of our army .  However , there still exists a wide gap between our army and foreign armies in the cultivation of high-quality talent .  For example , officers holding master 's degree and above make up a relatively low proportion in our army ;  
most cadres are deficient in combined capabilities and have a relatively poor scientific and technological quality ; and in particular , there is a shortage of top-notch technological personnel .  It is just as Chairman Jiang has pointed out : " At present , the quality of the cadres contingent of our army has yet to totally suit the demands of our military strategic requirements for the new period , and this is an issue that has to be settled urgently . "  
Those who have attained extraordinary work results , have given an outstanding work performance , have made great contributions , and have shown a strong work ability shall be promoted to higher posts either ahead of time or overstepping their proper ranks ; and those who have achieved major scientific research results or have considerably enhanced the military efficiency shall be amply rewarded .  
In recent years , a submarine chaser group of the East Sea Fleet has successfully accomplished dozens of urgent , difficult , dangerous , and arduous tasks , such as emergency and disaster rescue , locating shipwrecks , and going on patrol at sea .  It has won the title of advanced unit in military training from the higher authorities for many years in a row and is known as " hunters " of the East China Sea .  
Observers point out that the most direct and evident information gleaned from the fact that , only three months after taking office , the Bush Administration could not wait to deploy an NMD program far exceeding that of his predecessor is that the United States needs to simulate its economy , which has started a downturn , by means of stepping up production in the defense industry , and also to offer a political reward to the military industrial complex for supporting Bush in getting into the White House .  
fifth , the US decision to link NMD with TMD overseas is bound to harm regional peace and stability ; should the United States being Taiwan into the east Asia TMD , this will be organizing a US-Taiwan military alliance in disguise , interfering in China 's internal affairs , and increasing the tension in the Taiwan strait .  
It is present in political , economic , military , scientific and technological , and cultural education ; its core values are patriotism , revolutionary heroism , and the spirit of dedication ; and its ultimate objectives are to boost all citizens ' will , skills , and physical capabilities in loving , developing , and defending their motherland , so that they can firmly adopt the idea of " being prepared for danger in times of peace " and " joining hands to resist foreign aggression . "  
First , not long ago , the United States ' Bush administration decided to adjust its military strategy and set forth a plan for deploying a global missile defense .  Before that , the United States had drawn Japan into its TMD ( theater missile defense ) program by forcing Japan to sign a cooperation agreement and get involved in the four-year program for joint technological research and development of the TMD system .  
The " operational manual for new-type aircraft and fighters " compiled by reading several hundreds of new aircraft materials , studying and analyzing over a-hundred pieces of cabin equipment and aerial test flight verifications , and with the efforts of Li Keqiang and pilots of the whole regiment was published , thus providing effective technical support for our military training for refitting new-type fighters .  Following that , six volumes of " collections of theses on study of new-type aircraft tactical and combat methods " were compiled and published .  
In the Indian Ocean region , India is rather powerful in terms of territorial size , population , scientific and technological capability , military and economic strength .  India also has certain influential power in the international political arena .  Therefore , drawing India to its side and playing the " Indian card " will bring a lot of benefits for the United States to seize the world hegemony .  
and externally , they have gone all out in their pursuit of a " pragmatic diplomacy , " a " money diplomacy , " and a " secret diplomacy . "  Particularly , they have invited a " guardian god " from abroad , expanded their military purchases , and threatened to " fight a decisive offshore battle . "  
The party committee of the Ministry of Public Security 's Frontier Guard Administrative Bureau has attached great importance to launching the " strike-hard " struggle .  To solidly and efficiently launch the " strike-hard " struggle , the bureau has established a frontier guard " strike-hard " leading group .  Various public security frontier guard headquarters have also established " strike-hard " leading groups headed by principal military and administrative officials .  
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi commented today at a press conference that China is carrying out a peaceful policy of foreign diplomacy in which independence and initiative is maintained .  This will aid in protecting and advancing peace and stability in the Asia Pacific region as well as in the world .  No matter how military planning is strengthened , advocacy of containment of China is contrary to the historical trend and is entirely wrong and will get nowhere .  
The report states : To pursue the new Asia strategy , the United States should make significant readjustments of its military deployments in the Asia-Pacific region , such as shifting the focus of its regional military deployments to South Asia from Northeast Asia , developing and improving the military security network with its allies , building Guam into a military center of the United States in Asia , strengthening joint air and naval forces , and developing its long-distance fighting capability .  
In May , 2000 , the PLA demonstrated in the Nanjing Military Region a series of single-soldier training topics by stressing a reform in the following two aspects : As for training contents , the PLA for the first time prioritized training in comprehensive quality by taking training in modern military technology as the mainstay and training in " three capabilities ( intellectual capability , technological capability , and physical capability ) " as the vital ingredients ;  
If Taiwan takes all that is offered , an increase in its military strength is bound to inspire misgivings of the communist China , the two sides of the strait are bound to head for an arms race , and , no doubt , the current cross-strait relations will go from bad to worse .  The arms sales , in which the Chen Shui-bian Government believes it has achieved a major breakthrough , may become a cause leading Taiwan to wars .  
Its missile plan is aimed at achieving its absolute military and economic superiority by means of hegemony .  To pursue this purpose , the United States does not scruple to provoke a global arms race , does not scruple to undermine the regional security of other countries , and does not scruple to break the international rules and order .  In short , for the sake of its national interests , the United States does not scruple to harm the interests of the whole world .  
To strengthen the actual combat capability of the United States Air Force in Korea , the United States military , of late , has continuously strengthened the facilities of the Osan air base , specifically constructing underground a reinforced command and control center , and a C41 ( command , control , communication , computer and intelligence ) system .  
Guam is located in the southern extreme of the Pacific Ocean 's Mariana Island Chain . The strategic function Guam as a forward deployment and support base for the United State military is increasing by the day .  
However , this writer is of the opinion that the United States ' current military deployment in the Asia-Pacific region still is in a kind of historical continuation status - - there have not been any major changes in terms of quantity and quality .  Whether or not the United States will continue to adopt a " Cold War Forward Strategy " in its new strategic plan and step up its direct military presence around China are yet to be observed and studied .  
There are two reasons why the United States has decided to give up its strategy of " winning two local wars breaking out simultaneously . "  First , the United States has been feeling that its military strength and transport capability are inadequate and its financial resources are insufficient , making it difficult to continue to hit others using two fists at the same time .  
Implementing a system according to which division , brigade and regimental level commanders in the infantry , naval , air and secondary artillery forces receive training at military academies and universities from other branches of the military is an important measure in improving the knowledge of our military cadres , in cultivating commanders of united military operations , and in improving our military 's ability to conduct joint operations .  
The Central Military Commission recently decided to select middle - and high-ranking cadres working in one branch of the military to receive training given by a military academy under another branch of the military .  This created a new training model that will certainly be an important driving force in improving our military 's ability to conduct joint operations in modern - - and particularly high-tech - - wars .  
As our reform is entering a crucial stage of storming fortified positions , new developments and problems have emerged in large numbers , such as the work of preparing for military struggle with the aim of winning the war and not become morally degenerate , and the cadre system reform with the implementation of the raw on Officers on Active Service and the temporary Measures for Resettling Demobilized Soldiers as the content . 
and how to implement General Secretary Jiang 's principle of dunning the country by virtue , satisfactorily unify efforts to run the army according to law with efforts to step up ideological and moral education among officers and men and , while enhancing the legal system concept and moral quality of officers and men , enhance the management level of army units , raise the consciousness of officers and men in loving the army , learning military skills , and strictly observing discipline , and so on .  
In order to ensure the smooth enforcement of the government and military orders in a special natural , political , and social environment in Tibet , the Tibet Military District CPC Committee spelled out the following requirement in no uncertain terms : " Though there is a forbidden zone for life on the roof of the world , there is no special zone for enforcing the government and military orders here , " thus enhancing a sense of " unconditional submission " among the officers and men .  
In 1998 , after the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission made such a major decision as banning the PLA units from engaging in business activities , the Tibet Military District decided to take back Zhufeng Hotel , which had been leased to a well-known business group from the south , and rename it as a guesthouse for military use .  It also decided to take back some 100 street-facing shop places around the compound of its headquarters , which had been leased to the local businesses , and rebuild them into a compound wall .  
In coping with external military threats , Russia , which is resolutely opposed to NATO 's expansion to the east , has put forward a proposal for establishing , with European countries , a rapid reaction force to maintain the security of Europe . Moreover , Russia has held many large-scale military exercises with the Commonwealth of Independent States and established a " collective air-defense system " in the western part of Russia .  
The target of the military reduction in force is mainly logistic personnel , health personnel , administrative personnel of military organs , " surplus units " that have emerged after the merging and reorganization of military arms and services , and personnel who have completed or who will soon complete their term of military service .  Military reduction in force will not include standing military units and war preparedness duty units .  
The Russian air force will optimize its setup and organizational structure through merging , reducing redundant commanding organs , and replacing backward weapons and equipment so that it will have the capability to serve as a fighting group in peacetime and to cope with local armed conflicts , thus becoming the principal attacking military service of the Russian armed forces in the new century .  
In dealing with the serious problem that has emerged in the social standing and daily livelihood of military personnel who have been affected by the national economic crisis for some time , Putin pointed out that at present , " the income and social standing of military personnel are incompatible with the price they pay in serving in the military , which has seriously undermined and affected the unity of the armed forces . "  
Further , this base allowed different types of units under different arm services to conduct combined tactical training at the same time .  Crack troops have been selected and established as the " blue army brigade . "  Through direction , transfer , separation , and back-to-back training , troops participating in military exercises were able to use their skillful tactics under sharp confrontations .  
In the light of the United States ' attitude of clinging obstinately to its course on the NMD issue and course of action in starting the research and development of advanced military satellites and space weapons , Putin recently issued another presidential order to demand an early formation of Russia 's new " celestial army " and set this 1 July as the deadline for completing the formation .  
Nevertheless , following the gradual deepening of their understanding of the importance of space intelligence and information in the future and particularly in the face of the reality that United States has started to seize space superiority , many Russian military experts have in recent years held that the space of a battlefield of the 21st century will extend to the outer space and that a future war can be won only by occupying a place in the space .  
It can be seen that Russia 's government and military have taken the organization and formation of the " celestial army " as an important work in restoring the imposing bearing of a military power and racing to control the future commanding point in space .  As such , Russia 's " celestial army " has arduous tasks and a long road ahead .  
During the last 50 years , thanks to the concern of the central authorities and the support of the people in the rest of the country , the party , the government , the military , the police , and the people were united as one and worked hard and perseveringly to accomplish the tremendous achievement of rapid economic development , all-round social progress , and continuous improvement in the people 's living standards .  The entire region has gone through earth-shaking changes .  
To carry out Chairman Jiang 's important directive on striving to construct a contingent of high-quality cadres , the General Department of Staff and the General Political Department decided to , starting this year , replace the old system of directly promoting excellent soldiers to the officer level with a new system in which particularly excellent soldiers are selected to be sent to military academies or universities .  These soldiers can be promoted if they pass an examination at the end of the training program at academies or universities .  
Leaders and political institutions at all levels should , in accordance with the criteria , select promising soldiers with outstanding moral and military integrity and excellent and crucial soldiers , heroic models and exemplary figures in preparing for war , performing their duty and carrying out significant tasks , so as to allow this policy to be an award and a guide in further arousing enthusiasm in loving the military and learning military skills among the majority of soldiers .  
Lenin said : " Only by being armed with all human knowledge can one become a communist . "  Only the new type of military personnel armed with all human knowledge , especially modern high-science and - technology knowledge , can accomplish our military 's historical mission of prevailing on the battlefield and remaining unchanged in nature .  
If cadres are characterized by a uniform quality structure and simple experiences , with infantry officers not understanding the various branches of the military , cadres of the various branches of the military not understanding the issue of being composite , political cadres not understanding military matters , and military cadres not being able to do political work , such a state of affairs in terms of quality will not meet the requirements of joint operations in the context of informationization .  
This essential character requires that military personnel of the new type should not only become military experts , but also be politically minded , politically sensitive , highly capable of making distinctions on political issues , firm in adhering to ideals and convictions , and pure ideologically and morally .  
At the meeting , Jiang Zemin , on behalf of the party Central Committee , the State Council , and the Central Military Commission , extended warm congratulations to national model military officers transferred to civilian work and to advanced units and workers engaged in work in resettling demobilized officers and extended cordial regards to the military officers to be transferred to civilian work and to those comrades engaged in resettling such military personnel .  
Participating in the national conference were responsible officials of relevant central departments ; responsible official of various provinces , autonomous regions , municipalities directly under the central government , and sub-provincial-level cities ; and responsible officials of the armed forces , the armed police force , and major military units .  
In military affairs , he has advocated a " decisive battle offshore " , increased military spending , intensified the purchase of advanced offensive weapons , and advocated that the United States should " coordinate in the defense of Taiwan " and help Taiwan to resist an " attack " by the mainland .  
The Gulf War and Kosovo War have demonstrated the trend of information war .  The United States has realized that , under the situation of a new military revolution , the pattern of future war will have a qualitative difference from a mechanized war with nuclear weapons .  US military strategy must be adjusted to suit the changing patterns of war .  
The US strategic adjustment is a new round of expansion under the conditions of the development of the political , economic , and military situation in the world and the necessary result of further consolidating the US position of being the sole superpower in the new century .  The defense group of the Bush administration has a strong color of " Cold War fighter " .  The essence of his " new pragmatism " is to use the strong power of the United States as basis to maximize its national interests .  
The new edition of " Military Doctrine " approved by Putin , which opposes NATO 's eastward expansion , has for the first time put forward the viewpoint that Russia 's national security is faced with " the danger of foreign invasion and domestic trouble and the aggravation of outside threat will constitute a military threat " to Russia .  
Under the situation of weakness of comprehensive national strength and being inferior to NATO in conventional forces , nuclear weapons will remain an effective deterrent power of Russia in the future period and the " tower of strength " to support Russia 's desire to be a major military power .  
Russia will raise the quality of training for war preparations .  The two Chechen wars exposed the low level of the Russian military 's preparations for war and its lack of training and other problems .  Therefore , starting last year , the three services of Russia started to reform the military training system , increasing training time and frequency , expanding training scale , and fully utilizing modern high technology to improve the quality of training according to the requirements of the " Military Doctrine " and reform plan .  
The " Russian Weapons and Equipment Development Plan for 2010 " , approved by President Putin early this year , has specifically defined the direction of priority development of weapons and equipment for the Russian military .  The Russian military will adhere to the general principle of " reducing quantity and increasing quality " in the development of weapons .  It will give priority to developing integrated weapon systems with higher capabilities and greater precision that combine reconnaissance , forewarning , command , positioning , attack , and communications .  
The Russian military has actively organized joint air defense exercises and anti-terrorist exercises with countries of the CIS , held military conferences with the CIS , enforced joint air defenses , and helped concerned countries restore radar early warning systems .  The Russian military has also provided countries of the CIS with modern air-defense missile system and warplanes .  Russia and countries of the CIS have now gradually established a unified air defense system and formed an effective defense and deterrent capability .  
Local governments at all levels including their party committees and departments and the party organization at all levels in the military have made many effective contributions to the appropriate resettlement of demobilized military cadres and reform in that resettlement .  They have effectively ensured the smooth implementation of the Party Central Committee 's strategic decision to cut military forces by 500,000 , enhanced the construction of quality in the military , accelerated national economic development and strengthened the social stability as a whole .  
The majority of demobilized military cadres carry forward and promote the excellent traditions and working styles of the people 's army - - struggling with painstaking efforts , striving forward and dedicating themselves to their careers and enthusiastically forging ahead .  The majority made new contributions to the great cause of constructing socialist modernization , have won praise from the party and the people and have added more glories to the people 's army .  
Role models of demobilized military cadres that won awards at this conference are representatives of the excellent demobilized military cadres working in every front line throughout the country .  Their advanced deeds and lofty ideology embody the new spiritual outlook of the majority of demobilized military cadres , being precious spiritual resources .  The entire military should satisfactorily study and vigorously disseminate their deeds and ideology .  
The enthusiastic and hospitable Indian people expressed their cordial and friendly feelings toward the visiting Chinese naval officers and men .  In downtown Bombay , over 1,000 residents warmly applauded the successful performance by the Chinese military band .  
Liu Jinhai , who has just been awarded a national model for demobilized military cadres , said in a deep manner that , when he left the military , he noticed the non-military government at all levels was facing a great deal of pressure dealing with resettling demobilized military cadres and he decided to move forward in his career himself .  
Resettling demobilized military cadres at divisional and regimental levels still remains a focus of discussion among representatives .  Wu Cuiling , director of the Jinzhou Municipal Resettlement Office of Liaoning province , said in an emotional manner that , demobilized military cadres at divisional and regimental levels have dedicated their prime years to the military and to the great cause of safeguarding national security .  They have lofty prestige among officers and soldiers that are still serving in the army .  
Bian Jiagui , deputy director of the Beijing Garrison Command 's Political Department , said that extraordinarily rapid scientific and technological development throughout the world is embodied not only in economic fields but also in military fields .  Military cadres should devote greater efforts to delving into science and technology and continuously improve their abilities in every field .  Only in this way can military cadres set up a solid foundation for being competitive in the non-military sectors after their demobilization .  
President Akayev said cheerfully that the fact that the fruitful activities of the " Shanghai Five " in recent years have drawn the attention of the international community has a lot to do with its growing international prestige in the region and in the world , with our successful solution of problems in the political , military , economic , trade and other spheres , and with the tremendous role we are playing in the protection of regional security .  
After the invasion of terrorists into southern Kyrgyzstan last year , it was a member of the " Shanghai Five " that first provided political , military and technical assistance to the country .  The collective security system of the Commonwealth of Independent States also played a positive part .  At present , the armed forces of Kyrgyzstan are bracing themselves for possible assaults from international terrorist forces .  
All military forces profoundly carried out and implemented the important strategy of administering the military according to the law , through which they have further raised their level of making decisions , administering the military , managing military training and managing soldiers all according to the law and have effectively accelerated ideological and political construction and the comprehensive construction of the military .  
Under the banner of " self defense " , they broke through the " restricted zone " set by the constitution and relevant ordinances .  They have kept engaging in arms expansion .  They have increased their military spending year by year , ignoring long ago the regulation that Japan 's military expenditure is not allowed to exceed 1 percent of its gross national product .  
Both ordinary people and politicians have joined their ranks .  As far as the forms and nature of their activities are concerned , the post-war Japanese rightwing forces are quite similar to the pre-war ones .  They conduct terrorist activities , plot military coup d'etat , suppress progressive forces , strangle the freedom of speech , spare no effort to deny the history of invading China , adhere to the historical point of view of a kingdom , and advocate nationalism .  
To this end , India has designed a series of diplomatic steps : In 1996 , India for the first time joined the Regional Forum of ASEAN and in 2000 , its defense minister paid a visit to Japan and the two countries conducted a joint military exercise in the South China Sea , which has laid a foundation for India to be militarily involved in the South China Sea and signified that India has stridden over the second door in the process of " eastward expansion " .  
The tasks undertaken by the Bureau of Investigation and Analysis which has more than 7,000 staff and more than 70 intelligence stations all over the world are the most mysterious .  In simple terms , it is targeted against neighboring countries and major countries and through means like espionage and reconnaissance to collect and sort out the political , military , and economic intelligence of these countries and provide the most updated research and analysis results to the Government Cabinet of India . Meanwhile , it also possesses certain rebellion-instigating , subversive , and anti-espionage functions .  
Since last year , Japan and India have constantly strengthened their cooperation in military and other fields , established a partnership relationship , conducted many joint military exercises , jointly cracked down on those pirates threatening Japan 's energy passage at sea , and weakened the strategic pressures brought about by China to Japan at sea . 
In mid May , officers from the northwestern operation department under the General Staff Headquarters and the military command academy and specialists in military science jointly organized an operation drill to oppose pro-Taiwan independence forces ' attempt to liberate Taiwan and as an effort to put down their rebellions .  This operation drill was launched with high technology at a simulated battlefield , set up based on the ratio of a real war battlefield .  
The third battle : Naval and air troops crossed beaches for landing .  Paratroops occupied strategic forts while naval and air troops and the Second Artillery Corps used strong firepower to support the attack and prevent foreign troops from eliminating mines , blocking seas , and entering the Taiwan region to join the remaining pro-Taiwan independence forces for military counterattacks .  
In a meeting today with Rupert C . Montanaro , commander of the armed forces of Malta , Chi Haotian , vice chairman of the Central Military Commission , state councilor , and national defense minister , said that developing healthy and lasting military ties between the two countries under the new historic conditions is the common wish of the Chinese and Maltese people .  He was convinced that Sino-Maltese military relations would enter a new stage of development following the commander 's ongoing visit .  
The Ministry of National Defense made public for the first time in 5 June the training of its " special operations " forces through its " Wuhan drill " .  As has been learned , the new joint-branch No . 862 special operations brigade of the Army is the only multipurpose special operations unit of the national army , which is responsible not only for the defense of Taiwan and Penghu but also for the highly confidential task of assaulting military targets behind enemy lines .  
Through the previous period of study , the majority of Party members in the military have obtained a certain level of awareness and understanding of the rich content and political , theoretical and practical meaning of the important thinking of the " three represents " .  However , this important thinking is broad , extensive and profound , with very rich content .  
We should closely associate with the domestic and international situation , military construction and the ideological reality of every individual person .  We should inspect ourselves in accordance with the requirements of the " three represents " , profoundly consider and effectively understand the essence and internal relations of the " three represents " .  We must thoroughly understand the historical background and the era-oriented significance of the " three represents " .  
Only when leaders of Party committees and Party members working for institutions take the lead in profoundly studying , thoroughly comprehending and understanding the important thinking of the " three represents " in light of other aspects can they solve problems met by Party members working for grassroots units and satisfactorily provide military grassroots units with correct and effective guidance in promoting this educational campaign .  
Under new historical conditions and due to the complicated and multi-faceted duties of our various military units in future anti-aggression war , we must abandon the traditional concept of " resisting and attacking enemies face-to-face " in our research and thoroughly study strong opponents who are capable of fighting a high-tech war .  
The social , economic , political , and military moves of any side will affect the reunification of China . The Democratic Progressive Party and Chen Shui-bian authorities are launching the " Taiwan independence " activities and are selling out Taiwan 's interest in collusion with the anti-China forces in the United States and Japan at the cost of making the people on both sides discouraged and disappointed at the peaceful reunification and afraid of the future . 
In the field of the military strategy , with regard to the United States ' national missile defense plan which was widely criticized , this representative figure of the conservatives in the US political circles said that Washington was not subject to the binding force of the " Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty " it signed with the former Soviet Union . He also " guaranteed " that the legislation for the deployment of the NMD system would be completed as soon as possible .  
This important thinking came from practice and guide practice .  Once this important thinking is combined with practice , it will become a powerful spiritual and material strength and will greatly advance construction of party-building and comprehensive military construction .  
To sum up , party members should put the important thinking of the " three represents " into practice in a repetitive and long-term manner , make theory part of their personality and working achievements , so that the overall personal quality of the majority of party members will be greatly improved and the military 's comprehensive construction will advance in leaps and bounds .  
Due to the continuous decline and notable shrink in the transactions of Taipei 's stock market in the previous week , the influence of the upcoming PLA military exercise on Dongshan Island , and the upcoming publication of the various industries ' business income in May , electronic shares did not perform well on 4 June , and Taipei 's stock market opened low and remained low .  Except for financial shares , which registered growth thanks to the support of specific funds , all shares declined .  
US media have also paid great attention to it .  Quoting a US military intelligence official , " Washington Post " said that this military exercise of the PLA held in Fujian 's coast was such a large-scale one that " had not been seen for some time " .  Troops participating in the exercise are as many as nearly four times those in the 1996 large-scale exercise , and US surveillance planes have spotted at least 157 amphibious landing ships and combat cars of the PLA gathered on Dongshan Island .  
Berger was Clinton 's military advisor on foreign affairs and security questions , and was a motivating force for the United States and China developing " relations of strategic partners " .  At present , he still insists that " based on the United States ' principles of democracy and national security , the government is obligated to continue to carry out policies to maintain contact with China in principle " .  
First , as " the Le-cheng Program " is a highly confidential program involving top secrets , Taiwan 's military has had to implement the program without mentioning it in public , and Taiwan 's officers and men involved in the program also know very little about it .  As Taiwan 's media have of late published a series of unfavorable reports on " the Le-cheng Program " , Taiwan 's top brass are concerned that the public will not support the program .  
During his inauguration anniversary interview with the Wall Street Journal , he specifically cited the bitter experiences of leaders in neighboring countries in comparison with his own .  Philippine President Estrada was forced to resign , while the Indonesian President was censured by the national assembly , which also threatens to impeach him .  " Taiwan went through the so-called recall incident but made it through in one piece " and the key was that the military did not have a hand in the political scene as Taiwan kept its fine tradition of military nationalization .  
NSC Consultative Committee Member Ko Chen-heng has seriously considered this issue .  He thinks that the system under which the military 's command authority belongs to the minister of national defense in peacetime and to the chief of the general staff during wartime is dangerous and is faulty in design .  Ko Chen-heng told his friends in private that the only military suggestion that he , as a Consultative Committee member , has given President Chen is : " The command authority in the military command system must be an integral whole and should not be divided " .  
The barracks were surrounded by barbed wire , and orderly parked camouflaged military vehicles and artilleries were clearly visible .  Two seriously looking rifle-holding soldiers stood guard .  Eight big characters in red were written on a wooden plate : " It is forbidden to take pictures in this important military area " !  
It was a clear day with fewer clouds .  Sea gulls were flying close to the water .  Dark green military tents were already set up on the beach , surrounded by a dozen or so military vehicles .  
Zhu Zhaofa , office director of Dongshan County 's " frontline supply station " , said that during the military exercise , the planned economy model under the market economic system is implemented for Dongshan Island 's material supply .  While ensuring unchanged prices for the residents , more materials are provided for the army under a preferential scheme .  
US domestic and foreign policies will definitely have a tremendous effect on the world because of the United States ' superpower status in the world .  In particular , the readjustment of US military strategy will not be limited to US security only .  We can see that the political scheme and economic needs from that readjustment will have a major impact on the international political structure and strategic environment of the entire 21st century .  
They won 8 medals for achievements in special military skills competition and in " " revolutionization , modernization , regularization " , meritorious service reward for 51 man-times , and two distinguished honors of winning the titles of " advanced regiment in scientific and technological training " and " advanced regiment in overall construction " .  
The military region party committee , maintaining that these personnel should contribute their talents and services to developing ways and means for winning future warfare , decided to turn them into highly proficient military personnel during the course when the armed forces were engaged in science and technology training .  
Then , aside from assigning the personnel with doctorate or master 's degrees to units with modern equipment and positions that require scientific and technical expertise , the region also gave them important military assignments to accomplish , or assigned them to oversee projects of tackling difficult operational and training problems .  
and four Armed Forces Awards for Scientific and Technological Advancement , Third Class . Tao Qian , an officer with a doctorate degree in science of military campaigns , recently demonstrated his ability in the base that the military region built for combined campaign training exercises .  His remarkable performance in teaching the theory of organized campaigns and directing a real exercise has made him the pacesetter of the military region in providing the armed forces with science and technology training .  
As joint operations waged under modern conditions involve a large number of precision-guided weapons , intelligent weapons , as well as the C4ISR system , which serves as " nerves and brains " for different weapons systems and military command systems , concentration of military strength is now increasingly dependent upon a commander 's enormous potential unleashed via an information system , and upon a perfect integration of different weapons systems and information systems .  
However , since he took office , he has failed to honor his commitment .  To consolidate his political base , he has been blindly playing up to the interests of the conservative forces , the rich , and large enterprises , especially of the military industrial enterprises , in the financial budget and taxation policy , education policy , social security policy , environment policy , and on a series of other issues .  
After the Kosovo war , the United States military and congress unanimously affirmed the policy decision to , after the Gulf war , strengthen the improvement and production of geographic information and precision guidance weapons .  At the same time , they decided , beginning in the year 2000 , to increase by $ 1.2-billion every year the money provided to install global satellite navigation reception equipment on more joint direct attack weapons , joint weapon-launching systems outside defensive areas , and bombs and missiles of joint voice channel monitoring weapons .  
The military branches of other NATO nations , at the same time as they are reforming and strengthening their geographic information assurance , also want to increase the number of equipment retrofit kits adaptable to the NAVSTAR GPS on their missiles , bombs , weapon-launching platforms , electronic surveillance and intelligence systems - - in accordance with the demands of United States military joint combat - - to heighten the global positioning and navigation level of various kinds of munitions .  
In carrying out ideological and political education in the military , it is necessary to focus on the reality of the primate phase of socialism and the objective existence of the socialist market economy , to be responsive to society 's diversified development , to grasp the mainstream and essence , and to work hard to utilize , incorporate , exploit , and develop positive factors .  
In carrying out ideological and political education , the military must adhere to the main melody , vigorously advocate patriotism , collectivism , and the spirit of sacrifice , adhere to the purpose of serving the people whole-heartedly , adhere to principles of materialism , resolutely fight against idealism and feudal superstitions as well as decadent bourgeois lifestyles and various erroneous currents of thought and phenomena .  
Therefore , in carrying out ideological and political education , the military should focus on characteristics and special features , in the process of developing or discarding ideas or ethical standards existing in society in a pluralistic context .  
In carrying out ideological and political education in the military , it is necessary to implement the strategic policy for the new period and to closely center on the requirements of military struggle , working to provide sustained , adequate spiritual motive force for " being able to win " .  
To aim ideological and political education at the war time , it is first of all necessary to intensify education on war-readiness in response to the prevailing situation to guide officers and soldiers , so that they will profoundly understand the importance and urgency of getting prepared for military struggle and educating officers and soldiers to make them understand that hegemonism is now rampant , that " Taiwan independence " forces are increasingly rampant , that there has been a continual tension at the Taiwan Strait , and that there are increasing uncertainties about " peaceful unification " .  
It is necessary to rectify guiding thinking on education , to set education objectives , to arrange education contents , and to improve the education system on the basis of closely centering on the implementation of the military strategic policy for the new period , so as to form an education mechanism suited for prevailing in contemporary warfare and to ensure that the military is capable of accomplishing the sacred mission of resisting aggression and maintaining the country 's unity and territorial integrity .  
It is necessary to fully explore scientific and technological strengths on the basis of accommodating characteristics of information society and to build the military 's internal network of information on political education and make such a network operational as soon as possible , so as to reduce the number of levels and simplify procedures to ensure that education can keep up on a timely basis , respond rapidly , work effectively , and produce real results .  
The ministers held that the fruitful military cooperation between the SCO member states sets a good example of a new kind of regional military cooperation suitable to modern trends in the post-Cold War era .  It is not only conducive to promoting long-term and healthy development of friendly relations and cooperation between SCO member states , but also of great significance to safeguarding regional and world peace and stability .  
The ministers unanimously agree that the fruitful military cooperation based on that of the " Shanghai Five " has set an example for establishing new-type regional military cooperation commensurate with the trend of the times after the Cold War , which is not only conducive to promoting the long-term healthy development of the friendly and cooperative relations among the member nations of the " Shanghai Cooperation Organization " but also is of great significance to maintaining peace and stability in the region and even the world at large .  
After the Bush administration came to power , it treated Russia as " the number one potential opponent " of the United States . It showed an extreme distrust of the Putin government and expressed strong disapproval of Russia 's developing military cooperation with Iran in addition to restoring and strengthening its relationships with some former Soviet Union allies .  
The sovereignty of each newly independent country , even the political stability of the whole region , are threatened by the continuous illegal Chechnya military terrorist acts , the long-lasting Afghan war , the influence of Islamic fundamentalism and the chaotic drug and arms smuggling .  The furious terrorism , separatism and extremism especially endanger the region .  
The Summit attendees unanimously proposed " zero tolerance of separatism , ethnic separatism and religious extremism , " and wrote the proposal that " each member state should adopt measures to combat the international terrorism , organized crimes , arm smuggling , drug trafficking and other transnational criminal activities " in the first joint charter .  It centered the " Shanghai Five " cooperation on the experiment of establishing an effective security cooperation framework instead of its initial goal of accomplishing border military trust and disarmament .  
" Shanghai Five " has played an important role in abolishing border military confrontation among the member states , building up military trust , resolving the border leftover problems , jointly preventing multinational criminal activities , controlling drug and arms smuggling and jointly cracking down on the international evil forces ever since its founding five years ago .  These engagements have become the reason and the strength for the existence of " Shanghai Five " and for the consolidation of its mechanism .  
It is learned that because of the wide gap in the ratio of investment in offensive and defensive weapons , the national army is actively developing " defensive deterrence weapons system , " including secret development of the medium-range ballistic missile with a firing range from 1,000 and 2,000 kilometers , code-named " Tiching . " The army has reported the whole program to President Chen Shui-bian , who has asked the military to develop it as a priority key project .  
Information from military sources has disclosed that the development program of the medium-range ballistic missile , undertaken by the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology [ CIST ] , is a top secret .  Very few officials in the military know about it .  However , some foreign think tank personages have verified it from the Ministry of Defense [ MND ] officials , and there are signs that the number of people who are aware of the program is increasing .  
After the change of the government in March last year , President Chen Shui-bian began inspecting various military headquarters .  When hearing confidential briefings at the CIST on the morning of 4 July , he " confined " the media at the underground " news room . "  Although the journalists were promised that they could view the first half of President Chen 's speech by a closed circuit television broadcast , the video and audio signals were completely cut off after the president spoke just two sentences .  
In discussing the bilateral military relationship , Chi Haotian said the Chinese armed forces are very positive regarding developing friendly relations with the British armed forces , with the frequent high-level exchanges of visits between the two countries ' armed forces in recent years , and constant progress in each area of cooperation and exchange .  
It is for this reason that Comrades Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin , respectively the core of the first three generations of the leadership group of the Party Central Committee , published at crucial moments in the revolution and construction important speeches on " the current situation and the task , " comprehensively and correctly analyzed the domestic and international situation at that time and educated the Party , the military and the people .  
In light of this situation , the office has pooled its backbone technical personnel .  After more than one year of hard work to overcome key problems , they have developed a new type of missile for military training .  Compared with regular missiles , these missiles for military training purpose are low in manufacturing cost .  They can be used several thousand times .  Therefore , they are highly welcomed by military units .  
At the Second CPC Congress of the Arms Department of the General Staff Department , which was convened on 19 June , Fu Quanyou , member of the Central Military Commission and chief of the General Staff Department , stressed : The units of various arms are set to assume arduous tasks , heavy responsibilities , and glorious missions in a new era , in which the PLA forces will push forward a modernization drive in an all-round way , and speed up preparations for a military struggle .  
We must push forward " four innovations " with persistent efforts , namely , innovating in theories , contents , methods , and systems , and work hard to bring about a breakthrough in our military theories , operational guidance , and basic tactics .  We must energetically press ahead in an all-round way our activities of training troops through science and technology , and popularize and upgrade such activities as well .  In training our troops through science and technology , we must also work hard to translate achievements into fighting capacity .  
It is not a special case .  With the many favorable conditions , the Chen Shui-bian administration has speedily entered a stage of good diplomatic relations with the United States . On the contrary , the new politically powerful in Washington had a poor opinion of the Chinese Communists , which greatly deteriorated further after the Chinese Communists ' handling of the military plane collision incident caused ill feelings among the American people .  
The US Defense Department recently submitted a study report to Congress which emphasized that in order to meet the requirements of future war , the US military should attach importance to integrating the combat strength of all branches of the armed forces and organize a combined rapid strike force , so as to make the command system smoother and strike action faster and more effective !  
It is learned that prior to these additions , CCTV had established nine major channels covering news , economics , comprehensive literary and art , international events , sports , movie , children , military , agriculture , television dramas , and English programs .  
It was learned that the zhongshan Institute of Science and Technology has secretly developed " Taiwan 's Tomahawk " cruise missiles designed for striking at targets 1,000 kilometers away , and the missiles have already been tested for hitting targets several hundred kilometers away .  Launched in different ways , " Taiwan 's Tomahawk " cruise missiles are capable of hitting various highly valuable military targets along the mainland coast within nearly 1,000 kilometers from Taiwan .  
the fact that the United Daily News disclosed the military 's covert research and development of the " Hsiung-feng II-E " cruise missile , Major General David Soong , vice president of the Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology , yesterday attended a press conference held by the Ministry of National Defense . He explained during the conference that the " Hsiung-sheng Project " is a project of the Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology aimed at improving the Hsiung-feng II-E anti-ship missile , as well as increasing its accuracy , intercept capability and destructive power .  
Especially since the beginning of the 1990 ' s , with the continuous progress of the domestic and international situation and the magnificent cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the central leadership collective of the party with Jiang Zemin as the core has adhered to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , and made new explorations in practice and a new summarization in theory of many major economic , political , cultural , military , and diplomatic issues , thus enriching and developing Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
The mainland 's military media reported yesterday that the Air Force fleet of the Nanjing Military Region recently conducted an airborne long-distance contingency drill based on actual battle requirements .  The troops overcame difficulties arising from changes in weather conditions and an unfamiliar flight route and airport , and carried out a remarkable mock attack on the " enemy 's " radar , thereby realizing a successful first-entry , first-discovery , first-attack , and first-hit .  
Through this campaign , officers and solders have profoundly understood that the party 's absolute leadership over the military is determined by the nature of our military .  It is crucial for the life of our military and fundamental for the victory of our military .  This campaign has further consolidated the determination of officers and soldiers to continuously advance the military modernization construction under the leadership of the party .  
Cadres of naval and air forces have organized for party members and cadres , in light of the six-point requirements proposed by the General Department of Politics on maintaining the advanced nature of party members , to identify their weaknesses in ideological and political qualities and scientific , technological and cultural abilities , and strengthen the military 's sense of the urgency and responsibilities for advancing the military construction .  
All military forces closely united this educational campaign with the practical struggle and the reality of the thinking of officers and soldiers and distinguishing the right and wrong regarding crucial and major issues .  
A division of Jinan Military Area Command regarded strengthening the leadership over ideological and political work as an important responsibility of party committees .  In light of the rapid development in the international and domestic situations as well as with frequent occurrence of crucial issues , this division promptly analyzed the ideological trend of the military , and adhered to the system according to which leading cadres give reports on the situation , answer questions that officers and soldiers are generally concerned about and use decisions made by the party Central Committee to unite thinking .  
On the basis of this training and with the guidance of departments concerned under the fleet , they made bold efforts in giving up the previous drill pattern of " hitting dead targets . "  Instead , they used mobile target ships that can change direction and speed to simulate the movement of " enemy " ships .  As a result , they have greatly enhanced the difficulty in military drills .  
do a good job of the logistic work in the preparations for military struggle and of logistic reform and innovation with high demands and the spirit of the speech as the base , by centering on the party 's objective of endeavor and historical mission in the new century , and in line with the requirements set by the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission , and realize adequate logistic support in real terms ;  
We must meet the general requirements of building armed forces that are " qualified politically and competent militarily and has a fine style of work , strict discipline and adequate logistic support , " and follow the military strategy for the new era as our overriding guideline .  We must stress the quality of army-building and strengthen our armed forces by relying on science and technology and run the army according to law in an effort to build the People 's Liberation Army into a strong , modern and revolutionary regular army .  
Those advanced collectives and outstanding individuals are from enterprises , rural areas , organizations , schools , scientific research institutes , neighborhoods , military and other fronts .  Their advanced deeds and noble spirit have embodied the character , styles and features of contemporary members of the CPC with clear characteristics of our time .  
In conducting their respective theoretical study , ideological and political education , and political theory course teaching , the central study groups of party committees , armed forces , and military academies and schools must allot special time to organize the study of General Secretary Jiang 's important speech and properly unify the thinking and understanding of officers and soldiers on major issues so that they will willingly maintain a high degree of ideological and political unity with the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
It is a rather complete system of science in the aspects of philosophy , political economy , and scientific socialism and covers the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnic , military , foreign affairs , united front , and party building aspects .  It is also a system of science to be further enriched and developed in all aspects .  
An expert working on a certain base of the General Armament Department said that faced with new situations and tasks , scientific researchers must strive to realize the important ideology of the " Three Represents , " to occupy the main battle position of the world 's advanced military scientific and technological development , and to become the advanced representatives for the modernization construction and development of the weapons and equipment of the Chinese Army .  
During a discussion session , officers and men of the " Indomitable Company , " recalling the achievements scored thanks to the close care given by the party 's three generations of leaders , said that they must carry forward the " indomitable spirit , " train hard , strive to gain high-tech military knowledge , acquire tough amphibious landing skills , undertake the sacred mission , increase glory to the party flag , and add luster to the military banner .  
the proportion of the gross industrial product made up of dominant products , high-tech products and technical products for both military and civilian use rising to 40 percent from the current approximately 30 percent ;  
According to what is understood , for more than 20 years China 's national defense science and technology industry has gradually realized a transformation from an industry that produces industrial products for military use only , to one that produces products that integrate military and civilian use .  Every industry within the military industrial complex has fundamentally formed a developmental pattern with professional characteristics for products for the civilian industry .  
Launching a psychological offensive in conjunction with military action and breaking down the enemies ' morale through applying psychological pressure that leads to their defeat and to the seizing of the initiative in a war has been a favorite method embraced by both Chinese and foreign military thinkers both ancient and modern times .  
and it was a programmatic document guiding us in the new millennium to comprehensively promote the party 's construction of grand new projects , and to comprehensively promote the grand cause of the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics .  The troops throughout the entire military must thoroughly understand the vital significance of General Secretary Jiang 's speech , make studying and implementing the speech a significant political mission and a long term strategic mission , and lose no time in firmly grasping these missions .  
Analyzing the issue in the context of international strategy , how could the United States guarantee that the reconnaissance plane with sophisticated equipment would not take pictures of important military facilities along the coast and carry out " legal espionage mission " once it was permitted to cross China 's territorial airspace ?  Moreover , without regard to China 's strong objection , the United States had resumed its spying mission in the air space of South China and said that it would continue to do so .  
As disclosed by an informed source , US Secretary of State Colin Powell will be visiting Beijing around 20 July to repair the battered bilateral relations after the military plane collision incident and the US arms sales to Taiwan and to pave the way for President Bush 's official visit to China this October . He will establish with the Chinese side the general direction and main agenda of the summit meeting , and the Chinese side will recommend to the US side Bush 's specific itinerary at the request of the United States . 
Beijing 's top hierarchy recently stated its formulation on the relaxation of Sino-US relations .  It noted that as proven by facts , the Chinese government is becoming more and more mature in its handling of major international affairs , as in its crossing of swords with the United States over the military plane collision , stressing that the Chinese government has maintained national sovereignty , dignity and interests while preventing a serious impact and damage on Sino-US relations as a whole .  
The cadre center of the city military sub-district has exploited its advantage of having many politically steadfast veteran cadres and organized and sent its personnel to veteran cadres ' activity centers in urban and rural areas and to neighborhoods to publicize and explain the thinking of " three-represents , " and to encourage veteran cadres to advocate advanced culture .  
In the face of the worst flood since the founding of New China , leading members of the Guangxi regional party committee and the regional government personally went to the front line to direct the work of combating the flood .  More than 100,000 military servicemen and people have been organized to reinforce the dikes .  After overcoming various kinds of difficulties , they built more than 10 kilometers of auxiliary dikes within two days .  
All military units and armed police units should offer assistance to areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups , old revolutionary base areas , border areas , and areas bogged down in serious poverty in the central and western parts of the country .  
The circular requires that all military units provide more technological , educational , cultural , and medical support to the people in poor areas , thus helping them develop the ability to shake off poverty and get rich .  
Military schools and academies and military scientific research institutes should use their favorable conditions to pass scientific knowledge to the people in poor areas , transfer scientific and technological achievements to production , spread the use of advanced techniques , help the masses to master science and technology and thus build up their ability to develop the economy .  
The KMT 's confederation proposition reads : " The party , on the basis of abiding by the National Unification Outlines and the 1992 consensus about ' one China , with each side of the strait having the freedom to define its meaning , ' seeks to establish a peaceful and stable cross-strait relationship , build a mechanism governing mutual trust in the military sphere , and build the Taiwan Strait into a zone of peace .  
A rapid response unit will join in the military exercise for the first time .  The special armed unit whose members were transferred from the Beijing Theater 's certain group army , has accomplished various assault training missions in northern China over the last two years .  The unit has been airlifted to the Fuzhou Theater by Russia-made IL-76 transport planes to join in live-fire training .  In addition , the airborne force is now in a predetermined area awaiting orders .  The marine corps has also sent a task force to take part in the war drill .  
The magazine says that in the planned military exercise , the PLA will use the following hi-tech weapons : Feibao medium range fighter-bombers , IL-76 transport planes , Zhi-9 armed helicopters , modern class warships , Kilo class submarines , Dongfeng - 15 tactical ballistic missiles , 63A tanks , S-300PMU1 air-defense missiles , Daoer M1 air-defense missiles , and red earth shells .  
According to military sources , Chen zhen-xiang , taking a handful of Army General Headquarters officers with him , left for a secret visit to Europe on 30 June . At least Germany , Austria and Switzerland were included in his itinerary .  It is believed that he visited some of the host countries ' army units to get acquainted with the current situation of their army-building efforts and learn from their experience in the use of wheel-type armored vehicles and tactical wheel-type vehicles .  
Zhang Qiyue said , as everyone knows , China practices a peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , and its military expenditure has always been at a low level among major world powers .  
It is quite unreasonable for Japan to make wild comments about China 's normal national defense construction in an official publication such as its " Defense White Paper , " and this does not help to promote mutual understanding and trust between the two countries in the military security field .  
With regard to the means of commanding armament , the military region has developed an applicable software for the armament command system of group armies and built an initial automatic command system for armament for field operations that is linked to field operation command and coordinated with logistical support .  
Making full use of the powerful position of junior military academies and strengthening ideological and political education among the children and youth so that they will foster from childhood the fine quality of loving the party , the motherland , the people , and the army and give them training in acquiring a patriotic spirit of a high degree , a strong sense of national defense , a strong will , and strong physique is a major issue that has a bearing on the future of China 's socialist modernization .  
The provincial military district system , in accordance with relevant regulations at a national level and in the military , integrate political education , organization and rectification , military training , recruitment work , and major holiday and commemoration activities , accomplishing national defense of civilian militia reserves .  
The party , government , military , and civilian must pool their efforts , coordinate closely , and expand in a deep and sustained way the advertisement of the " National Defense Education Law " , creating a fine social atmosphere that all people will focus on , be concerned with , and support .  
They have also dispatched the fleet to the sea to conduct test training in different sea areas and under different weather conditions .  They have successively completed more than 30 difficult training courses , including replenishment in rocky areas at night , round-the-clock comprehensive supplies from all directions , replenishment in strong waves and winds , and joint logistical replenishment tasks by military and civilian vessels .  
To increase the rapid response capability of the base for accidental events on the sea , the base 's logistics leaders and units have vigorously developed the maritime emergency support services .  They have organized emergency support subunits out of defense logistics , arms and equipment , and military supply departments .  They have equipped them with light and advanced logistic facilities as well as conducted special training for them so that they can promptly provide maritime logistical support on receipt of an order .  
The foundation of the two countries ' complementary and mutually beneficial economic , trade , and military relationship is solid ; China is Russia 's sixth largest trading partner , and Russia is China 's ninth ; last year their bilateral trade totalled $ 8 billion .  
Over the past three years , by accepting and resettling a total of 4,008 demobilized military cadres , as well as 270 camp families , the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has successfully completed the state-assigned resettlement task and basically attained the goal of making the armed forces , the local authorities , and the demobilized cadres feel satisfied .  
The US military maintains that in order to secure a victory in a ground offensive campaign , the US ground force should build mobile units capable of fighting and encircling an enemy in a vertical way .  
The MND organized more than 100 officers to participate in the operation of the " Lecheng " plan , which includes many plans and special projects and requires a wide range of cooperation .  Frequent meetings every month enabled US officers on active service to visit all Taiwan 's sensitive and important military areas , such as the Air Force Operation Command , the Army 's missile bases , and the Navy submarine base , and to conduct field investigations of the coastal areas where the Chinese communists may conduct landing .  
The US military has also assisted the Army to establish an " electronic warfare battalion " in secret .  It has leased all the necessary electronic warfare equipment and delivered to the Army a set of mobile equipment , which is the most advanced equipment in service .  The US military plans to deliver five sets of such equipment to Taiwan .  
These people naturally bear a grudge against the armed forces or the government .  Since military personnel have their deep-rooted political belief and ideology , the top military and intelligence leaders are taking communist China 's military united front work plan for the recruitment of our retired servicemen very seriously .  The unit concerned has in fact identified a certain retired army lieutenant general as a possible hidden target of military united front work by the Chinese communists , as he has been seeking advantage for himself by all means on the mainland .  
To cope with the situation as quickly as possible , the government should increase high-technology weapons , get rid of the thinking of symmetrical operations , change the current situation in which the army amounts to a higher proportion in the three armed forces , and implement as quickly as possible the tactic of downsized troops .  In this way , the situation in which outlays for personnel maintenance accounts for half the annual defense budget and eats up the military investment budget can be avoided and fighting capability will be intensified .  
Rumsfeld has indicated on numerous occasions that , although Europe 's importance to the US remains unchanged , with the break up of the Soviet Union the military threat that the US faces in Europe has been greatly reduced , and the eastward expansion of NATO has also clearly increased NATO 's strategic depth , resulting in a great improvement in the security environment of the European allies , and at present the likelihood of war breaking out on the European continent is far less than in Asia .  
While it will still take time for the United States to build NMD , its firm intention to deploy a missile defense system in pursuit of absolute military superiority is having an increasingly marked negative impact on the international strategic order .  It will undoubtedly undermine the global strategic balance , triggering a new arms race .  
Shuai Hwa-min pointed out that , speaking of this current phase , Taiwan-US military exchanges certainly have their necessity and importance , but this kind of exchange , rather , is not the kind which can generate a military alliance and actual troop joint military exercises , which is what the people of the nation are hoping for .  The biggest key factor is that the two sides are nations without diplomatic relations .  Therefore , future Taiwan-US military exchanges will continue to be low key , but they will be conducted in an essentially advancing way .  
According to " New York Times , " the US Department of Defense recently decided to make a major adjustment in its military strategy , replacing the strategy of " fighting and winning two major wars simultaneously " implemented since 1991 with a new strategy requiring troops to " win a decisive victory " in a major regional war and , at the same time , maintain sufficient capability to fulfill other important tasks .  
The US military has to spend a huge amount of fund to sustain the armed forces capable of fighting " two wars . "  This strategy requires that the United States maintain at least 1.4-million troops on active service .  Even with such a massive army , the Pentagon has to admit , the United States can only undertake less than a half of the war tasks .  
In the purpose of military buildup , it will strive to build an army " more compact in scale , quicker in response , more flexible in action , more accurate in attack , tighter in defense , faster in deployment , and more effective in support , " which " will have absolute supremacy over all future threats , including opponents equipped with weapons of mass destruction . "  
Guam is about 1,500 nautical miles from the Philippines . The US deployment of massive forces at this important " strategic supporting point " reflects the strategic thinking of the new Bush administration and will be conducive to launching a long-distance precision attack against the mainland 's coastal regions by US military within 12 hours .  
The military exercises staged there by Communist China will be conducive to practicing a cross-region combined battle of the three services and testing the rapid mobilization system in the local region without interfering with the overall situation of economic development of the southeast region .  
The province has fully exploited the material support provided for coastal defense and security management by rapid economic development .  Drawing on science and technology , Jiangsu has abandoned the past method of simply relying on patrols and inspections of beaches .  Instead , the province has included public order , production , transit , ships , ports , and military facilities in coastal areas into the land-sea-air comprehensive management system .  
Lianyungang and other localities have brought into full play the role of high-tech facilities of military bases in the field of coastal defense surveillance and have built and improved a multilevel surveillance and intelligence network for the sea and coastal regions ( including islands ) .  This has enhanced the coastal defense monitoring capability in ocean and territorial airspace , not merely restricted to coastal beaches , thus solving the difficult problem in coastal defense management .  
In order to ensure harbor safety and a smooth navigation channel during wartime , the unit made full use of local fishing vessels in their preparations for military struggles and regarded conducting joint military-civilian sea drills to " launch counterattacks on small-scale enemies " an important study subject .  After repeated deliberations and verifications , the unit drew up a plan to build a combined formation of corvettes and armed fishing vessels and lay down the principle for allocating men and equipment .  
We have a system to establish political commissioners and political institutions .  We also have a system to base Party branches on the military units at the company level .  The availability of and the adherence to these systems enables our military to ensure the military remains under the Party 's firm control despite the dynamic historical conditions and constant changes in members of the military .  
The system according to which the leading commander of a military unit is responsible for this unit and which stipulates that this unit should be under the collective leadership of the Party committee of this unit as well ? is a way to carry out the democratic centralization system in the military ; it is the fundamental system for adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership over the military and is an effective mechanism for Party committees to lead military forces .  
At a certain place in eastern China , a hunter chasing an animal in a dense forest suddenly came upon a sight that stopped him in his path : A unit of soldiers , wearing green berets , herb-spot camouflage uniforms , and white armbands were charging toward him , along with scores of tanks in camouflage ; the tanks were not displaying the " 1st August army emblem " but a triangular military emblem .  The hunter ran as fast as he could .  
Because the " Red Army " and the " Blue Army " compete with each other without knowing the other side 's manpower deployment , battle approaches , and tactical motives , their tactical training has therefore altered from a unilateral combined training to a realistic actual-troops confrontation , thus changing the mode of our military 's exercise , in which the " Red Army " used to win every battle .  
The large-scale sci-tech military exercises have made many achievements using new experiments , such as combined operations drills , internet warfare against directorate organizations , rapid reaction training of artillerymen , training in offshore composite formation by numerous naval vessels , mobile launch training for missile troops , and others .  
Many large-scale military exercises have shown the newest achievements that China 's military has obtained from the traditional " three attacks and three defenses " - - attacking tanks , planes , and airborne troops , and defending against nuclear , chemical , and biological attacks - - to the " new three attacks and three defenses " of attacking stealth aircraft , cruise missiles , and helicopter gun ships , and defending against precision strikes , electronic jamming , and reconnaissance and surveillance .  
On this occasion , on the issue of biological weapons , the Bush Administration uses the excuse that the stipulations of the draft agreement of the protocol , regarding verification and inspection , might threaten US commercial and military secrets , leading to the adoption of an opposition standpoint , in total disregard for the appeals and great efforts of the international community ; this has once again demonstrated that the Bush Administration is determined to obstinately cling to its course and disregard the opposition of the international community .  
The psychological and electronic warfare troops established recently by the PLA coordinated for the first time the operations of military reconnaissance satellites over the Taiwan Strait . The second stage was " combined forces of the navy , the army and the air force crossing the Strait and carrying out landing operations , " which mostly consisted of guided missile attacks and other methods .  This illustrates the fact that the manner adopted by the PLA to attack Taiwan has switched from one of a " sea-borne landing " to " airborne raids " and other varieties .  
Su Zhirong : In the new era , the PLA has set implementation of military combat preparedness as the primary objective of modernization , with the armed forces building the " two fundamental transitions , " that is : in military combat preparedness , making the transition from dealing with combat situations under normal conditions to achieving victory in combat under conditions of modern technology , especially high technology ;  
China uses its military power to ensure a safe and secure domestic and foreign environment for our national economic construction and reform and opening up , to protect our national interest , national dignity and international prestige .  These all fall into the category of a self-protection strategy .  
The PLA General Logistics Department , acting in line with state laws and army regulations , conducted checks on 82,000 vehicles with military license plates , and recovered a number of stolen , expired , and fake military license plates , thereby deterring criminal groups from committing illegal activities that undermine the army vehicles ' legitimate interests .  
It also has a bearing on the rise or fall of the Chinese nation .  It will also determine whether or not our army can always become the effective tool to fulfill the Party 's political tasks under the new situation .  Therefore , to continuously arm our army with military equipment of advanced technology , enhance our army 's fighting power , and fulfill the Party 's highest political requirements in " fighting to win " should be our army 's basic task in upholding the Party 's absolute leadership over the army under the new situation .  
Efforts must be made to step up our efforts in carrying out reform in the army and strengthening army building .  We must continuously develop high technology in order to enhance fighting power by training more skilled professionals , improving military equipment , reforming the military structure , and carrying out major high-tech military drills .  All this is aimed at turning our army into a mighty army that will remain invincible in future warfare and live up to the expectation of our Party and the people .  
Over 60 qualified military and technical personnel and 34 university students who were from the current term entered the base and settled down , while scores of directing and dispatching personnel pursued advanced studies in colleges and institutes .  
At the same time , in line with the features of the establishment of external units , the base has provided the " Blue Army " with infantry , artillery , armored , engineering , chemical , communication , electronic confrontation , and helicopter troops - - which form a joint training command headquarters with the air force and the army aviation unit - - and has copied military drills and training conducted by powerful adversaries . 
Over the past few years , the Central Military Commission and the General Departments have implemented a series of significant measures and devoted even greater efforts to rewarding excellent military professionals .  For example , awards were established and issued for significant technical achievements and for military professionals who excelled in a variety of fields .  Senior specialists are treated according to higher standards .  
The verdict that metes out the heavy punishment points out that Ji Shengde , in addition to accepting huge amounts of bribes from Lai Changxing , could not explain the sources of his assets that valued at tens of millions of Hong Kong dollars , broke the rules set for military intelligence operations , and used enormous amounts of public funds without authorization .  
He said , developing good neighborly and friendly relations between the DPRK and Russia is in the fundamental interests of both countries , and there are tremendous potentials for bilateral cooperation in the economic , military , and cultural fields .  
Jiang Zemin emphasized that the general task of the whole party and the whole armed forces is to meet the needs of the new international situation in the new century , gain more relatively peaceful time to develop the economy , science , technology and military to a new level , and increase the comprehensive national strength .  Only in this way will it be possible to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity better and this is the strategic policy .  
Since the 1991 Gulf War , the US and British aircraft have been flying on patrol missions in two " no-fly zones , " set up over the north and south of Iraq respectively , frequently striking at various civilian and military targets in Iraq , and resulting in losses in human life and property .  
An official of US Defense Department who asked not to be named said on 10 August that the United States hoped to establish with Russia complete , normal , and friendly relations in the economic , political , military , and other fields , as a solid foundation for security and stability , and that , in this process , the two countries will simultaneously recede from the " ABM Treaty . "  
To win a local war under the future high-tech conditions , the PLA has actively carried out weaponry and military restructuring and changed its training contents and methods , with a view to increasing high-tech weaponry , improving the quality of troops , and enhancing its troops ' quick reaction ability .  
On 7 and 8 August , the Russian military delegation headed by Colonel General Yuri Baluyevsky , first deputy chief of Russia 's general staff , and the US military delegation headed by Douglas Feith , undersecretary of defense for policy , held a two-day meeting in the US Pentagon . At the end of the meeting , they issued a brief statement , saying that the delegations of the two countries held a " substantive discussion " on an extensive scope of issues concerning strategic stability and international security .  
An unidentified official of the US Defense Department said on 10 August that the United States hoped to establish all-round normal and friendly relations in the economic , political , and military fields with Russia as a solid foundation for security and stability , and hoped that both sides would agree to withdraw from the ABM Treaty at the same time .  
The " Ordinance " stresses : The development of an automated command system must be organized and carried out according to military needs .  It is necessary to adhere to the thought of integrative development , unify leadership , unify planning , unify the technical structure , effect scientific organization and close cooperation , emphasize practical results , and ensure quality .  
It is precisely these two " leaps " that have provided vast room for the development of the Japanese armed forces .  Thus , the self-defense forces are developing in the direction of long-range and massive weapons .  Moreover , Japan has joined hands with the United States to push ahead with the development of the Theater Missile Defense system in a bid to achieve absolute military superiority with which it " can both attack other countries and avoid attacks from them . "  
The ongoing large-scale military exercise " Liberation No 1 " in Fujian 's Dongshan Island entered its third stage of " making counterattack and hitting reinforcements " a few days ago .  Two Sovremenny-class warships imported from Russia joined the combat groups in a combined exercise of attacking an aircraft carrier , and two live Sunburn missiles were fired for the first time .  
Given this , in order to divert public attention from domestic economic issues , allow himself a breathing spell , and win more time for working out new economic policies , Junichiro Koizumi deemed it necessary to create some political , diplomatic , and military news , and this is nothing but an old trick favored by some Japanese politicians .  
Cadres and soldiers did penetrating research on foreign military equipment and discovered that , considering the defensive and maneuvering capabilities of modern armed helicopters , ordinary light weapons definitely can not shoot them down easily .  
Borrowing from the military region signal regiment 's achievements in the scientific and technical training of troops , the group army 's signal elements overcame the difficulty of insufficient amounts of equipment and materials , and scientifically conducted " three defenses " training in defending against enemy reconnaissance and surveillance , defending against enemy electronic jamming , and defending against an enemy 's precise attacks .  
and attempted to sever the kinship forged with blood , which is thicker than water , between the people on two sides .  As if that is not enough , the Taiwan authorities have time and time again spent the hard-earned money of the general public in buying advanced weapons from abroad .  They advocate " fighting a decisive battle outside our borders " and wish to enter into a military alliance with the United States and Japan against the mainland .  
The Jinan Military Region especially held a training class for retiring political commissars at rest homes and some retired veteran cadres in order to have sufficient backbone instructors to guide the study by veteran cadres of the entire military region .  
To align the personal quality of these professional soldiers with the requirements of the rank of nomcom as soon as possible , people who have obtained the rank of noncom must understand their position and role in military construction , be aware of their duties and have a strong sense of urgency regarding learning information about organization , training , and education and about administrating soldiers , so as to improve their overall quality in the military and in political fields .  
For the sake of ensuring the unity of our motherland , the Chinese armed forces are perfectly capable of monitoring fixed and moving targets along the southeastern coast and nearby waters , to spot , track , and identify medium-sized and larger military vessels .  They are capable of anytime , all-weather monitoring of large warships ( mainly aircraft carriers ) .  
actively organize and encourage both army troops and militia reserves to plunge themselves in the current large-scale development of the country 's western region ; take up urgent , difficult , dangerous , and heavy tasks on our own initiative ; and strive for dual effects of promoting economic development and consolidating the defense building in line with the principle of manufacturing products for both peacetime and wartime use and for both military and civilian use .  
Then , under Helen 's command , the US special mixed fleet turned and fled toward the open waters .  In 1996 , when the PLA conducted a military exercise including test-firing its guided missiles , the United States also sent aircraft carriers to the Taiwan Strait . After the PLA 's nuclear submarines departed from their military port and disappeared in the vast seas , the US aircraft carriers immediately left the region .  
The key to building a system of logistics support that is adaptable to joint operations and to fundamentally eliminating such deficiencies as multiple channeling , separation of the general-purpose support and the special-purpose support , and operation via separate bodies is to take the road of integration .  This will bring about a new setup of logistics support where support for the three armed services are integrated as one , the system is compatible to both the military and the civilian , and the general-purpose logistics supplies and services are all supported in a unified way .  
The existing joint rear service system based on military regions still adopts the past method of combining supply and demand as one and integrating fund and support-in-kind .  This can hardly meet the demand of the " three-dimensional matrix " style operational mechanism of integrated support .  The mechanism for logistical operation must be changed .  
Qian Qichen said in his speech , international nongovernmental organizations have developed very rapidly in recent years ; they have played an increasingly important role in international political , economic , military , cultural , and social fields , and have become a force that can not be neglected in the international arena .  
It is said that during the amphibious landing joint military exercise on Dongshan Island , the Chinese Communist once more used large commercial vessels to ship supporting firepower cannons and rockets .  The purpose is nothing more than making up for the severe shortage of conventional amphibious landing vessels .  But this action will only be feasible under the condition of possessing superior naval and air forces .  These vessels are big and weak targets , but not a miraculous cure as they appear to be .  
Viewing from the United States ' perspective , high ranking US officials have generally recognized that in the Indian Ocean region - - no matter whether it is considered from the angle of territorial size , population and resources , scientific and technological capabilities , or military and economic strength - - India fully deserves to be considered as one of the top great nations , and it also possesses influence in the international political arena that can not be ignored .  
Moreover , the Taiwan authorities have repeatedly used the money earned by onerous toil of the ordinary people to buy advanced weapons from foreign countries , advocated " a decisive battle offshore , " and intended to form a military alliance against the mainland with the United States and Japan .  
A military official has commented that the new government may very likely be drawn into a scandal in future in the " underwater sonic detection system " cooperation program , just like the scandals surrounding the purchases of French Lafayette frigates that troubled the previous government .  
For example , the health of Tang Yao-ming has become a political issue because of his position .  When the media learned that he underwent surgery to remove his gallbladder , they sought confirmation from the military before reporting on it .  However , the military broke the news first by publishing Tang Yao-ming 's surgery on Ching-Nien Jih-Pao . Thus , the media were unable to break the news .  This struck a great fear into journalism and the media can no longer trust the directive to " confirm all matters through the spokesman . "  
After the plane collision incident in early April this year , the Chinese Government actively resolved the incident in reasonable and moderate fashion , but after the US aircrewhad returned home the US side turned around and would not admit that it was in the wrong , and the US military announced the temporary suspension of military exchanges with China .  
since the mid-1990 ' s , the PLA has discarded its former positional defense warfare and started to attach importance to rapid mobile warfare ; while streamlining its personnel , it has organized rapid reaction units , and now has over 100,000 troops in rapid reaction units with modern equipment , which are subordinate to the group armies in the seven military regions ; these are capable of rapid reaction by land , sea , and air , and can be termed as the PLA 's crack and fist units in the new century .  
During the current military exercises underway at Dongshan island and the southeast coast , the special electronic countermeasures unit which has just been organized has for the first time been operating in coordination with military reconnaisance satellites ;  
This is specifically expressed in the following ways : The special electronic countermeasures unit which has just been organized is for the first time operating in the Taiwan strait in coordination with military satellite reconnaisance ;

General Secretary Jiang 's July 1 speech , he said , is important because it provides our party with a powerful ideological weapon for understanding , strengthening , and improving itself under new historical conditions and provides a strong spiritual force for our great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  Studying the speech is not only an important political task for the entire military now , but also a long-term strategic task .  
Meanwhile , Israeli Prime Minister Sharon suspended his vacation and returned to Tel Aviv , where he immediately convened an emergency meeting participated in by cabinet members , including the foreign minister and the defense minister .  The meeting decided to continue adopting a resolute retaliating measure against any act of attacking Israeli targets .  It even allowed the military to adopt acts of attacking targets inhabited by common people .  
The Chinese military expert held that the 21st century would be a " marine century . "  He said : It is necessary to make conscientious efforts to build a powerful and large navy and turn it into one of the major forces that protect the motherland and safeguard world peace and regional security .  
The spokesman said : Attempts , plans , and actions by a single country to seek military and strategic advantages in outer space not only have always existed but are being further developed .  If this is not prohibited , it is likely that weapons will be employed in outer space in the near future , which could even lead to a multilateral arms race in outer space .  
With regard to Taiwan 's form of government , the Taiwan authorities are seeking to transform Taiwan into an " independent political entity " through a " constitutional reform . "  In foreign relations , the Taiwan authorities have spared no effort to carry out the activities of creating " two Chinas . " In military affairs , the Taiwan authorities have bought large quantities of advanced weapons from foreign countries and attempted to establish a military alliance of a disguised form with the United States and Japan .  
We have of late paid a visit to a certain air strike division of the Chinese Air Force , a hero unit known far and wide for its military prowess in the southeast , and interviewed the division 's Commander Zhang and political Commissar Su . What we saw and heard there has left us such a deep impression that the " fist " flight division has all along remained as a vanguard .  
Under the pretext of the so-called " China threat theory , " some foreign forces have also seized opportunities to intervene in the Taiwan question , an act of interference in China 's internal affairs , through diverse means such as , in the military sphere , continuing arms sales to Taiwan and building " theater missile defense , " in an attempt to secure their strategic interests in the Asia-Pacific region through the continued playing of the " Taiwan card , " thereby presenting a threat to our national security .  
- - He stressed holding cross-strait talks on an equal basis under the one-China principle and did not mention " talks between the central and local authorities . "  He reiterated that conditions for Taiwan can be more liberal than those for Hong Kong and Macao , that is , a high degree of autonomy ; the mainland will not send troops and officials to Taiwan ; Taiwan 's judicial powers will be completely independent ; Taiwan will have the power of final adjudication ; Taiwan can completely retain its original party , administrative , and military systems ;  
Speaking about the military meeting between the United States and Taiwan to be held in Washington in April , Zhu Bangzao emphasized that the Taiwan issue is China 's internal affair and the United States should not interfere in it .  The Chinese Government is opposed to US arms sales to Taiwan and has on many occasions explicitly opposed US moves to provide Taiwan with any theater missile defense system and relevant technical equipment .  This stand is firm and unshakable .  
The extent to which science and technology are applied and mastered in the military domain and the scientific and technological level of arms and equipment as well as military scientific and technological quality of commanders are the key symbols of army modernization .  How to take the strategy of building a strong army through science and technology as an important means of realizing army modernization ?  
regard raising the scientific and technological quality of military personnel as an important strategic task ; work hard to train qualified cross-century hi-tech personnel ; implement in real earnest Chairman Jiang Zemin 's requirement of " rather letting qualified personnel wait for equipment than letting equipment wait for qualified personnel , " and put scientific and technological quality progress of qualified personnel in a prominent position in the Chinese army 's modernization building .  
He emphasized the necessity of giving prominence to key points , linking with the reality of the armed forces , closely centering around the two historical themes of " being able to win " and " not changing color " facing the PLA , thinking deeply about how to keep abreast of the new trends in the world 's military development and how to bring about development in big strides in the modernization of the armed forces , and putting forward suggestions and proposals that show real knowledge and deep insight .  
At the same time , he also proposed that departments concerned should re-appraise the reasonability and serviceability of the existing national defense engineering system in southeast coastal areas based on the Central Military Commission 's military strategic principle for the new period , should rebuild this system in line with the requirements of the future high-tech war , and should intensify the building of military facilities and future battlefields in order to meet the demands of the military struggles against Taiwan .  
The national defense budget for this fiscal year will be raised by 12.7 percent ; the task of cutting 500,000 military personnel set three years ago has been completed ;  
The grand military review for celebrating the 50th founding anniversary of New China demonstrated to the whole world our army 's fine spiritual outlook and tremendous achievements in modernization .  This military review also greatly inspired the patriotic enthusiasm and the national pride of the people throughout the country .  
Reportedly , after drawing from the experience of the military pressure exerted during Taiwan 's presidential elections in 1996 and also for the sake of avoiding unnecessary conjecture , the air force , navy , and missile troops along the southeast coastal areas have received orders to suspend all their military exercises one week before and after Taiwan 's current presidential elections .  The military action will be focused on stepped up monitoring and patrols .  
A military source said that the situation of current cross-strait ties is changeable and the period is crucial .  There is no need to be panic because it is quite normal and reasonable for the troops stationed along the coast to be on alert and to be prepared for all contingencies .  
As the Chinese military begins to pay close attention to its modernization and strives to catch up to and surpass others in every military aspect , there is a book circulating in China entitled " Chao Xian Zhan " ( " Unrestricted Warfare " ) .  It advances a tactic known as " unrestricted warfare , " and although this is neither a mature thought nor a formal line of thinking in the Chinese military , it nevertheless has evoked broad repercussions .  
They hold the key to how the emerging countries should deal with today 's international order and rules .  The many problems China has run into in its modernization process , including its backward political , military , economic conditions today , make many people suspicious of the rules of international competition and contemporary warfare .  Many believe that under the rules drawn up mainly by the Western developed countries , China can never win .  
After the Cold War , although the United States ' military development has advanced to a level unprecedented in human history , the international rules and international order have remained in effect .  The Americans have not gone all out , like other imperial expansionists we are familiar with in world history , to forcefully establish hegemony based purely on military power similar to the kind we know in history .  
Those who proposed " unrestricted warfare " fully considered the changing military operations brought by the new technological means , but they failed to consider the rules , morals , and conscience of mankind that also govern the course of war .  The new military means and modes of warfare are still governed by traditional rules of war , including the restrictions of international laws ; there is no legal vacuum .  
In a modern war where the use of force sees no bounds , the weak are still nations outside of the West , because the Western nations so far are in control of the initiative for technological and scientific advancements and the resulting military advantages .  In a war where the two opposite sides have no rules but make massacre their ultimate goal , the victor will still be the side with technology and material superiority .  
Modern war is contention of the entire military systems and not simply confrontation between certain military systems , and it is victory in the main military domain that determines overall victory .  To gain temporary superiority in some non-crucial military domain by breaking the rules of war , even if that superiority is due to advanced technologies , will only bring partial victory which often ends in overall defeat .  This is because after the rules of war are broken , the side with overall superiority will become even more destructive amid the confusion .  
These non-traditional acts of violence are not accepted as legal national means of war by today 's international military systems and by modern international laws on armed confrontation , because by most countries ' existing laws and moral order , most of those acts are clearly and unmistakably illegal acts of violence .  A country founded on laws and democratic traditions can not regard an illegal act as a legal means .  
" The Chinese People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] is a mighty , civilized , and victorious military force which has been ever-triumphant .  Moreover , after carrying out reform and opening up for over 20 years , China has attained outstanding accomplishments in facilitating economic and social progress which attracted global attention .  Consequently , China has very considerably enhanced its social productivity , comprehensive national strength , and national defense capability .  
Female senior engineer Su Longxu , aged 37 , has developed over 40 scientific and technological accomplishments over the past 10 years .  Out of the total , seven were first-class and second-class awards for military scientific and technological progress , and eight items were awarded national patents .  Ninety percent of the scientific and technological accomplishments have been promoted and applied extensively .  
The top level in Beijing believes that peaceful reunification must be guaranteed by powerful military force and correct strategic design , otherwise , the initiative in cross-strait relations will be lost .  
To safeguard the interests of their own bourgeois class , Western countries headed by the United States have used political , economic , and military means to enforce their political system , ideology , and human rights concept in the international community and to grossly interfere in the internal affairs and trample on the sovereignty of other countries .  
The military pointed out that the result of the presidential poll , which led to a change of the ruling party , aroused discontent from military cadres , most of whom are Kuomintang members .  For this reason , Defense Minister Tang Fei and Chief of General Staff Tang Yao-ming both made speeches at the meeting , hoping that the three armed services will submit to the election outcome and focus on stabilizing the situation and reassuring the public .  
Thus , although a formation of U.S . aircraft carriers had shown up more than 100 nautical miles east of Taiwan to make its military presence known during our army 's military exercises in 1996 , it had not actually sailed into the Taiwan Straits . Moreover , as soon as the U.S . forces learned that a number of Chinese nuclear submarines had lifted anchor and left the port , the aircraft carrier battle group immediately moved back 100 nautical miles .  
The Soviet Union was all along reticent about the true figures of its military spending .  The total amount of its defense expenditures , published for the first time in 1989 , was 77.3 billion rubles .  It was further admitted in 1990 that its military spending represented one-fourth of its national budget .  
Last year when Putin acted as prime minister , he took resolute action and ordered that the Russian army recover Chechnya occupied by illegal armed forces .  Although the Russian army suffered heavy casualties , this move received the support of the people and the military .  
It will be exposing the deceitful propaganda of the Taiwan military authorities from the political and military perspectives .  Its aim is to fully demonstrate the strong determination and great might of the PLA [ People 's Liberation Army ] in fighting " Taiwan independence " and splittism and defending state sovereignty and territorial integrity in order to promote the development of cross-strait relations in a benign direction .  
He urged the US side to promptly complete a full and thorough investigation on the " bombing incident " and severely punish responsible persons so as to have a satisfactory answer to the Chinese Government and people and be conducive to ending the past and ushering in the future and creating a good foundation and atmosphere for improving and developing military relations between the two countries .

US President Clinton recently submitted to Congress the national defense budget for fiscal 2001 ; the total amount of the budget is $ 305.4 billion , an increase of $ 16.5 billion - - 5.7 percent - - over that of fiscal 2000 ; the figure represents over one-third of total global military expenditure and is equivalent to the total expenditure of the eight countries ( regions ) which rank after the United States .  
The aircraft is equipped with advanced comprehensive navigation electronic systems and weapons ; it can cruise at supersonic speed , has stealth capability , is highly maneuverable , and possesses superior features in being able to find , fire at , and destroy an enemy without being detected itself ; it represents the orientation for future fighter development , and so its research and development have aroused attention in military circles the world over .  
With the " backing " of the huge defense budget , the extremely expansive and aggressive US military and foreign policy has worsened the international atmosphere and disrupted international order , and goes against the tide of the times of world peace and development ; it is " bad tidings " as mankind enters the new century .  
Thanks to the construction and development over the past half a century , a remarkable improvement has been registered in the overall surveying and mapping level of our army ; and the use of new and high technologies , represented by satellite positioning , remote surveying , digital mapping , and a military geographic information system , has provided a strong surveying and mapping support for the operational commanding of our army .  
Whether or not cross-strait military strength is balanced is a major basis for the United States in deciding on arms sales to Taiwan ; when the mainland bought 10 Su-27s , the United States could sell 20 F-16s to Taiwan , and this trial of strength between spear and shield will continue , because the United States believes that regional security can be assured so long as relative balance is maintained in cross-strait military strength .  
Under the new circumstance , it is the military academies ' central task to cultivate new-type and high-quality military talents , who have comprehensive and excellent development in aspects such as ideological and political building , scientific and cultural building , military profession , and physical and psychological strength , and are endowed with comprehensive knowledge and talents as well as the spirit and ability to make initiative .  
The ideological and political building should be carried out with focus on this center , and the promotion of students ' ideological and political quality should always be given the priority .  Great efforts should be made to resolve the issue of ideal and faith so to form the spirit of devoting to the national defense cause .  Importance should be attached to the cultivation of sublime morality and the formation of characteristics unique for military personnel .  
It is reported that Guangzhou City held a national defense mobilization meeting last month .  Huang Huahua , secretary of the Guangzhou City CPC Committee , chaired the meeting in his capacity as the first political commissar of the Guangzhou Military Region . He called on the relevant quarters in the city to seriously do good preparatory work for military struggle in the new period in accordance with the central authorities ' arrangements .  
He pointed out that under the unified leadership of the central authorities , the military and armed police , the party committees and government at all levels , and the political and legal organs regarded implementing the central policy decision as a serious political task and assigned it an important position ; they swept into action with a high sense of political responsibility and sense of work urgency , and got a really good grasp of implementation , with the result that this work has continually proceeded in a healthy and orderly way .  
Hu Jintao said that in the past two years the leadership group offices , handover work offices , and military and armed police leadership group offices and their staff at all levels have displayed the spirit of selfless devotion and the style of fighting continuous combat , scrupulously carried out their duties , worked hard , swept into action , done their work in a precise and meticulous way , carried out a great deal of arduous and detailed and highly effective work , and completely fulfilled this political task assigned by the central authorities .  
Hu Jintao pointed out that the key to why the work of withdrawing the military , armed police , and political and legal organs from business activities has been able to fulfill the predicted target in a relatively short time and has consistently maintained stability in the overall situation lies in the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee , State Council , and CMC , in the positive efforts of the large military units , armed police , and regions and departments , and in the effective support of all sectors of society .  
Through carrying out this work , not only have the military , armed police , the party committees and government at all levels , and the political and legal organs undergone testing in stressing politics , taking account of the overall situation , and observing discipline ; we have also found a number of effective measures and summed up a number of successful experiences , which provide a useful reference for unfolding specific items of tidying things up in the future .  
If in the future a problem again arises of some unit of the military , the armed police , or the political and legal organs engaging in business activities , we will hold accountable not only those directly responsible but also the leaders of that unit in accordance with the regulations on building good party style and clean government , and will strictly discipline them .  
Wei Jianxing emphasized at the conclusion of the meeting that the military , armed police , party committees and government at all levels , and the political and legal organs must seriously implement the spirit of Comrade Hu Jintao 's speech , further enhance understanding of the great strategic significance of the central policy decision , and enhance awareness of upholding the decision .  
In recent years , the National Defense Committees at all levels of the military region have conscientiously implemented the gist of relevant instructions issued by the party Central Committee , the State Council , the Central Military Commission , and the State National Defense Committee ; persistently regarded the military strategic principle of the new period as their general guidance , deepened reform , paid close attention to a sound implementation , and have attained evident results in their national defense mobilization building .  
At present , all localities are engaged in the formulation of their " 10th five-year " plan for national economic and social development .  All localities are required to draw up an overall plan and take into consideration the needs of the national defense building ; and urban construction , communication and transportation , medical care , postal and telecommunications services , and other industries and trades which are closely related to the military sector , in particular , should take earnest steps to incorporate the national defense mobilization building into their overall development plan .  
Chi Haotian pointed out that strengthening preparation for war [ zhan bei gong zuo ] , upgrading the high-tech and high-quality equipment of the armed forces , and making good preparation for properly fighting an " anti-Taiwan-independence " war and opposing hegemonic military intervention at any time are the principle for war preparation formulated by the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission in accordance with the reality that the two sides of the strait are still in a state of war and hegemony has not stopped interfering in China 's internal affairs .  
At present , Taiwan 's military expenses exceed $ 10 billion per year .  As long as the hostilities between the two sides of the strait are terminated , Taiwan will be able to save a huge amount of military expenditure and shift the financial resources to social welfare and other fields which need the resources more urgently .  This will obviously be beneficial to the people of Taiwan .  
To sum up , we may see that only the saving of military and diplomatic expenses and the lowering of the costs by the " three direct links " will bring huge benefits ; as for the tapping of potential from cross-strait cooperation , the invisible assets in the political , foreign relations , cultural , and educational fields will be immeasurable .  
To consolidate its sector dealing with Taiwan affairs in light of the new situation , the CPC is about to institute a major reshuffle of the relevant mechanism , including increasing the military 's involvement in Taiwan affairs as well as the number of Taiwan affairs offices nationwide , especially the size of such offices in coastal areas . 
In fact , the Taiwan authorities have never relaxed military preparations for " armed resistance to reunification . "  They have purchased a massive amount of advanced weaponry from foreign countries and sought to join the theater missile defense system in a bid to establish a certain disguised form of military alliance with the United States and Japan .  
People who understand international law know that an unequal international treaty the signing of which is forced by military aggression is not valid , and so whether or not after its defeat in the war Japan signed a document on returning Taiwan to China does not affect the legal status of Taiwan as Chinese territory .  
The first is to suddenly employ large-scale military operations , using the effectiveness of a wave [ attack ] to make their military operations , transportation , communications , electric power , mass media , and other crucial facilities lose their function and utility , causing Taiwan to be paralyzed .  Only by having the first wave reach this kind of level can the foreign anti-Chinese forces be made to give up their plan of interfering .  
The Zhanjiang sub-military district , which guards China 's southern gate , recently held a joint troops and militiamen military exercise at the Baishawan in Xuwen County . The military exercise included storming the beach , rapid shifting of offensive lines , rapid putting up of air defense , and comprehensive logistics support .  
As reported , the establishment of military lawyers in the armed forces ' political institutions will be put under the leadership of the chiefs of the relevant units , and political institutions will perform their duties under the leadership of the legal advisory offices of the relevant units and receive guidance from the higher level of responsible judicial departments in professional work .  
They said they started the war to keep stable the Yugoslav Federation 's situation and to halt military conflicts and disputes , namely , with good intentions , but what followed was : The people were plunged into misery and suffering , the national economy fell back 20 years , and the natural environment and people 's lives were threatened by prolonged pollution from nuclear radiation and chemical and poisonous gases We can not help asking : Can a war solve any problem ? 
We should be aware that with the arrival of an information era and the promotion of global integration , a war will gradually no longer be ignited by traditional disputes .  Western countries headed by the United States are looking for new causes for provoking a war or military intervention .  They are now in the stage of theoretical exploration and tests .  The Kosovo War and the wars started by NATO previously are new adjustments made to achieve this aim .  
Chi Haotian said that since establishing diplomatic relations in 1985 China and Bolivia have enjoyed smooth development of friendly cooperative relations , both sides have expanded exchanges and cooperation in political , economic , military and cultural fields , to which China is satisfied , and is willing to make continuous efforts to further relations between the two states and armed forces in a healthy and stable way .  
After Chen Shui-bian , who had been a member of the opposition party , was elected as Taiwan 's new leader , the outside generally doubted whether or not the armed forces , which had been controlled by the Kuomintang over a long time , would take orders from Chen Shui-bian , who previously was strongly opposed to interference in government work by the military , called for cutting military spending , and exposed the dark side of the military , and doubted whether or not the military would stage a coup d'tat .  
He said that to promote national defense in future , we must " carry out nationalization of the armed forces , establish modern and highly-efficient military strength for national defense , conduct streamlined training for war , increase the combined combat-effectiveness of the three armed services , improve quality , improve welfare , and establish the dignity of the national troops . "  
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations seven years ago , China and Slovakia have made joint efforts to promote the constant development of friendly cooperation in the political , economic , military , science , technology , and cultural fields .  
the multi-polarization trend in the world pattern is irreversible ; and the competition of comprehensive national strength with the economic , scientific , technological , and military strength as well as national cohesion as the main content is tending to become more acute .  Judging from the general situation , peace and development remain the theme of the times .  
Hu Xiaodi pointed out : A program aimed at " controlling the outer space " has been drawn up and under implementation through the political , economic , scientific and technological , and military might of a superpower , with a view to seeking unilateral military and strategic superiority .  
In discussing which chief modes should be adopted for cultivating military cadres by relying on general higher education , this responsible person stated that in the " Decision " , three main modes are put forward : choosing cadres for cultivation from within schools , directly accepting into the corps graduates from general higher level institutions , and soliciting students studying national defense .  
typical high level institutions implement an employment policy of " dual directional selection , self reliance on job choice " , thus increasing greatly the indeterminate variables for selection of graduating students into military work .  
This responsible person stressed that based on the high or low quality level of the military cadres selected from general high level universities , speaking in a definite sense , their level of quality impacts the entire level of military development and the success or failure of our undertaking .  
In the new historical period , Chairman Jiang , based on the developmental changes in the domestic and foreign situation , summarized the new experience in our army 's modernization development , creatively putting forward the scientific concept of " ideological and political development " , stressing that we must put ideological and political development in the premier position among all the army 's development projects , and he gave a series of important instructions in regard to strengthening military ideological and political development under the new situation .  
In accordance with the requirements of Chairman Jiang 's " Two Armings " , the entire military , on the basis of conducting ideological theoretical arming , has put great efforts into strengthening modern science and technology arming , especially arming with high technology knowledge , actively transforming concepts , adjusting work thinking , and putting the focus on cultivating personnel , creating talent , and comprehensively raising the quality of officers and soldiers .  
Facing new situations and tasks , ideological and political development has shouldered heavy responsibilities .  The troops in the entire army will take Chairman Jiang 's important thinking regarding the " three represents " as the guide , constantly reforming , being brave in innovating , and industriously opening up a new page in military ideological and political work .  
Further , it has readjusted the national military strategy and military concepts ; stressed local wars under high-tech conditions and rapid response capability ; emphasized the task of strengthening the military through science and technology such as electronic warfare , information warfare , network warfare , and modern communication ;  
At the ceremony of promoting military officers to the military and police rank of general on 21 June , Jiang Zemin made a special emphasis in his speech : In the year of the new century [ as published ] , cadres at the divisional-bureau level in all services and arms as well as all military scientific research institutes are required to attain the level of higher education and the level of possessing modern professional knowledge .  
At the conference , Fu Quanyou , member of the Central Military Commission [ CMC ] and chief of general staff of the People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] , stressed : Deepening military training by scientific and technological means is implementing the important ideology of President Jiang Zemin 's " three represents , " and a major measure and basic practical activity for solid and effective preparations for military struggle .  
The army at all levels must follow the principles for military strategy in the new period and consider military training by scientific and technological means as the most direct and most effective preparations for military struggle .  It is necessary to educate officers and men about the arduous situation of military struggle , raise the army 's morale by stressing the importance of the people 's army 's fundamental functions , and use the revolutionary spirit of fighting for victory to arouse the fighting spirit and comprehensively raise the army 's capability to win wars .  
Military training by scientific and technological means is a comprehensive and profound change , which will have a fundamental , complete , and deep influence on military training , military struggle , and army-building .  
When asked by a reporter to comment on the issue that the US Senate will begin to discuss and put to vote the so-called " China Nonproliferation Law " bill on 10 July , Zhu Bangzao said that China is always opposed to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , has exercised strict and effective control over relevant materials according to its military trade and anti-proliferation policies , as well as its relevant international commitments , and has made tremendous efforts to prevent international proliferation .  
Taken internationally , science and technology are advancing rapidly with each passing day in the world at present , the process of globalization is gathering pace , the trend toward a multi-polar world pattern is irreversible , and the competition in comprehensive national strength taking the economic , scientific and technological , and military strength and national cohesion as principal contents is increasingly vehement .  
The earliest military strategy of Taiwan based itself on " recovering the mainland . "  Finally , to face reality , Taiwan changed its strategy into fighting a " decisive war on the island , " the core of which was a " decisive battle on the beach and offshore ; " that is , " destroying the enemy forces at the waterfront and annihilating them on beachheads . "  
The trends described above indicate that the Taiwan authorities and the military are transforming a " passive defensive strategy " into an " active defensive strategy , " the core of which is to strengthen military " deterrence , " avoid as much as possible a decisive battle on the island , and make great efforts to push the battle ground off the island or even to the west of the center line of the strait or within the mainland .  
The thinking of a " decisive battle offshore " and any overconfident military and political provocations are no doubt nonsensical and crazy practices and a risk that invites self-destruction .  Some people in Taiwan should rein in on the brink of the precipice .  
The fourth five-nation summit was held in Bishkek , the capital of Krygyzstan , in August 1999 .  The joint statement issued after the summit further promised to make joint efforts to establish a mechanism of mutual cooperation , develop multilateral cooperation , promote regional stability , fight ethnic secessionism , and eliminate drug-trafficking and terrorism .  The five nations also reiterated that they would abide by their border treaties and agreement on military trust and make constructive contributions toward regional and world peace .  
and that a US military strategic chain link from Japan in the north to Australia in the south be established and targeted on China . Taiwan is located in the central and crucial position in this military strategic chain link of the United States .  
Its basic characteristic is the comprehensive use of various high-tech information technology [ IT ] developed in the 1990 ' s to conduct rapid , hidden , and destructive damage to the enemy 's military and civilian computer networks and communication systems , cutting off the enemy 's military contacts , disabling command , dowsing the fighting spirit , and bringing great chaos to the economy and society of the country concerned .  This will finally allow the attacking side to achieve the goal of striking the first blows without shedding a drop of blood .  
Second , the US military has a large number of complex and high-tech weapons .  Therefore , there is a large consumption and costly price for logistical and technical support .  In addition , because of independent purchases systems for various weapons of armed services , the maintenance and upkeep is extremely difficult .  
In view of this and in consideration of the current regional and surrounding geopolitical circumstances , all sides have determined to deepen cooperation in the political , diplomatic , economic and trade , military , military technological , and other fields to consolidate regional peace and stability .  
3 .  All sides point out that the agreements reached between the five countries in settling border issues and enhancing military trust have embodied a new security view that is built on mutual trust , equality , and cooperation ; are conducive to enhancing mutual understanding and good-neighborly relations ; and have contributed in a constructive manner to ensuring stability in this extensive region .  
President of Kyrgyzstan Askar Akayev first expressed his gratitude to the " Shanghai Five " for moral support and military and technical assistance to his country when international terrorists invaded southern Kyrgyzstan in August last year .  He suggested the need to establish an anti-terrorism center for central Asia in Bishkek .  
From Shanghai , Moscow , Alma-Ata , Bishkek to Dushanbe , the degree of military confidence among the five countries along their borders has constantly risen , border problems left over by history have been settled gradually , cooperation in the area of political security has been constantly deepened , consensus over regional and international matters has been constantly expanded , and economic and trade cooperation has developed day by day .  
In recent years , the Taiwan authorities led by Lee Teng-hui carried out armaments expansions without restraint , stressing augmenting the Taiwan armed forces ' control of the air and command of the sea by relying on the geographical position of an isolated island and under the guidance of the military thinking of " active defensive and effective deterrence . "  The Air Force 's special budget for the purchase of F-16 and " Mirage-2000 " fighters alone was as high as $ 12 billion .  
We are positive toward developing bilateral military exchanges at various levels .  We hope that through joint efforts , both sides will further expand the scopes of bilateral military ties , and ensure that Sino-US military ties will develop in a sustained , healthy , and stable manner .  
They should extensively carry out the guiding spirit of the national rally for naming double-support model cities ( and counties ) .  In light of promoting the reform , development , and stability of the state as well as army building , they should carry out various activities in a thoroughgoing and effective manner .  They should further consolidate and develop the great situation of the unity between the military and the government as well as the unity between the military units and the people .  
All localities and all military units should conscientiously carry out the guiding spirit of the central ideological and political work conference .  They should launch the activities of building spiritual civilization through the joint efforts of servicemen and civilians and promote coordinated development of spiritual and material civilization .  
During the visit , Jiang Zemin urged all departments participating in the cooperation of war industries to implement the principle of " the integration of military and civilian use , and the integration of wartime and peacetime needs , " meet the needs of the new situation of the development of the socialist market economy , adhere to the principle of turning civilians into a part of the armed forces , and establish a vigorous structure for the development science and technology for national defense ;  
We must obtain maximum results from our limited resources , form a complete set of effective mechanisms for competition , appraisal , and supervision , optimize the distribution of the science , technology and productive forces of the whole society , promote the ties , integration and cooperation between the military and civilian scientific research structures , and enable the achievements in technological innovation to be turned faster and better into productive forces for national defense and economic development .  
Zhu Bangzao said , there is another important content of this statement , that is , non-strategic ABM defensive systems that are not banned under the ABM treaty , and international cooperation in this field , should not damage the security of other countries , should not lead to the establishment and strengthening of closed military and political blocs , and should not damage global and regional stability and security .  
Yu Yongbo said emphatically : The important speech given by Chairman Jiang at the central ideological and political work conference profoundly expounded on a host of major issues in strengthening and improving the party 's ideological and political work in the new situation .  A policy document of great theoretical and guiding significance , the speech further pointed the way for us to cope with the overall situation of party and government work and to do a good job in ideological and political work in the military .  
At that forum , which was presided over by Nanjing MR Commander Liang Guanglie , Fang Zuqi also reminded the responsible persons from the upper echelons of the party committees in the Nanjing MR to " strengthen and improve ideological and political work in the army " and " make great efforts to provide a powerful mental motive force for winning a war " in the process of making preparations for military struggle .  
China is a peace-loving country which has mainly developed her self-defense national defense on her own .  In the meantime , China has also conducted some cooperation with the countries concerned .  Originally , China had signed with Israel an agreement on purchasing an aircraft equipped with an early warning radar on the basis of normal military trade relations between the two countries .  
A few days ago , at a certain sea port in northern Jiangsu , more than 30 civilian ships of large tonnage called up by the Jiangsu Provincial Military District carried officers and men of a certain motorized infantry brigade and heavy equipment and sailed towards the wavy Huang Hai sea area to start a two-day , two-night sea-crossing and military tactics and technology training .  
According to today 's " Jiefangjun Bao , " since the beginning of July , Nanjing Military Region has sent units of a whole division and regiment to the coastal forefront to conduct maritime military training , forming a military training picture of a grand scene at sea along the meandering coastal line .  More than 10,000 officers and men of a certain infantry division were organized into a formation and crossed the sea in arms in stormy conditions .  Neither the front nor the end of the formation could be seen ;  
Officers and men of a certain air force station of the People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] along the southeast coast on the frontline of military struggle against Taiwan have learned the lesson from the Kosovo War , firmly upheld their mission , taken practical actions , accelerated the modernization of flight logistics , continued to raise the level of logistical command automation , and provided strong logistical support for winning the war .  
Upon receiving an emergency order , the naval training vessel " Shichang " set sail in a thick fog with visibility of only 15 m .  It braved the wind and the waves of a near Force 10 typhoon for 17 days , sailing 4000 nautical miles .  It satisfactorily completed comprehensive training in maritime national defense mobilization with " wartime civilian vessels emergency mobilization and acquisition " as its main task .  The vessel returned to a certain military port in the Bo Hai a few days ago .  
It is necessary to actively push forward various reforms of the army , boldly make innovations , advance with keen determination , strengthen the theoretical study of military sciences , further optimize structures and formations , adopt the strategy of strengthening army with science and technology , improve weaponry and equipment , and vigorously nurture and bring up high-quality talented people , so as lay a solid foundation for the development of our army in the new century .  
However , an analysis of Taiwan 's military combat capability , especially of its naval and air forces , will readily show that the Taiwan military 's so-called " decisive battle offshore " can only be described as a dangerous and dubious wishful thinking .  
Another weak point of the Taiwan military is that it purchases weapons from a variety of countries ; their quality , performance , and operating regulations differ , with the result that it is very difficult to form the weapon systems into a complete perfect set , and this has a direct impact on taking advantage of their combat capability .  
The report believes that although the Chinese communists ' military threat against our troops has changed from mere advantage in quantity to competition in quality , leading to a disparity between the two sides of the strait and the Chinese communists are eager to settle the " Taiwan issue , " thus imposing a greater threat to our security , both sides of the strait should still create conditions for cooperation with goodwill , jointly deal with the issue of " a future China , " and seek a win-win result on the basis of mutual trust .  
Thanks to this " three attacks and three defenses " training , all military units generally acquired the skills of attacking tanks , aircraft , and paratroopers and the skills of defending against nuclear attack , chemical warfare , and biological weapons .  At the same time , People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] training has developed by leaps and bounds as a result .  
During a 16 June military review , the new leader in Taiwan put forward for the first time the strategic thinking of " fighting decisive battle outside Taiwan . " He also instructed the military to enhance its information warfare capability , develop air-to-ground missiles and other offensive weaponry , set up a special agency for the development of " space weapon system , " deploy for the first time guided missile boats to the Kinmen front , and conduct live-warhead missile launching exercise .  
It is a new form of military training adapted to the science and technology age and designed to win victory in a local war under high-tech conditions .  The mainland 's development of strategic ballistic missiles is in the direction of raising mobility , precision and warhead efficiency ; its development of tactical missiles is in the direction of increasing range , enhancing precision , raising payload and improving warhead efficiency ;  
Taiwan 's " Minister of National Defense " Wu Shih-wen said in the preface of the report : " The change of our strategic concept to effective deterrence and tenacious defense does not mean we want to engage in an arms race with the Chinese Communists , " and " we hope we can proceed in an orderly way and step by step to promote the establishment of an institutionalized military mutual trust mechanism between the two sides to ensure lasting peace in the Taiwan Strait . "  
The General Armament Department of the People 's Liberation Army recently held a forum of military representative bureau heads of the armed forces , which stressed that the building of the army 's weapons and equipment must match the overall situation of economic construction and national defense construction ; it is necessary to seriously study the new situation and characteristics of the work of military representatives under socialist market economy conditions , and further speed up the reforms in the building of the army 's weapons and equipment .  
The General Armament Department of the People 's Liberation Army recently held in Beijing an all-military forum of military representative bureau chiefs .  It stressed that military weaponry should meet the needs of the overall situation of national economic and defense construction .  It also pointed out the need to conscientiously study the new state and characteristics of military representatives ' work under the socialist market economic conditions in order to further speed up the reform of weaponry building .  
Our basic missions in strengthening ideological and political education in military academies are to " be victorious at war and not to degrade , " to ensure that we are on the correct path of developing advanced military academies , and to ensure that we can materialize the target of cultivating military professionals with high caliber .  
While paying attention to the pattern of modern education , the " Opinions " have also made use of the PLA 's political superiority .  The " Opinions " have summarized and incorporated the PLA 's basic experiences of strengthening ideological and political education in military academies under new circumstances .  The " Opinions " are currently , and will be for some time in the future , an important guiding document for strengthening ideological and political education in military academies .  
Our basic missions in strengthening ideological and political education in military academies under new circumstances are to " be victorious at war and not to degrade , " to ensure that we are on the correct path of developing advanced military academies , and to ensure that we can materialize the target of cultivating military professionals with high caliber .  
Facing the challenge of a revolution of military affairs in the world , Xu Guangfeng studied and practiced hard at his post and promptly became a technical vanguard of the group army .  He applied specialized knowledge learned from school to actual tasks .  
In October 1996 , Xu Guangfeng , as an outstanding officer of the military region , was sent to a unit to receive specialized training on guided missiles .  He learned unknown areas of special subjects , was bold in scaling technological heights , and quickly mastered maintenance , repair and management of weapons of advanced technology .  He improved his own ability from mastering general special knowledge to mastering special knowledge of high technology .  
During his visit to China last July , Putin said that further developing all-round cooperation in the economic , trade , science and technology , and military fields is one of the important direction for expanding and deepening the equal , trustworthy , strategic cooperative partnership between China and Russia .  
The experience the academy has gained in this respect has inherited the glorious tradition of the ideological and political work of the party and PLA , reflects the specific situation and characteristics of the new period , and is marked by innovations and improvements .  It is not only useful to military schools , but also worth drawing on by ordinary institutions of higher learning in various localities .  
As far as the cadet 's ideological and political quality is concerned , the academy holds that a revolutionary ideal embodies a concentrated reflection of the scientific world outlook , philosophy of life , and values , that the military spirit emphasizing the party 's absolute leadership over the PLA is the foundation for ensuring the PLA 's unchanged quality , and that the highly patriotic spirit of dedication is an inexhaustible driving force for service members to take root in the PLA to perform meritorious deeds .  
It has thus aroused the cadets ' sense of mission and responsibility .  In addition , it has encouraged the cadets to become new-type military personnel capable of operating high-tech equipment by promoting the thinking of " letting well-trained people wait to be equipped rather than having equipment ready but without well-trained people to operate it . "  
As related by relevant departments of the General Staff Headquarters , China had the capability to independently develop and produce advanced armored tank vehicles a long time ago .  Our military 's armored force has formed a weaponry system with various types of vehicles , such as tanks , light amphibious tanks , armored carriers , and coordinated fire support , combat support and logistics technical support vehicles .  
During recent years , our military 's armored force has deeply implemented the military strategic principle of the new period , established its footing on winning a victory in the local war under high-technology conditions , striven to upgrade quality , and steadily marched toward the goal of building itself into a picked , composite and efficient force .  
It has been learned that Yao Zhesheng owned a luxury villa in Beijing , spend most of the time there , lived a lavish life , cultivated special relations with senior officials , and maintained excellent relations with officials of the Public Security Ministry , the General Administration of Customs , the United Front Department under the CPC Central Committee , and even with the military .  
He said : In his half-century revolutionary career , Comrade Su Yu performed immortal feats for the liberation of the Chinese people , and made important contributions to building a modern and regularized revolutionary army ; strengthening the national defense of the New China ; and enriching and developing Mao Zedong military thinking , leaving behind him an everlasting monument and a precious legacy .  
Zhang Wannian said : In his military life , Comrade Su Yu defeated his opponent by a surprise move .  He developed a unique art of conducting campaigns and conducted a string of major and ferocious battles , setting many shining fighting examples .  
The rapid progress of science and technology in the world , especially the development of information technology , has created new and broad prospects for the development of the productive force and the society .  It is creating a profound influence on political , economic , military , science and technology , culture and social fields of various countries .  
Although the Chinese government insists that the Taiwan question brooks no intervention and has taken retaliatory action against European countries that sold advanced arms to Taiwan with satisfactory results , it is reluctant to take action to stop the United States from overtly calling for the maintenance of the status quo while covertly supporting " Taiwan independence , " because it is aware of its substantial gap with the United States in economic and military strength and has to take care of its economic development and improve the material life of its people .  
His advanced deeds and noble spirit fully embody the lofty realm of communists and revolutionary soldiers in consciously practicing " three represents , " and demonstrates the spiritual outlook of teachers of military academies who heroically blaze new trails , are content in serving as the ladder for others to get ahead , and work with selflessly devotion .  
All military academies should energetically promote the good practice of respecting teachers and assigning importance to teaching , strive to foster more excellent teachers like Liu Yixin , fundamentally improve the level of teaching and the quality of education , fully bring into play the role of military academy education as a matter of fundamental and overall importance in providing the lead in the modernization of the army , and make new and greater contributions to the building of our army into a revolutionary , modernized and standardized army , he said .  
After the explosion occurred , relevant leaders of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region and Urumqi City promptly went to the scene of the explosion to direct rescue operations .  Several hundred public security personnel , armed police , and military personnel stationed in the area as well as more than 100 medical personnel swiftly plunged into fire fighting and rescue work .  The injured people were sent to nearby hospitals for emergency treatment .  
The conference was attended by the relevant responsible persons from various provincial , autonomous regional , or municipal people 's procuratorates , various military procuratorates , and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Procuratorate , as well as some other procuratorates .  
In line with Chairman Jiang 's important instructions , the all-military political work meeting has put forward the historical missions of ideological and political construction in the military in the new situation - - to provide powerful spiritual motivation for winning future high-tech wars , and to provide a reliable political guarantee for maintaining the nature , inherent qualities , and style of the people 's military .  
Every year throughout the military , over one thousand leading cadres at or above the army level have gone among the soldiers to understand the situations , give guidance and lectures , answer and solve hot and difficult educational issues , and give effective guidance on education .  This has produced a lively situation where party committees have attached great importance to education , leaders have worked together to manage it , and officers and men participated in it enthusiastically .  
In light of the new situation that has occurred in maintaining and developing a healthy and pure internal relationship in the military , they should strengthen the awareness of the cadres of " taking a correct attitude and commanding the troops in a civilized manner " and the awareness of military personnel regarding " respecting cadres and obeying management , " strengthen the unity between officers and men , and improve internal and external relationships .  
While working on improving the quality of classroom education and fully enhancing the role of classroom education as the main front , they have focused on the reality wherein there are closer contacts between life in the military camps and society , and where officers and men are receiving more extensive information ; enhanced the educational roles of mass media ; in many ways efficiently used society as a great classroom ;  
and launched joint educational activities between the military and localities .  In line with the reality that there has been a general increase in the awareness of democracy , equality , and participation among officers and men , they have carried out diverse types of mass self-education , during which " everyone have stated clearly their problems , distinguished between right and wrong , talked about principles , and found answers . "  
The " Suite of Songs on the Morals of Military Men , " which was organized and created by the General Political Department , has rapidly become popular in military camps north and south of the great river , the frontiers , and islands , and officers and men have received education on our military 's fine traditions and the moral standards of military personnel in the art forms that they love .  
According to reports , along the journey of advancing into the new century , all units of the military have rode on the strong east wind of the central ideological and political work meeting , earnestly acted in the spirit of Chairman Jiang 's important speech , and with higher standard and full of enthusiasm , striven to produce new results in strengthening and improving ideological and political education in the armed forces and to create a new situation .  
After the economically developed west , with its strong military forces , has been attacked and destroyed , Taiwan 's entire economic , political , and military systems will be in a state of chaos and paralysis , and no matter how strong the eastern defense base is , it will be unable to retrieve the war situation in the west .  
Some foreign missionaries directly served colonial expansion , took part in selling opium , gathered intelligence , encouraged and participated in military aggression , seized economic gains , took part in plotting to force the government to sign unequal treaties , relied on the special privileges provided by unequal treaties , ran wild in the countryside , bullied and humiliated the people , and stirred up the opposition of the people .  
In the separation of government functions from enterprise management , for example , problems arising from the running of commercial enterprises by special interest entities were solved when the military , armed police and political and legal organs were ordered in 1998 to disengage themselves from commercial operations .  
According to the initial report made by the investigation team , there were no dubious factors for the explosion .  But the military unit obviously violated the operational rules while transporting outdated explosive articles scheduled to be scrapped .  A mistake led to a military vehicle colliding with a bus , causing heavy casualties .  
Some personalities in Beijing 's military circles believe that the planned reorganization indicates the development of China 's comprehensive economic and scientific and technological strength , and it will raise the international standing of China as a force of peace in the Asia-Pacific Region and in the world .  
In 1997 , at the 15th CPC National Congress , Chairman Jiang Zemin declared to the whole world : Following the 1-million personnel retrenchment in the 1980s , China will further cut down the personnel size of its army by 500,000 in the next three years .  In order to implement this strategic decision made by Chairman Jiang and the party Central Committee , the PLA has readjusted the organizational establishment of its troops ; reformed its logistic support , weaponry management , and the structure of its military academies and training institutions ;  
A group of military commanding talents is in the making , who have had a modern scientific and cultural knowledge and a modern management knowledge and who are capable of using modern weapons and are capable of organizing and commanding combined operations among different arms and services .  A new enhancement has been noticed in both the military and political qualities of the officers and men of the three armed services .  
Presenting themselves in public in their firm , vigorous and uniform steps , the military units being reviewed fully embodied the militant fighting spirit of the North Korean People 's Army .  
Despite the changing international environment , the two countries have understood and supported each other since the establishment of diplomatic relations more than 40 years ago .  The two countries have had fruitful cooperation in political , economic , military , and other areas , setting a model for South-South cooperation among developing countries .  
To make a success of training the troops through science and technology , it is necessary to carry it out in close connection with the requirements of actual combat , centering on resolving key and difficult problems in preparations for military struggle , persist in hard and strict training , intensify targeted training , and make efforts to narrow the gap between training and actual combat .  
The military source said that the establishment of the Fuzhou Theater signifies the intensified degree of tension in the Taiwan strait compared with the previous stages and increased possibility of a breakout of a partial war by adding that the military had raised a level of military alert in this theater .  
The report stated " the Fuzhou Theater in particular has rapidly been taking shape as a strong joint operation mechanism for the troops and has greatly enhanced the capability to launch a large-scale joint operation under difficult conditions of having to organize the Theater in a very short period and of personnel coming from different military systems . " 
According to an authoritative source , the 56 theoretical research achievements for theoretical exchanges during this experience-exchanging military exercise are focused on resolving major and knotty issues faced in a modern war , such as combined operations among different arms and services under high-tech conditions , reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance , air strike and counter-air strike , defense breakthrough [ tu fang ] and counter-defense breakthrough , and jamming and anti-jamming , and they represent the leading edge of the military theoretical research of the Chinese Army ;  
It has focussed on the major theories and practical issues related to the preparations for military struggle , thus further defining the orientation and thinking of deepening the training of troops through science and technology .  The training of troops through science and technology represents a profound revolution in the military affairs of China 's armed forces at the end of the 20th century .  
The whole army should use as its guidance Chairman Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " as well as on strengthening the armed forces and improving their training through science and technology .  In light of the military strategic principle in the new period as well as the goal of realizing the preparations for military struggle , the whole army should continuously deepen its ideological understanding .  In addition , the whole army should ensure that it follows correct orientation during the whole process of training of troops through science and technology .  
We should take a lead in socialist spiritual civilization construction .  We should further foster close ties between the military and the government as well as between the military and the people .  We should continuously make new contributions in promoting coordinated economic and social development , in consolidating and developing China 's political stability , and in creating a good situation of social stability .  
The most important point is whether the entire people possess a strong combat will .  This is also the core of the policy of " national defense by the whole people . "  As long as the people throughout the country strengthen their mental defense , reinforce the all-people 's defense mechanism , do not fear communist China 's propaganda offensive and military threat , and remain a backing for the government and armed forces , the armed forces will certainly have confidence and ability to ensure the country 's security .  
Attending the meeting were over 700 people , including leaders of relevant departments from various provinces , municipalities , and autonomous regions , and central state organs ; the PLA General Staff Department ; various military regions and districts ( and garrisons and commands ) ; the Air Force ; and the National Civil Air Defense Offices of key cities as well as responsible comrades from the Civil Air Defense Offices at and above city level , some academies and institutions , and scientific research institutes and colleges .  
The circular finally stressed : We should make vigorous efforts to train and utilize qualified personnel capable of working in both military and civilian posts and this is at once a need of army building and a need for tackling the problem of lack of qualified personnel in the rural areas and promoting rural development as well . 
In another development , the Chinese put on display for the first time an advanced guided missile whose name remains unknown .  Though it was only a model and was attached to the model of the Qianhong 7 aircraft ( namely , the Flying Leopard heavy bomber especially manufactured for its naval air force ) , it has attracted the attention of foreign military experts .  A US military expert who is taking part in the show , believes that is a new supersonic antiradar , antiship guided missile recently developed by the CPC military .  
Facing such an intricate and complex international political , economic , and military struggle , in order to safeguard China 's national security and the unification of our motherland , ensure a smooth progress for our great socialist cause , and protect the fundamental interests of the people of the entire country , we must enhance our awareness of guarding against possible future mishaps and must reinforce our national defense building .  
Present at the meeting were leaders of all provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities , relevant departments under central and state organs , the PLA General Staff Headquarters , all military regions and provincial military districts ( garrison commands and garrisons ) , the Air Force , key cities for the civil air defense work designated by the state , and the Civil Air Defense Offices at the city level and above ; as well as the responsible comrades of a number of colleges , universities , and scientific research institutions .  
In the next 20 years , although oil supply and demand in the world will be basically balanced , as complicated contradictions remain between major oil consuming countries , between oil consuming and producing countries , and between countries with oil resources , this may increase uncertain factors that trigger off political , military , and diplomatic contradictions and conflicts , and may directly and seriously affect the world or regional oil markets .  
Gore seemed to lay greater stress on establishing an Asia-Pacific multilateral security mechanism and attach greater importance to the US ' relations with China , but he stressed that Japan was the US ' principal ally in Asia . Gore and the younger Bush shared identical views on the two key issues of stressing Japan being the principal ally of the US in Asia , and of maintaining the US military presence in Asia .  
AMEEGC General Manger Xia Guohong told this reporter during the air show in Zhuhai that the AMEEGC will , by adhering to the guiding thought of " gearing to the market , with aerospace as the principal line , striving for scientific and technological innovations , prevailing on the strength of quality , " speed up the general adoption of the market principle and the process of converting military enterprises to civilian production in order to maintain a sustained , sound and fast development of China 's space undertakings under the conditions of market economy .  
Since the relations between The People 's Republic of China and Lao People 's Democratic Republic ( referred to as " the two parties " hereinafter ) were normalized in 1989 , the traditional friendship and friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries have been fully restored and developed and their exchange and cooperation in political , economic , trade , military , cultural and educational , and other areas have been constantly strengthening .  
1 ) Displaying the achievements made in reform and opening up : The three groups of commemorative gold and silver coins marking the 30th , 40th , and 50th anniversaries of the founding of the PRC highlighted the great achievements made over the last 20 years , which saw rapid and sustained economic growth , constant improvement in people 's living standards , national unity , and the progress made in the scientific and technological and military fields that boosted China 's overall national strength . 
The meeting pointed out that the existing Chinese People 's Liberation Army Ordinance Governing Officers on Active Duty , since its implementation in 1988 , has played an important role in enabling the officers of the People 's Liberation Army and the People 's Armed Police Force to become more revolutionary , younger in average age , better educated , and more professionally competent ; in boosting their initiative and creativity ; and in ensuring their observance of law in performing military duties .  
It was learned that the hardware platforms of this kind generally used in China and foreign countries at present are priced at more than 500,000 yuan at least , while the hardware platform of this China-pioneered system is less than 20,000 yuan in price .  Specialists maintain that the successful development of this system has provided our military with a standardized , generalized , high-functional , and fairly cheap platform to develop the video system of battlefields , with China possessing the independent intellectual property .  
Comrades in charge of the relevant central party , government , military , and mass work units ; and deputy secretaries of party committees in charge of united front work and directors of united front work departments from provinces , autonomous regions , municipalities , cities whose leaders rank at the level of deputy provincial leader , and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps attended the session .  
This year in particular , there have been consecutive incidents of the killing of a South Korean hostess by a U.S . serviceman , the " mistaken bombing " by the U.S . military at Maehyang-Ri , and the discharge of poisonous waste fluid into the Han River by the U.S . military .  This has touched off even stronger anti-U.S . sentiments .  
he laid very great stress on the question of how to fight to win a partial war under hi-tech conditions , and demanded that the armed forces have a clear understanding of the new situation , further enhance their awareness of hardship , and step up their training with a high degree of political responsibility and the sense of urgency of seizing the day ; they should also make military training more targeted and narrow the gap between training and actual combat . 
Revolving around the political steadfastness and ideological and moral purity of troops , the entire military and armed police force regard resisting " red lanterns and green wine " [ feasting and revelry ] and preventing the erosion of decadent ideology and culture as a breakthrough point to vigorously grasp the education and consolidation of ideologies , styles , and disciplines as well as the internal and external relations .  
" If you want to win the battle , you have got to plan how to win the battle and train yourselves to win the battle . "  Therefore , the capabilities of field operation survival , rapid response , and combined operation of various arms units have been further strengthened , the weaponry and equipment , military quality , and defensive fighting capability have been remarkably improved , and new steps have been made in the direction of better troops , high effectiveness , and combined operations .  
( III ) In the face of the complex and changeable international situation and the new situation of various ideologies and cultures surging against each other and the contradictions and struggles in the ideological and political realm being very complicated , what to grasp and how to grasp the ideological and political building is an issue which has a bearing on what kind of mental outlook the Party , the country , and the military should meet for the challenges of the 21st Century .  
The fruitful achievements of the " four educations " in the People 's Liberation Army and the armed police force have provided beneficial inspiration for strengthening and improving the ideological and political work in our Party and our military during the new historical period .  
Over the educational practice of the last six years , the party committees and political organs at all levels of the entire military and the armed police force have justifiably and loudly upheld high quality and style , explained well large principles , propagated advanced things and developed healthy tendencies in a large way , and refuted erroneous ways and rectified unhealthy tendencies in a clear-cut manner , thus creating a strong public opinion and excellent ideological atmosphere about taking the overall situation into consideration , emphasizing the dedication , and observing disciplines .  
second , for the first time it set out comprehensive , systematic , and effective frameworks for handling bilateral relations , from the leaders ' hot line to the mechanism for dialogue on human rights , and from military exchanges to cooperation in law enforcement .  
China 's economic development potentials and its vast potential market , the unique role it plays in Asian affairs , its political influence among the developing countries , its special geopolitical status and future prospects of " great China " [ da zhong hua ] , and the acceleration of its military modernization - - all these factors mean that the US government and public can not but attach greater importance to China 's weight in the future international political pattern and its influence in world affairs .  
Beijing is worried that Taiwan and the US would take this opportunity to resume their military cooperation which has been suspended since 1979 .  Recently , signs showing this have surfaced unceasingly .  The Taiwan Security Enhancement Act clearly stipulates that the US military headquarters in the Pacific should have " direct and confidential communications " with the Taiwan military .  In mid-December , Taiwan 's request of buying Aegis-class destroyers from the US was proposed again , and will be decided at the China-US meeting scheduled to be held in April next year .  
It was reported that although the military tribunal already accepted the accusation lodged by the military procuratorate against Ji Shengde , who had embezzled nearly 80 million yuan by means of accepting bribes and diverting public funds for other use and on charge of dereliction of duties , the tribunal has recognized the justification of Ji Shengde 's lawyer : First , more than half of Ji 's stolen money can be recovered .  Because Ji Shengde spent most of his stolen money buying luxurious houses in Beijing , whose prices are still rising now .  
This kind of powerful strategic goal , together with the relatively rigid policy of President-elect George W . Bush towards China , surely helps one feel very confident in the resolve of the United States to protect Taiwan . It also stabilizes the gradual drift towards instability among military powers and national powers across the straits .  Because of this , the judgment of some people regarding the future of Taiwan now appears to be excessively pessimistic .  
In the bill requesting deliberation on the draft revision , Premier Zhu Rongji and CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin said : Since the regulations were put into force , they have played an important role in making the corps of our military officers more revolutionary , lowering the average age of officers , raising the their educational level , and making them more professionally competent , as well as heightening the initiative and creativity of the large numbers of officers .  
Yu Yongbo said : To carry out the spirit of CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin 's instructions that the military should " fight to win " and " never change its nature " and to meet the requirements on our military officers posed by the new situation and tasks , new requirements that military officers must be " loyal to the CPC , and must have firm revolutionary ideal and conviction and possess modern military knowledge " are added to the basic requirements of military officers stipulated in the current regulations .  
To meet the new situation of reform of the system of cultivating and replenishing military officers and the need of the development of troop modernization building , the draft revision includes particular stipulations on the supply of military officers .  These stipulations include : outstanding enlisted personnel and graduates of ordinary secondary specialized schools can be promoted to officers only after they have studied in and graduated from a military academy ;  
Experiences leading to the gratifying situation in the air force 's flight safety record are varied and can chiefly be summed up as follows .  First , all air force units always insist on applying the new period 's military strategic thinking in managing things , placing military training at the center of all work , giving priority to flight training arrangements , and well maintaining continuity in flight and in training course .  Second is persistence in subjecting units to tough and strict training .  
The youth military academy activities carried out in elementary and junior high schools and the military training conducted in senior high schools and institutions of higher education proved effective in giving national defense education to young people ; these measures are widely accepted by the students , their parents , school authorities , as well as the general public .  
He also disclosed : The flight squadrons currently stationed in the southeast coastal region are all crack troops with the most advanced equipment and weaponry in the Chinese air force , the most superb military technology , and the pilots with the greatest wealth of experience that can take off and conduct operations in all weather .  
Tens of thousands of troops from around the country took part in the exercises , encompassing all the military regions nationwide .  Branches of the military taking part in the exercises included rapid response units , amphibious armored units , digital artillery units , special operations units , marine corps units , airborne units , Army , Navy , and Air Force aviation units , and reservist units .  
According to the white paper " China 's National Defense in 2000 " published in mid-October of this year , since 1995 China has declared two rounds of military cuts , which resulted in the cutting of a total of 1.5 million personnel from the military , thereby significantly reducing the size of the military and streamlining military establishments .  Now the established size of the entire military is kept under the level of 2.5 million personnel , and consequently the Chinese military has embarked on the road toward streamlined armed forces with Chinese characteristics .  
" There is no lack of senior government officials and expert scholars who are familiar with East Asian affairs , international foreign affairs , and military security in the core members of the new Bush cabinet .  The basic tone and route of the China policy from Washington tends to establish a pragmatism .  We have to deal with it in a calmer and more rational attitude of dealing with concrete matters relating to work . "  
The high-ranking MND official pointed out : In recent months , the Chinese Communists have not engaged in any large-scale exercises along the coast , nor have there been unusual troop movements .  It is possible that the Chinese Communists are trying to create an atmosphere favorable to the opening of small-scale three links .  Our military has put in place defense and relevant security measures on the offshore islands .  Having inferred possible scenarios , the MND has concluded that there is no need to adjust the military strength on the offshore islands in the near future .  
The official said emphatically : Using simulated systems , our military long ago practiced ways of coping with possible moves by the Chinese Communist troops and came up with several contingency plans .  The US military provided relevant information and data specifically for this purpose .  It assisted Taiwan 's military in analyzing , through the application of the " net assessment " method , possible moves by the Chinese Communist troops for use as reference in contingency planning .  
From the perspective of business line , 12 of the 14 key industries monitored - - light industry , textile industry , machinery industry , metallurgical industry , petrochemical industry , building materials industry , tobacco industry , nonferrous metal industry , electronics industry , gold industry , pharmaceutical industry , and power industry - - have realized greater profits in varying degrees , and the net loss of coal industry and military industry has markedly decreased .  
and shall consciously devote themselves to the cause of national defense " ; Section Three shall be revised as : " Shall have attained a certain theory or policy standard ; shall have mastered modern military , scientific , cultural , or professional knowledge ;  
( 3 ) Have the theories , policy level , modern military , scientific culture , specialized knowledge , organizational and command capabilities , go through school training and achieve the corresponding record of formal schooling and physical health required for assumption of the responsibilities of one 's job ;  
Li Chieh also indicated that , considering the operational management problems on the elongated Taiwan Strait , the numerous missiles deployed on shores , and the limited operational space in the Strait , if the Navy can carry out mobile ocean-going missions from a greater distance , the Navy 's operations would not be confined in the Taiwan Strait and could hinder Communist China 's military deployments and prevent it from mobilizing its full force into operations in the Taiwan Strait .  
The two sides stressed that the friendly cooperative treaty should be based on safeguarding the security and interests of the two countries and their peoples , and that the Sino-Russian strategic cooperative partnership should be substantiated on the political , economic , and military fronts . 
Thus , the Taiwan side may possibly ask for procuring Kidd-class destroyers before the opening of the annual US-Taiwan arms sales negotiations scheduled to be held in April . If this is really true , newly elected President Bush will meet , for the first time , a grim challenge in handling the subtle military balance between " China " and Taiwan .  
Guided by theoretical study , we should step up study of the international strategic situation and the characteristics and law of military management under the high-technology local war conditions and the new situations ; we should actively organize and coordinate military organs , military academies , scientific research units , and the troops , to systematically study crucial and difficult problems .  
Since the US economy has grown strongly in recent years , its military strength far outstrips anyone else , and it controls international organizations such as the World Trade Organization and the World Bank , many in political and academic circles have become dizzy and declared that the US pursuit of world " unipolarization " is historically inevitable .  
The military made numerous fruitful results in ideological and political building , started sci-tech training , steadily promoted logistical reform , markedly improved armaments , and continued to raise the overall combat effectiveness .  
and thus laid a solid foundation for raising its own overall standard and for its own development as well .  The corporation also sorted out a clear-cut train of thought for developing civil products , clearly identified goals ; and secured fresh progress in respect of pluralizing the principal body of investment for backbone civil products , separating civil products from military ones , listing civil products separately in production , and industrializing hi-tech civil products .  
It was learned that in the 10th Five-Year Plan period , apart from readjusting scientific research or production capacity for military products , the corporation is also expected to further streamline production of key military products ; preliminarily industrialize its scientific research and production capacity for hi-tech military products ; further develop civil products with active efforts in setting up separate production lines for such products , in separating civil products from military ones , and in listing civil products separately in production as well .  
The corporation will further the work of structural transformation and joint-venture or cooperative operation ; will work hard to pluralize property rights , ensure scale operation , and pluralize the principal body of investment for civil products as well ; will focus on developing civil products of high or new technology , which are usable for both military and civil purposes ;  
3 .  The faction that thinks it is impossible to maintain the status quo , but readjustment should be made gradually : Japan 's demand to become a political and military big country will become an irresistible trend in Japan 's political arena in the future .  The United States can only pay attention to the regional power structure and the popular will at home , and readjust bilateral relations step by step in accordance with such demand .  
By contrast , the mainland China developed most of its military weapons by itself .  During the same period , it purchased a total of $ 2.59 billion worth of regular weapons from around the world , ranking 14th in the world .  The key country where the mainland China purchased its weapons from was Russia , from which $ 2.12 billion worth of weapons were imported .  
The " Epilogue - - China 's New Century " gave full expression to the firm determination of the entire military troops and civilian people throughout the country to closely rally around the party central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core and build our country into a rich and powerful modern socialist nation with a high degree of civilization and democracy in the new century .  
The procedures have further perfected the organizational structure of leadership over the work of protecting military facilities ; specified and concretized respective stipulations on the protection of military restricted zones and military directorial zones ; reinforced protective measures concerning the military facilities which are not assigned to any military restricted zone or military directorial zone ;  
While talking about Sino-US ties , he said : Last year , Chinese and US leaders conducted a successful meeting .  The two countries have enjoyed smooth economic and trade development .  Bilateral cooperation in scientific , technological , educational , cultural , military , and other aspects has also been continuously strengthened .  
To this end , Japan has changed its previous military deployment against the Soviet Union and comprehensively moved its main force to the west and southwest .  This year , it has also decided to establish an " island-protection force " to cope with the " activities of China 's naval vessels . "  Japan has even planned to equip itself with aircraft carriers in the next 15 years .  
Under such strategic positioning , the Indian military has worked out a multi-directional strategic principle of " attacking the west , resisting the north , going south , and maintaining stability internally , " which means that India should adopt a posture of vigorous offensive against Pakistan in order to defeat it once and for all ; 
India 's concept of military strategy has always been linked with the issue of territory .  Moreover , it entertains the idea of not hesitating to go to war .  For example , it has defined an offensive principle of " piecemeal encroachment of territory , internal subversion , military superiority , and strategic deterrent . "  
Le Kha Phieu spoke highly of the fruitful cooperation in the political , economic , cultural and military fields between Vietnam and China and appreciated China 's great achievements in reform and opening up .  He also said Vietnam attaches great importance to China 's experience and believes that the friendly cooperation between the two countries and the two armed forces will surely develop better in the new century .  
Beijing 's military theorists , including international strategists and military commanding experts , are relatively calm about the US military reinforcing Guam . They held that the Unites States has long been using military forces to surround China , not because of the strengthening of national power of the mainland .  Therefore , it is unnecessary to get excited about the shift in US military forces .  The things to do are only to keep up the analysis of US military forces .  
The US military 's expansion of its nuclear submarine base in Guam has a relatively particular purpose .  It wants to use Guam as an experimental site for US nuclear submarines in the new century .  For instance , a submarine 's deep-water communications and data image transmission and the suitability of undersea launching of missiles under new fighting conditions can all be tested at the base in Guam .  
When inspecting Fort Stewart military base as commander-in-chief of armed forces for the first time on Monday this week , Bush announced that the military expenditure for the next fiscal year would be increased by another $ 14 billion , bringing the total US military budget to $ 31 billion .  
In recent years , thanks to the sustained boom of the US economy , the pay in nonmilitary sectors has been increasing rather fast and the appeal of the armed forces has diminished .  Outstanding talent is unwilling to serve in the military and those who are already in the military are not contented .  
According to the " Provisional Procedure , " military cadres at the divisional level and those who are below the battalion level and who have served in the military for less than 20 years will continue to be assigned jobs when transferred to civilian work .  The local party committees and governments concerned should be responsible for arranging jobs for these cadres .  
The amount of the pension should be calculated on the basis of 80 percent of the monthly pay , military-rank pay , plus the standard allowance of the military cadre at the level equivalent to the new civilian job and the total of basic and length-of-service wages in the military .  
They may be settled in the original places of their spouses or the location of their marriage .  If their spouses have moved with the military units and have been registered residents for four years in Beijing , three years in Shanghai , or two years in Tianjin , Chongqing , a provincial or regional capital , or a city of a sub-provincial level or if their spouses are registered residents in any other cities , they may settle in that city .  
The broad masses of transferred military cadres , on the other hand , should preserve and carry forward the fine tradition of the people 's army , serve the interests of the whole , support the reform program , and show understanding and sympathy for the difficulties experienced by the state and local authorities in trying to settle them .  They should take the initiative to obey the arrangements made by the organization and work hard at their new posts to make fresh contributions to the cause of socialist modernization .  
For example , when Israeli forces deployed attack helicopters to pursue and kill a Palestinian military officer on 13 February , the US State Department spokesperson voiced a rare and stern criticism of Israel for this " premeditated assassination " and stated that Israel should be held responsibility for the ever-increasing wave of violent conflicts .  
Left Winger Deng 's 10,000-word Memorial Criticizes " Three Represents " It is understood that the " anti-Jiang faction " is composed mainly of retired senior party and military cadres .  A few serving officials and those officials dissatisfied with a graft probe into their children , secretaries or themselves , also have joined the faction , gradually developing activities against Jiang within the party .  
The " record , " citing the US election campaign and other detailed examples , lays bare the myth of American " democracy " and completely brings to light its escalating violence , unfair judicature , the widening gap between the rich and the poor , worrying economic and social rights of workers , serious gender discrimination , children being in a grim situation , unchanged racial discrimination , bad benefits for minorities , exhausting all resources for military buildup , and brutal infringements on other countries ' human rights .  
Russia has three major weapons : strategic nuclear missiles , anti-satellite weaponry , and directional anti-missile high-energy laser and particle beam weaponry .  But Russia today does not have the money to continue to develop them .  Taking advantage of the other 's problem , the United States is setting a trap for Russia by using its NMD program to egg Russia on to develop high-expense anti-missile system , thereby causing Russia 's national economy to be bled white by huge outlay of military expenses .  
Theoretical study classes and Marxist philosophy lectures were organized at all levels to help leading cadres systematically study the theory of dialectical materialism and historical materialism and to guide grass-roots officers and servicemen and cadets in military schools and academies to master the basic viewpoints of the materialist and atheist theory of Marxism .  
Meanwhile , with a view to successfully fulfilling the target of building up a regular , younger , and knowledgeable military , the Central Military Commission has recently selected and promoted from the basic level of all major military regions a group of forty-something cadres with university educational background and above to both the army and divisional levels , as a back-up force for the leading bodies of all major military regions .  
The relevant department disclosed that the Chinese People 's Liberation Army will increase the salaries and benefits of its officers and soldiers ( including the salaries of nonmilitary personnel and the allowances for soldiers ) next month .  The increase rate is about 25 percent over the current salaries .  This expense will be incorporated in the total military spending budget worked out by Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng under the national financial expenditure for this year .  
They should lay special emphasis on the study of the international strategic situation , high-tech local warfare , and the law of military management characteristic of the new situation so as to keep enhancing the scientific nature and effectiveness of their work of PLA construction and preparedness for military struggles .  
In answering a relevant question raised by a foreign journalist , Zhu Bangzao said that the US military spending this year is $ 14 billion more than last year and this increase is almost equivalent to China 's national defense spending last year .  Double standard should not be used on this issue .  
The main reasons for China to increase its national defense spending this year is to ensure that the living standard of the servicemen will improve simultaneously with social and economic development and with the increase in the average income of urban and rural residents , and to meet the needs of the modernization of national defense and the reform of the military management structure .  
All the armed forces stood up to the rigorous tests of complicated international and domestic situations as well as military and political struggles , always kept a high degree of stability , centralization , and unification , and accomplished with flying colors such tasks as conducting major military exercises , fighting floods and dealing with emergencies , holding a military review in celebration of the 50th founding anniversary of the PRC , and assuming the defense responsibilities in Hong Kong and Macao , making important contributions to defending and building the motherland .  
Ichiro Ozawa , a radical politician and the current head of the opposition Liberal Party published his article in a magazine in 1999 , entitled " my proposal of constitutional amendment , " which said that the current constitution was forcefully formulated during the occupation of the US military , therefore , the constitution is invalid .  
Afterwards , Wang Zhongyu heard reports from the Hebei Provincial Committee , the provincial government , the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee , and city government leaders , and fully affirmed the work of the provincial and municipal Party committees and governments , the rapid action of the military , military police , and public security police , prompt rescues , and effective measures .  Furthermore , he provided concrete requests and suggestions for the next steps in the rescue work , helping the injured , cracking the case , and protecting social stability .

It focuses on the implementation of a zero-base budget in a bid to bring into full play the role of macro-economic control of the budget .  In this way , it can gradually form a new budgetary system for the armed forces , in which financial power and financial resources are concentrated , military spending is scientifically distributed , budgetary items are specific and transparent , and supervision and restraint are tight .  
Moreover , although many military experts have identified Aegis warships as the " former TMD system , " Lieutenant General ( ?  Biersi ) [ name as transliterated ] , former commander of the US 10th submarine fleet who retired three years ago , seriously warned the Taiwan authorities during his visit to Taiwan at the beginning of this year , saying that the original design of the Aegis was not targeted at the anti-missile system such as the TMD , but now everybody believes that it can be used to confront ballistic missiles .  
The Bush administration 's foreign-policy team is still intoxicated with irrational economic prosperity in the 1990s , and it has not yet realized that the biggest challenge the United States is going to face will not a military but an economic one ; the fatal weakness of the Bush administration is that its senior financial and economic officials lack the prestige to stabilize the confidence of Wall Street investors .

So starting from the present , the party should expand the channels for participation and communication , so that party members and cadres have ample opportunity to express their opinions . A view of the current political situation reveals ever-changing and treacherous trends and widespread military conflict . The antagonism between the two extremes of freedom and slavery as well as of democracy and totalitarianism has never let up in the least .  
Under principles of " internationalization and liberalization " the system should be harmonized with those of our major trading partners . Consideration should be given to eliminating the exemption for military personnel and teachers as well as unreasonable erosions of the tax base ( like leaving out interest income up to 360,000 NT dollars or from stock trading ) , simplifying tax brackets , lowering the highest rates , and looking into the tax reporting method ; these are all concrete proposals to make a thorough reform of the tax system .

" Having vanished from Chinese history around the first century A . D . , the Hsiung-nu resurfaced in European history in the fourth century when they crossed the Don in pursuit of the westward-fleeing Alans and won complete victory in a great battle with the Ostrogoths and Visigoths , after which they established a kingdom on the Hungarian plain .  
According to research by Hsia Li-ming associate professor at Taitung Normal College , there is a marked difference between Chinese imperial maps , produced to meet the political and military requirements of the court , and European navigation charts of the same period , where the commercial interest is foremost .  
Although political considerations have held them back from making any aggressive move so far , from a purely military perspective our success during the 1958 Kinmen bombardment in downing 31 MiGs against one plane lost and gaining air supremacy over the Taiwan Strait , together with our subsequent vigilant posture , have actually made them weigh the cost of attacking Taiwan by force , " is how assemblyman Ting Shou-chung of the Legislative Yuan 's defense committee sees it . "  
For example , one of the most successful items in this year 's old people 's consumer exhibition by the social affairs department was undoubtedly the " old people 's manpower bank " organized by the Women 's Outreach Center . Over 300 people signed up on the spot , and in due course another 50 be came official members , including retired military officers , retired doctors , teachers , banking personnel and civil servants .  
Data indicates that if the mainland authorities launch an attack on Taiwan regardless of internal democratic opposition and the cost in casualties - - one third to one quarter of their combined forces manpower - - then they have three possible options for military action : The first is attacking the islands one by one , starting with Kinmen , Matsu and the Pescadores , at the same time using their air and sea dominance , and missiles , to strike military , political and economic targets on Taiwan itself .  
Submarines lose some of their superiority in the relatively shallow Taiwan Straits , where sea trenches are not wide enough for use , and military experts believe there can be at the most only thirteen mainland submarines deployed around Taiwan , to the north , east , south and southwest where the waters are deeper .  
Something worth mentioning is that with new military equipment largely automated and technological , future manpower needs will be reduced , which eases the problem that has been caused for the navy by the shortened term of naval conscription .  
Excellent personnel quality has always been the strongest point of our national defense . During annual recruiting for the combined forces academy , the proportion of enrollees for the navy is usually the highest , which underlines the quality standards required by the navy . In recent years however the numbers seeking admission to military school have fallen steadily , with the navy feeling the bite more than the other forces because of its reputation for the hard life .  
Explains an experienced naval officer : " Because they are versatile and swift , they can get anywhere nearby within a very short period of time . Stationing them at outer islands increases combat strength throughout the seas around Taiwan . In combination with onshore missiles they amount to a formidable control over the Taiwan Straits . " Whenever there is a fourth-degree alert the missile speedboats are ordered to deploy to outer islands , and when the alert is raised to third-degree they disperse among military harbors , ready for combat at anytime .  
The end of combat zone administration is not like simply cutting a watermelon in two - - one chop for a clean break with no complications . The regulations , personnel organization , administrative measures and so on that remain from over thirty years under the system of combat zone administration all have to be changed . So there are many areas where the military authorities and local government will have to work together in the future .  
Some grown-up " overseas students , " who have fulfilled their military obligations or finished junior college in Taiwan , have organized a club for them called the Chinese Youth Association . Besides holding lots of outdoor activities to let them work off steam so they can fall asleep as soon as their head touches the pillow when they get home , the older members help the students with their homework or find doctors or lawyers for them in case of emergencies . "  
In Europe , many countries that have achieved a certain level of economic development have devoted more and more resources to advancing technology in medicine , environmental protection and other areas related to public welfare rather than engaging in the all-out pursuit of economic strength or military power . The Soviet Union , on the other hand , lagged way behind Europe , North America and Japan in developing consumer-oriented technology , but it was undeniably a scientific and technological power in terms of its achievements in military research and development . "  
Under a situation that was too much even for the Cantonese character , renowned for its defiant tendency , the natives could only cause relatively minor disturbances for the British military , and the " shame of changing masters " became deeply embedded in their hearts . Yet the threads of nationalist thinking had not yet come together in the minds of the people .  
The civil officials judge the good and the bad - - the military carry out the punishment ; ox-headed and horse-faced demon messengers from purgatory detain the criminal and the gold and silver generals put him or her in a cangue ; the white messenger of death turns his eyes up fiercely and sticks out his tongue , while the black messenger carries the arrest warrant . You can not help but tremble in such a sinister atmosphere .  
Because the Japanese military imposed strict order , any photography that included topographic features , military bases , or indeed any photo whose field of vision extended downward more than 45 degrees had to be approved by the military police . Thus it was difficult for ordinary people to photograph freely outdoors .  
Actually , public and private schools have a deep connection . A few of the schools were established by retired members of the military dog training center . Also , when the police canine division was first formed , they trained both the people and the dogs by relying on the long experience of private dog schools .  
At one time - - I do not know what it was about - - a military warden was up on the platform , droning on and on , when a hissing noise rose up from all the students below . I could see the principal standing at the side , smiling , with no expression of being unhappy about the situation . " Wu Chin-fa thinks that the leeway given to the students by Kao-hsiung High during the period of martial law made a lasting impact on him .  
The end of Autumn Chrysanthemum is a happy scene of great coming together amidst the conflict between different ethnic groups . The children from the military dependents villages used the fraternal method of financial gifts and peace mediation ( in Wu Chin-fa 's eyes , the children from the military dependents villages had the most resources in those years ) , to smooth over the conflicts between Fukienese-Taiwanese and Hakka-Taiwanese factions , and resolve a scene of bloody conflict .  
At present 25% of the national budget goes for defense and the military ; 20% goes toward economic development ; routine government administrative costs account for 10% ; 15% is applied to education . . . . The remaining few percent is up for grabs among public health , agriculture , social welfare , religious , and other interests , naturally leading to the " squeezing out " effect .  
Five years later the low wall around the city had been completed , and artillery placements were added to all four gates ( north , south , east , and west ) to ward off attacks from indigenous peoples or foreign military units . The internal and external walls were each twenty feet thick , and there was a moat around the outside . Such was China 's southernmost county seat .  
In the early years , the Japanese sealed off the mountain areas in order to weaken Taiwan 's ability to resist their power , but after detailed exploration by the Japanese government , gold was mined in large quantities from 1897onwards . It is estimated that the main veins were all worked out within less than 20 years . All this gold was shipped back to Japan , where it became a major source of finance for the imperial army 's purchases of military equipment from abroad .  
In 1987 , he finished a survey of the western section of the Ching dynasty Patungkuan Trail over Mt . Yushan , and uncovered many sections of well-preserved Ching stone paving . At the site of a Ching military camp , he collected numerous fragments of blue and white porcelain crockery , which were identified by the National Palace Museum as products of the Dehua kiln in Fujian Province .  
The essence is entirely in the trailThese small foot paths and trails have gone from being the indigenous people 's " settlement trails " in earliest times , to being " military affairs roads " or " barbarian management roads , " to being the " fitness trails , " " historical sites " and " scenic routes " of today 's national park . Their roles have often changed , but their importance is the same as of old .  
On this day they paid honor to the flag god and inspected the military troops . " Swords and spears bright as snow , banners bright and colorful " accompanied the cold , harsh autumn . It truly carried a sad chill : " The brave warrior goes off , never to return " !  
Though the palace stands tall in a central position in downtown Taipei with countless people and vehicles streaming along the wide roads on all sides , the heavy guard of military police all around it has long made it an unapproachable , sternly mysterious forbidden territory in the eyes of the public .  
The tall central tower on top of the Presidential Palace is also the object of much curiosity . Every day at dawn and at 5:50 each afternoon , the public can watch the flag raising and lowering ceremonies , in which two military policemen hoist or take down the national flag on top of the tower . But just what kind of world is hidden inside the tower ?  
And so in 1901 , when the Governor-General 's Residence was completed ( now the Taipei Guest House ) , it was luxuriously expansive and well appointed . The Japanese craftsmen designed the space imitating the baroque style in order to show their noble authority . Widening Tungmen Street , which originally led through the East Gate , they left the Gate as the center of a traffic circle , so as to make it convenient for military parades as well as every-day horses and carriages . Full of traffic , the road was very impressive .  
These programs were connected to the political plan Japan had for its colony : Japanese leaders felt that Taiwan occupied an important strategic position astride the East and South China seas , and the navy was especially anxious to exert effective control over Taiwan and the Pescadores . Not only did they want to build Taiwan into a base for further military expansion , they hoped to squeeze the colony for its economic resources ( such as sugar ) to support capitalist economic development in the mother country .  
Mainland textbooks on the other hand stress the Communist Party of China 's development of an all-out resistance campaign behind enemy lines , stressing that " the Nationalist government , for fear of unleashing the great power of the people to resist the Japanese , only mobilized the government and the army in partial resistance , leading to severe military failures . The CPC implemented a total war of resistance , effectively complementing the Kuomintang 's overall military strategy and threatening the enemy 's rear . "  
But even though high-level medical technology ca n't be provided on location in these remote districts , where populations number in the hundreds , combined medical assistance should be sufficient , through telemedicine , mobile medical care , and public-sponsored rural physician visitation services , all of which have been carried out for many years , as well as the backup system of offshore military medical services .  
The anonymous sender wrote on it that it was composed 600 years ago by Liu Bowen , a wise and resourceful military counsellor to the first Ming emperor Zhu Yuan-zhang . The sender also added notes next to the crucial words and phrases to indicate that the poem had anotheinterpretation : " When the Taiwanese independence movement falls , where will Chen Shui-bian go ? Chrysanthemum flowers fall , plum flowers bloom , prospects unfold for the new united front and Jaw Shau-kong . " ( The characters for Jaw 's name appeared in the poem . )  
At this time , " the editorial read , " the highest military official for Hebei was absent . Civil and military officials at all levels had been ordered to just stay in their positions , so they were even more cautious and restrained than usual . It is inconceivable that the local Chinese forces would have dared to spark an incident during the night maneuvers by the Japanese forces .  
Even if his academic record was n't anything special , he worked to help support his family . He was quick at making chicken cages , and early every morning would wash and shell the dried fava beans that his mother bought at the wholesale market and sold from her front door outside the military dependents ' village . "  
The elephant veteranWhen they arrived at the military base at the head of Fengshan Bay , Ah-Lan passed away , perhaps because she could not adjust to the new environs . And because the military was not actively engaged , the remaining two elephants could only look forward to retirement . Later on , they were sent straight up to the Taipei Zoo , then located in the northern suburb of Yuanshan .  
Many young people , unable to find work immediately after completing their military service , see driving a taxi as a job which offers independence and an apparently reasonable income , so they enter this " reception center for the unemployed and waystation for those changing jobs . "  
To be fair , the three military drama troupes held many morale-boosting public performances and competitions over the years , which soothed the homesickness of those mainland officers and soldiers who moved to Taiwan early on . They have served overseas to promote Chinese culture , and they have helped prevent the disappearance of the Peking dramatic arts . The problem is that art and the military simply make peculiar bedfellows .  
Therefore , over the last ten years , the three Peking opera troupes went on fewer and fewer military entertainment missions . The main mission of the troupes became entertaining at veteran 's homes , participating in the annual national drama competition and performing for the public .  
" This is not just an issue about 200 people 's livelihoods , or who 's going to take over . It 's more about redefining Peking opera and readjusting the guidelines for national cultural development , " says National Institute of the Arts teacher Wen Chiu-chu , who just completed research on " Taiwanese Peking opera . " The three military opera troupes used to be cultural products forcibly cultivated by the government . They used up quite a lot of national resources , and under excessive protection they lost their ability to be innovative and different .  
It was discovered that in maledominated jobs-the military and police , construction workers , machinists-men use various roundabout methods to " mark their territory . " Thus posters of naked women , impossible to avoid seeing , are put up in factories . Or construction workers will urinate openly right in front of passing women . It even happens that women scholars doing field research or female students supporting labor rights may find themselves in dangerous situations in such environments .  
Porter pointed out that previous ideas about national power and competitive advantage focused on countries with vast territory and abundant natural resources , which ideally were backed up by military strength .  
Because Kaohsiung harbor has a huge capacity , and is a pivotal spot for routes to southeast Asia , in the Japanese occupation era the authorities made it a concentration point for heavy industry and petroleum refining . After the outbreak of the war in the Pacific , Japan used Kaohsiung as a base for advancing southward , and established many military facilities there .  
Satellites , in accordance with their different functions and missions , can be divided into five categories : scientific satellites are used to conduct scientific research in space ; surveillance satellites are used to obtain military intelligence ; resource satellites collect information on global resources ; weather satellites monitor atmospheric conditions and collect information for meteorological prediction ; and finally communication satellites , which are in high demand for their wide range of communication applications .  
Chen Hung-wei , a journalism student at Chengchi University , began to play the Japanese version of " The Three Kingdoms , " a game incorporating Chinese history and military strategy , two years ago . Not knowing Japanese did n't stop him from enjoying the game ; he spent the entire summer vacation after his freshman year attacking cities , invading countries and opening up the borderlands , often playing all night long .  
And , because the Three Kingdoms requires a knowledge of military tactics , it pushes players to study history more deeply outside the game . Tu 's son , a fifth grader , has carefully read a colloquial Chinese translation of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms ( the original is written in the difficult classical Chinese ) in order to better play the game , allowing his father to see the game 's charm firsthand .  
The southern Taiwan sun beats down on the low , densely packed buildings of Er-kung New Village , a military dependents ' community in Tainan County . In the morning market , the crowds seem to boil . In contrast , the expansive grounds of Our Lady of the Assumption Church , located in the center of the village , seem particularly cool and serene .  
Coincidentally , the great Roman general Julius Caesar also bound military carriages to the backs of elephants and used them to invade Britain . But this was only after the famed Carthaginian general Hannibal had crossed the Alps with 37 elephants in a sneak attack on Rome . In spite of their superior military strength , the Romans suffered serious losses in the attack . After such an unforgettable lesson , the Romans " imported " elephants for military use .  
A military gap ? Professor Chung has considerable confidence in the current naval forces of the ROC . He says that , leaving aside nuclear weapons , Taiwan 's maritime defense level , including ships , weapons systems , and personnel quality , is ahead of the PRC by 10 to 15 years .  
The new submarines run very quiet , so they are not easily detectable . Their fire control , sonar , and underwater detecting systems are all linked automatically in real-time mode , so they can go operational very rapidly . " They are superior to any diesel submarine in the PRC fleet , " says Sung Yu-ning , editor of Defense Technology Monthly and a long-time observer of military technology .  
The US plays the leading role under the newly issued Guidelines , while Japan will support the US in any military conflict around Japan . When there is a crisis involving a " regional " issue , the US is required to take responsibility for restoring peace and security in the " region . " Japan , meanwhile , is obliged to keep open its base facilities , airfields , and ports , and provide support to US forces in operating in international waters and airspace .  
Some have suggested that in the wake of the cold war , the world is too peaceful , but the nation must have enemies . And in the process of passing the EEA , the US Justice Department stressed that " economic security " was a major part of national security , as important as military security . Furthermore , it estimates that foreign governments and companies have robbed American companies of more than US $ 100 billion in profits and many millions of lost jobs by stealing trade secrets . Productivity and national power are closely linked .  
Amid the growing voices of opposition widespread attacks on the government 's monopoly of radio broadcasting were heard . After much discussioon about broadcast policies , the government began in 1993 to turn over radio bands that were originally reserved for military use , and nearly 120 new mid - and low-range local stations were granted licenses .  
In late 1928 , undeterred by Japanese obstruction , Zhang resolutely decided that the northeast should change flags , thus reestablishing the unity of China after a long period of fragmentation . In September 1930 , when a military campaign by Chiang Kai-shek against two northern warlords was at a stalemate , Zhang sent a telegram pledging his allegiance to the central government , and dispatched forces from the northeast into the Beijing-Tianjin area . This put an end to the six-month-old civil war , and again helped restore national unity .  
The Western powers were at the time entering a depression and had no energy to interfere in the affairs of the East . Secondly , blockading of the Communists was underway in Jiangxi . The Nanjing-Guangdong split had occurred , when leading military and political figures established an alternative government after the arrest of Hu Hanmin . The Yangtze also flooded with calamitous consequences , leaving millions of people dead or dislocated .  
Various parties have speculated on different possible causes , including engine stoppage and hijacking . Others have even suggested that the plane was victim of an artillery shot fired during recent military exercises . However , on the day of the crash the military called off area exercises due to rain , ruling out this last possibility . But until the aircraft 's black box is recovered , there is no way of really knowing what happened .  
An ad hoc task force comprising both civilian and military investigators is now hard at work on the case , but has discovered signs that many documents have either been lost or falsified . Many worrisome questions remain unanswered : How many people are involved ? How high up does the case reach ?  
The Investigation Bureau has received a tip that organized crime might be involved in the development of a radio communications system and related equipment , a project being carried out by the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology on contract to the armed forces . Commenting on the recent spate of scandals within the military , Assistant Professor Sung Hsiao-yuan comments : " The likelihood of corruption increases in direct proportion to the degree to which an organization is closed . The same holds true regarding the level of technical expertise required to carry out its operations . "  
Hau Pei-tsun , a former premier as well as chief of the General Staff , was a member of the armed forces for most of his career . Speaking about his experience as chief of the General Staff , Hau has stated that the military already has a perfectly sound procurement system , and that the important thing is the ethical standards of the officers in charge . If top generals get involved in politics and start engaging in tricky power plays , the military will naturally fall into disarray .  
Li Chin-kuo , a graduate of the Institute of Zoology at National Taiwan University , has always been concerned about wildlife . After the FS Studio class , he used the limited amount of money that he had been able to save during his compulsory military service to buy a digital video camera and a second-hand car , and headed off to fishing villages in search of material .  
They helped Chang retrace his first heartthrob , who he has never forgotten , and also his middle school military instructor , who devoted great efforts to guiding him . He is thrilled at the idea of expressing gratitude through TV , saying it is 100 times more effective than contacting these people in private . " I can let the whole world know how grateful I am to them ! "  
In military affairs , after the PRC unilaterally broke off negotiations in 1995 , they initiated a series of missile tests in the Taiwan Strait . According to the ROC Ministry of Defense , in recent years the PRC has continually seen Taiwan 's new generation of military capabilities as its primary hypothetical enemy and undertaken numerous military exercises based on this premise . In addition , the national defense report just issued by the PRC emphasized repeatedly that the possibility of using armed force against Taiwan could not be excluded .  
Of Taiwan 's offshore islands , because Kinmen and Matsu are in a high state of military readiness , it would be costly to attack them . Thus , the PRC could choose to assault those islands in the South China Sea which are currently occupied by ROC forces . Another possible form of small-scale military conflict would be the use of surface-to-surface guided missiles . Since the political effectiveness of such missiles against offshore islands would be limited , these would more likely be targeted against political or economic centers in Taiwan itself .  
According to the PRC 's national defense white paper for this year , mainland China has realized that there is a global trend toward domination of the battlefield through high-technology weapons . Therefore , the PLA is aggressively " moving along the path of a streamlined , high-quality military with Chinese characteristics . " The PRC plans to reduce its total armed forces by 500,000 men within three years , so that the PLA will stabilize at a level of about 2.5 million personnel .  
In order to achieve its new goals , the PRC has been buying or developing ( with the help of hired Russian experts ) SU-27 fighters , inter-continental ballistic missiles , and cruise missiles , and is forming a naval task force capable of independent operational capability . General Tang Fei , chief of the ROC general staff , judges that there are a number of objectives behind the PRC 's transformation of its military strategy .  
It hopes to raise its political status at a global level and at the Asia-Pacific regional level through the development of a high-technology operational capability . It also aims to increase its capability to deal with domestic and border area instability . Besides these , however , and of more immediate interest to Taiwan , another of the main goals behind mainland China 's new strategy is to maintain a reliable military threat to cope with Taiwan and its so-called " separatist tendencies . "  
With the end of the US-Soviet Cold War , the PRC has recognized that an enormous transformation has occurred in the global political and military structure . Bipolar confrontation has been replaced by regional or functional conflicts . Under these circumstances , middle-sized powers or regional powers can expand their international political influence .  
But looking only at the bilateral cross-strait relationship , there 's also a contradiction . On the one hand , despite occasional political dialogue , neither side has ever altered its basic position , and this is reflected in the fact that , in military affairs , each side sees the other as its most likely adversary . On the other hand , no matter how tense the situation gets between the two regimes , economic and social interaction between their citizens does not decline .  
In 1994 and 1995 , the question of whether Japan should take on a greater military role in Asia stirred intense controversy in many Asian countries . At that time , Lee Kwan Yew stated in no uncertain terms to American and Japanese news media that he was opposed to a stronger overseas role for the Japanese military . In stating his opposition , he told of his own terrifying experiences during the Japanese occupation of Singapore , and even spoke of a dark side to Japanese culture .  
Judging from the ROC national defense report , in which strategic thinking is guided by " no seeking of war but no fear of war , " it would have been be essential to respond flexibly ( i.e . at a parallel level ) to Communist China . Under such circumstances , there could have been rapid escalation to a military conflict .  
The chief culprit is suspected to be poor drainage at a disused military firing range on top of the hill . The Shihlin District Prosecutor 's Office is carrying out an investigation , and has not ruled out other possible causes , such as illegal logging , or that the drainage system for the whole area is inadequate .  
From 1957 on , the central government appointed three consecutive governors with military backgrounds . Behind this pattern was a tense military standoff with mainland China , which shelled the island of Kinmen heavily in 1958 . A number of projects designed to promote political stability and ensure economic and social survival and development were completed during these years .  
With regard to the organizational structure of the provincial government , Professor Cheng states that during the years when military men filled the governorship , administrative powers were highly concentrated in the hands of the central government . In 1967 , the city of Taipei came under the direct jurisdiction of the central government , whereas before it had been under the provincial government . In cities under the provincial government , the chief administrators of municipal districts , who had formerly been chosen by direct elections , also began to be appointed . The locals rule  
The program proved extremely popular and was aired for a full two years . Many of the documentary films used were collected by John Hei on trips overseas , and sometimes the ROC military even borrowed such material for information purposes .  
The Taiwan Garrison Command was established in 1958 , assuming complete control over martial law , police functions , entry to and exit from Taiwan , media and cultural censorship , postal spying , and military trials ( which could also be used in civilian cases ) .  
The object of traditional combat training was for war and self-defense . When military officers retired and moved back to their original homes , they brought their skills to a wider population , and thus martial arts began to spread . In the agricultural society of old , most people led plain lives , without time for such pursuits or the money to pay for training , which is why martial arts were generally passed down only in the families of the wealthy .  
For instance , before we broke ties with one nation , it informed us that it was facing economic collapse , that for eight months government workers had received no pay and that there had been three attempted military coups . They asked for US $ 120 million in loans or financial assistance , but this would only have been enough to meet their short-term debts .  
These are some of the main arguments that constitute Lin 's 1988 book China 's Nuclear Weapons Strategy , which is now available for the first time in a Taiwan translation in Lin 's recently published The Nuclear Hegemon . Although China 's Nuclear Weapons Strategy was published back in 1988 , it is still very enlightening for readers today to find out how Communist China 's nuclear weapons strategy is very much tied to Chinese strategic tradition . Anyone studying Communist China 's military can not ignore the influence of traditional strategic culture .  
In sum , by reading Lin 's new book , The Nuclear Hegemon , the reader can enjoy , first , a systematic look back at Communist China 's long road to becoming a nuclear power and its subtle use of traditional Chinese strategic thinking , as seen through the eyes of a Chinese . The reader can also come to understand the true capabilities of the PLA through the essays on PLA military modernization .  
In fact , American China policy has maintained a general direction based on three main national interests : democracy and human rights , economics and trade , and security and military strategy . The periodic swinging results from a tug of war between two groups of US domestic forces , one more accomodating toward Beijing such as the mainstream China scholars , the other more critical , such as the media . Nevertheless , Taipei seeks simultaneous improvement of relations with both Washington and Beijing .  
Due to the increased tension across the Taiwan Strait and incessant rumors of elevating levels of military alert , within five days Taiwan 's stock market shed more than a thousand points . On July 16 alone it plummeted 506 points , with total market value shrinking by more than NT $ 1.5 trillion . To prop up the market , the Ministry of Finance forced four major government-related funds-the postal savings fund , labor pension fund , labor insurance fund and civil service pension fund-to buy stock .  
" Hsinchu residents seem conservative and parochial on the surface , " says Chen Mei-chun , a researcher with Dandelion Workshop , " but once you have made contact you find that they can be very flexible , and highly spontaneous . " When Chen was studying at Tsinghua University she spent some time filming a documentary and collecting historical material in the Chincheng New Village , a military dependants settlement just across from the university .  
From Qingdao they went to Hunan and from Hunan to Guangzhou . Finally , hearing that the commanding officer of the forces defending the Penghu ( Pescadores ) Islands hailed from Shandong and was willing to look after the children of fellow Shandong natives , the school principals discussed the matter among themselves and decided to go to the Penghus . Male students aged 17 and over were to divide their time between study and military training ; boys under 17 and female students were to take classes in a separate school .  
In his Master 's thesis entitled War and the Taiwanese , Li Kuo-sheng states that the system first appeared after the January 28th Incident of 1932 , when the Japanese attempted unsuccessfully to invade the lower Yangtze valley from their concession in Shanghai . Okamura Yasuji , chief of staff of the Japanese Imperial Army , was anxious to bring an end to the endless patronizing of local prostitutes by Japanese soldiers . To this end he ordered the establishment of military " comfort stations " where the soldiers could take care of their sexual needs .  
Ho Pi-chen , chief executive officer of TWRF , strongly contests the contention of the Japanese government that the comfort women were engaged in private prostitution . In talking with former comfort women from many different countries , Ho has learned : " Most of these women were transported to the front on naval vessels . The comfort stations were built by the military , and the military determined how they were to be run . When the women got sick , they were attended to by military doctors .  
Chu notes in her research that after they captured the city of Haikou on Hainan Island in 1939 , the Japanese military ( operating through the Government-General of Taiwan ) ordered Taiwan Development to carry out economic development on the island . The company was given a wide range of tasks , and construction of buildings urgently needed by the occupying forces received top priority . Facilities built included administrative quarters , a mess hall , barracks , and a naval comfort station .  
Under the crisp and pleasant skies of late December , Mrs . Pu , a woman in her late fifties who lives in a military dependents ' village in Taoyuan , hastens to place her order for 40 catties ( 24 kg ) of streaky pork . When the meat arrives she chops it into one-catty strips , then steeps these in a marinade of dry-fried star anise and other spices , mixed with rock sugar , salt and Gaoliang liquor .  
The " organic law " will , among other changes , cause individual services to lose their respective intelligence agencies , which will be unified under the general staff . The political warfare system ( an autonomous system of political commissar-type officers , created in early Republican times , to ensure the loyalty of the military to the nationalist revolution 's leaders ) will be reorganized and its functions will undergo a qualitative change .  
Of course , different countries are in different situations , and the external threats faced by these countries are not comparable to the cross-strait situation . PRC military affairs expert Alex Kao concludes that although the idea of taking a war beyond Taiwan is worth consideration , it would only be really useful if it could be adopted into the national security structure and done in an integrated and comprehensive way .  
The Republic of Palau , situated on an archipelago in the Micronesia region of the South Pacific , occupies a strategic position both for international transport and in military terms . It has a total area of 488 square kilometers and a population of something over 18,000 . After being " discovered " by the Portuguese in 1783 , Palau was subsequently ruled by Spain and Germany . After WWI it was made a Japanese protectorate , and after WWII was governed by the US under a UN trusteeship .  
In response to these doubts , Chen Shui-bian stressed that Tang 's achievements in reforming the military during his tenure as minister of national defense were plain for all to see , and his enlightened working style and democratic approach were fully in accord with the principles of inclusive , clean government . Taiwan needed stability in which to pursue reform and progress , develop its economy and assure its national defense capability , and Tang was the best choice to bring this about .  
The various parties leveraged their carrots and sticks against their delegates , threatening expulsion for not supporting the neutralization of the National Assembly at the same time as they tried to appease their delegates . Finally , on April 24 these maneuvers helped bring about the passage of several constitutional revisions , including deactivation of the National Assembly , favorable provisions for residents of Taiwan 's offshore islands ( Kinmen , Matsu , and Penghu ) and military personnel , and revocation of lifelong special privileges for grand justices .  
1,000 years ago , under the rule of scholars who valued culture over military prowess , Song-dynasty China saw rapid economic development and brought forth remarkable cultural and artistic achievements .  
But county executive Chen Shui-tsai , who was in the military for decades and maintains close contacts with the local defense command , says that while he understands the importance of military security , people must recognize that Kinmen 's role has changed from that of defender to communicator . The military , he says , will simply have to make the necessary adjustments to coordinate with the implementation of the little three links . " The security-related measures chosen by the Ministry of Defense will be key to the smooth implementation of the little three links . "  
The only people allowed to fly in or out of Kinmen were senior military officials and persons in need of emergency medical treatment . A Kinmen native living in Taipei had to first spend two entire working days completing the paperwork , then take a day traveling by train to the southern port of Kaohsiung . From there the traveler boarded a military landing craft for a choppy trip back home lasting more than ten hours .  
The level of education soared , and a total of 43 candidates from Kinmen eventually passed the extremely competitive imperial examinations over the years . The military period began after the Mongols put an end to the Song dynasty in 1279 . Loyal Song subjects unwilling to submit to Mongol rule retreated to Kinmen . Four centuries later , after the Ming dynasty was conquered by Manchus from the north , Zheng Chenggong ( Koxinga ) used Kinmen as a base in his attempt to restore Ming rule .  
It was chilly inside the shack , and Lin Chong decided to go down to the village for some liquor . Following the military veteran 's directions he passed an old temple and came upon a little inn . The owner recognized the veteran 's bottle-gourd and gave Lin a friendly welcome . Once Lin had warmed up he bought some dried beef and liquor , and headed back to the fodder depot .  
On August 21 , the task force announced that Yin 's murder had been planned out in advance by persons who were currently active in the military service . One was Captain Chen Lu-tseng , chief of staff for former Navy Commander-in-Chief Chuang Ming-yao . Another was a high-ranking military official whose identity is too sensitive to reveal .  
The day after the quake , while watching TV , their son Li Chien-ho saw the familiar sign from the family hair-stylist shop collapsed on the road side , and rushed off to get a temporary leave from his military unit to go home . Returning to Chungliao after a five-hour motorcycle journey through the night , face-to-face with his devastated home and uncertain whether his mother was alive or dead , he burst into tears .  
They are convinced that humanitarian assistance is necessary and should be permanent . Some even suggested that service in agricultural assistance teams be allowed to substitute for compulsory military service , so that even more young people from Taiwan can participate in international humanitarian assistance . Let 's go back for a moment to August 22nd .  
I wanted to stand up and testify in my personal status-as a writer who was imprisoned , shackled , and beaten because I insisted on freedom of speech and refused to bow down before authoritarianism ; and as a " thought criminal " for whom a military court sought the death penalty-to the fact that the dark ages are over in Taiwan , and that mothers will no longer have to cry for political reasons .  
The latter was the northernmost of these three counties , and extended all the way to Taipei and Keelung , but settlers long declined to venture north of Touliu ( today the county seat of Yunlin ) . Further south in Tainan , the Dutch arrived in the 1620s and established a fortress called Zeelandia . Later in that century , the Ming loyalist Koxinga 's able minister Chen Yonghua adopted a policy of keeping Taiwan equally strong in both the cultural and military spheres . A period of cultural flowering ensued in the south .  
In 1874 the Japanese , acting under the pretext that certain Ryukyu islanders had been murdered in Taiwan , sent a military expedition to occupy Mutanshe in southern Taiwan . Then in 1884 France , having declared war on China , attacked and shut down Keelung . All this made the Manchu court realize Taiwan 's importance as a gateway to the seven provinces along the southeastern coast . Clearly , the aims of foreign powers vis-a-vis Taiwan had changed .  
Wang admitted to military investigators during initial questioning that six months earlier , acting alone , he had lowered himself down from the rooftop into his neighbors ' apartment looking for money . When Wu Ming-han heard noises and woke up , Wang panicked and hacked both Wu and his wife to death with a meat cleaver . Wang then stole NT $ 6,000 before returning to his own apartment .  
Not long after coming to Taiwan , Ho prepared a study entitled " Developing Organization behind Enemy Lines and Establishing Intangible Bases , " and sent it to Chiang Ching-kuo . Ho was summoned to meet with Chiang , and as a consequence was allowed to enter the army academy , from which he graduated ( in Class 20 ) at the " ripe old age " of 39 . But he did not enjoy any further special successes in his military career .  
Recalling how hard it was back then , just she and four students in a lumbering old military transport plane , the always hearty Chou laughs and relates : " The thing we were most afraid of was landing on the wrong side . As we were coming in on our approach , a student said to me , ' We 're OK . The sign says Recover the Mainland ! , not Liberate Taiwan ! ' "  
Not long afterwards , he was arrested by the Japanese military for a cartoon in a newspaper depicting a famous Chinese general from the Ming dynasty killing a " dwarf pirate . " ( " Dwarf pirate " has long been a derogatory term used by Chinese to refer to Japanese . ) He thereby became categorized as a " Chinese juvenile political criminal . "  
Lin Pao-chun says , " Before Historical Records , Chinese military strategy had absorbed the idea of ruling with compassion , and the highest objective of the student of the martial arts was to eliminate the violence in his own heart . Lin expands on this point , stating that in the ethos of the knight-errant , magnanimity was more important than fighting skill . Moreover , knights-errant were expected to be ethical , moral , honorable , decorous and patriotic , as well as protecting the common folk .  
9-11 has left us at the brink of war , but the possibility of military conflict as a result of US retaliation is not the only worry . A fluke incident and a single leader 's misjudgment in many other flashpoints worldwide could push us beyond the point of no return . The historic enmity between Israel and Palestine comes to mind , as do the ethnic and religious killing in Eastern Europe . North and South Korea are another cause for concern .  
Chen Bin , a gezai xi music composer who graduated from the music department at the Fujian Provincial Academy of the Arts , has noticed that when he composes music for a contemporary gezai xi work , stirring Western symphonies or military tunes always come into his head subconsciously , which is very much at odds with the warm , homey emphasis of traditional gezai xi .  
The Pearl S . Buck Foundation takes its name from the Nobel Prize winning author , Pearl S . Buck , whose unforgettable renderings of China and its people are contained in the classics The Good Earth and Dragon Seed . The foundation was established in Philadelphia in 1964 , and four years later a branch was established in Taiwan . At its inception , the focus of the organization was to address new social concerns engendered by the presence of the American military on the island , specifically the growing number of children of mixed Taiwanese-American parentage .  
After the government of the Republic of China came to Taiwan in 1949 , the island of Kinmen became the front line in the Chinese Civil War and an important military base . A huge network of tunnels was dug out underground , while , on the surface , lovely traditional villages remained totally intact .  
During the Ming dynasty an Inspection Office was set up here , and Kinmen became an important maritime defense settlement . After the commanding general , Zhou Dexing , said of the place , " It is as impregnable as a metal [ kin ] wall and a moat of boiling water , and it commands control of the ocean gate [ men ] , " it came to be called Kinmen . Thus Kinmen 's role as a key military strong point began several hundred years ago .  
Many of the works on display are considered to be national treasures in the mainland ; indeed , they are recognized as consummate works of art by experts in the international community , as well . This exhibit offers the opportunity to learn not only about the cosmopolitan nature of the Tang dynasty and its capital , Chang'an , but also allows us to recognize the Tang as the most glorious of ages , in terms of art , culture , Buddhism , and military and economic strength .  
Chang Shiang-hua , who played a leading role in the translation of these poems , points out : " No matter how much difference there may be in political , military , or economic values , no matter how much competition or even conflict there maybe , basic human nature can still in many respects be recorded in poetry , and convey the beauty and the purity of heart .  
In his faculty apartment at Tainan National College of Arts , there hangs a picture he took of a little girl in a military dependent 's village . The girl is wearing a simple white dress and her eyes are staring at the camera . It is Chang 's favorite photo .  
Efforts to cut back on plastic waste shifted into a higher gear on January 1 with a measure restricting the use of plastic bags and plastic ( including expanded polystyrene , i.e . " styrofoam " ) disposable eating utensils . This marks the second phase of implementation of a policy that was first introduced on a more limited scale last July , when the government clamped down on the use of such items by government agencies , membership supermarkets for military personnel , and public and private schools .  
After fulfilling his mandatory military service , Lin was reluctant to return to the bakery , but he could n't find any other work . He was n't happy with the thought of spending a life amidst flour and oil and standing next to a hot oven . He often switched jobs , shuttling between guest houses and leading a dissipated life .  
They include the medical teams of the International Cooperation and Development Fund , young men doing " overseas duty " as a substitute for military service , religious organizations , and individual doctors . They are performing a wide range of medical assistance activities not just limited to simple humanitarian aid , including donation of medical supplies , technical exchange in the field of public health , education and training , promotion of preventive medicine against epidemic illnesses , and " matchmaking " between people with certain medical needs and those who can provide what is needed .  
" Currently , only 35 people a year are allowed to perform foreign medical service in lieu of military service , " Kay notes . " This is too small a number , and those performing this service should n't be limited to males of enlistment age . " Having grown up amid affluence , young Taiwanese often have a utilitarian bias . By performing overseas service , they can learn that " those who give always get more in return . "  
Chen called on DPP party officials and public office holders to withdraw from management of electronic media , and he also stated that the government would abandon all management rights in those media outlets in which it holds stock . Moreover , he asked the DPP caucus in the Legislative Yuan to give priority to amending the laws governing radio and TV-especially those provisions that would exclude government , political parties , and the military from control over the media-saying that it is their duty to complete the amending process in this legislative session .  
During Qing times , train station warehouses were strategic military entrepots ; during the Japanese occupation they were used as storage facilities by the sugar , salt , and forestry industries ; and after the war they were used to accommodate rail passengers on their way south or north . Although they were located in urban centers with good communication links , these warehouses stopped being used for freight storage many years ago .  
Of all the famous artifacts it was the carved ivory balls in particular that captured his interest . The superb craftsmanship expressed in their warm rich hues and intricately carved multiple layers never ceased to amaze him . Seeing these ivory balls he too was determined to carve ivory once he had completed his obligatory military service .  
The incident was sparked when police stopped a pair of students from NTU and Taipei Teachers ' College for riding double on a bicycle . When the students proved uncooperative , the police beat and detained them , setting off a chain of events that eventually led to mass arrests by the military police .  
Frank , like James , was born in China , and had a deep emotional attachment to the country . He found it hard to understand and accept the tragic circumstances that befell Asia and was filled with inner spiritual turmoil . In 1946 , at the age of 26 , at a US military base near Hiroshima , Japan , he shot himself .  
Sadly , " because these grass-roots anti-Japanese movements had no clear political objectives and the fighters had no military training , the years of rebellion all came to naught , " says Chien Jhiung-jen , a professor of humanities at Providence University and author of the book The Taiwan People 's Party . From these bloody lessons , Taiwan 's gentry realized that there was no future in armed resistance , and so began the non-violent approach to challenging the colonial regime .  
Just after finishing his studies and completing his military service in 1985 , Hsu competed in a global trek around the globe sponsored by a local daily newspaper , the Independence Evening Post . After circling the globe , Hsu settled into the stable life of a salaryman . However , this adventurous spirit , who feels that sleeping in the wild is more comfortable than sleeping in a bed , seemed destined to return to the mountains , to the unpopulated wilds , and to the swift currents of the sea .  
" Players living in Taiwan have always been pretty keen to represent their country , " says Chinese Taipei head coach Hsu Sheng-ming . " Players who take the top three spots on the team can earn exemption from military service and a substantial award from the central government . In addition to these practical matters , in every stage of training the players are instilled with strong ideas about pursuing honor for their country . "  
Fortunately , both Kinmen and Matsu undeniably possess rich tourism assets . Kinmen offers an aggregation of overseas emigrant culture , historic front-line military sights , and Southern Fujianese culture . Matsu , on the other hand , has intact communities of Eastern Fujianese style architecture and a rare species of tern . The larger question , though , is where and how do Kinmen and Matsu best fit in ?  
" Hard " thinking , based on military aggression and economic hegemony , has long dominated the fate and historical development of mankind , several times leading the world to the brink of extinction . Therefore Lu placed special emphasis on the spirit of cooperation and sharing , on " soft thinking " that can lead to win-win situations , pluralism , and mutual coexistence and prosperity . She urged that the Pacific be managed as a " soft ocean " of sustainable development .  
Rebellious spirit and modern Taiwanese literature aside , Mt . Pakua and the Changhua Big Buddha are the most common images people have of Changhua . Mt . Pakua in particular , thanks to its featuring in history so prominently , and the number of stories it 's involved in : rebelling against the Qing dynasty , fighting the Japanese , being the site of a military base . . . the peak , over 400 meters above sea level , features in many a heroic tale .

Based on these logistical factors , the existing UNOSOM aircraft fleet is not sufficient to meet current military and humanitarian requirements within Somalia .  
The traditional concept of security , focused primarily on the security of States and based mainly on military components , should be replaced by a broader concept that includes social , economic , environmental , cultural , religious and ethical aspects .

In addition , military countermine techniques are intended for dealing with landmines laid in accordance with established practices and are less effective when faced with randomly laid mines , as is common in internal conflicts .  
With a downward trend in global military spending and an increased reliance upon lighter arms in situations of actual conflict , the technological base for more sophisticated weapon systems is getting narrower .

The need to develop innovative material for use at the primary and secondary school levels , within universities and in professional training , especially for the judiciary , law enforcement officials , the military , and medical and social workers ;  
This backstopping covers operational , political , military , humanitarian , legal , logistical , financial , personnel and other administrative aspects of peacekeeping operations .  
Calls upon all States to take urgent , effective measures to terminate all collaboration with the racist regime of South Africa , in particular in the military and nuclear fields , and to refrain from entering into other relations which run counter to the maintenance of existing sanctions against the regime in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and of the Organization of African Unity ;  
Noting with grave concern the extensive links and collaboration between the apartheid regime of South Africa and certain countries in the political , diplomatic , economic , nuclear , military and other fields , and the growing military and nuclear cooperation between racist Pretoria and Israel ,  
Condemns the extensive links and collaboration between the apartheid regime of South Africa and certain countries in the political , diplomatic , economic , nuclear , military and other fields , and the growing military and nuclear cooperation between the racist regime and Israel ;  
But this sharing of experience and this programme of cooperation , as pointed out in the Managua Declaration and the Plan of Action , must transcend the sphere of conceptual criteria and value judgements on the democratic system and freedom , as opposed to totalitarian and authoritarian regimes , of the left or of the right , fundamentalist or religious , or merely the result of military or populist ambitions . 
In view of the increasing use of United Nations peace-keeping operations in support of humanitarian activities , the High Commissioner recognized the need for improved understanding , new doctrines and operational procedures , and new mutually advantageous systems for coordination between UNHCR and the military .  
The view was expressed that an international legal regime dealing with issues related to the dual use of military satellites and non-discriminatory access to the information obtained from such satellites should be elaborated and that such an instrument would promote the peaceful uses of outer space and the maintenance of outer space for peaceful purposes .  
By its resolution 46 / 36 H , entitled " International arms transfers " , the General Assembly , inter alia , called upon all States to give high priority to eradicating the illicit trade in all kinds of weapons and military equipment , a most disturbing and dangerous phenomenon often associated with terrorism , drug trafficking , organized crime and mercenary and other destabilizing activities , and to take urgent action towards that end , as recommended in the study submitted by the Secretary-General .  
The Committee regrets that the headquarters of the General Intelligence Department has been recognized as an official prison , that the armed forces officers are granted the capacity of public prosecutors , that they have the capacity of detaining suspects incommunicado , whether military persons or civilians , until the end of their interrogation for periods of up to six months , and that detainees are deprived of access to judges , lawyers or doctors .  
But in the final analysis the proper functioning and efficiency of the United Nations depend first and foremost on the political support that Member States , especially the most powerful , give to multilateralism , as well as the political , military and financial resources they are prepared to make available to international organizations .  
The commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations affords an opportunity for giving deep thought to finding the best means of facing up to the challenges of our times and to equipping our Organization with the military capability and material resources that would enable it to address problems at the international level with a single standard based on the principles of equality and justice .  
The global order can no longer be based solely on the special position of the anti-fascist coalition or the nuclear club , or on economic or military power ; rather , first and foremost , it should be based on the real contribution of individual countries to the prevention of every form of totalitarianism and to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; on their role within global socio-economic development ; on their democratic achievement ; and on their regional importance .  
Let us learn from our successes , as from our failures , by developing preventive diplomacy at the regional level and by increasing the rapid response capability of our Organization in the humanitarian and military spheres .  
In Singapore , compulsory national service in the military , police force or civil defence authorities has played an extremely important role in forging common links , fostering shared values and a sense of nationhood among young people from diverse backgrounds .  
Firstly , in the cultural and intellectual area , as it constitutes the vision which guides youth in all areas ; secondly , in the aesthetic field , art and literature are the essential pillars of culture ; thirdly , science as the basis of progress in our present generation which is witnessing growing scientific progress ; fourthly , sports and military fields ; fifthly , public social service , and finally , the field of trips and touristic activities and hostels .  
Another main reason for this failure is that the policies of major arms-producing countries designed to control the spread of weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons are always short-sighted and discriminatory and aim simultaneously at securing the destructive power of their own weaponry and their own military dominance .  
The United States itself has practised various types of terrorism against us , from the imposition of embargoes to military provocations in our territorial waters and overt aggression against our peaceful cities under the cover of darkness - let alone its sheltering of ungodly extremists trained in the United States to carry out acts of sabotage inside Libya , with the assistance of United States authorities . 
One can not forget that the historic changes of a few years ago those changes which finally , once and for all , sealed the fate of totalitarianism actually took place along a line of confrontation which kept Europe and the entire world divided into two opposing ideological and military camps for several decades . 
Is it not also an injustice that the veto power should continue to be valid even when it is used to consecrate acts of aggression , as happened 10 years ago , when it was used by a country that enjoys the privilege in trying to avoid condemnation for a treacherous military , air and naval attack against my country in the course of which hundreds of innocent people were killed and injured ? 
El Salvador experienced one of the most severe , complex and difficult crises in Central America in the second half of this century in the 1980s , to be precise , when a military and political conflict began and went on for 12 years .  
In the case of foreign military installations , we did hear some comments to the effect that the military installations were an important factor in local employment and the local economic situation , and that because of the decision to close or downsize some of them there were adverse consequences that some of the Territories were unable to face without adequate cooperation from the administering Powers . 
We urge the Special Committee to take very careful note of the documentation presented to it by Amnesty International , by other human rights groups and by East Timorese in exile , which details the ongoing human rights abuses in East Timor , such as torture , involuntary disappearances , maltreatment of political prisoners and extrajudicial killings .  The recent killing by the Indonesian military of 6 civilians in Liquica is but one example .  
In the context of our common endeavour we must encourage international cooperation in all possible uses of science and advanced technology for both military and civilian purposes so-called dual-use through the transfer and exchange of scientific and technical know-how for the peaceful purposes of promoting sustainable development and the preservation of international security .  
In addition , the European Union adopted , on 18 September , a common position with the aim of fostering the adoption of a new protocol on blinding lasers , which satisfies the humanitarian concern to avoid unnecessary suffering without limiting the legitimate military use of lasers .  
The European Union takes note of the progress made during the first part of the Review Conference , held in Vienna from 25 September to 13 October , with the adoption of a new Protocol IV on blinding laser weapons , which responds to humanitarian concerns to avoid unnecessary suffering without limiting the legitimate military use of lasers .  
I fully agree with the view expressed by the representative of Spain that , in all probability , it is on the regional level that increased confidence and greater transparency in military matters have the most significant , positive effects , especially as far as conventional weaponry is concerned .  
Greater transparency in military matters and the nurturing of confidence between States are the key elements required for bringing about the regional and global stability which would contribute to reducing excessive and illegal trade in conventional weapons .  
Similarly , my delegation feels it necessary to point out that security in the Latin American region is also closely linked to the process of economic and social development and , hence , the need for integral plans for regional security which spell out the social , economic , humanitarian and environmental aspects alongside the military issues . 
An end to military rivalry , foreign occupation and feelings of racial superiority would be conducive to a world free of poverty and injustice , in which relationships would become more democratic , humane and stable .  
The months immediately preceding December last year marked such a deterioration in the political and security situation in Liberia that the number of military observers of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia ( UNOMIL ) had to be drastically reduced , the humanitarian situation worsened , and the area controlled by the Military Observer Group of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOMOG ) effectively became limited to no more than 15 per cent of the country . 
We consider that the countries that are participating in ECOWAS and in the ECOWAS Military Observer Group ( ECOMOG ) are playing a key role in preventing Liberia from sliding into complete military and political anarchy and in preventing the breakup of the country which , without any doubt , would have serious negative consequences for the entire region .  
At its 93rd plenary meeting , on 20 December 1994 , the General Assembly decided to defer consideration of the agenda item entitled " Declaration of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity on the aerial and naval military attack against the Socialist People 's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya by the present United States Administration in April 1986 " and to include it in the provisional agenda of its fiftieth session . 
As peace and security are closely interlinked with political , economic and social development , including democracy and the realization of human rights world wide , crisis management should consist of an adequate combination of diplomatic , military , legal , economic , environmental and social measures of stabilization .  
In his 4 November 1994 report ( paras . 79-86 ) , the Special Rapporteur concluded , inter alia , that Bosnian Serb de facto authorities continued to be responsible for large-scale violations of human rights and , both directly and indirectly , for displacement of people from areas under their control , for systematic military attacks on civilians in the " safe areas " and elsewhere , and for grave disruption of humanitarian aid and medical evacuation programmes .  
Undertake to explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction in excessive military expenditures including global military expenditures and arms trade , investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development ;  
Although the democratic Government had been elected by a sizable majority , opposition forces had controlled the Senate because it included nine senators appointed by the outgoing military regime .  
At a time when national security should be seen more and more in the context of military and political stability at the regional and international levels , the time had come to apply the principle of undiminished security at the lowest level of armaments .  
In this context , my Government wishes to emphasize the need for the quick deployment of UNAVEM III , because it alone as we all know will bear responsibility for the quartering , disarming and selection of UNITA troops that are to be integrated into the unified national army of Angola and for the demobilization of the excess military personnel that will be reintegrated into civilian life after receiving vocational training .  
My delegation is particularly grateful to the Secretary-General for his excellent report ( S / 1995 / 97 ) , dated 1 February 1995 , which has provided valuable insights into the continuing problems in Angola in the political , military , civil and humanitarian spheres .  
Broad parliamentary support would be required to change the legal situation , especially in view of strong opposition from the Catholic Church , whose moral authority had been enhanced by its defence of human rights under the military dictatorship .  
The Secretary-General , in his peacemaking initiative and in close consultation with the Security Council , sent to Tajikistan a small integrated United Nations unit of political , military and humanitarian officers to monitor the situation on the ground , provide liaison services and constitute a ground core for any possible more extensive United Nations participation in the regional efforts in Tajikistan in the future .  
Needless to say , the tragic events triggered by the military coup d ' \ x { 5f4b } at during the night of 20-21 October 1993 can not be viewed in isolation ; they should be considered in the light of their historical , political , economic and social background .  
It was not possible to set up or put into operation the national state security council because those who were to be members had declined and the rebels came up against the unanimous condemnation and firm demands on the part of the political , moral , social and even military forces calling for a return to constitutional legality . 
In that regard , the mission proposes that a legal expert , a military expert and an administrative expert , all highly qualified and having considerable experience in their respective fields , should be appointed to assist the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in his mission .  
In order to counter the instability posed by the production and proliferation of weapons , women 's non-governmental organizations have called for reductions in military expenditures world wide and for the elimination of the international weapons trade , questioning the morality of a militaristic culture and armed conflict as a means of resolving disagreements .  
By 21 February , a total of 211 international staff members from 36 countries had joined the Mission , comprising 111 substantive staff , of whom 72 are United Nations Volunteers , 60 administrative and logistical support staff , 10 military liaison officers and 30 civilian police observers .  
With regard to the possibility that special laws or exclusive jurisdictions could be invoked to uphold impunity in respect of human rights violations , a careful study has begun of Guatemalan domestic legislation , with special reference to the military criminal justice system and the identification of cases in which the functioning of this special system could promote impunity .  
Any armed attack on the civilian population is obviously prohibited , and that prohibition does not end even if the indirect aim is to achieve military objectives , unless there is a pressing military need and , at the same time , a certain proportionality between the military objective to be achieved and the expected and foreseeable harm which may be caused to the civilian population .  
In this context , it would be desirable to separate the police function from the military function and to have a police body with sufficient technical and operational training to carry out its activity in a spirit of respect for human rights , and for such a body to have greater human and material resources so that it can operate in rural areas and perform its irreplaceable functions . 
Such actions affecting private property or public utilities designed to meet the needs of the civilian population involve a high degree of risk for civilians and can not be justified as legitimate military operations .  
These confidence-building measures , which could lead to an informal suspension of offensive military operations , would constitute a demonstration of good will aimed at alleviating the suffering of the civilian population in areas affected by the armed confrontation , protecting human rights and facilitating the work of MINUGUA as well as all national entities devoted to the protection and promotion of human rights . 
With regard to military operations , until such time as a cease-fire is agreed to and takes effect , URNG insists on the commitment to respect the provisions of the comprehensive agreement on human rights intended to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population , protect human rights and facilitate the work of MINUGUA and of all national bodies devoted to the protection and promotion of human rights and the rights deriving from international humanitarian law .  
Bioremediation of polluted groundwater , technologies for containing pollution , biological methods of treating pollution in the unsaturated zone above groundwaters contaminated by past industrial and military activities , and the treatment of extracted contaminated soil are among the topics of the regional ECE Seminar on the Prevention and Control of Groundwater Pollution to be held in September 1995 .  
The cost estimate also makes provision for pending claims by civilian and military personnel for lost personal effects as a result of the civil war ( $ 500,000 ) , of which an amount of $ 375,000 has been brought forward from the previous mandate period .  
Also condemns in the strongest terms the kidnapping and killing of military peace-keeping personnel attached to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda , the killing of personnel attached to humanitarian organizations operating in the country , the wanton killing of innocent civilians and the destruction of property during the conflict , which constitute a blatant violation of international humanitarian law ;  
Being aware that the Hague meetings addressed general military considerations for the operation of UNPROFOR and believing that a continuing evaluation is desirable to provoke also a more forward-looking analysis not necessarily constrained by the lowest common denominator ,  
Deeply concerned further by the increasingly severe and grave violations of human rights by the Government of Iraq against the civilian population in southern Iraq , in particular in the southern marshes , where the combination of massive drainage projects and wide-ranging military operations on the part of the Government of Iraq has forced residents of the marshes to flee in large numbers , many of whom have sought refuge on the border between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran ,  
Also expresses special alarm at the grave violations of human rights in southern Iraq , and urges the Government of Iraq to implement without further delay the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur , including , inter alia , the immediate halting and reversal of the draining of the marshes and the cessation of its military activities against the marsh Arabs , whose survival as a community is endangered ;  
The notion of " economic integration " in fact implies specific and obvious political and legal consequences , particularly when it is linked to the continuation of the military occupation and the total political dependence of the Cypriot territories in question on Ankara .  
The progress report focused on prerequisites of learning from experience with United Nations peace-keeping operations , and on the status of a ready capacity to act for six substantive components of complex missions : information , electoral , repatriation , human rights , civilian police and military .  
The three political , military or humanitarian functions can be carried out in integrated and unified operations , provided that there are clearly established modalities of cooperation , including information sharing , transparency , joint planning and logistics ;  
The travel costs of military and civilian personnel to the mission area on assignment , rotation or repatriation have been estimated at an average of $ 2,000 per person one way , or $ 4,000 round trip ( basic air fare of $ 1,000 , plus 100 kilogrammes of unaccompanied baggage and travel allowances at $ 1,000 ) .  The cost of a round-trip travel on a three-day official mission to New York is estimated at $ 1,400 ( $ 700 basic airfare and $ 700 in allowances and daily subsistence allowance ) .  
Further areas of concern related to biological weapons , new types of weapons of mass destruction , radiological weapons , limitation and reduction of conventional weapons and international arms transfers , the prevention of an arms race in outer space , curbing the naval arms race , naval armaments and disarmament , and reduction of military budgets .  
Discussion at the United Nations focused on issues such as limitations on conventional weapons ; transparency in international arms transfers and arms production ; curbing the illicit traffic in conventional arms ; transparency in military expenditures ; inhumane weapons and the Convention restricting their use ; and , recently , regulation of the transfer of technology with military applications .  
In the Final Declaration , adopted by consensus , the Conference reaffirmed the strong common interest of the States parties in preventing the use of environmental modification techniques for military or any other hostile purposes and confirmed that the obligations assumed under the ENMOD Convention had been faithfully observed .  
An understanding was reached that military or any other hostile use of herbicides as an environmental modification technique was a method of warfare prohibited by the Convention if such use of herbicides upset the ecological balance of the region , thus causing widespread , long-lasting or severe effects as a means of destruction , damage or injury to any State party .  
The possibility of reducing the huge financial , material and human resources devoted to the military sector and reallocating part of them to the civilian sector of national economies has been the object of deliberations within the framework of the United Nations for over three decades .  
Travel costs for the military and civilian personnel have been calculated on the basis of the following travel rates : ( a ) for repatriation of military contingent personnel , by group travel arrangements , at a rate of $ 540 per person ; and ( b ) for international civilian personnel , by commercial arrangements , at a rate of $ 3,500 per person one way or $ 7,000 round trip , inclusive of the entitlement for excess unaccompanied baggage .  
In addition to its introduction and my concluding observations , the report includes seven sections , devoted respectively to military aspects ; public security aspects ; human rights , the judicial system and the Commission on the Truth ; electoral matters ; economic and social issues ; financial aspects ; and administrative aspects .  
There has been a manipulation of social demands ; a campaign to discredit new State institutions , particularly the National Civil Police ; a rise in common crime typical of post-war situations ; and isolated but persistent calls for a growing military role which could undermine the credibility and authority of the National Civil Police and the political system as a whole .  
The world 's less powerful countries and those of lesser political , military and economic influence have thus become wary of the exploitation of global humanitarian principles and objectives to serve the purposes of some parties rather than others .  
Despite numerous reminders about the Geneva Conventions and calls upon Serbian military and political leadership to halt and reverse their practice of ethnic cleansing , these crimes continue as cited by your report of 22 March 1995 , abated only by the rapidly decreasing number of potential human victims . 
As a country that is a frequent target for international terrorists and narcotics traffickers , the United States is properly concerned that the work of an international criminal court not compromise important , complex and costly investigations carried out by its criminal , justice or military authorities .  28 .  For the most part , neither drug crimes nor crimes of terrorism occur as isolated criminal acts .  
Despite the numerous reminders citing the Geneva Conventions and the calls upon the Serbian military and political leadership to halt and reverse their practice of ethnic cleansing , these crimes continue , abated only by the rapidly decreasing number of potential human victims as is , in fact , pointed out in the Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } report of 22 March 1995 .  
Both the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb authorities must exercise the maximum restraint and must realize once and for all that there can be no military solution to the conflict , only a comprehensive political solution such as will restore the peaceful coexistence of the various ethnic , cultural and religious components that have lived together in Bosnia and Herzegovina for centuries .  
Estimates for activities ranging from water purification and storage to the number of civilian and military personnel required for the Mission and infrastructure repairs were excessive ; in that regard she fully shared the concerns expressed and the recommendations put forward by the Advisory Committee in paragraphs 24 , 34 , 39 and 42 of its report .  
Accusations , such as producing and stockpiling chemical weapons and trying to develop nuclear weapons and building up conventional arms , are concocted apparently in order to frighten Iran 's neighbours , justify an illegitimate foreign military presence in the Persian Gulf , and impose a costly and unnecessary arms sale to the countries of the region .  
The ninth report of the Human Rights Division , issued in September 1993 , emphasized that the increase in crime was linked to non-implementation or delayed or incomplete implementation of the agreements : " [ Firstly ] , the failure to confiscate military weapons in the hands of the civilian population . . . 
In a whole range of areas , there is no halt to military actions , in clear violation of the agreements of 21 and 31 December last year between the Bosnian parties on a cease-fire and on a complete cessation of hostilities .  The situation is being aggravated by attempted offensives from the Government forces and by disproportionate responses from the Bosnian Serbs , including acts against the civilian population which is absolutely inadmissible .  
Since then , the country has removed strategic and tactical nuclear weapons , closed scores of bases and demobilized many thousands of military personnel , transferring to local authorities the responsibility of providing them with housing and basic services .  
In his statement before the Special Political and Decolonization Committee ( Fourth Committee ) on 28 October 1994 , 4 / in explanation of vote on the draft decision on the question of St . Helena , the representative of the United Kingdom stated that , as in previous years , the draft decision was unacceptable to his Government because it mentioned military facilities on Ascension , an island which , although linked to St . Helena for administrative reasons , was not included in the Committee 's agenda .  
Despite an almost total information blockade and the restriction of the movement of representatives of international organizations by the Croatian side under various pretexts , foreign media have managed to inform the world public about some of the atrocities and the systematic drive of the Croatian military and civilian authorities to erase the traces of these atrocities by burning the dead , burying them in unmarked mass graves or by washing the streets and roads to remove the evidence .  
On 4 March 1995 , at 1000 hours , a khaki-coloured Iraqi bus , carrying 45 military forces wearing khaki , was observed travelling from west to east , at a distance of 2 kilometres from the geographic coordinates of PB 152-478 on the map of south of Mehran , in no man 's land , between east of border pillar 27 / 7B and west of border pillar 27 / 8 .  
In the Mission 's view , the laying of mines in places where people work , live or circulate constitutes a violation of this commitment and of the principles of international humanitarian law , since it puts the civilian population at unnecessary risk and there is no proportionality between the intended military objective and the foreseeable harm that may be caused to that population . 
The prudent action of the military authorities , who were aware of the guerrilla presence in the city and promptly informed MINUGUA , postponing the arrival of army troops at those points until after the URNG forces had withdrawn , avoided an armed confrontation that could have seriously endangered numerous civilians .  
The Mission believes that URNG has committed human rights violations and has failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population , by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting the " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines or explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals . 
As regards the assurances given by Mr . Batu that Turkey does not harbour any designs or territorial ambitions against Greece or any of its neighbours and without going into any historic retrospection that would give ample and eloquent proof of Turkey 's traditional performance in the broader area of the Balkans and the Middle East , suffice it to recall the notorious contemporary case of the military invasion and ongoing occupation of Cyprus .  
After nearly three years of civil strife , marked by increasing violence , corruption , and near-total devastation of the country 's social and economic infrastructure , the military general , Raoul Cedras , under strong threat of outside military intervention sanctioned by the United Nations , returned the legitimate authority of the Government of Haiti peacefully to its democratically elected president , Jean-Bertrand Aristide .  
However , the United States Administration , together with the south Korean puppet army , has , since 1976 , staged " team spirit " joint military exercises against us each year , mobilizing nuclear weapons instead of coming to the talks , and even cancelled the already proclaimed reduction plan of American troops in south Korea , in July 1979 .  
The strengthening of the offensive capabilities of the Turkish occupation forces in Cyprus , coupled with the completion of extensive fortifications all along the buffer zone , are indicative of the real intentions of Turkey in Cyprus : that is , the imposition of a military solution , something to which Turkey resorts with utter contempt to international law and civilized behaviour .  
International security must be identical for all States in all its dimensions : military and political , social and economic , scientific and technical and humanitarian .  
To the contrary , recent developments in eastern and western Bosnia and Herzegovina offer ample proof that the Belgrade Government and , specifically Mr . Milo \ x { ea92 } vi _ , has not only failed to influence the so-called Croatian and Bosnian Serbs positively , but has effectively encouraged them to intensify their military option and ethnic cleansing .  
Faced with the joint and highly coordinated offensive military activities of the Croatian and Bosnian Serbs , and the growing interference of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , the Republic of Croatia presented the Croatian Serb leaders with a clear choice : to accept immediately the principles of peaceful reintegration or face police and military action aimed at restoring Croatian sovereignty over its occupied territories .  
We call upon the authorities in Zagreb to hold inviolate the civil and human rights of the local Serb population and to treat all prisoners of war in accordance with accepted standards of international law governing the rights of military personnel in conflict situations .  
The report also noted that URNG had committed human rights violations and had failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines and explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals . 
There have also been infamous cases in which State intelligence authorities or security forces , opposition groups , armed domestic resistance movements or criminal organizations hire mercenaries to engage in illegal actions such as forming paramilitary forces for purposes of repression , organizing death squads or providing military protection for illicit drug trafficking , smuggling or arms trafficking .  
The Code , reaffirming the continuing validity of the comprehensive concept of security , set politically binding norms and principles guiding the role of armed forces in democratic societies and the relation , among States as well as the relations of States vis - - vis their nationals in the military field .  
These settlors need not only represent recognized legal experts in international military / peace / security issues , but also those having expertise in economic , social and cultural relations where disputes are most often the root cause of all disastrous conflicts .  
Total arms expenditure , including money spent on developing advanced technologies for military purposes , has absorbed considerable human , material and financial resources .  
There seems to be a common understanding among the above States that bilateral CSBMs , once agreed , should lead to greater transparency in military activities , thus having a stabilizing effect , especially in border areas , and stimulating contacts between the military of the respective States at the lowest possible level .  
Military doctrines of the States in the region should be exclusively defensive and in all respects adapted to the international agreements on restricted use of military force and non-use of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons ;  
Recommends that the Commission to be appointed by the Secretary-General be composed of five to ten impartial and internationally respected persons , including legal , military and police experts , under the Chairmanship of an eminent person , and assisted by the appropriate support staff ;

In current conflicts , peace-keeping operations may benefit from using modern technologies to gather information ( weight , heat and infra-red remote-sensing devices ) , to detect and defuse mines ( infra-red , ground-penetrating radar ) , to improve communications and inter-operability among multinational United Nations forces , to equip blue helmets with more effective military means while causing a minimum of damage to humans , and to assist in humanitarian efforts .  
Growing stocks of surplus fissile material from the military sector and growing amounts of plutonium in civilian fuel cycles make accountancy and control an urgent task of paramount importance .  
In addition , the component 's task is to monitor the activities of the existing police forces , so as to ensure that they are acting in strict accordance with the plan , which is intended to secure the organization of a free and fair referendum without military or administrative constraints and to prevent any possibility of intimidation or interference from any quarter .  
In 1994 , the Special Committee , in keeping with its consistent goal of limiting documentation and streamlining its report to the General Assembly , recommended to the Assembly that in preparing the general working papers on the Territories , the Secretariat should , where applicable , incorporate under separate headings those sections relating to foreign economic and other interests and those on military activities and arrangements on those Territories .

A special effort was made to bring to the Conference experts from industry , public and private , and to emphasize the practical issues and options of the conversion process .  The subjects covered included the nuclear industry , military machines , shipbuilding , electronics , aeronautical and aerospace industries , information , intellectual property and international cooperation .  
It aims at training senior managers of Chinese military enterprises for conversion to production of civilian goods for the domestic and world markets , and facilitating joint ventures by bringing together major domestic and international investors from the private sector in the most attractive and committed Chinese enterprises .  
Include information about international and regional instruments and standards in their public information and human rights education activities and in adult education and training programmes , particularly for groups such as the military , the police and other law enforcement personnel , the judiciary , and legal and health professionals to ensure that human rights are effectively protected ;  
Undertake to explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures , trade in arms and investment in arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to permit the possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development , in particular for the advancement of women ;  
The Croatian Army , which is operating in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the express request of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina , and consistent with international law and within the framework of the bilateral agreement signed between the two respective Governments , will end its limited military activities in the area in the shortest time possible .  
The Turkish invasion of northern Iraq was accompanied by flagrant violations committed by the invading forces through intensive utilization of weapons that were not commensurate with the number of those who were subjected to the military campaign , in which military aircraft and heavy military equipment were used , causing great damage to property and killing Iraqi Kurdish citizens .

We always believe that however complicated a dispute between States or an internal conflict in a country may be , we should encourage the parties concerned to seek peaceful solutions through negotiation and dialogue , for this is the only right and effective way to a comprehensive and durable settlement .  The practices of imposing sanctions , using military force or even expanding a war in order to stop it are not conducive to a settlement .  
NULLWhile one reason the abuses , human rights violations or crimes allegedly committed by military commissioners and members of CVDCs , whether for political or general reasons , continue is that the people are afraid to say anything , the main reason they continue is that , in much of Guatemala the institutions responsible for maintaining public order and administering justice either do not exist or are very weak . 
While there is no evidence to suggest that the attack was formally sanctioned or approved by military commanders either at the most senior level or locally , it is hard to believe that so many men could have become involved without the knowledge of the local commander .  
NULLThe events described above , coupled with other political and military developments within the Republic of Croatia and the contiguous territories of the former Yugoslavia , as well as the frequently declared intention of the Croatian authorities to recover lost territories by other means if negotiations did not succeed , made it very difficult to resume meaningful negotiations and bring them to a successful conclusion .  
Throughout 1995 , field officers have continued to travel from commune to commune meeting with civil , judicial and military authorities and local populations to learn about the general conditions of each commune , including security , access to property , the material needs and the functioning of the judiciary , conditions of detention centres and alleged human rights violations .  
The offensive in western Bosnia , whose ultimate goal is the seizure of Prijedor and Banja Luka , is continuing unabated despite the demands of the Security Council contained in the presidential statement of 12 October 1995 ( S / PRST / 1995 / 52 ) , that all parties fully comply with the provisions of the cease-fire agreement and refrain from any military activity that could seriously jeopardize the peace process . 
Another basic theme of the regional programme is support for the economic and social reintegration of former combatants , demobilized military personnel and wounded victims of war and conflicts in the subregion , who are covered by specific peace agreements . 
The continuing plundering of the cultural heritage of the Greek Cypriots and the changing demographic structure of the area under Turkish military occupation through massive importation of settlers were two additional characteristics of the unacceptable situation created in Cyprus through the force of arms .  
Similarly on the point of occupation , the General Assembly concluded that , " in particular , [ the activities of ] the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) . . . aimed at achieving the integration of the occupied territories of Croatia into the administrative , military , educational , transportation and communication systems of the Federal Republic are illegal , null and void , and must cease immediately " .  
It is anticipated that one of the areas to be developed is joint peace-keeping seminars , co-sponsored by national staff colleges and the United Nations , with a view to increasing general knowledge and understanding of peace-keeping for mid-level and senior military and civilian officers .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
It is clear that continuous Croatian threats , sabre rattling and persistent military provocations , as well as the deployment of great number of Croatian troops in the contiguous territories of Srem and Baranja , are not a way to overcome major outstanding problems in a satisfactory manner , i.e . , by peaceful means and through political negotiations .  
Noting that the peace dividend has not materialized in the form of additional financial flows to developing countries , and expressing the need for the reallocation by developed countries of resources freed from military purposes arising from the end of the Cold War towards productive development purposes in support of existing international commitments for development ,  
To supplement premises provided by the Government of Angola under the terms of the status-of-forces agreement , and taking into account the total number of military and civilian personnel of the Verification Mission , UNAVEM requires the continued rental of additional premises for residential and office accommodation at Mission headquarters at Luanda and at six regional headquarters .  
Taking into account the vast area of the country , its ravaged infrastructure and the total number of military and civilian personnel to be mobilized throughout the Mission area , the services of these aircraft are considered essential in accomplishing the operational requirements of the Mission .  
Also noting that despite the positive developments in the political and military situation in Angola , the economic , social and humanitarian situation remains dire , and reaffirming both the importance of and the need for a continued and effective United Nations presence in promoting a negotiated settlement in Angola with a view to fostering the peace process ,  
The Security Council further recommended that the Commission be appointed by the Secretary-General and be composed of 5 to 10 impartial and internationally respected persons , including legal , military and police experts , under the chairmanship of an eminent person , and assisted by the appropriate support staff .  
The massive exodus of almost the entire Serb population from Krajina and western Slavonia , preceded by the previous exodus of over 300,000 Serb population from Croatia outside Krajina , as well as military intervention of the regular units of the Croatian army in Western Bosnia served the purpose of the current leadership of Croatia to create " Greater Croatia " , i.e . , an ethnically pure State without the Serbs .  
While welcoming the thoughtful use of military assets by UNHCR in relief operations , and other innovative solutions , his delegation was firmly convinced that violators of humanitarian law should be held individually responsible .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
Upon inquiry , the Committee was informed that contractual arrangements with the military supplier of helicopters proved to be more economical than budgeted ; instead of contracting for a minimum number of hours per month , plus making provisions for additional hours , payments were made on the basis of actual helicopter hours used . 
The Council recommended that the Commission be appointed by the Secretary-General and be composed of 5 to 10 impartial and internationally respected persons , including legal , military and police experts , under the chairmanship of an eminent person , and assisted by the appropriate support staff .  
Governments bore the primary responsibility for formulating appropriate strategies , policies , programmes and actions to combat poverty ; the effort required sound macroeconomic policies , structural changes and the mobilization of domestic resources , inter alia , through more equitable tax regimes and a reduction in military expenditures .  
Condemns further violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including killings , the burning and looting of houses , the shelling of residential areas , harassment of and attacks on refugees , the elderly and the infirm perpetrated by members of the Croatian Armed Forces and civilians in the formerly Serb-controlled regions of Croatia during and subsequent to the military operations there in August 1995 ;  
pointed out that the resolution mentioned above had been adopted on an initiative of the Sudan , motivated by its concern for the situation of more than 20,000 children who had been sequestered by the insurgent movement in the south of the country , which used them as explosives carriers , human shields in minefields and as a military reserve , a situation which was intolerable since it violated religious and humane principles .  
with interest that the Government of Nigeria , on 1 October 1995 , affirmed the principle of multi-party democracy , announcing its intent to accept the principle of power-sharing , lift the ban on political activity and the press , devolve power to local levels of government and subordinate the military to civilian authority , but disappointed that only limited action in this regard has followed ,  
the global level , it was pushing for a ban on anti-personnel land-mines , an optional protocol to the Convention raising to 18 the minimum age of recruitment into armed forces , and a reordering of priorities away from military spending towards investment in human development .  
On 24 November , at border crossing point Sremska Raca , a Mission team 's local female interpreter was harassed in the ladies room by an intoxicated individual wearing a military uniform .  
noting that despite the positive developments in the political and military situation in Angola , the economic , social and humanitarian situation remains dire , and reaffirming both the importance of and the need for a continued and effective United Nations presence in promoting a negotiated settlement in Angola with a view to fostering the peace process ,  
Provision for two military observers and 14 temporary posts authorized for OSGA in 1995 ( one-D-2 , one P-5 , two Field Service , one General Service and nine local-level posts ) and an additional three posts : one at the Field Service level for a Communications Officer and two local-level posts , one for a vehicle and generator mechanic and one for an administrative assistant ;

considered the complexities of the situation described above , and based on a careful analysis by my military advisers , I am convinced that a mechanized division of two brigades , with combat capability , air support and a strong mobile , armoured reserve , would be required .  
the absence of precise information concerning the operational requirements of each mission , the cost estimates have been based on the average cost per person per day of military personnel and civilian police derived from the commitment authorization of $ 115,373,000 gross ( $ 113,866,300 net ) provided by the General Assembly for the month of December 1995 .  
Condemns in the strongest terms all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict , recognizing that the leadership in territories under the control of Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and formerly Serb-held areas of the Republic of Croatia , the commanders of Serb paramilitary forces and political and military leaders in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) bear primary responsibility for most of those violations , and that persons who commit such acts will be held personally responsible and accountable ;  
Further condemns violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including killings , the burning and looting of houses , the shelling of residential areas , harassment of and attacks on refugees , the elderly and the infirm perpetrated by members of the Croatian armed forces and civilians in the formerly Serb-controlled regions of Croatia during and subsequent to the military operations there in August 1995 ;  
gravely concerned , however , at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including killings of civilians , arbitrary arrest and detention , restrictions on freedoms of expression and association , torture , forced labour , forced portering , human rights abuses in border areas in the course of military operations , forced relocations and development projects , abuse of women and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
with interest that the Government of Nigeria , on 1 October 1995 , affirmed the principle of multi-party democracy , announcing its intent to accept the principle of power-sharing , lift the ban on political activity and the press , devolve power to local levels of government and subordinate the military to civilian authority , but disappointed that only limited action in this regard has followed ,  
flow of men and mat �� iel , not to mention the direct involvement of the military leaders of the former Republic of Yugoslavia , played a very important role in the brutal and criminal overrunning of the safe areas , in contravention of all the Security Council resolutions on the matter , and led to the exodus of tens of thousands of civilians and the liquidation of thousands of unarmed men and boys .  
the past year , there had been increasing reports of slavery and forced labour of women and children belonging to racial , ethnic and religious minorities ; of atrocities against indigenous peoples ; of indiscriminate aerial bombardments against civilian targets , and of unaccompanied minors being conscripted into military service .  
In 1994 , the Special Committee , in keeping with its consistent goal of limiting documentation and streamlining its report to the General Assembly , recommended to the Assembly that in preparing the general working papers on the Territories , the Secretariat should , where applicable , incorporate under separate headings those sections relating to foreign economic and other interests and those on military activities and arrangements on those Territories .

Amid all these problems , the Government of National Unity installed on 19 July 1994 was faced with the daunting challenge of rehabilitating and rebuilding a war-ravaged economy , reviving the provision of basic social services to a traumatized population , coping with the wreckage of genocide , stabilizing a fragile political alliance , and consolidating internal peace and security , as well as warding off looming military threats from exiled soldiers of the former regime .  
They have been declared entirely subordinate to the political Constitution as an apolitical , non-partisan , non-deliberative body obedient to civil authority ; mandatory military service has also been abolished .  
Through its current operation Israel has demonstrated once again its utter contempt for Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) , as well the Charter provisions and principles of international law governing relations between States . My delegation regards this military action , which has brought about scores of casualties among the civilian population , particularly among women and children , as unconscionable . 
However much some might try to justify the Israeli military actions , these international criteria are not applicable to the repeated , massive attacks against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon , nor against innocent unarmed civilians in Lebanon .  
In conclusion , while looking forward to the achievement of a genuine , permanent and peaceful settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict , my Government is hopeful that the international community will take a firm stand against the Israeli military aggression in the area .  
These settlors need not only represent recognized legal experts in international military / peace / security issues , but also those having expertise in economic , social and cultural relations where disputes are most often the root cause of all disastrous conflicts .  
The mechanisms must have a unified and clearly defined command and control structure ensuring the orderly and effective discharge of the mandate assigned to them , and precise coordination of the political , military , humanitarian , civilian and administrative components of any activity must be ensured ;  
We share the view that today the notion of security has undergone a radical transformation and includes an entire set of equally important political , economic , environmental , social , military and other components .  
If power politics are allowed to be deployed in the pursuit of exclusive and narrow interests in a climate of confrontation , if the world 's resources are shared on the basis of military power rather than of international treaties and conventions , if priority is not given to international law and international cooperation , and if we attempt to evade the responsibilities that we have all undertaken under the Charter , however appealing and convenient that might appear in the short term , we will sow the seeds of chaos , anarchy and rapid disintegration .  
The social and economic consequences of these conflicts have no parallel in contemporary history , but we can not simply pretend that military imposition , coercion and sanctions are a universal panacea that can solve the numerous humanitarian problems of the world .  
A sound early warning system , combining political , military , humanitarian , human rights and economic areas , would broaden the base of options and enhance the chances for success in the early detection of conflict situations .  An early international monitoring presence in itself has a major deterrent effect .  
In spite of obstructions and misinformation campaigns , the Islamic Republic of Iran has continued to articulate and pursue initiatives and measures aimed at fostering greater regional confidence ; enhancing respect for principles of international law ; bringing about transparency in armaments and reduction of military spending ; creating zones free from weapons of mass destruction ; strengthening peace and security through persistent endeavours to encourage and facilitate understanding and conciliation ; and consolidating economic cooperation .  
The situation is exacerbated by the disappointing results experienced by several countries in converting military production and in arms reduction when compliance with international commitments becomes a factor in diverting already meagre resources and funds from the urgent needs of economic development .  
In so doing , Japan deems it important to keep in mind in particular that in our present-day world , peace and stability can not be achieved and maintained solely on the basis of political and military factors , but that stable and durable peace can be realized only through efforts that take into account a wider perspective which comprises humanitarian concerns and social and economic reconstruction and development as well .  
In this sea of change in international relations , the whole concept of international security has increasingly moved away from the bipolar view , concerned largely with military security , to one which assigns a central role to sustainable development and the welfare of the individual .  
The occupation itself constituted the primary violation of the human rights of the civilian population and was the source of other violations and harsh practices by the occupying Israeli authorities , including closure and sealing of the occupied territories , land confiscation , the demolition of Palestinian homes , the detention of Palestinians , and the killing of Palestinians by military and undercover security forces .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
The Republic of Croatia , being cognizant that the overall peace process in the former Yugoslavia is at a delicate stage and being fully determined to contribute to peace and stability in the region , would support a continued deployment of United Nations military observers in the area of the Prevlaka peninsula in Croatia , with an understanding that such deployment shall be a short-term interim arrangement , until , as proposed by my Government , the United Nations arrangement is replaced by a regional arrangement .  
Whereas in the past , neighbouring States had been wary of South Africa 's military strength , South Africa 's current deliberate policy of transparency and the concerted use of common resources to ensure regional stability should form the basis for fruitful cooperation between States in the future .  
KODELLAS ( Greece ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that for the past 21 years it had been indisputable that the Cyprus problem was a clear case of the violation of the territorial integrity , unity and sovereignty of an independent State , of massive human rights violations and of the artificial division of a country by military force . 
Although the Security Council meets far away from the scene of the events we are discussing today , and although we are not subject to the difficulties faced by the people in the field , I believe it is important that the personnel of the United Nations civilian and military should be aware of our solidarity with them and understanding of the difficult tasks and living conditions that they have to face .  
The establishment for an initial 12-month period of a major operation with a significant military contingent could , in our opinion , not only foster mutual trust and discourage any thoughts of outside interference , but also , generally speaking , ensure security throughout the region during the transitional period and oversee the demilitarization process . 
In welcoming the special envoy of the Secretary-General , Mrs . Sadako Ogata , United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , the Prime Minister went even further , and announced the mechanisms planned as a means to establishing permanent consultation on security measures between the military and civilian authorities concerned and the representatives of United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations .  
However , through our civil military cooperation ( CIMIC ) operations IFOR has established an effective mechanism to coordinate activities with the many international non-governmental and other civilian organizations contributing to the reconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
Military contingents , including military , technical and rear support units ( subunits ) , shall be fully supplied with weapons and military equipment , spare parts and military and technical supplies , and technical servicing , evacuation and repair components under schedules , tables and norms specially drawn up for them , taking into account the physical and geographical conditions of the region in which their tasks are carried out and in accordance with individual agreements .  
In addition , we are very concerned about the continued UNITA military activity in some regions of the country , in a pattern of military movement without prior notification to UNAVEM III and of isolated attacks and ambushes against civilian and military targets alike , almost always resulting in a loss of human life . 
My delegation believes the report provides us with important information regarding the political , military , humanitarian , financial , economic and social aspects of the situation in Angola , which , in our opinion , will prove invaluable to our discussion concerning the future of UNAVEM III .  
Expresses deep concern at the numerous delays in the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol , reminds the Government of Angola and UNITA of their obligations to consolidate the peace process and , in this regard , urges them to maintain an effective cease-fire , conclude their military talks on integration of the armed forces , undertake active engagement in the demining process , and commence the integration of UNITA personnel into administrative and governmental institutions in furtherance of the objective of national reconciliation ;

Hiding behind a " living shield " of members of the Government forces , they are continuing attacks which are compelling the command of the armed forces of the Republic of Tajikistan to abandon the positions occupied by it in order to avoid unjustified losses of life among military personnel and the civilian population .  
To establish or strengthen operational coordination machinery for the competent institutions so as to increase the effectiveness of national and regional efforts to combat crime and all threats to democratic security necessitating the use of military , security or civilian police forces , such as terrorism , illicit arms trafficking , drug trafficking and organized crime ;  
To provide information , within the Security Commission , on the respective military and public security expenditures approved in their budgets for the current fiscal year , taking as a reference the " Instrument for standardized international reporting of military expenditures " adopted by the United Nations on 12 December 1990 , under the provisions of article 52 ( k ) of this Treaty ; and ,  
To consider the information provided by the Governments on their respective military and security budgets for the current fiscal year and to elaborate joint proposals for the possible adaptation of future budgets , taking into account the internal situation of each State ;  
The permanent communications mechanism which the Parties undertake to establish and put into operation in order to facilitate secure , efficient and rapid communications among the respective competent civilian , military and public security authorities and between them and the Security Commission , with a view to preventing incidents , responding to alerts and contributing to the fulfilment of the objectives and obligations set forth in this Treaty . Article 61 .  
These resolutions , inter alia , demanded that the Government of the Republic of Croatia respect fully the rights of the local Serb population in the former Sectors following Croatia 's military operations , including their rights to remain , leave or return in safety , take urgent measures to put an end to all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights and investigate all reports of such violations so that those responsible for such acts be judged and punished .  
Also noting that despite the positive developments in the political and military situation in Angola , the economic , social and humanitarian situation remains dire , and reaffirming both the importance of and the need for a continued and effective United Nations presence in promoting a negotiated settlement in Angola with a view to fostering the peace process ,  
The mechanisms must have a unified and clearly defined command and control structure ensuring the orderly and effective discharge of the mandate assigned to them , and precise coordination of the political , military , humanitarian , civilian and administrative components of any activity must be ensured ;  
The United States is becoming more undisguised in its moves to build up a " tripartite military alliance " with Japan and south Korea , and moves forward on a full scale with the reintroduction of its cold war era policy to the Korean peninsula and its vicinity , by repeatedly launching joint military exercises among the United States , south Korea and Japan over the so-called " north Korea 's threat " .  
Now that north and south Korea have already signed an agreement on non-aggression and inaugurated the north-south joint military body , this detailed proposal of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea , if realized , would bring about an epoch-making environment for d \ x { 5f4b } ente and peace on the Korean peninsula and would also create the prerequisite for a confederal reunification of Korea .  
In the months preceding the suspension of hostilities ( see para . 45 ) , there was a relative increase , on the part of URNG , in armed clashes , harassment , the installation of roadblocks and the occupation of residential areas for propaganda purposes which sometimes endangered civilians , for instance , when they were caught in the line of fire or when military units were located near populated areas .  
Threats and intimidation continued to be directed against individuals and entities working for the protection of human rights by CVDC members and former military commissioners in rural areas and by unidentified groups operating in urban areas .  
Once the resolution establishing an operation has been adopted , this unit , which may be reinforced as needed by the future commanders of the main national detachments , would ensure the overall military planning of the operation by preparing , in particular , a detailed military directive and the initial order of operations . 
Experience seems to recommend , however , on the one hand , the systematic designation , for all operations of whatever size , of a special representative of the Secretary-General having complete authority over the various components of the operation and , on the other hand , at least for peace-restoration and conflict-moderation operations , which almost inextricably link military tasks ( even including combat ) with negotiation and humanitarian aid activities , an integrated structure involving close cooperation between civilians and military personnel at all levels of command , including logistics .  
The costs relating to the military mandate total $ 30,455,700 gross ( $ 29,739,700 net ) inclusive of the Office of the Force Commander , which consists of two international staff , one at the D-2 level ( the Force Commander ) and one Field Service officer , 170 local staff , 1,230 contingent personnel , maintenance and operating costs , 142 contingent-owned vehicles , including engineering equipment , and 53 rented vehicles . 
In general , desk officers and military mission officers deal with day-to-day operational and related political issues that affect the mandate and conduct of operations , as well as a broad range of other issues , which include military , logistical , administrative , humanitarian , electoral and legal issues .  
This seminar will provide instruction in the development of peace-keeping training methods and programmes to a select group of military and civilian police officers who already have previous United Nations peace-keeping experience and who are presently involved in peace-keeping training at the national level , or will likely become involved in the future .  
The Secretary-General 's military advisers and potential troop contributors to a renewed but significantly reduced UNMIH assessed that a contingent of 1,900 would be the minimum viable force required to accomplish UNMIH 's mandate with an acceptable degree of risk to the United Nations personnel involved .  
This force , at 9 per cent of the size of the multinational force which intervened in September 1994 to establish a stable and secure environment , and one third the size of the currently mandated UNMIH , was designed to be of sufficient strength to be capable of executing the military mission it was being assigned , and no more . 
The most updated theory of international aviation law states than an aircraft designed for " civilian " air transport belonging to a private airline and operated by a civilian crew may in a particular situation be considered to be " State aircraft " if it performs a military , customs or police function . . .  Other aircraft , besides those involved in military , customs or police services , could also be considered " State aircraft " because the enumeration in the Convention is not preclusive .  
Invites Member States and regional , international and non-governmental organizations to stand ready to provide assistance in support of progress achieved by the parties towards political dialogue , and to cooperate with the Government of Burundi in initiatives for comprehensive rehabilitation in Burundi , including in military and police reform , judicial assistance , development programmes and support at international financial institutions ;  
Invites Member States and regional , international and non-governmental organizations to stand ready to provide assistance in support of progress achieved by the parties towards political dialogue , and to cooperate with the Government of Burundi in initiatives for comprehensive rehabilitation in Burundi , including in military and police reform , judicial assistance , development programmes and support at international financial institutions ;  
The three country studies are being complemented by comparative analyses of selected United Nations missions , interviews with key personnel in civilian and military peace-keeping as well as national policy makers ; analyses of United Nations documentation and reports with a view to improving coordination between Headquarters and field commanders ; and review of press reports to gauge public reaction to the way in which peace-keeping operations are conducted .  
Condemns in the strongest terms all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict , recognizing that the leadership in territories under the control of Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and formerly Serb-held areas of the Republic of Croatia , the commanders of Serb paramilitary forces and political and military leaders in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) bear primary responsibility for most of those violations and that persons who commit such acts will be held personally responsible and accountable ;  
Further condemns violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including killings , the burning and looting of houses , the shelling of residential areas , harassment of and attacks on refugees , the elderly and the infirm perpetrated by members of the Croatian armed forces and civilians in the formerly Serb-controlled regions of Croatia during and subsequent to the military operations there in August 1995 ;  
Also gravely concerned , however , at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including killings of civilians , arbitrary arrest and detention , restrictions on freedom of expression and association , torture , forced labour , forced portering , human rights abuses in border areas in the course of military operations , forced relocations and development projects , abuse of women and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Noting with interest that the Government of Nigeria , on 1 October 1995 , affirmed the principle of multi-party democracy , announcing its intent to accept the principle of power-sharing , lift the ban on political activity and the press , devolve power to local levels of government and subordinate the military to civilian authority , but disappointed that only limited action in this regard has followed ,  
The cost of the mission for the 12-month period amounts to $ 7,302,500 gross ( $ 6,795,200 net ) and provides for 44 military observers , maintenance and operating costs for 38 United Nations-owned vehicles , one air support helicopter and one fixed-wing aircraft for supply purposes and overall logistic support and civilian support of 24 international and 35 local staff .  
The Advisory Committee inquired as to the administrative , organizational and resource requirements for UNFICYP 's humanitarian activities and was informed that a military unit comprising from 15 to 20 personnel , including civilian local level staff , was involved in this activity . 
As indicated in the executive summary of the report of the Secretary-General , the cost estimate of $ 17.1-million gross provides for a strength of 135 military observers and 139 civilian staff ( 64 international and 75 local ) and reflects " a moderate increase over the prior period " .  
It is the invalidation by the United States side of the key provisions of the Armistice Agreement that has paved the way for south Korea 's current status as the greatest United States overseas military base and nuclear base .  
Stressing that all forms of repression and cruel and inhuman treatment of women and children committed by belligerents in the course of military operations or in occupied territories , including taking them hostage , their imprisonment , the destruction of their dwellings and their forcible eviction , should be considered criminal ,  
All documented sources , including those of the information media and the international relief organizations , have confirmed that it is Uganda that provides support and that it is the major source arming the insurgency and supplying it with men and logistic , military and political support and providing transit access to all the forces and parties that are supporting the insurgency . 
Taking into account the geographical size of the Mission area and the number of military and civilian personnel and the premises of UNAVEM III , it is considered essential that personnel from the aforementioned sections be deployed in the regional headquarters to administer and monitor related activities under the supervision of their respective sections at Mission headquarters .  
As the Mission approaches full deployment and with the operations of the logistic support service contract , emphasis was given to the strengthening of selected areas of administration and integrated support services to ensure optimum efficiency in the utilization of human resources and the timely provision of services to military and civilian personnel .  
( e bis ) Restructure and target the allocation of public expenditures to promote women 's economic opportunities and equal access to productive resources and to address the basic social , educational and health needs of women , particularly those living in poverty ; ( g ) Reduce excessive military expenditures and investments for arms production and acquisition , as is appropriate and consistent with national security requirements , in order to increase resources for social and economic development ;  
96 Paragraph 233 ( d ) calls upon Governments and non-governmental organizations , the United Nations and other institutional organizations , to include , as appropriate , " information about international and regional instruments and standards in their public information and human rights education activities and in adult education and training programmes , particularly for groups such as the military , the police and other law enforcement personnel , the judiciary , and legal and health professionals to ensure that human rights are effectively protected " .  
The Office will include four other international Professional staff : a political adviser / special assistant at P-5 level , a legal affairs officer at P-5 / P-4 level , a military advisor at P-4 level and an administrative officer at P-3 level .  Its support staff will consist of 10 international and locally recruited General Service staff and 2 security officers .  
The perpetration of acts of terrorism and the imposition of inhumane measures by the Israeli military are neither surprising nor a new phenomenon - for they are integral to the expansionist and aggressive nature of this regime , which has disregarded the will of the international community and violated numerous General Assembly resolutions and Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) with impunity .  
To our disappointment , however , not only have military actions continued , but they have in fact intensified , as evident in the brutal shelling of the United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon ( UNIFIL ) compound earlier today , which has taken the lives of yet more innocent civilians .  
The Chinese delegation expresses its profound concern at the large-scale military offensive launched by Israel in recent days in southern Lebanon , which has resulted in the loss of innocent civilian lives , the massive destruction of property and a large number of civilians ' becoming homeless or refugees , consequently further escalating the conflict in southern Lebanon and aggravating the already tense situation .  
The two sides express their readiness to further develop friendly exchanges between their military forces at various levels and further strengthen their cooperation on military technology on the basis of equality and mutual benefit , bearing in mind their respective international obligations .  They declare that the development of military relations between China and the Russian Federation and their cooperation in the field of military technology are not directed against any third country or country bloc .  
As regards the subprogramme on environmental law , institutions and policies , over 10 additional intergovernmental meetings were convened on issues relating to the protection of marine environment from land-based sources of pollution ; the Lusaka Agreement on cooperative enforcement operations directed at illegal trade in wild fauna and flora ; military activities and the environment ; and African Ministerial Conference on the Environment .  
In keeping with the options I outlined in my report to the Council of 19 January 1996 , and pursuant to resolution 1042 ( 1996 ) , I sent a technical team last month to examine the current functions of the MINURSO military component and to determine whether its size could be reduced , while still permitting it to play an effective role in monitoring the cease-fire and verifying allegations of violations . 
The members of the Council urge you to fulfil your recent unilateral commitment to quarter 50,000 troops at the latest by 15 June 1996 and to increase significantly the number of workable weapons and other military equipment turned over by UNITA troops to UNAVEM III . The members of the Security Council are also concerned that the military talks on the modalities for the integration of UNITA troops into the Angolan armed forces were not concluded on 15 May 1996 in accordance with the timetable agreed by all parties on the Joint Commission earlier this month . 
The establishment of an appropriate defence system incorporated in collective security arrangements ( NATO ) and the definite formulation of a defence policy based on the principles of civil control of military forces and on a democratic political system are our permanent commitment .  
The military element , with an initial strength of 1,200 personnel , would be located in Port-au-Prince only and be composed of one reduced infantry battalion and one reduced reconnaissance battalion , a helicopter unit , a military police unit , an engineer unit , transport and logistic elements , as well as adequate medical support .  
The Mission is deeply concerned at the continuation of this practice , which , given the army 's historic influence over such committees , undermines the primacy of civilian authority and also affects the human rights situation , in that members of the voluntary civil defence committees and former military commissioners are implicated in numerous complaints of human rights violations .  
In view of the foregoing , it is clear that , while members of national military contingents discharge international functions and serve in United Nations peace-keeping operations under the operational control of the Organization , no direct contractual or statutory relationship exists between them and the United Nations .  
Ethnic and religious tensions between Timorese and Indonesians had increased ; mass immigration of Indonesians into the territory of East Timor was continuing ; cases of torture , arbitrary detention , attacks , summary executions , disappearances and killings were becoming increasingly common ; the numbers and violence of the military and police forces were increasing , and many Timorese , especially young people , had become strangers in their own land and had been forced to seek asylum . 
Whenever incidents occurred that were contrary to its firm commitment to uphold and protect basic rights and fundamental freedoms , as had happened in Dili on 12 November 1991 , the Indonesian Government took swift and decisive action to bring to justice those responsible , be they civilians or military personnel . 
The revised cost estimates submitted in document A / 50 / 696 / Add . 1 of 30 October 1995 amounted to $ 890,230,900 gross ( $ 881,791,500 net ) , compared to the original estimates of $ 1,013,629,900 gross ( $ 1,002,021,100 net ) and took into consideration reduced requirements for military and civilian personnel , rental of premises , transport operations , air operations and the purchase of equipment .  
The United States Secretary of Defense and Speaker of the House have recently intensified their campaign of disinformation and hostile propaganda against the Islamic Republic of Iran by the reckless suggestion of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran respectively on National Public Radio on 2 August and NBC 's " Meet the Press " of 28 July - statements which represent blatant examples of political manipulation of public opinion already apprehensive about the recent tragic events . 
In 1994 , the Special Committee , in keeping with its consistent goal of limiting documentation and streamlining its report to the General Assembly , recommended to the Assembly that , in preparing the general working papers on the Territories , the Secretariat should , where applicable , incorporate under separate headings those sections relating to foreign economic and other interests and those on military activities and arrangements in those Territories .

The human rights situation in Burundi is characterized by large-scale massacres involving both State agents and rebels ; selective murders of intellectuals , political leaders , provincial officials and Hutu merchants , as well as certain Tutsi military officers alleged to be moderates ; arbitrary arrests ; and enforced disappearances .  
Condemn the serious crimes and inhuman atrocities of genocide , massacres , extrajudicial killings , reprisal killings , arbitrary detention , torture , use of rape as an instrument of suppression , burning of houses , villages and townships , and destruction and desecration of holy places , committed by the Indian Government , through its military and paramilitary personnel , renegades and mercenaries , in Jammu and Kashmir during the last seven years ;  
Condemn the serious crimes and inhuman atrocities of genocide , massacres , extrajudicial killings , reprisal killings , arbitrary detention , torture , use of rape as an instrument of suppression , burning of houses , villages and townships , and destruction and desecration of holy places , committed by the Indian Government , through its military and paramilitary personnel , renegades and mercenaries , in Jammu and Kashmir during the last seven years ;  
These included changing mandates and constant uncertainties in the Mission , delays in budgetary authorization , delays in issuing budgetary allotments , cumbersome and inflexible procurement procedures , lack of experienced United Nations staff , frequent rotation of military personnel , difficulty in integrating military and civilian components and intractability of some local authorities with respect to their obligations under the various status of forces agreements . 
The international community rose in unison in condemning unequivocally the military takeover and in demanding the prompt and unconditional return of Burundi to its constitutional Government , including the restoration of its elected National Assembly .  
The military coup d'etat of 25 July last in Burundi was a violent act that flew in the face of established constitutional order , accelerated the spiral of violence and arbitrarily usurped political power to the detriment of democracy , national reconciliation and peace in that country .  
These include the unbanning of all political parties , the restoration of the National Assembly , the initiation of businesslike and unconditional negotiations between all political and military powers in the context of the mediation efforts pursued by former President Nyerere , guarantees for the security and safety of members of the former Government , the immediate cessation of all acts of violence , ensuring the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the targeted needy groups throughout Burundi and ensuring the safety and security of personnel of regional and international humanitarian agencies .  
Over half a century of occupation of south Korea by United States military forces has created the tragedy of a divided nation , put grave obstacles in the way of peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula , even in the current post-cold war era , and inflicted immeasurable misery and suffering on the entire Korean population .  
New ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development , including poverty eradication , should be explored .  
Subsequently , our mission in New York received an unofficial note by facsimile transmission , a copy of which is attached herewith , in which Iraq was brazenly ordered not to reinforce its defensive forces on its own territory , not to defend itself , its people or its sovereignty , and not to repair or rebuild the civil or military installations situated in Iraqi territory , which the cowardly American aggressors had destroyed with their long-range cruise missiles . 
It has maintained close relations with the administrative , judicial and military authorities at local and national levels , and has reported its assessment of the human rights situation to the Government on a regular basis .  
In recent experience , some peacekeeping operations have been mandated to include different combinations of the following tasks : monitoring of cease-fires and buffer zones , protecting humanitarian convoys , disarming and demobilizing ex-combatants , reforming military establishments , demining , establishing police forces , organizing or monitoring elections , monitoring human rights , promoting electoral and judicial reform , promoting aspects of civil administration and coordinating economic rehabilitation .  
I hope the Turkish side will respond positively to my proposal , otherwise the only logical inference to be drawn will be that the massive presence of Turkish forces is not for the alleged safety of the Turkish Cypriot community , but for the perpetuation of the status quo , which , as stated in your report , has been created by military force and is sustained by military strength and which the Security Council has deemed unacceptable .  
The opposition informed UNMOT of its forward positions as at 20 July , briefed it about military developments in the Tavildara sector , agreed to identify potential UNMOT team sites behind their forward defensive positions once they had been verified and to establish communication with UNMOT in the Tavildara sector , as foreseen in the joint declaration .  
Growing stocks of surplus fissile material from the military sector and growing amounts of plutonium in civilian fuel cycles make accountancy and control an urgent task of paramount importance .  
Information had been gathered from authorities , victims ' families and non-governmental organizations , from investigations done by specialized agencies and the press , and by reviewing judicial documentation and ascertaining the open and public existence of organizations devoted to the recruitment of soldiers of fortune , that is , persons of military rank or persuasion disposed to serve as mercenaries .  
As reported at the consultation of the whole , on 18 September 1996 , at approximately 0200 hours local time , a 350-ton , 106-foot military submarine was found about 100 feet offshore , grounded in shallow water near the coastal city of Kangnung , one of the major ports on the eastern coast of the Republic of Korea .  
The above savings were realized mainly as a result of more favourable rates for the hire of aircraft used for rotation of military personnel ; receipt of additional vehicles , equipment and supplies from other missions ; cancellation and deferment of maintenance projects as part of the special measures taken in relation to the bad financial situation in the United Nations ; and the reduced prices offered by the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic for petrol , oil and other lubricants .  
In this paragraph , Van der Stoel betrays his intentions and his established bad faith : how otherwise can these claims that there are no special circumstances in Iraq be interpreted , when he knows perfectly well that Iraq has been facing a hostile situation and experiencing unrest , quite apart from having to endure gross violations of its sovereignty and territorial integrity due to the imposition by certain of the allied States of the no-fly zones in the north and south of Iraq , and direct military intervention ?  
The fact that our Kurdish people sought help from its national Government in order to end its suffering exposes the persistent claims of the Special Rapporteur and certain of the allied States , principally the United States , that their military intervention in the northern part of Iraq was intended to protect the Kurds , and supports our previous assertions , namely , that the secret but true intention behind that intervention is to tear apart Iraq and fragment its territorial integrity .  
The practices engaged in by the United States and its subsequent large-scale military mobilization , undertaken without regard for the widespread disapproval aroused in world public opinion , are in flagrant violation of the purposes and principles of the United Nations concerning the maintenance of international peace and security and respect for the sovereignty of States and the dignity of their nationals . 
Kazakstan calls on the parties to the conflict on all concerned States in the region and on the international community to take urgent measures to halt the military action , ensure non-interference in the internal affairs of the sovereign Islamic State of Afghanistan and guarantee its territorial integrity .  
As already noted , the reduction of UNMIH 's military element necessitated a concentration of the remaining forces in Port-au-Prince ( see attached map ) , which , as the centre of economic , political and social activity in Haiti , is critical to the maintenance of a secure and stable environment .  
I should also like to reiterate my firm conviction that the continued presence of United Nations civilian police monitors is contingent upon the existence of a secure environment maintained by a credible international military force ( see S / 1995 / 1031 , para .  29 ) .  
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 8 of document A / 50 / 363 / Add . 4 that , as proposed by the Secretary-General in paragraph 35 of his report to the Security Council ( S / 1996 / 416 ) , some of the existing UNMIH contingents remained in Haiti and that the revised cost estimates for the liquidation provides for the repatriation of 538 military personnel and contingent-owned equipment and for 8 international staff and 28 local staff for the closing of the base camp in Cap Ha \ x { 9ba0 } ien .  
However , terrorism was not confined to certain countries or regions ; it posed a serious threat to all countries , regardless of their military power , economic development and geographical location , and therefore required a concerted international response .  
Child sex clients have been identified as coming primarily from the following groups : paedophiles , preferential child sex abusers or regular situational customers , local prostitute users , tourists , travelling businessmen , migrant foreign workers , military personnel , public workers in isolated places and others .  
The relationship between the military and prostitution has been illustrated by cases of soldiers paying for the sexual services of orphaned , abandoned or displaced girls , who are often held in brothels under conditions of virtual slavery and forced to sexually service off-duty local soldiers .  
The revised cost estimates for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 amounted to $ 31,902,000 gross and reflected a 39 per cent decrease in gross terms in comparison with the original cost estimates , taking into account that it provided for the reduced strength of 230 military observers and 9 civilian police observers , supported by a civilian establishment of 167 personnel ( 102 international and 65 local ) and 2 observers from the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) .  
The revised cost estimates for the maintenance of the Observer Mission for the 12-month period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 represented a 47 per cent reduction in the previous estimate , due to the reduced staffing level , comprising 34 military observers , 43 international staff and 47 local staff , and the non-implementation of disarmament and demobilization programme .  
Violations of human rights remain extremely serious , including , in particular , the practice of torture , summary and arbitrary executions , forced labour , including forced portering for the military , abuse of women , politically motivated arrests and detention , forced displacement , serious restrictions on the freedoms of expression and association , and the imposition of oppressive measures directed , in particular , at ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
I should like to mention by way of example the return of UNITA members to the National Assembly , which they left in 1992 ; the return of the expected total number of general officers to the Angolan Armed Forces ; the completion of the selection process of a total 26,300 UNITA military troops for induction into the Angolan Armed Forces ; the re-establishment of government administration , given the continued illegal occupation of certain areas of the national territory ; and the free circulation of goods and people in the areas under its control .  
Just a few years ago , Nicaragua maintained a large army and devoted a large part of its national budget to meet high military expenditures , to the detriment of its economic and social development .  Just a few years ago , many of you , and even we ourselves , were looking with sceptism at the possibility of peace reigning in Nicaragua or of the country enjoying full liberty .  
The doctrine shall encompass respect for the Guatemalan Constitution , human rights , the international instruments ratified by Guatemala in the military field , protection of national sovereignty and independence , the territorial integrity of Guatemala and the spirit of the agreements on a firm and lasting peace .  
The necessary amendments shall continue to be made to the corresponding regulations so that the military education system is consistent , in its philosophical framework , with respect for the Guatemalan Constitution and other laws , with a culture of peace and democratic coexistence , with the doctrine defined in this Agreement , and with national values , the integral development of the individual , knowledge of our national history , respect for human rights and the identity and rights of the indigenous peoples , and the primacy of the individual .  
The practice of voluntary military recruitment shall be continued , until the Government of Guatemala , on the basis of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights , adopts the necessary administrative decisions , and the Guatemalan Congress approves a civil service law , which shall include military service and community service ; this law shall entail fulfilment of a duty and a constitutional right , which is neither compulsory nor a violation of human rights , is universal and non-discriminatory , and would reduce the length of service and offer options to citizens .  
Such practices are also liable to generate a worrying state of affairs , not only for Iraq , but also for Turkey and the region as a whole , which is primarily afflicted by the irregular situation created by the Americans and their allies in northern Iraq , not to mention the human injury to which Iraqi citizens are exposed as a result of the illegitimate activities of the Turkish armed forces and their military operations inside the territory of the Republic of Iraq . 
He reported about numerous allegations , the majority of which concerned death sentences imposed after trials by military courts , allegedly falling short of international standards .  
The Special Rapporteur informed the Commission that he had received allegations concerning secret trials , allegedly held before the Special Military Court in Lagos , of a group of more than 30 military officials and civilians accused of being involved in an attempted coup d ' \ x { 5f4b } at which was discovered in March 1995 .  
The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , in his report to the Commission on Human Rights ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 4 ) cited information that had been brought to his attention in 1995 concerning the secret trials held before the Special Military Court in Lagos of more than 30 military officials and civilians accused of being involved in an alleged attempted coup d ' \ x { 5f4b } at .  
The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers expresses grave concern that in Nigeria today substantial judicial power , particularly in the administration of criminal justice , is vested in the military and special ad hoc tribunals to the exclusion of the ordinary courts . 
Those constraints included the numerous changes in its mandate , as well as other uncertainties in its operating environment , delays in budgetary authorization , cumbersome and inflexible procurement practices and procedures , a lack of experienced United Nations staff , the frequent rotation of personnel , the difficulty of integrating military and civilian components , and the intractability of some local authorities with respect to their obligations under the various status-of-forces agreements .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
At a time when profound changes are taking place in the international arena and the United Nations is being increasingly called upon to face new challenges that are not always conciliatory and require the concerted efforts of all Member States , regardless of size , geographical situation or economic and military might , it is vital that a broad programme of comprehensive reform of the multilateral institutions be adopted to further measures , in a decisive manner , for the democratization of international relations based on the rule of law and the mutual benefit of States .  
This is because while members of national military contingents discharge international functions and serve in United Nations peacekeeping operations under the operational control of the Organization , no direct contractual or statutory relationship exists between them and the United Nations ; the terms and conditions of their assignment to the United Nations peacekeeping operations are set out in bilateral agreements and / or understandings entered into between the Organization and their respective Governments . a / General Assembly resolution 50 / 217 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses .  
In that part of the former Yugoslavia , the ethnic Albanians , who constituted the overwhelming majority continued to be subjected to Serbian police and military repression and to large-scale violations of their human rights despite repeated condemnations of that situation in the relevant General Assembly resolutions .  
This singling out of the Jehovah 's Witnesses is almost certainly due to their religious militancy , which is expressed through proselytism , conscientious objection to military service and a variety of public demonstrations which call into question the interests of the dominant Church and the legislative and political system of the State .  
While it would now be possible to obtain commercial insurance coverage for contingent personnel assigned to United Nations peacekeeping operations if the Secretary-General were so authorized by the General Assembly , in view of the opinion provided by the Office of Legal Affairs , any compensation made for the death or disability of such military personnel could not be paid directly to disabled troops or dependent survivors , but rather to the national authorities , as was the current practice .  
In my report of 1 October , I observed that the Haitian National Police had not reached the level of experience and confidence required to control and defeat threats posed by subversive groups , and that it was clear , therefore , that the presence of the UNSMIH military element was a key factor in the ability of the Haitian authorities to contain the danger of destabilization by forces threatening democracy .  
Respect for the right of the Iraqi population to food and adequate health care was also called into question by the rationing system set up by the Government , which protected the elite of the Baath Party and the Iraqi military , but served as a way of subjugating the population to discourage any opposition and retaliating against the population in the south of the country , which was suspected of being hostile to the Iraqi regime .  
The multidimensional , intra-State nature of conflicts required that United Nations peacekeeping operations should be equipped with the skills to tackle a variety of military , political , humanitarian and civilian problems .  
Given the increasing interrelationship between political , economic , social , military and cultural factors in conflicts , the concept of peacekeeping had been modified and had acquired a multidimensional and integral character .  
ICRC had also been developing a model manual for the armed forces on the law of armed conflicts , designed primarily for use by senior officers with tactical responsibilities , and intended as a reference tool for the military commander without legal background .  
Concrete measures which had been identified included improved police training methods , a protection programme for witnesses of human rights violations , assistance to victims of violent crimes , transfer to civilian courts of competence to try military police crimes , and federal investigation of human rights violations .  
Although the establishment of a rapidly deployable mission headquarters was a constructive step , it would not be a panacea for the range of problems experienced in previous United Nations peacekeeping missions ; it would provide operational and planning improvements , however , and would enable the United Nations to deploy more quickly to the field a well-prepared and jointly trained team of military and civilian personnel in the most critical phase of peacekeeping operations .  
His delegation called upon the major Powers to stop providing military , financial and strategic support , as well as direct and indirect financing for the construction of new settlements , since that posed a threat to a just and lasting peace in the region .  
This frontier was described as the " existing administrative border between the Republics of Montenegro and Croatia " and the reason stated for " raising the issue of borders " were " historic , geographic and other interests arising from the military significance and strategic position of Prevlaka and the entire Boka Kotorska Bay " .  
The suffering of the Afghan civilian population , who continue to bear the main brunt of the civil war , and the dangers that that war creates for regional stability , oblige the international community to intensify its search for a peaceful solution , despite the fact that certain Afghan parties seem to continue to favour the military option .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
Urges the international community to reduce , as appropriate , excessive military expenditures on and investments in arms production and acquisition , consistent with national security requirements , in order to increase resources for social and economic development , in particular , to poverty eradication programmes in developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries ;  
The cost estimates contained in annex III to document A / 50 / 696 / Add . 4 covered the pre-liquidation period from 1 January to 30 June 1996 and provided for the repatriation travel of 309 military observers and 7,463 contingent personnel , as well as for the maintenance of an average monthly strength of 1,237 contingent personnel , 293 international civilian staff , 458 local staff , 725 international contractual personnel and 23 United Nations Volunteers .  
Since Israel 's occupation of East Jerusalem , more than 28 years ago , the Israeli Government has tried to judaize the city by distorting its identity , changing its demographic character , deporting Palestinian inhabitants and reducing their numbers through the application of military , administrative and legal measures , moving settlers into the city and expanding Jerusalem 's borders to prejudice the final status of the city .  
In fact , the much needed international humanitarian and technical assistance to the Palestinian people remains hindered by the apparent non-cooperative attitude of the Israeli authorities , who continue to enforce upon the population of today 's Palestine the same restrictive bureaucratic formalities that they designed to deal with the people living under their military occupation in previous years . 
Noting the key role played to date by the United Nations Civilian Police , supported by United Nations military personnel , in helping to establish a fully functioning Haitian National Police Force of adequate size and structure as an integral element of the consolidation of democracy and the revitalization of Haiti 's system of justice , and , in this context , welcoming continued progress towards establishing the Haitian National Police ,  
Urges the international community to reduce , as appropriate , excessive military expenditures on and investments in arms production and acquisition , consistent with national security requirements , in order to increase resources for social and economic development , in particular to poverty eradication programmes in developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries ;  
I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that our country is prepared to provide , on specific terms , special units of its military forces for demining operations conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and other international organizations , or on a bilateral basis .  A mine-clearance training centre , established in the city of Kamyanets-Podilsky , provides all the facilities necessary to train foreign specialists in this field .  
Thirdly , the relationship between the States themselves : instead of waging propaganda wars and in some cases even resorting to economic coercion and the use of military force to deal with ethnic tensions and situations involving minorities in other countries , States should rely on the legal means provided by international human rights instruments , in particular the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , which contained a provision allowing States to make a complaint when they were not satisfied with the performance of another State in matters covered by the Convention .  
The maintenance of a significant United Nations presence in Haiti in the form of military elements , particularly against the backdrop of the far more drastic crisis situations in other regions of the world and the extremely difficult financial situation of the Organization , could be perceived as a manifestation of double standards , especially when one takes into account the totally different attitude towards other truly critical and more volatile flashpoints .  
Noting the key role played to date by the United Nations Civilian Police , supported by United Nations military personnel , in helping to establish a fully functioning Haitian National Police Force of adequate size and structure as an integral element of the consolidation of democracy and the revitalization of Haiti 's system of justice , and , in this context , welcoming continued progress towards establishing the Haitian National Police ,  
The same was true of other violations of the law of armed conflict mentioned in the new draft , i.e . , the employment of poisonous weapons calculated to cause unnecessary suffering or the wanton destruction of cities , towns or villages not justified by military necessity .  
IV of the Constitution of the United Mexican States provide that public service in the armed forces is compulsory ; that it is an obligation for Mexicans to receive military instruction making them fit to exercise the rights of citizens skilled in the handling of weapons and proficient in military discipline ; that males who are Mexicans and have reached 18 years of age shall be considered to be citizens of the Republic and that it is a prerogative of those persons to bear arms in the armed forces for the defence of the Republic and its institutions .  
National military service serves to enrol personnel in the armed forces , is instituted by constitutional declaration contained in the fourth paragraph of article 5 of the Constitution of the United Mexican States , which provides that the only public service which may be compulsory , under the terms of the respective laws , is military service , which requires all the country 's inhabitants to assist in the defence of the fatherland .  
Secondly , the reasons for raising the minimum age to 18 years are not only associated with recruitment methods but with the physical , psychosocial and emotional impact on the young person , the teaching of military skills and attitudes and the deprivation of opportunities to develop educational and social skills more appropriate for civilian life .  
A key element of an effective arms control regime is provision for complete , accurate and timely exchange of relevant information , including the size , structure , location and military doctrine of military forces as well as their activities ; - Verification . 
Authorizes the Secretary-General to commence the gradual and progressive withdrawal of UNAVEM III formed military units from individual quartering areas prior to February 1997 , and to accelerate the withdrawal schedule subsequently , if former combatants vacate the quartering areas in accordance with the Lusaka Protocol and other factors are conducive to withdrawal , without putting at risk the successful completion of the peace process ;  
The extension of UNAVEM 's mandate until 28 February 1997 will provide the Angolans with an additional chance to accomplish the remaining military and political tasks foreseen in the Lusaka Protocol and to establish the basis for a peaceful , united and prosperous Angola .  
Authorizes the Secretary-General to commence the gradual and progressive withdrawal of UNAVEM III formed military units from individual quartering areas prior to February 1997 , and to accelerate the withdrawal schedule subsequently , if former combatants vacate the quartering areas in accordance with the Lusaka Protocol and other factors are conducive to withdrawal , without putting at risk the successful completion of the peace process ;  
Underlines that the primary responsibility for the further successful implementation of the peace process lies with the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina themselves , which during the next two years should assume increasingly a greater responsibility for the functions now undertaken or coordinated by the international community , and stresses that without compliance and active participation by all the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina in rebuilding a civil society they can not expect the international community and major donors to continue shouldering the political , military and economic burden of the implementation and reconstruction efforts ;  
A number of major causes of the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina have yet to be removed and it is only the continuing sound international presence , both military and civilian , that can prevent the resumption of hostilities even on a minor scale .  
Underlines that the primary responsibility for the further successful implementation of the peace process lies with the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina themselves , which during the next two years should assume increasingly a greater responsibility for the functions now undertaken or coordinated by the international community , and stresses that without compliance and active participation by all the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina in rebuilding a civil society they can not expect the international community and major donors to continue shouldering the political , military and economic burden of the implementation and reconstruction efforts ;  
His delegation had actively participated in every aspect of the work , as the United States was committed to the establishment of a fair , effective and truly international criminal court that met all relevant standards of due process and strengthened both international and national law enforcement and military justice interests .  
It is noteworthy that Mr . Clerides who stressed during the exercises that " the joint military doctrine is here to stay and will proceed as planned " had already made their ultimate aim clear in pursuing this confrontational posture when he stated that " . . . when the time comes , Hellenism will be resurrected in north Cyprus " ( Simerini , 4 April 1996 ) . 
Non-democratic States over time tend to generate conditions inimical to development : politicized military rule ; a weak middle class ; a population constrained to silence ; prohibitions on travel ; censorship ; restrictions on the practice of religion or imposition of religious obligations ; and pervasive and often institutionalized corruption .  
Support for a culture of democracy has proved critical to success in holding free and fair elections in which all actors in society - government officials , political leaders , parliamentarians , judicial officials , police and military forces and individual citizens - play their accorded roles .  
Moreover , at a time of increasing demand but decreasing resources within the United Nations for international action , the potential of regional groups to contribute political , diplomatic , financial , material and military resources has taken on even greater importance . 
Rape continued to be reported as widespread ( perpetrated by members of all parties to the conflict ) and regular reports were received of women being obliged to perform forced labour for military and paramilitary units and groups .  
Reiterates grave concern about the excessive levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , as well as the lack of progress towards a significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;

As indicated in paragraph 17 of the report of the Secretary-General , an additional eight United Nations Volunteers would be assigned to the eight regional offices to carry out education and promotion tasks , coordinated by the MINUGUA Education and Promotion Unit , which , in conjunction with the Indigenous Affairs Unit , would design a comprehensive training programme aimed at indigenous leaders , civil and military authorities and non-governmental organizations .  
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development will be undertaken .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
We make this statement for the sake of the record of this institution , which was established for the attainment of the goals and ideals reflected in its Charter , maintains its neutrality , supports peoples ' will and is based on the principles of sovereign equality of all States , irrespective of their size , geographical location and military or economic potentialities .  
The new , restructured MINUGUA will oversee an unprecedented transformation in the political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public-security life of Guatemala .  
The signature of this most recent Agreement makes effective all the previous agreements signed by the parties , which cover complex political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public-security questions . 
Conscious of the human rights and dignity of all refugee children and adolescents and that , due to their specific needs and vulnerability within the broader refugee population , they need to be among the first to receive protection and assistance in any refugee situation , Gravely concerned that refugee children and adolescents continue to be exposed to family separation , physical violence and other violations of their human rights , including through sexual abuse and exploitation , and military or armed attacks ,  
With the successful conclusion of the military observer Mission in Guatemala , the definitive ceasefire between the Government and the URNG has established the necessary conditions for the promotion of peace and development in a subregion of the Americas which has been particularly vulnerable to pernicious blends of internal strife and external interference .  
In our view , special attention should be paid in the charter to the security interests of States that have not joined military and political alliances and have not expressed the desire to join such alliances in the foreseeable future .  
Unfortunately , these gains were nullified by subsequent events , characterized by the ominous statements made by the Israeli Prime Minister and members of his Government and backed by continued military occupation ; land confiscation and settlement in the occupied territories ; construction of housing units in the settlement of Givat Zeev ; demolition of Palestinian houses in the occupied territories ; confiscation of identity documents of Palestinians ; imposition of closures to drain the Palestinian economy , resulting in the loss of potential income ; and systematic change in the physical character and demographic composition of Jerusalem .  
In fact , the much-needed international humanitarian and technical assistance to the Palestinian people also remains hindered by the apparent non-cooperative attitude of the Israeli authorities , which still continue to enforce upon the population of today 's Palestine the same restrictive bureaucratic formalities that they had designed to deal with the people living under their military occupation in previous years .  
The vital contribution of the multinational Stabilization Force in providing a secure environment for the implementation of the Peace Agreement has been generally recognized , and it is particularly important that the conclusions of the Bonn Peace Implementation Conference confirmed an emerging consensus on the need for an international military presence to continue beyond June 1998 . 
I should like to conclude my remarks by expressing the Government of Japan \ x { e5b8 } deep appreciation to all the countries and international institutions that are engaged in the noble and difficult tasks , both civilian and military , that are required for the implementation of the Peace Agreement .  
Mr . Galu \ x { ea98 } a ( Czech Republic ) : Although the Czech Republic , as an associated country , endorsed the statement of the European Union presented by the representative of Luxembourg , I would like to make a few additional comments on this point .  The reason is that the situation in the former Yugoslavia , specifically in Bosnia and Herzegovina , is a long-term priority of Czech foreign policy , reflected in our intensive political , military , material and financial support for all efforts to bring stability to the region .  
These are the facts about the bellicose , obstinate , rejectionist and intransigent attitude of the Taliban , which is aided and assisted by the presence of agents of the cross-border military intelligence services and attested to by the physical presence of foreign military and paramilitary prisoners in Afghanistan .  
It is inequitable to reprobate and qualify as warlords those who are fighting for the independence of Afghanistan and not for personal and material gain and to equate them with those who are serving the interests of a foreign country by inviting foreign military personnel .  
Regional and international arms races and military expenditure do not merely threaten international peace and security and the stability of States ; they also absorb tremendous amounts of national economic and financial resources , particularly in the developing countries that so sorely need those resources to achieve their aspirations to economic and social development .  
The issues to be discussed at the conference are set out in table 4 , and include methods for estimating capital stock , including the perpetual inventory method and direct survey methods ; concepts of capital for different purposes , such as balance sheets and productivity analysis ; issues for national balance sheets ; and extensions of the 1993 SNA capital boundary , such as computer software , mineral exploration and non-weapon military equipment .  
While the international community was watching without taking proper action , the systematic policy of " ethnic cleansing " operations , planned and carried out by nationalistic politicians , military and paramilitary groups as well as civilians who were themselves victims of racist propaganda , resulted in the mass exodus of more than 2-million refugees and internally displaced persons , in the death of more than 200,000 human beings , in the economic destruction of vast areas of the region , and in the most horrendous acts of torture , systematic rape and similar expressions of barbarity .  
The continued presence of Rwandan refugees in neighbouring countries has had a number of serious , closely linked consequences of several kinds : humanitarian ( suffering endured ) , economic ( depleted humanitarian assistance ) , political and strategic ( interests of States ) , ecological ( destruction of host States ' ecosystems ) and security ( military and paramilitary activities of former FAR and militia members , as well as border insecurity ) . 
The case has some special features , not only because of its innately tragic nature , but because of its more immediate effects ; for the first time a President of the Republic accepted institutional responsibility for an occurrence ; for the first time a massacre was immediately brought before the courts ; for the first time a whole military unit was taken to court ; for the first time military jurisdiction was set supplanted by the civil courts in a case with military defendants ; for the first time criminal charges of extrajudicial execution were preferred .  
None of the parties to the conflict has fulfilled the obligations arising from article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions , and serious violations of its provisions have occurred , including attempts on life and physical integrity , homicide , torture , taking of hostages , outrages upon personal dignity and arbitrary arrests , including arrests of wounded and sick people , without the justification of military necessity .  
Rounds of consultations are currently being held at the level of the Government and political parties on a new preliminary bill on the subject , with the aim of harmonizing the specifically military and social aspects to be included in the future law .  
In order for the disbanding and disarming of military commissioners and CVDCs to lead to a fundamental change in the human rights situation , it is necessary to eradicate the counter-insurgency mentality , which is a source of potential human rights violations , and to promote in its place tolerance , unrestricted public participation and the effective presence of institutions for the protection of human rights .  
Likewise , all political , military or police authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina violating the Dayton / Paris Accords , international law and basic human rights must be held accountable and confronted by those responsible for implementation .  
After the fire , Thai government authorities allegedly relocated the toxic residues to a dumpsite in a military area in Kanchanaburi . The toxic waste is buried approximately 4 m underground and the entire 3,800 _ m2 area is covered with cement . 
The Agreement brings into effect all the previous agreements encompassing military , political , social , economic and environmental issues and binds them into a comprehensive nationwide agenda for peace .  
The Special Rapporteur would like to point out that rebels , Tutsi militias or Tutsi groups from the displaced persons ' camps accompanying the military , are all equally guilty of murderous acts that result in grave violations of international humanitarian law and human rights .  
Urges the international community to reduce , as appropriate , excessive military expenditures on and investments in arms production and acquisition , consistent with national security requirements , in order to increase resources for social and economic development , in particular to poverty eradication programmes in developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries ;  
He emphasized the fact that , owing to the deleterious effects of transborder crime , international cooperation against it had become the fourth major area after political , economic and military cooperation .  
It encompasses detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues which have been bound together into a comprehensive national agenda .  
The arming of Armenia on such a large scale and the sharp build-up of its military might in violation of international legal norms , at a time when relations between Azerbaijan and the Russian Federation are improving and steadily developing , poses a real threat to the entire region .  
Armenia , which has seized 20 per cent of Azerbaijani territory and expelled more than 1-million Azerbaijanis from their homes , and which constantly accuses Azerbaijan of being unwilling to resolve the conflict through peaceful means , has in fact not halted and continues through all illegal means to build up its military potential , which is a gross violation of the provisions of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe , which regulates the admissible levels of conventional weapons for the countries parties to the Treaty .  
The deliveries to Armenia of military equipment and spare parts for them , which were unauthorized by the Government of the Russian Federation , have provoked a negative response on the part of a number of Russian officials and have become the subject of special deliberations in the State Duma of the Russian Federation , which has instructed its main committees - on defence , security , and CIS and ties with fellow citizens - to conduct a thorough investigation .  
It encompassed detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues , which had been bound together into a comprehensive national agenda .  
The resettlement and integration verification area would consist of the Chief ( P-5 ) , one-P-4 to liaise with the international and national institutions responsible for the resettlement of displaced persons , one P-3 ( local ) to deal with the legal aspects of repatriation and documentation of ex-combatants , one military liaison officer , and one civilian police observer , supported by three Local level staff .  
Taking into consideration the modest financial capabilities of the State , in this short period it has been impossible to supply the appropriate equipment and arms for the armed forces of the Republic of Macedonia at a level that would provide for an appropriate initial reaction or a possible urgent military action ;  
He called for increasing contacts across the Taiwan Straits and negotiations that would lead to reunification in which Taiwan would ' exercise a high degree of autonomy and enjoy legislative and independent judicial power , including that of final adjudication ' and ' may also retain its armed forces and administer its party , governmental and military systems by itself ' .  
The continued preference of some of the warring Afghan parties for the military option , and their intransigence and lack of responsiveness to the strenuous efforts of the special representative to achieve a comprehensive settlement , confirm the need to develop the efforts currently being made by the United Nations and to direct these efforts to more practical steps leading to the creation of the climate necessary for the implementation of the proposals made to date and of the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council on this subject .  
In view of the grave consequences of a possible intensification of military confrontation , the Polish delegation shares the view expressed by the Secretary-General in his report that it is necessary to increase and coordinate international efforts to impress upon the Afghan parties the need to solve the conflict in a peaceful way , that is to arrive at a lasting political settlement with the participation of all segments of Afghan society .  
Greatly concerned , the Islamic State of Afghanistan wishes to request you to take appropriate preventive measures in order to halt the planned massive military assault which would inevitably entail the loss of many lives of the innocent civilian population .  
In an earlier report ( S / 25274 , para . 56 ) , the Commission stated that : " ' Ethnic cleansing ' has been carried out by means of murder , arbitrary arrest and detention , extra-judicial executions , rape and sexual assault , confinement of civilian population in ghetto areas , forcible removal , displacement and deportation of civilian population , deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas , and wanton destruction of property . "  
Although the aim of producing the above-mentioned report ( which was prepared by a United Nations expert ) was not to study the problem of landmines and remnants of war and their effect on the future of the country and its development , the references to and preliminary estimates of war damages make it clear beyond any doubt that what was suffered by Libya during the military operations , and the landmines and explosives left by those operations , represented a human and material disaster of incalculable proportions . 
This requires that they be included in economic and military matters , in both multilateral and bilateral diplomacy , and in official delegations to international and regional conferences .  
Organizations of the United Nations system and various economic , political and military structures at the regional level have become important international public employers , but here , too , women have remained a minority concentrated in lower-level positions .  
In her statement , the Chairperson-Rapporteur , Ms . Erica-Irene Daes , outlined four major concerns : ( a ) the need for a recognition of the effects of dispossession of lands and habitat on the health of indigenous peoples ; ( b ) the exposure of indigenous peoples to hazardous industrial and military activities ; ( c ) the need to improve access to national health-care systems ; ( d ) the role traditional medical practices could play in national primary health-care systems and the protection of those practices .  
As at 13 June , the cumulative total of arms and ammunition recovered and verified by military observers was 10,036 weapons and more than 1.24-million assorted pieces of ammunition , while approximately 3,750 weapons had been reported surrendered to ECOMOG outside the official disarmament sites .  
In such cases , it is also common for the majority of the members of the judiciary to be removed from office and for the ordinary courts to be replaced by military courts to try people for alleged political offences , culminating in a Supreme Court of Justice that legalizes institutional acts or their equivalent , or confers a supra _ constitutional status on emergency rules adopted by the regime .  
The Civil Affairs Unit continues to coordinate with legal non-governmental organizations to resolve cases where the Government of Croatia does not issue documents according to the agreed procedures , including failure to meet administrative deadlines , refusals to issue passports to men of military age and refusals issued without the adequate explanation required by Croatian law .  
In order to avoid military courts , in those countries where they have not yet been abolished , helping to perpetuate impunity by virtue of a lack of independence resulting from the chain of command to which all or some of their members are subject , their jurisdiction must be limited solely to specifically military offences committed by military personnel , excluding human rights violations constituting serious crimes under international law , which come under the jurisdiction of the ordinary domestic courts or , where necessary , an international court .  
Reiterates grave concern at the continuing excessive levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , and the lack of progress towards and significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;  
We sincerely hope that the Angolan Government , and UNITA in particular , will , in the fundamental interests of the people of their country and in a continued spirit of unity and cooperation , seize the historic opportunity to complete as soon as possible the pending tasks in the political and military fields and achieve national reconciliation at an early date , thus paving the way for national reconstruction and development in the country .  
We urge the Government of Angola , and in particular UNITA , to make haste and complete the remaining political and military aspects of the peace process , including the normalization of State administration throughout the national territory in accordance with the agreed timetable and procedures ; the transformation of the UNITA radio station into a non-partisan broadcasting facility ; the registration and demobilization of all remaining military elements ; the elimination of all obstacles to the free circulation of people and goods ; and the disarmament of the civilian population .  
The professionalism of the role the army now plays in national life was made clear by its comportment during the electoral process of March 1997 : in marked contrast to the record of military interference in the history of El Salvador , the army demonstrated its respect for the democratic decision of the Salvadorian people that those elections represented .  8 .  Before the signing of the peace agreements , public security functions were carried out by bodies dependent on the armed forces .  
At the beginning of the 1990s , the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung took the landmark initiative of demolishing the concrete walls built up on the south side of the military demarcation line , allowing free travel between the north and the south , and holding north-south high-level talks and the north-south summit talks to remove the root cause of the war and accelerate the process of peaceful reunification on the Korean peninsula in the next few years .  
I should like in the present letter to alert you to the fact that between 1 January and 30 June 1997 United States and other warplanes continued to violate the airspace of the Republic of Iraq from military bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and to engage in such hostile , provocative and inflammatory actions as the dropping of heat flares in civilian areas and on civilian installations in Iraq .  
Such a dramatic development as the current incident could be avoidable if the United States would not leave the maintenance of the demilitarized zone entirely to the south Korean puppets , insisting only on new war provocation , while neglecting our proposal for establishing an interim agreement that can replace the obsolete Korean Armistice Agreement , and for Democratic People 's Republic of Korea / United States military general-level talks . 
Noting the key role played to date by the United Nations Civilian Police , supported by United Nations military personnel , in helping to establish a fully functioning Haitian National Police Force of adequate size and structure as an integral element of the consolidation of democracy and the revitalization of Haiti 's system of justice and , in this context , welcoming continued progress towards professionalizing the Haitian National Police ,  
With its leaner and more focused mandate , the Mission will undergo a corresponding reduction of its personnel and will thus complete its transformation from the large peacekeeping operation established in 1995 , with a strength of approximately 6,000 military and 700 civilian police personnel , to a contingent of 250 civilian police and a headquarters unit of 50 military personnel having full command and control over a voluntarily funded security element .

On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 21 August 1997 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , calling attention to the fact that Turkish military operations in northern Iraq are continuing to violate Iraq 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and urging the United Nations to meet its responsibilities as laid down in the Charter and halt the intimidation and aggression to which Iraq is constantly being subjected .  
It should particularly be mentioned that maps utilized by the Azeri side are , first , drawn on a distorted scale , as Nagorno-Karabagh and adjacent territories , in comparison with the neighbouring regions , are drawn larger than they are in reality , and second , the line of the Karabagh-Azeri military contact is drawn more eastwards than the genuine borders of the confrontation : a fact to be easily observed if Azeri maps are compared with the military and other maps used by the OSCE Minsk Group on the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict . 
The High Contracting Parties , while independently deciding on matters of national security and military organizational development , shall engage in close cooperation in these areas and determine forms of interaction on the basis of this Treaty , the bilateral Treaty of 16 March 1995 on the Russian military base in the territory of the Republic of Armenia , and other relevant agreements .  
The meetings and talks that were held during the visit confirmed the broad convergence of the interests of the two States in the political , military and strategic and economic fields , and the similarity of their approaches to global and regional problems .  
Promising directions of cooperation of development of cooperative links in the mining and metallurgical , chemical and jewellery industries and light industry , mechanical engineering , building materials production , military industrial complexes and agro-industry complexes ; the establishment of inter-State industrial and financial groups and joint enterprises ; cooperation between transport department ; harmonization of the actions of the banking systems of Armenia and the Russian Federation ; and other joint actions taken in the light of the mutual economic interests of the two countries .  
While crying for the introduction of diversified military equipment , the south Korean authorities are now shipping modern tanks , armoured vehicles , anti-aircraft missiles , anti-tank missiles and helicopters from the Russian Federation as well as the United States , Harpy unmanned attack planes from Israel and huge military equipment from many countries around the world .  
With a view to promoting peace and strengthening security in the Mediterranean region , the new Government of Malta has time and time again committed itself to a foreign policy that is based on the values of democratic governance , on the upholding of fundamental human rights , on the peaceful settlement of disputes and on a policy that is in favour of disarmament and strongly opposes military aggression , and the manufacture , distribution and proliferation of all types of armaments and weapons , especially weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological .  
It has never engaged in overseas aggression , nor does it have any intention of using landmines in other countries .  Should China use anti-personnel landmines in legitimate circumstances , it would be entirely for the purpose of defending against foreign military intervention and aggression , safeguarding its national unification and territorial integrity , and ensuring a peaceful life for its own people .  
Thirdly , it is necessary to prevent a small number of countries taking advantage of their advanced military technology and economic power to seek their absolute security and military superiority over others while they focus the target of disarmament on the developing countries and deprive them of their legitimate right and means of self-defence .  Fourthly , the countries with the largest and most sophisticated conventional and nuclear arsenals should continue to bear special responsibility for disarmament .  
The decision gradually to remove up to 500 tons of highly enriched uranium and up to 50 tons of weapons-grade plutonium from nuclear military programmes is an effective contribution by Russia to ensuring that nuclear disarmament is irreversible .  The 1972 Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems ( ABM ) is of paramount importance to nuclear disarmament as a key element of strategic stability and a prerequisite for further reductions in strategic offensive arms .  
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , will be undertaken so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
Genuine and substantive discussions should take place without further delay between the present military regime and the leaders of NLD and with other political leaders who were duly elected in the democratic elections of 1990 , including representatives of ethnic minorities .  Certain steps reportedly taken in July by SLORC , apparently to initiate such discussions , are a welcome and positive development , but that development must be intensified .  
These seminars are intended to strengthen the capacity and improve the performance of all public officials - judicial , administrative military , and law enforcement officers involved in the administration of justice at the prefectural level .  
The project covers five main areas of activity : human rights education and training for the judiciary , the military , the gendarmerie , the police , prison administration personnel , other civil servants and members of local human rights non-governmental organizations ; capacity-building in the sector of civilian and military justice ; capacity support for human rights non-governmental organizations ; the popularization of human rights through formal and informal education and promotion activities ; and support for genocide victims and vulnerable groups .  
The effective functioning of the justice system and , in particular , the independence of the judiciary have been seriously undermined by several factors , including military intimidation , political pressure , very low salaries and a limited level of legal training of the judges and prosecutors , publicly recognized corruption of the judicial personnel , and article 51 of the Civil Servants Act .  
In the context of widespread rumours about arrests , executions and disappearances , and of the evacuation of their nationals by several embassies , numerous persons affiliated with FUNCINPEC , BLDP and KNP , including senior political , military and police officials of those parties , parliamentarians , leading activists and supporters , as well as affiliated journalists , reported threats and intimidations and expressed fears for their lives and safety .  
In conclusion , the Special Representative urges the Government to complete its election preparations by agreeing on an appropriate legal framework , establishing an election commission that is clearly independent , taking legal and political steps to establish the Constitutional Council , creating guarantees that would give the political parties equal opportunities to express themselves via the media , demobilizing and disarming the armed troops of political parties , and ensuring political neutrality by all military and security forces .  
The Cambodia Office continued to benefit from the generous support of UNDP in several areas of its work , including the provision of legal advice to the National Assembly , supporting the National Assembly Commission on Human Rights and Reception of Complaints , provision of training for provincial judges and court staff , assisting the Government in developing forensic capability , and provision of training to police , commune leaders and military officers at the provincial level .  
These included deferment of military service for Serbs in the region ; guarantees of Serb political representation at the local , regional and national levels ; and affirmation of the Government 's intention to protect Serbs ' civil and legal rights as required by Croatian law .  
The Convention is recognized as the first truly verifiable global disarmament accord , with a unique , comprehensive and effective verification regime covering both military and industrial facilities .  
On the other hand , it was generally assumed by the Panel members that the measures for prevention should be applied primarily to the small arms and light weapons manufactured to military specifications , because in this case the question has to be addressed on a global basis and because the issue of civilian firearms regulation is currently being taken up by the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice .  
Resources that should be expended on providing a better life for present and future generations are being wasted on war machines and on vain efforts to acquire elusive military security on an individual national basis , instead of reliance on and pursuit of collective security .  
As far as transparency in the conventional weapons sphere is concerned , Jordan is of the view that unless the scope of the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms is broadened to encompass military holdings and procurement through national production , as well as stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction , effective operation of the Register can not be expected in the near future .  
The visits to Kibungo Prison and the communal cachots and the discussions with the civilian , military , prison and judicial officials who met with the Special Representative provided valuable insight into the prevailing conditions of detention and the urgency of conducting fair and effective criminal trials for those accused of genocide and related acts .  
Within this framework , the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms must , if it is to be successful , be expanded to include information on other categories of armaments that are not currently covered , such as nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , in addition to advanced technology with military applications .  
Moreover , the Register must be expanded to include nuclear weapons and sophisticated technology with military applications if it is to become a more balanced instrument , free of all discriminatory criteria , and to have a more global scope and the highest possible number of participants .  
Though we fully realize that peace and security , as well as stability , in the region of the Middle East will be achieved only when a comprehensive , just and lasting settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict in all its dimensions is attained , it is essential to create the necessary climate and security conditions based on equal security for all , security at the lowest level of armament , and security that would not allow for the military superiority of any individual party .  
It should be borne in mind that the expanded verification role of MINUGUA covers a package of agreements signed by the Government of Guatemala and URNG , which include detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues , which are bound together into a national peace agenda . 
New policy perspectives coordinating the commercial , consumer and strategic requirements on a national and international level needed to be established , and the dialogue between military , industry and civilian users needed to be extended .  
The unencumbered balance resulted mainly from savings attributable to lower deployment of civilian and military personnel , availability of rent-free premises and accommodation , lower requirements for transport and communication spare parts than earlier estimated owing to the implementation of the wet lease and self-sustainment arrangements under the new reimbursement procedures for contingent-owned equipment and the continued availability of supplies from existing UNPF stock .  
An average of 96 groundsmen and cleaners were employed under special service agreements to clean a maximum of 88 military locations at a monthly payment equivalent to the lowest grade provided for in the established local salary scales ( $ 915 per month ) .  
Norway firmly believes that the stabilizing presence of a NATO-led military follow-on force , authorized by a Security Council mandate , will also be required after June 1998 , when the current SFOR mandate expires , in order to consolidate our gains and provide vital support to the civilian agencies involved .  
Continued support from a robust and credible NATO-led military force will not least be crucial to a successful completion of IPTF 's efforts to restructure , retrain and reform the local police and judicial system in Bosnia in order to help them handle public security in a manner which is professionally sound , democratic and observant of human and minority rights .  
Reiterates its grave concern at the continuing excessive and increasing levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , and the lack of progress towards any significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;

According to reliable sources available to the Commission , the exiled Rwandan political and military elite located in Nairobi have formed an " invasion group " to plan for the invasion of Rwanda in pincer-movement attacks from the east and the west - the camps in Zaire and United Republic of Tanzania - which would " meet in Kigali " to conquer the country and restore Hutu rule .  
The Council recommended that the Commission be appointed by the Secretary-General and be composed of 5 to 10 impartial and internationally respected persons , including legal , military and police experts , under the chairmanship of an eminent person , and assisted by the appropriate support staff .  
In 1994 , in keeping with its consistent goal of limiting documentation and streamlining its report to the General Assembly , the Special Committee had recommended to the Assembly that , in preparing the general working papers on the Territories , the Secretariat should , where applicable , incorporate under separate headings those sections relating to foreign economic and other interests and those on military activities and arrangements in those Territories .

We have been enthusiastic supporters of all initiatives aimed at limiting the arms trade , in addition to being aware that there are free markets often beyond Government control , we are concerned that the industrialized countries , by lifting embargoes in this field , may begin moving towards the opposite extreme and promote the sale of weapons everywhere , under pressure from the military industry , which has an extremely powerful lobby . 
By building peace , reducing unsustainable military expenditures , promoting equitable and sustainable development and encouraging stable , democratic societies which respect human rights , we not only limit human suffering , but we also address the root causes of conflict itself .  
I wish to reiterate that , while we fully support the noble crusade to protect innocent civilians from anti-personnel landmines , a sweeping ban can not be a satisfactory answer for a country like the Republic of Korea , which faces the real and present risk of a recurrence of all-out war , and whose heavily populated capital is only 25 miles from the military demarcation line .  
More attention should be given to appropriate and timely preventive measures , because we believe that early measures adopted by the international community are the ideal way to avert the outbreak of conflicts and wars and to avoid taking the necessary political and military measures in the aftermath of the conflict let alone imposing half solutions that are often unfair .  
The result of this deliberate inflexibility is the perpetuation of the illegal Turkish occupation of 37 per cent of the territory of the Republic by Turkish military forces , the artificial forceful separation of the two communities , the colonization of the occupied area by illegal settlers from Turkey , the refugee problem , the usurpation of the Greek Cypriot properties in the occupied area and the continued blunt violation by the Turkish side of General Assembly and Security Council resolutions .  
There is strong dissatisfaction in the international community about the fact that while we have a fully functional Tribunal in The Hague , the military and political leaders responsible for the grave violations of humanitarian law and the acts of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Herzegovina remain free .  
I must therefore underline that continued and adequate support from all member States for the Agency 's technical cooperation programme is indispensable if one is to realize the atoms for peace vision , which is the dual quest to prevent the spread of a military use of nuclear technology and to facilitate the transfer of nuclear techniques for peaceful purposes . 
My delegation wishes to emphasize that current realities of the post-cold-war era the diffusion of political , economic and military power among diverse regions of the world require that decisions affecting the maintenance of international peace and security be made in a more representative and democratic manner , mindful of the sovereign equality of all States .  
Equally historic is the balance achieved in civil and military relations , following the successes of April 1996 , when popular pressure and the enormous weight of solidarity on the continent thwarted attempts to take us back to outdated forms of autocracy .  
Nonetheless , several issues are still pending , such as the formalization of an agreement to ban the production and stockpiling of fissile material for military use ; the establishment of adequate and legally binding guarantees for non-nuclear-weapon States ; and the strengthening of existing multilateral safeguard mechanisms .  
While we consider counterproductive the ambition to expand the geographical frontiers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , and while we attach particular importance to efforts to remove nuclear weapons from the territory of foreign military bases in order to limit nuclear arsenals to the territory of the nuclear States , we are also ready to hold consultations on building a balanced system of relations between Belarus and that important military bloc and to work for political , military and strategic equilibrium with all our partners .  
Regrettably , the continuing military occupation by Israeli forces of large areas of Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , the presence of a large number of armed settlers in the occupied territories , the frequent roadblocks and boundary closures and the serious damage caused to the Palestinian economy all of them unilateral measures have a negative impact on the search for a just and peaceful settlement that respects the legitimate rights and claims of all the parties .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
I should like in the present letter to alert you to the fact that between 1 July and 31 December 1996 United States and other warplanes continued to violate the airspace of the Republic of Iraq from military bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and to engage in such hostile , provocative and inflammatory actions as the dropping of heat flares in civilian areas and on civilian installations in Iraq .  
For instance , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions has continued to receive information about massive displacements of populations which have occurred mainly in the context of armed conflicts , including indiscriminate military attacks against civilians during counter-insurgency operations , attacks by irregular armed groups , and communal violence .  
Widespread abuses appear to be ongoing within the context of an oppressive military presence , continuing environmental damage and the cultural subordination of indigenous people in the face of the massive exploitation of resources by powerful multinational corporations .  
In an open challenge to every provision of international humanitarian law , in pursuance of an exclusive military option and by acquiring a large quantity of weapons and logistical support from abroad , the Taliban mercenaries attacked and occupied part of Charikar , the capital of the province of Parwan to the north of Kabul on 16 January 1997 .  
As you may be aware , the agreements on Hebron do not only refer to the redeployment of Israeli military forces in the city , but also to agreed security arrangements , joint security measures , the deployment of the Palestinian police and various civilian matters relating to the normal and effective functioning of the city , and the Israeli and Palestinian populations therein .  
The three country studies are being complemented by comparative analyses of selected United Nations missions , interviews with key personnel in civilian and military peacekeeping as well as national policy makers ; analyses of United Nations documentation and reports with a view to improving coordination between Headquarters and field commanders ; and review of press reports to gauge public reaction to the way in which peacekeeping operations are conducted .  
It is also expected that the Secretariat will inform the Security Council , in accordance with operative paragraph 13 of Council resolution 1076 ( 1996 ) of 22 October 1996 , about the political , military and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan , which will obviously include the recent ethnic cleansing by the Taliban , which has been widely reported and witnessed by impartial observers and the international mass media .  
The Security Council welcomes the letter of 13 January 1997 ( S / 1997 / 27 , annex ) from the Government of Croatia on the completion of the peaceful reintegration of the region under the Transitional Administration , which guarantees the local Serb community representation and a voice at various levels of local , regional and national government , provides for a limited deferment of military service , and affirms the intention of the Government of Croatia to provide the local Serb population with the protection of their legal and civil rights under Croatian law .  
The people of Cuba as a whole are called upon to continue the profound and systematic examination of the annexationist and colonialist plans of the Government of the United States of America included in the Helms-Burton Act as a means of ensuring that in every territory , community , workplace , educational institution and military unit there is full knowledge of the specific consequences that the execution of these plans would entail for each and every citizen , and to guarantee everyone 's active and conscientious participation in the measures needed to defeat them .  
If applicable , assists the Director in preparing methods and procedures for verification of human rights during internal armed confrontation , commitment to strengthening the system for the protection of human rights , commitment relating to security forces and the bearing of arms , military conscription and voluntary nature and behaviour of paramilitary forces ; assists also in following up the verification and evaluating the findings of regional offices . 
On 21 September 1996 , the Vice-President of SLORC , Gen . Maung Aye , is reported to have declared that the military could remain in power longer if elements receiving foreign support caused disorder and on 25 September 1996 , the NLM indicated that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi would soon be charged with political crimes as she was conspiring with former colonial powers and aiding exiled dissident groups in a plot to overthrow the Government .  
In order to cut the main links between the insurgent groups and the civilian population , SLORC has forced entire communities living in the border area between Myanmar and Thailand to move to relocation sites which are subject to tight military control .  
The Special Rapporteur also observes that article 17 of Protocol II Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 requires that , in the case of displacements carried out for the safety of civilians or for imperative military reasons , the responsible party must take all possible measures . . . in order that the civilian population may be received under satisfactory conditions of shelter , hygiene , health , safety and nutrition .  Article 14 of the same instrument also stipulates a prohibition of starvation of civilians under the control of organized armed forces .  
Furthermore , arms sales are also a blatant violation of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 1993 Principles Governing Conventional Arms Transfers , where it is categorically stated that each participating State has to consider the internal and regional situation in and around the recipient country , in the light of existing tensions or armed conflicts , and is obliged to avoid transfers which would be likely to endanger peace , introduce destabilizing military capabilities into a region or otherwise contribute to regional instability .  
The Council also expressed grave concern about the excessive level of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including the introduction of sophisticated weaponry .  
With regard to the military observers , their presence in Angola during the coming months will continue to be required for the verification of the implementation of the remaining tasks of the Lusaka Protocol , the monitoring of the formation of the unified army and the demobilization of excess UNITA and FAA soldiers , as well as verification and investigation of allegations concerning the residual presence of UNITA armed elements and the existence of weapons caches .  
There is a strong tide of international opinion _ which New Zealand supports vigorously _ that rejects the military use of these most indiscriminate weapons when set against the deadly toll extracted on innocent civilians , as well as the economic and developmental loss in countries already devastated by war , and concludes that only a total ban is an acceptable goal .  
The effort has attracted strong and high _ level political support from a large number of countries ; it is overwhelmingly supported by the public , leading NGOs and a growing band of senior military figures .  
Its President 's statement to the Special Rapporteur , the documentation he turned over and his account of the company 's background in the countries where it has concluded specialized service contracts offer an alternate way of looking at things in which military sciences are likely to be taken out of the State context and to move into the private sector where they offer skilled professional services in a free and global market .  
By its own definition , Executive Outcomes is a company devoted to providing highly skilled and confidential military advisor services and to furnishing personnel , mainly military and highly skilled , to provide strategic and tactical training services in countries requiring sophisticated , effective support for the adequate control of their socio-political reality , to put an end to internal conflicts and to encourage the development of economic activities related to natural and mineral resource development .  
Van der Stoel 's allegations concerning mass arrests in northern Iraq are pure fabrications , since everyone is aware of that region 's special status and the consequences of the abnormal situation in which it finds itself , being outside the scope of the State administration due to foreign military intervention and the establishment of air exclusion zones .  
The reported unencumbered balance resulted from savings attributable primarily to ( a ) lower transportation costs than estimated in the budget in respect of repatriation of troops and military observers , civilian police and international staff ; ( b ) fewer rented vehicles and lower requirements for spare parts and maintenance of the vehicle fleet ; ( c ) lower hire / charter costs and aviation fuel charges ; and ( d ) lower actual charges for the shipment of ONUMOZ - and contingent-owned equipment .  
The net additional requirements of $ 536,400 for commercial communications were attributable to the satellite user charges from the previous mandate period ( $ 356,200 ) , recorded in the reporting period because of the late submission of invoices and the extensive use of satellite facilities by the military , civilian police and electoral observer components of the mission in November and December 1994 ( $ 626,000 ) . ( b ) Main trunking contract .  
The second phase of Operation Joint Guard , the stabilization phase , has now begun , and over the coming months SFOR will continue its efforts to keep the peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina by accomplishing its principal military tasks and by providing selective support to the international civil organizations in theatre , thereby contributing to a progressive implementation of broad civilian programmes .  
It is therefore clear that if there is to be genuine improvement in the disturbing situation in the former Sectors , efforts by both international and local organizations to promote confidence and reconciliation will continue to be needed for the foreseeable future .  1 International observers had estimated the total number of killings which had taken place in the former Sectors in circumstances unrelated to the military actions of August 1995 to be at least 120 ( see S / 1995 / 1051 ) .  
The Assistance Mission 's mandate has been revised and extended by the Council in subsequent resolutions , most recently in resolution 1029 ( 1995 ) of 12 December 1995 , which extended the Mission for a final period until 8 March 1996 .  In the same resolution , the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to reduce the military personnel level to 1,400 , to withdraw the civilian police component and to initiate planning for the complete withdrawal of UNAMIR within a period of six weeks after the expiry of its mandate .  
The earlier than anticipated departure , effective 2 February 1996 , of the key military logistic support unit provided to UNAMIR required that the functions of that unit be provided through commercial contractors .  
Contributing to the total additional requirements of $ 162,600 under the meal and accommodation budget line item were daily subsistence allowance payments to military contingent personnel ( $ 16,700 ) recorded in part , under this budget line item ( see para . 10 below ) , and charges for meal allowance paid in the preceding mandate period ( $ 48,600 ) .  
While repatriation travel of staff officers was arranged on commercial aircraft and reflected under other travel costs budget line item ( see para . 10 below ) , other military contingent personnel departed on the UNAMIR-chartered aircraft , with respective costs absorbed under the fixed-wing aircraft heading , resulting in savings of $ 826,600 .  
We would like to express our delight and gratitude to the entire military and civil staff of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan for the devotion and bravery they demonstrated in complicated and often life-threatening situations as they carried out the very difficult duties assigned them by the Security Council .  
On the basis of the bilateral and multilateral treaty instruments signed in recent years , and taking into account the development and intensification of trade and economic relations and also the existence of cooperative links in the past , the parties have reached the conclusion that there is a need to promote in every possible way cooperation in such areas as transport , communications , energy supply , engineering , agriculture , in science and technology and military technology , the environment , humanitarian assistance , tourism , physical culture and sports .  
It would be preferable to support the viewpoint that the prohibited participation by children in military operations should not be designated as direct participation since the actual practice in armed conflicts hardly allows any conclusions to be derived from the proposed distinction between direct and indirect participation by children in the conflict .  
The reason for this is that , although children unquestionably require protection from enlistment in the ranks of these groups , the political and military circumstances of these entities vary to an extent that makes it not only difficult to subject them to a standard rule but also dangerous to accord them international legal status , which might be misinterpreted as granting them implicit recognition .  
However , this criterion must be linked with the preceding one , since such control must be sufficient to enable the armed group or dissident forces to conduct sustained and concerted military operations and to implement the Protocol .  
Turkeys military intervention in northern Iraq and the aerial bombardment of that region , which had provoked a massive population exodus southwards , constituted unacceptable interference in Iraqs internal affairs and had been widely condemned by the international community . 
Encourages Governments , United Nations bodies and organs , the specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as appropriate , to initiate , coordinate or support programmes designed to train and educate military forces , law enforcement officers and government officials , as well as members of the United Nations peace _ keeping or observer missions , on human rights and humanitarian law issues connected with their work , and appeals to the international community to support endeavours to that end ;  
The Advisory Committee requested additional information on the operational requirements that necessitated the increase in troops over the authorized level and was informed that the average troop strength exceeded authorized strength by 166 in May 1996 and by 132 in June 1996 owing to the fact that the repatriation of the former UNCRO engineering battalion had to be postponed to the end of June 1996 , since engineering support was needed to complete the installation of military camps . 
The main activities of the Observer Mission , in addition to the completion of the remaining military tasks , would focus on political , police and human rights aspects , as well as on humanitarian and public information programmes aimed at supporting and consolidating the national reconciliation process , with a view to creating conditions conducive to political stability , economic and social recovery and sustainable development . 
Accordingly , we concur with the Secretary-General 's recommendation to extend the mandate of UNAVEM III until 30 June 1997 , on the understanding that the operation would gradually proceed with the transition towards a United Nations observer mission in Angola to be formally established on 1 July 1997 .  In addition to the completion of the remaining military tasks , the observer mission would focus on political , police and human rights aspects , as well as on humanitarian and public information programmes aimed at consolidating the national reconciliation process .  
Encourages Governments , United Nations bodies and organs , the specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as appropriate , to initiate , coordinate or support programmes designed to train and educate military forces , law enforcement officers and government officials , as well as members of the United Nations peace _ keeping or observer missions , on human rights and humanitarian law issues connected with their work , and appeals to the international community to support endeavours to that end ;  
Such violations shall include , but not be limited to , murder , ill _ treatment or deportation to slave labour or for any other purpose of civilian population of or in occupied territory , murder or ill _ treatment of prisoners of war or persons on the seas , killing of hostages , plunder of public or private property , wanton destruction of cities , towns or villages , or devastation not justified by military necessity ;  
This military putsch , contrary to the basic principles of democracy , is a grave assault against the dignity and free choice of a people who rightly aspire to build a state based on the rule of law after having undergone so many years of instability and civil war .  
The absence of any major incident during the entire process confirmed what had already been demonstrated by the flawless observance of the informal ceasefire since 19 March 1996 , namely , that in addition to their leadership , the combatants on both sides were convinced that the time for military confrontation was over .  
In paragraphs 45 to 47 of my report of 7 February 1997 ( S / 1997 / 115 ) , I described in detail the challenges that would be faced by the administrative component of the follow-on mission , as logistical support would have to be provided to headquarters of the follow-on mission in Luanda , to the political , police , human rights and military components in six regional headquarters , and to almost all provincial capitals and over 30 other outstations .  
In addition to the regular contacts between the Steering Committee and the relevant international organizations , the multinational protection force Command in Tirana has daily contact through its civil military cell with the representatives of the main international organizations .  
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development will be undertaken .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
The second option would be to deploy a United Nations peacekeeping force , composed mainly of African contingents provided with adequate military capability and with sufficient financial and logistical support to fulfil the challenging tasks entrusted to it .  
Croatia 's position is that , with the successful holding of elections , UNTAES has completed the executive part of its mandate : authority over the region should therefore be transferred to Croatia , the UNTAES military component should be withdrawn and the remaining United Nations civilian presence restricted to a monitoring and observation mission pending its replacement by a long-term OSCE observation mission .  
In the Middle East , the Palestinian people and the Arab population in the Syrian Golan , southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley continue to face serious environmental dangers as a result of the continued Israeli occupation of their territories and the growing military threat posed by nuclear , chemical and bacteriological weapons .  
The wealthy Powers preferred to embark on an insane and increasingly expensive arms race which geared their economies to military objectives and diverted funds from aid that could have helped the developing countries .  
Reiterates grave concern at the continuing excessive levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , and the lack of progress towards and significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;  
With the advance of the Allied Democratic Forces for the Liberation of the Congo ( ADFL ) in eastern Zaire and the consequent elimination of rear bases of armed Hutu rebels close to the Burundi-Zaire border , the security situation in Burundi gradually improved during the first months of 1997 , though strong pockets of rebels remained within the former Zaire ( now the Democratic Republic of the Congo ) near Fizi , Kalemie and Moba - enabling them to launch operations against targets in Burundi , including the Government 's military strongholds of Bururi and Makamba provinces .  
This paved the way to military and non _ military approaches to security : peace and security seen not only from a military standpoint but also from that of various disciplines , i.e . technological , legal , economic , political , psychological , religious and environmental .  
In this context we must recall the brutal acts of aggression carried out on Lebanese territory by the Israelis on an almost daily basis , the bombardments by Israeli military aircraft , the use against civilians of proscribed weapons , the naval blockade of Lebanon 's southern coast and the inhumane practices carried out against Lebanese citizens in the occupied area .  
In addition to expertise and support relating to the political , diplomatic and military aspects of designing and negotiating a disarmament , demobilization and reintegration programme , financial and developmental assistance from the international donor community , humanitarian agencies and non-governmental organizations have proven equally essential .  
They also agreed that regular meetings between their senior military and security officials , as well as joint military exercises and patrols and participation in subregional or regional peace operations , would help not only to tackle specific concerns such as controlling the illicit trade in arms and drugs and helping to resolve specific conflicts , but also to enhance overall transparency and confidence among Central African States . 
In our view , and as envisaged in the Register 's founding resolution ( General Assembly resolution 46 / 36 L ) , an expanded Register including data on advanced conventional weapons , on weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear weapons , and on high technology with military applications would represent a more balanced , more comprehensive and less discriminatory instrument attracting a larger number of regular participants . 
The Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } report makes it clear that the peace process has taken a crucial turn and that the progress made during the past two and a half years is threatened by UNITA \ x { e5b8 } delay in implementing its obligations under the Lusaka Protocol : complete military demobilization , facilitation of the Angolan Government \ x { e5b8 } restoration of State administration throughout Angolan territory , the transformation of radio VORGAN into a non-partisan radio station and UNITA \ x { e5b8 } genuine transformation into a political party .  
The lessons learned earlier in Rwanda and Somalia , and in Afghanistan during 1996 , showed that as long as political mediation , military and security operations , emergency relief and development assistance operated largely as independent policy instruments , the international response to large-scale violence would be incoherent and ineffective .  
Under such circumstances , the DPRK long ago put forward to the United States side a proposal that senior military officers of both sides sit down face to face to negotiate the establishment of a new mechanism in conformity with the actual situation in order to deter dangerous situations from arising , and has been waiting with patience for positive response .  
This suffices to prove that the present authorities of south Korea have pursued a more vicious policy of confrontation and war against the northern half of Korea than preceding military fascist regimes .  
It needs to be questioned to what extent this secrecy is compatible with the access to information necessary for democratic practice and social justice and whether , in some cases , instead of contributing to long-term security , it may conceal information about processes ( ecological , financial , military , etc . ) which are a potential threat to everyone and which need therefore to be addressed collectively . 
Given the vast territory of Angola and the deployment of MONUA at Luanda , six regional headquarters and 18 provincial offices , these aircraft are essential in providing support for the transport of military and civilian personnel , the transport of medium and heavy cargo from the Viana logistics base throughout the mission area and for medical and casualty evacuation purposes .  
Furthermore , arms sales to south Cyprus also constitute a violation of the 1993 Principles Governing Conventional Arms Transfers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , where it is categorically stated that each participating State has to consider " the internal and regional situation in and around the recipient country , in the light of existing tensions or armed conflicts " and are obliged to " avoid transfers which would be likely to endanger peace , introduce destabilizing military capabilities into a region , or otherwise contribute to regional instability " .  
The major issues addressed included providing an enabling environment for conversion at both national and local levels ; the role of public and private sectors ; conversion of military bases and defence industries to export processing zones ; tourism development in former military bases and defence complexes ; civilian manufacturing , prospects for small and medium-sized enterprise development ; and continuity of social infrastructure services .  
In the face of the intransigent position of the military junta , which has refused to step down , bringing about further deterioration of the situation in the country , which has one of the world 's lowest living standards , and threatening regional peace and security , the Polish delegation believes that the measures recommended by ECOWAS , which the Security Council would take by adopting the present draft resolution , are appropriate for the objective of the expeditious restoration of the democratically elected Government of Sierra Leone .  
It has done so despite the exceptional circumstances , well known to the international community , that Iraq is experiencing because of the maintenance of the comprehensive embargo imposed on it in August 1990 and because of the brutal military aggression of January 1991 that created highly abnormal conditions in all spheres of civilian life and for all groups of the population .  
In extreme cases , where coercive economic measures are most likely to have important long-term effects , such measures are usually multilateral , comprehensive in scope , extensive in duration and also frequently coincide with civil or other military conflict that also thwarts economic development .  
The systematic and planned killing , deportation , rape , summary execution , abduction , arbitrary detention and looting was perpetrated by the Taliban while Pakistani military personnel accompanied and assisted the Taliban .  
It seems illogical , and indeed morally indefensible , to suggest that armed forces are free to engage in behaviour against citizens of their own country which would be outlawed were they involved in military operations abroad .  
It is my firm belief that for the time being there could be no civil implementation without the strong international military force available immediately to ensure the secure environment , which is also mandatory for the work of the civilian organizations .  
In Cuba , special sanctions are applied to anyone who , while wearing a military uniform or appearing as a public official , violates the physical integrity of a detained woman by sexual abuse or harassment .  
The International Committee was currently developing a model manual for use by armed forces , which would serve as a reference tool for military commanders to incorporate the norms of humanitarian law into the operational decision-making process .  
With regard to the right to a competent , independent and impartial judge , the Special Rapporteur would like to assess the civil and the military faceless judges in light of international standards .  
These seminars have been intended to strengthen the capacity and improve the performance of all public officials _ judicial , administrative , military and law enforcement _ involved in the administration of justice at the prefectural level .  
The effective conduct of such operations required closer integration of political , military , humanitarian and economic actions , as well as collective security efforts at the global and regional levels .  
During the 1980s , the region experienced its longest period of elected Governments and constitutional processes , reduced military spending , and the acceptance by the armed forces of civilian governmental authority .  
The report should have contained a functional analysis of the backstopping requirements of peacekeeping operations as they relate to the implementation of their mandates ( military , civilian police , human rights monitoring , humanitarian , electoral assistance ) .  
There is an increasing trend of more joint satellite missions , both on a national basis ( e.g . by merging military and civilian systems ) and through international cooperation .  
Increased efforts of the Catholic Church and others , along with better understanding of the international humanitarian norms among senior military officers , improved the overall quality of human rights monitoring in East Timor .  
Intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to religion , education , art , science or charitable purposes , historical monuments , hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected , provided they are not military objectives ;  
Intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to religion , education , art , science or charitable purposes , historical monuments , hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected , provided they are not military objectives ;  
While most concepts on transparency in military matters have been developed and implemented in a regional context , on a global scale the international community has moved forward slowly and has made only modest progress so far .  
Greek Cypriot political and military leadership issued provocative statements while air force and naval units engaged in manoeuvres , using live ammunition , which pronounced the element of offence in order to " capture occupied territories " .  
The claim that the Serbian authorities pursue an open policy of genocide and ethnic cleansing supported by brutal military and police action against innocent Albanian civilians is both untrue and ludicrous .  
Intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to religion , education , art , science or charitable purposes , historical monuments , hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected , provided they are not military objectives ;  
Intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to religion , education , art , science or charitable purposes , historical monuments , hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected , provided they are not military objectives ;  
Once an FMCT has been adopted , there would be a reasonable chance that the main nuclear _ weapon States would commit themselves voluntarily to placing irreversible fissile material transferred from military uses to civilian ones under full IAEA safeguards .  
Formed by the political forces hostile to Mobutu , but lacking the resources needed for the achievement of its objective , AFDL accepted military and logistical assistance from friendly countries , including Rwanda and Uganda .  
Destruction of houses , arbitrary indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians and forced relocation of people to unknown sites culminating in what is known as ethnic and tribal cleansing are all deployed as techniques for a show of military might .  
The existence of many internal armed conflicts , some of them attributable to ethnic mistrust and resistance , which extend to the regional level and in which the warring parties resort to the hiring of mercenaries to boost their military potential ;  
On 3 May 1995 , KPA closed the NNSC buildings they controlled on Conference Row and suspended free movement across the military demarcation line into the northern part of the neutral joint security area to the remaining NNSC members and UNCMAC personnel .  
In order to train these units for future missions , the countries members of the Committee have agreed to organize joint military exercises in connection with mock peacekeeping operations , scheduled to be held in south-western Gabon in 1999 .  
In pleading guilty , the former Prime Minister not only acknowledged and confirmed that genocide did indeed occur in Rwanda in 1994 but also indicated that it was organized and planned at the highest levels , both civilian and military .  
It would be appropriate to consider the question of security through a multidimensional approach encompassing military , economic and social aspects at various levels international , regional and national .  
Conflicts based on ethnic , religious or cultural grounds are still emerging in many parts of our planet , claiming innocent lives and precious resources , while the race in military expenditures knows no bounds .  
Other training and reference materials in the pipeline are : a training manual for primary and secondary school teachers ; a training manual for national and local NGOs ; a handbook for parliamentarians ; a trainers guide for military peacekeepers , a training manual for the treatment of victims of domestic violence for the police ; and a handbook on human rights and constitutions .  
Owing to the difficulties experienced by the UNOSOM administration during the life of the Operation which were attributable to the complexity of the political , military and security situation in the mission area , compounded by the magnitude of the residual administrative and financial tasks involved , the originally envisaged time-frame for the completion of the Operations liquidation process proved unrealistic .  
The activities concerned included training for judicial , administrative and military authorities , provision of material and logistical support to judicial authorities , as well as awareness campaigns , selection and training of government officials within ministries to act as human rights focal points , capacity-building for non _ governmental organizations , and training initiatives with a focus on social and economic rights .  
In light of the repatriation of the military engineering support unit during the 1998 / 99 financial period , it is proposed that the Missions civilian staffing establishment be reduced by 5 international and 10 local posts authorized in connection with the deployment of the unit ( see A / 52 / 730 / Add . 2 , paras . 23 and 24 ) .  
Expressing its grave concern about the continuation of the military confrontation in Afghanistan , threatening regional peace and security and causing massive loss of life and extensive human suffering , further destruction of property , serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure , refugee flows and other forcible displacements of large numbers of people ,  
There is a common thread running through the preceding statements that makes unequivocally clear one of the characteristics of the recent armed conflicts that have led to political or military action by this Organization : the fact that their first and principal target has been the civilian population , in particular its most vulnerable sectors children , women , the elderly , the sick , refugees and internally displaced persons .  
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations is currently gathering statistics provided by Member States contributing personnel so as to provide data on the participation of women in their military and civilian police establishments , in order to have a better understanding of the potential to increase the participation of women in peacekeeping in the foreseeable future .  
Support to peacekeeping exercises focuses on the multidimensional and multinational aspects of this training and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations routinely provides not just military and civilian police role players and trainers , but also Special Representatives of the Secretary-General , political , legal and public information staff members and humanitarian , human rights and non-governmental organization coordinators .  
The legislation gives priority to countries which have demonstrated a sustained commitment to poverty alleviation or have recently suffered a major natural disaster , but it excludes countries with excessive military spending , gross violations of human rights , blatant drug trafficking or ethnic conflicts ;  
Noting with grave concern the content of the report of the Commission of Inquiry of the International Labour Organization , [ 5 ] appointed in March 1997 in accordance with article 26 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organization , regarding the observance by Myanmar of the Forced Labour Convention , 1930 ( No .  29 ) , which indicates a widespread and systematic use of forced labour imposed by the military on the civilian population ,  
Gravely concerned about the systematic terrorization of ethnic Albanians , as demonstrated in the many reports , inter alia , of torture of ethnic Albanians , through indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanian citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) by the police and military ,  
We are therefore convinced of the need to address these issues linked with the risk of weaponization of outer space in the CD in a coherent manner and review those gaps and loopholes in existing legal instruments that need to be closed in order to preclude the possibility of military conflicts in , or including , outer space .  
We fully agree with the Norwegian State Secretary when she said last week that excess material that is removed from the military production cycle should no longer have the status of military non _ verifiable material , but gradually be made subject to a transparent , non _ military and civilian regime subject to international verification .  
During the war of liberation ( 1996-1997 ) , which was intended to put an end to the Mobutu dictatorship by restoring to the Congolese people its long-affronted dignity and establishing a State governed by the rule of law and respectful of human rights and fundamental freedoms , the Alliance des Forces Dmocratiques pour la Libration du Congo ( ADFL ) had accepted military and logistical assistance from several friendly countries , including Rwanda and Uganda .  
By virtue of its inherent right of legitimate individual or collective self-defence , the Democratic Republic of the Congo is conducting appropriate military and diplomatic action to regain its sovereignty and territorial integrity , and to make its cause triumphant in the community of nations .  
Indeed , in struggling for a just cause , the Democratic Republic of the Congo is determined to defend itself , not only at the military level ( through the exercise of individual or collective self-defence ) but also at the judicial level ( through an application to the International Court of Justice ) in order to secure the condemnation of the aggressors and just compensation for the damage suffered , including the damage described in this white paper .  
It includes the lack of response to acts of political violence but is also reflected in the almost daily reports of abuses by military and police officials against common people , including killing , rape , illegal arrest or kidnapping for extortion as well as beating and other violent acts .  
The timely response to the recruitment exercise facilitated the expeditious processing of the recruitment of civilian and active military and civilian police personnel , in accordance with established recruitment and placement procedures , involving appointment and promotion bodies which formulated recommendations for selection of the best qualified candidates with due regard to the need to ensure the widest possible geographical basis and with regard to gender .  
Such assessments require a political grasp of the clash of parties , values and interests in the mission area , as well as a solid military , logistical and administrative understanding of the risks , costs and means required for operational effectiveness .  
The Office of Operations leads the planning process by providing the overall framework , developing options for courses of action , leading reconnaissance missions to the field and coordinating and integrating inputs from within the Department and from other entities ( e.g . military , police , humanitarian , electoral , human rights and other aspects including logistics , support and staffing requirements ) into a comprehensive plan for approval by the Security Council .  
Force was especially demonstrated through demands that an " international military presence " , meaning foreign troops , be accepted even before a political settlement was reached , although the scope and character of international presence had been defined in the agreement concluded between Yugoslavia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) . 
We believe that the establishment of a reliable system for European security and stability is possible only on a common European basis with unswerving observance of international law and by making use of the potential of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) as the most representative and universal common European organization capable of dealing with all the challenges of the twenty-first century - political , economic , military and humanitarian ones .  
The decisions of the Constitutional Court clearly show that , in the Colombian legal system , military jurisdiction is of a special and exceptional nature and may handle the offences committed only when the punishable acts have a clear _ cut , close and direct link with official duties .  
This process involved not only the execution of suspected individuals within the leadership of each unit ( including many members of the Government and the Central Committee of the Party ) , but also the repeated wholesale arrest and killing of all of the Party cadres in a unit considered treacherous , such as a particular sector or military division .  
We are convinced that the construction of a reliable system of European security and stability is possible only on a pan _ European basis , in a context of unswerving respect for international law , and using the potential of OSCE as the most representative and universal all _ European organization which can address all the challenges of the twenty _ first century - political , economic , military and humanitarian .  
In its resolution 1193 ( 1998 ) of 28 August 1998 , the Security Council identified a further relevant factor when it noted the fact that despite repeated pleas by the Security Council , the General Assembly and the Secretary-General to halt foreign interference in Afghanistan , including the involvement of foreign military personnel and the supply of arms and ammunition to all parties in the conflict , such interference continued unabated .  
The intensified terror tactics and military assaults by the Yugoslav forces against the ethnic Albanian community in many parts of the province represent the continuation of a systematic repression by the Yugoslav authorities to drive innocent civilians , especially women and children , out of Kosovo , reminiscent of the policy of ethnic cleansing that was carried out during the dark days of the Bosnian crisis .  
Belarus stresses that the use of military force against Yugoslavia without a proper decision of the only competent international body , which is undoubtedly the United Nations Security Council , as well as any introduction of foreign military contingents against the wish of the Government of Yugoslavia , qualify as an act of aggression , with all ensuing responsibility for its humanitarian , military and political consequences .  
The primary causes for these types of violation , one source reported , are the wide gap between the letter of the law and practice by the relevant authorities ; legislation and regulations that lead to the arbitrary detention of political opponents ; the absence of procedural safeguards in the law ; the lack of judicial independence ; and the absence of a separation between the military and the police . 
When the Democratic Republic of the Congo 's painful transition to independence in the 1960s saw the birth of the first armed militias , political leaders , including those in the United Nations , did not gauge what the refugee problem would become 40 years later , with refugee camps transformed into military training and arms-supply facilities , compromising any good-faith attempt to provide humanitarian assistance to vulnerable affected populations .  
By a letter dated 24 March 1999 addressed to the President of the Security Council ( S / 1999 / 320 ) , the representative of the Russian Federation requested that an urgent meeting of the Security Council be convened to consider " an extremely dangerous situation caused by the unilateral military action of NATO against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia " . 
The unencumbered balance of $ 2,556,300 gross ( $ 2,216,500 net ) was attributable to the delayed deployment of civilian personnel , fewer rotation of military observers and a substantial portion of the Missions equipment requirements being obtained through transfers from the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi .  
The unencumbered balance of $ 2,199,100 gross ( $ 2,153,300 net ) resulted primarily from accelerated repatriation of military personnel and reduced requirements for air operations , as well as the fact that staffing and non-staff resources earmarked for the support of the run-off presidential elections were not utilized .  
Demands an immediate halt to all repressive actions undertaken in Kosovo by the Serbian authorities which has led to further ethnic cleansing in the region , the genocide of Kosovars , their forced mass exodus and the destruction of their property with the aim of preventing their return , and also demands the immediate withdrawal of the Serbian military and paramilitary forces from Kosovo ;  
The archive should be organized by major substantive and support tasks , including monitoring ceasefires and buffer zones , protecting humanitarian convoys , disarming and demobilizing ex-combatants , reforming military establishments , defining and establishing police forces , organizing or monitoring elections , monitoring human rights , promoting electoral and judicial reform , promoting aspects of civil administration and coordinating economic rehabilitation .  
Condemning also the massive military operations launched by the Serbian authorities against the unarmed civilians in Kosovo , resulting in large _ scale killings , systematic and planned massacres , destruction of homes and property , and forced mass exoduses to neighbouring countries , as well as internal displacement ,  
In view of the substantial withdrawal of MONUA military units and observers , logistical support provided by the Observer Mission to the civilian police component was augmented both in terms of geographical coverage and the increased number of police observers , which reached their authorized strength of 345 by October 1998 .  
With the completion of the phased withdrawal of UNAVEM III formed military units , the authorized strength of MONUA from 1 March 1998 comprised 90 military observers , 955 contingent personnel , 345 civilian police observers , supported by a civilian establishment of 281 international staff , 225 local staff and 71 United Nations Volunteers .  
Given the vast territory of Angola and the deployment of MONUA at Luanda , six regional headquarters and 18 provincial offices , these aircraft provided air support for the transport of military and civilian personnel , medium and heavy cargo from the Viana logistics base throughout the mission area and for medical and casualty evacuation purposes .  
The continuing violations of the rights of children , in particular through the lack of conformity of the existing legal framework with the Convention on the Rights of the Child , through conscription of children into forced labour programmes , through their military and sexual exploitation and through discrimination against children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
By enlisting enormous military might and by aerial bombardment of the population of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , its infrastructure and economic potentials , NATO has brazenly dropped more than 5,000 tons of the most destructive explosives and used cluster bombs banned by international law , causing enormous human casualties and vast material destruction .  
It is incomprehensible to request the withdrawal of the legitimate forces of a sovereign State from its own territory instead of calling for an urgent ending of foreign military aggression , killing of civilians and destruction of civilian targets .  
Condemning also the massive military operations launched by the Serbian authorities against the unarmed civilians in Kosovo , resulting in large _ scale killings , systematic and planned massacres , destruction of homes and property , and forced mass exoduses to neighbouring countries , as well as internal displacement ,  
The continuing violations of the rights of children , in particular through the lack of conformity of the existing legal framework with the Convention on the Rights of the Child , through conscription of children into forced labour programmes , through their military and sexual exploitation and through discrimination against children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
We would also like to know what measures the NATO members intend to take , and when , to stop and correct the overt , flagrant and continuing violation of the obligations they have undertaken , and how they plan to compensate for the economic and other damage to Yugoslavia and its citizens after the halting of military action against this sovereign member State of OSCE .  
The use of such personnel had been expanded from the traditional area of technical cooperation to other sectors such as military planning , logistical support for peacekeeping operations , disarmament , humanitarian assistance , internal oversight , economic and social research and administration and management .  
It urges the Government of Colombia to establish as soon as possible the necessary measures to guarantee a truly independent judicial system , to ensure the transfer of all judicial procedures concerning serious human rights violations currently under military penal jurisdiction to the jurisdiction of the ordinary justice system and to separate the functions of the executive and the judiciary .  
The budgets provide for the continued deployment of 1,350 military contingent personnel and 24 police officers , supported by an increased civilian staffing establishment of 114 international staff , 111 local staff and 13 United Nations Volunteers , with provisions for the Missions liquidation reflected in the proposed 1999 / 00 budget .  
The revised budget for 1998 / 99 also provides for the replacement of obsolete and damaged refrigeration , water-purification and industrial laundry equipment required to support the MINURCA military personnel after the departure of the French logistical contingent .  
For operational reasons , in view of a substantial quantity of military-pattern equipment provided to the MINURCA military contingents by the Government of France as a voluntary contribution in kind , increased provisions are also made for the supply under letter-of-assist arrangements of essential required spare parts and other matriel required to maintain those assets .  
We appeal to the members of NATO to think before it is too late and to immediately halt their military action which has already brought such untold suffering to hundreds of thousands of people , created a humanitarian catastrophe and thrown Europe backwards into the distant past .  
Further escalation of military action , barbaric bombings of industrial , social , cultural and civilian targets and the peaceful population are all assuming horrible proportions .  
The strategic framework is to comprise integrated and coordinated actions for addressing any combination of political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic factors .  
The unencumbered balance of $ 4,571,900 gross ( $ 4,275,100 net ) resulted from reduced requirements as follows : military personnel costs ( $ 83,000 ) , civilian personnel costs ( $ 4,368,400 ) , operational costs ( $ 2,247,300 ) and staff assessment ( $ 296,800 ) ; these were offset by additional requirements amounting to $ 2,423,600 as follows : other programmes ( $ 19,300 ) and United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi ( $ 2,404,300 ) ( A / 53 / 908 , annex II ) .  
The Security Council must endorse the proposals which , among other things , would pave the way for a verifiable end to violence and ethnic cleansing in Kosovo , the withdrawal of Yugoslav military , police and paramilitary forces , the establishment of an interim administration in the province , the safe and free return of refugees and a political settlement providing self-government for Kosovo .  
We wish to recall the declaration of the Ministerial Meeting of the OIC Contact Group , held in Geneva on 7 April 1999 ; to confirm our strong condemnation of the policy of ethnic cleansing perpetrated by the Serbian authorities against the Albanian Kosovars ; and to demand an immediate halt to all repressive actions undertaken in Kosovo by the Serbian authorities and the immediate withdrawal of the Serbian military and paramilitary forces from Kosovo .  
Notwithstanding its own difficult economic situation , which , in fact , is complicated by economic losses caused by the ongoing military actions in Yugoslavia , Ukraine is contributing to international efforts by providing humanitarian aid to refugees from Kosovo .  
In this regard , progress has been made in many developing countries where public spending on education and health has increased against a background of fiscal adjustment under IMF-supported programmes . 11 At the same time , unproductive public expenditure , such as excessive military spending , should be avoided or reduced ; 
The revised budget for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 is therefore based on the maintenance of 1,350 military contingent personnel , 24 civilian police officers supported by the increased ( from 1 March 1999 ) civilian staffing establishment of 114 international staff , 111 local staff and 13 United Nations Volunteers .  
The former CIA official stated in this article that the National Security Advisor , Samuel R . Berger , justified the action against the factory by claiming that the plant was part of the " Sudanese military industrial complex " , that it was heavily guarded , that it produced no medicines and that its ownership trail led to terrorist chief Osama bin Laden .  
Following these informal consultations , the President made a statement to the media , on behalf of the members of the Council , expressing their concern at renewed fighting and their support for ECOWAS and other international efforts to bring peace ; calling upon all parties to halt military operations and allow the free flow of humanitarian assistance ; and urging all parties to renew their commitments to the Abuja peace process and to respect the ceasefire of 3 February .  
The members of the Council also expressed their support for renewed and urgent diplomatic efforts to reverse this negative cycle on the military , political , security and humanitarian fronts .  
The members of the Council expressed concern over the sporadic renewal of fighting , and called on all parties to halt military operations , respect international humanitarian law and facilitate the free flow of humanitarian assistance to affected populations .  
Thirdly , the adoption of a renewed Strategic Concept by a regional military alliance _ despite the declared end of the cold war _ is bound to generate considerable concern in the wide spectrum of nuclear and non _ nuclear States .  
A staff member , other than one recruited specifically for a mission , who has completed one year of satisfactory probationary service or who has a permanent appointment and who is called upon to serve in the armed forces of the State of which the staff member is a national , whether for training or active duty , may be granted special leave without pay for the duration of such military service , in accordance with terms and conditions set forth in appendix C to these Rules .  
Staff members who have completed one year of satisfactory probationary service or who have a permanent appointment may , if called by a Member Government for military service , whether for training or active duty , be placed on special leave without pay for the duration of their required military service . 
We have to come to grips with some very urgent questions , including the guarantee for the safe and unimpeded return of all refugees and displaced persons who have been forcibly expelled from their homes and villages in the wake of the heinous policy of ethnic cleansing that has been carried out by the Yugoslav military , police and paramilitary forces in Kosovo at the behest of the leadership in Belgrade .  
On the one hand , they are expected to hurt the economy because of the shortfall in revenue and the loss of jobs , while on the other , a more expedient handover of deteriorating facilities on lands held by the military would expedite land development projects , including a proposed free trade zone and the construction of affordable housing .  17 .  According to the administering Power , the residents of Guam have seen many improvements in the islands standard of living over the last several years .  
This includes regular army and naval forces , armed civilian groups , associated paramilitary groups , air forces , national guards , border police , army reserves , military police , intelligence services , federal and Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs local , special , riot and anti-terrorist police , and any other groups or individuals so designated by the international security force ( KFOR ) commander ;  
This process was very complicated from both the legal and technical perspectives and required a lot of resources and international assistance , so for us it seems disgraceful and unjust that in the context of mentioning countries which have abandoned their military nuclear programmes or forsworn nuclear weapons the name of our country is sometimes not even found .  
The fragile peace that has now been maintained in the region for five years thanks to the military and political balance that has been established and to the efforts of the international community must not be made dependent on the nationalist ambitions of Azerbaijan 's present leaders .  
It is not possible to understand this process of gradual but incessant erosion of the indigenous peoples ' original sovereignty , without considering and , indeed , highlighting the role played by juridical tools , always arm in arm with the military component of the colonial enterprise .  
Jurists ( with their conceptual elaborations ) , domestic laws ( with their imperativeness both in the metropolis and in the colonies ) , the judiciary ( subject to the rule of [ non-indigenous ] law ) , one-sided international law ( its enforcement assured by military means ) and international tribunals ( on the basis of existing international law ) were all present to validate juridically the organized plunder at the various stages of the colonial enterprise .  
These included the bringing of armed civilian groups under strict control and the prompt arrest and prosecution of those who incited or threatened to use violence , a ban on rallies by armed groups , the redeployment of Indonesian military forces , the immediate institution of a process of laying down of arms by all armed groups to be completed well in advance of the holding of the ballot and the freedom of association and expression of all political forces and tendencies .  
Plans of action have been established at country operational level , focussing on key areas requiring protection and assistance measures ; sexual exploitation and violence ; under-age military recruitment ; education ; and unaccompanied minors and adolescents ; all of which are fundamental to addressing the needs of girls more effectively .  
UNTAES was created in an environment favourable to its ultimate goal of peaceful reintegration of the formerly occupied Croatian territory : we had the agreement of the parties to the conflict ; recourse to the military option was unattractive to all interested parties ; and the political goal of peaceful reintegration was clearly set and known , as well as supported by the political will of the host Government , the international community and the skilled United Nations leadership in the field .  
This was undertaken in pursuance of resolution 51 / 39 , in which the Assembly had requested the Secretary-General to update and further develop an earlier report dated 17 October 1990 , entitled Scientific and technological developments and their impact on international security ( A / 45 / 568 ) , in order to evaluate the impact of recent scientific and technological developments , in particular those which have potential military applications .  
Following on the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa ( S / 1998 / 318 ) , the Council addressed this question last year in its resolution 1208 ( 1998 ) which , in unequivocal terms , called on all concerned to respect the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and condemned the use of such camps by combatants for the furtherance of military aims .  
Japan , from the first days of its aggression against Korea , especially during the nearly half a century-long period of its military occupation of and colonial rule over Korea from the early twentieth century , pillaged and destroyed a considerable amount of valuable cultural property , which the Korean people had handed down with utmost care generation after generation .  
Firmly announces that all foreign military recruits to be captured by the armed forces of the Islamic State of Afghanistan will be considered as criminals and would be directed to the security authorities of the State for prosecution and punishment in accordance with Afghanistan 's criminal code of 1976 , which prescribes severe punishment against those who are committing crimes against the internal and external security of the State ;  
The CN-235 and the unknown type of Turkish military aircraft violated the national airspace of the Republic of Cyprus , flying over the area of Mesaoria , before landing at the illegal airport of Tymbou in the occupied area of the Republic , from where they departed on the same day , returning to the FIR of Ankara .  
In this connection , there is an obvious need for international legal regulation of the worldwide development of civilian and military information technology , and for the formulation of a coordinated international policy on information safety that meets the needs of international security .  
This provides for the gradual phasing in of an additional 140 military observers , the establishment of a second-line medical capability with 35 medical personnel and the expansion of the Observer Mission by 59 international civilian and 21 local staff as well as for the required logistical support .  
These include : ( a ) a desire by State or non-State actors in conflict situations to disrupt humanitarian operations which they consider undermine their own political , strategic or military goals ; ( b ) a desire to remove actual or potential witnesses to human rights abuses and other violations of international law ; and ( c ) a general mistrust and suspicion of the motives and intentions of humanitarian organizations .  
Furthermore , our feelings of incredulity and indignation are accompanied by the conviction that many of the economic and social problems which overwhelm and cause distress to the majority of human beings could be alleviated in considerable measure if only a fraction of the resources devoted to military expenditures were utilized for the noble objective of the progress and well-being of the peoples of the world .  
Refrain from developing military capacity beyond their legitimate defence requirements , while at the same time reaffirming their resolve to achieve the necessary degree of security and mutual confidence with the lowest possible levels of troops and weaponry , and adhere to the Convention on Chemical Weapons . 12 .  The European Union is convinced that greater transparency in military issues will induce stability at the regional level .  
" The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the deteriorating political , military and humanitarian situation in Angola , at the suffering of the people and at the dramatic increase in the number of internally displaced persons , which has now reached well over two-million people , not including the unknown number of internally displaced persons in areas which are currently inaccessible to humanitarian agencies .  
All these initiatives have been carried out despite the climate of uncertainty prevailing throughout the country , characterized by potential and actual food shortages , a hard-to-reach population scattered throughout Katanga , and a volatile situation in Kasa hindering the effective distribution of humanitarian assistance ( scattered population , heavy military presence , etc . ) . 
In fact , evidence obtained by the military authorities of the Islamic State of Afghanistan on the command and control of military campaigns , the extensive use of heavy artillery and superior air power and the use of night vision equipment to advance in the dark clearly casts aside all doubts about the discernible direct and large-scale Pakistani involvement in Afghanistan and overt military assistance to the Taliban .  
We believe that the renewed military escalation that began at the end of last month , as is the case every summer , is sufficient proof of the repetitive pattern of chronic fighting that is prolonging the political uncertainty and deepening the misery of the Afghan people by causing many casualties among the innocent population .  
The international community and its organizations and , in particular , the Conference on Disarmament , must make genuine endeavours to agree to an international convention on the prohibition of the production and use of depleted uranium for military purposes , and the existing international conventions relating to environmental protection must be strengthened by additional measures to deter parties from failing to respect environmental laws .  
Resources should be allocated to basic priority human concerns , for example , moving away from military towards social spending and shifting the focus to better education , health services and safe water accessible to people living with poverty .  
IMF policy advice , financial and technical assistance has sought to improve the quality of public expenditure by shifting resources away from unproductive outlays , such as excessive military expenditure , to infrastructure , basic education and health care , which build physical and human capital and thus enhance broad-based growth and equity , and to target poverty alleviation programmes .  
Without obviating the need to clarify , refine , update and expand the rules of customary international and treaty law to combat mercenary activity , it should be established as a principle that , in essence , the aim of such rules is to condemn mercenary acts in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to the humanitarian standards that apply to armed conflicts and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
The Special Rapporteurs point of view has already been stated : the international community can not , without undermining the principles on which its very existence is based , allow the globalized market to function as well for the free and unrestricted sale of military assistance and active peacekeeping and peace-building operations that are the province of international organizations .  
Mr . President , even at this late stage , Pakistan is committed to pursuing contacts and consultations with all the members of the international community in order to evolve a broadly agreed approach to deal with the threats to regional and global peace and security emerging from Indias political and military ambitions as revealed in its nuclear doctrine .  
Links are being forged or strengthened with international , regional and sub-regional organizations ; academic and other institutions ; international financial institutions ; the private sector ; members of civil society ; and even military organizations and police structures .  
We are therefore grateful to the Secretary-General for his ideas expressed in the report and for his bold approach to the issues of political and military action in cases of systematic and widespread violations of international law , especially those ideas expressed in paragraph 67 of his report .  
Finally , coordination between the human rights and humanitarian components of United Nations operations , on the one hand , and political and military components , on the other , will help ensure sharing of information needed to assess the likelihood of mass exoduses and formulate and implement strategies to prevent , prepare for and respond to these emergencies in an effective and comprehensive manner .  
The military aspects provide for an immediate ceasefire , the release of hostages within three days ( although this concept is unclear , since those whom RCD regard as hostages are considered by the Kinshasa Government to be protected persons ; the word hostages is not defined in annex A ) , a joint military commission , and an international peacekeeping force administered by the United Nations . 
The Netherlands calls for a coherent and integrated approach to conflict prevention and conflict resolution in which the diplomatic , political , military , economic and humanitarian aspects , as well as development assistance , are treated as integral parts .  
It is indeed very disturbing that , not only are external forces continuing to fuel the fighting inside Afghanistan with deliveries of ammunition and other war-making materials , but an increasing number of other nationals are taking part in the actual combat , as well as the planning of military offensives .  
The Department for Disarmament Affairs has continued consultations with international and regional organizations receiving reporting on military expenditures and has received their views and comments on the recommendations contained in the previous report of the Secretary-General ( A / 53 / 218 ) deriving from the consultations held on 23 April 1998 .  
All international disputes and regional conflicts should be resolved in a fair and reasonable manner through peaceful negotiation and consultation on the basis of equality , rather than through the arbitrary use or threat of force based on the power of military superiority .  
The international community now takes military action to deal with tragedies that only a few years ago would have left us indifferent , and yet we are still influenced by military assessments , strategic interests , regional solidarity , public opinion and the magnitude of any human rights violations .  
In the opinion of Poland , costs borne by the international community in connection with the imposition of sanctions are usually significantly lower in material as well as in human dimensions than potential costs of military or peacekeeping operations that could be needed in cases when sanctions are not imposed or the sanctions regime is not fully observed .  
It also reminded States with a system of compulsory military service , where such a provision has not already been made , of its recommendation that they provide for conscientious objectors various forms of alternative service which are compatible with the reasons for conscientious objection , of non-combatant or civilian character , in the public interest and of not punitive nature .  
It was stressed that international efforts to assist refugees and seek solutions to their plight should be equitable and based on human need , regardless of the nationality , race , geographic , political or military importance of the refugee population .  
The Security Council mission stated in its report ( S / 1999 / 976 and Corr . 1 , para . 14 ) that the violence could not have occurred without the involvement of large elements of the Indonesian military and police , and concluded that the Indonesian authorities were either unwilling or unable to provide the proper environment for the peaceful implementation of the 5 May Agreement ( para . 19 ) , a state of affairs which had not been altered by the imposition of martial law .  
The tasks of the United Nations force would be to maintain a secure environment throughout the territory of East Timor , to provide direct security for United Nations personnel and property , to monitor the prompt and complete withdrawal of any remaining Indonesian military and security personnel , to take measures to disarm and demobilize armed groups and to assist humanitarian activities as appropriate , including the safe return of refugees and internally displaced persons .  
Authorizes the establishment , for an initial period of six months until 15 April 2000 , of the United Nations Office in Angola ( UNOA ) staffed with the personnel necessary to liaise with the political , military , police and other civilian authorities , with a view to exploring effective measures for restoring peace , assisting the Angolan people in the area of capacity-building , humanitarian assistance , the promotion of human rights , and coordinating other activities ;  
Authorizes the establishment , for an initial period of six months until 15 April 2000 , of the United Nations Office in Angola ( UNOA ) staffed with the personnel necessary to liaise with the political , military , police and other civilian authorities , with a view to exploring effective measures for restoring peace , assisting the Angolan people in the area of capacity-building , humanitarian assistance , the promotion of human rights , and coordinating other activities ;  
Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,  
It was therefore truly regrettable that violations of such principles continued to occur , as in the imposition of the aerial exclusion zones in northern and southern Iraq by two permanent members of the Security Council , the continuing military attacks on Iraq and the interference in its internal affairs .  
The Courts inadequate jurisdictional safeguards especially as applied to nationals of States that had not acceded to the Statute might inhibit responsible international military efforts in support of humanitarian or peacekeeping objectives .  
Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
Underscores that , as pointed out by the Commission to Follow Up the Implementation of the Peace Agreements , key reforms remain outstanding , including the fiscal , judicial , military and electoral reforms , and , therefore , stresses the critical importance of continued compliance with the peace agreements in 2000 ;  
You are , of course , aware of the economic embargo of the past nine years and of the fact that these years have been punctuated by constant military assaults , planned and carried out by the United States , targeting all aspects of life and based on the refusal of that country to allow the people of Iraq to live a life of dignity and exercise its free and independent will .  
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,  
As indicated in paragraph 2 of the report of the Secretary-General ( A / 54 / 355 ) , the package of agreements signed by the Government of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca ( URNG ) included detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues , which were consolidated into a comprehensive peace agenda .  
The proposed budget of UNMIK for the period from its inception on 10 June 1999 to 30 June 2000 provides for a total strength of 9,812 personnel , including 38 military liaison officers , 4,718 civilian police , 1,269 international staff , 3,566 local staff , 18 National Officers and 203 United Nations Volunteers , and amounts to $ 456,451,200 gross , inclusive of the commitment authority of $ 200-million already authorized by the General Assembly in its resolution 53 / 241 of 28 July 1999 .  
The tasks of the United Nations force would be to maintain a secure environment throughout the territory of East Timor , to provide direct security for United Nations personnel and property , to monitor the prompt and complete withdrawal of any remaining Indonesian military and security personnel , to take measures to disarm and demobilize armed groups and to assist humanitarian activities as appropriate , including the safe return of refugees and internally displaced persons .  
The military incursions in northern Iraq violated its sovereignty and territorial integrity and had forced a withdrawal of the central administration from those areas , turning them into a breeding ground for factional infighting and bloody conflict .  
The EU stresses its concern at the use of diamonds , gold and other resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to fund military operations in the region , and calls on all the parties to ensure that all commercial dealings of this nature are legal under the relevant domestic and international law , transparent , consistent with States ' arrangements with the international financing institutions , and benefit the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and not private individuals .  
Expressing its grave concern about the continuation of the military confrontation in Afghanistan , threatening regional peace and security and causing massive loss of life and extensive human suffering , further destruction of property , serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure , refugee flows and other forcible displacements of large numbers of people ,  
The Panel finds that expenses relating to activation of the nuclear and radiological emergency plan are , in principle , compensable as reasonable precautionary and preventative measures to protect against a potential spillover effect from Iraqs military operations against the Israeli nuclear reactor .  However , the evidence is insufficient to enable the Panel to verify the claim .  
In response to increasing reports of violence and human rights abuses attributed to Indonesian government forces since the beginning of the year , the Special Rapporteur had repeatedly sent urgent appeals to the Government urging the authorities to protect the safety and integrity of the civilian population in East Timor and to ensure that the police and military were conducting their operations in strict compliance with international human rights and humanitarian law standards . 
Condemning the grave violations of human rights in Kosovo that affected ethnic Albanians prior to the arrival of personnel of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and troops of the international security presence , the Kosovo Force , as demonstrated in the many reports of torture , indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by the Yugoslav police and military ,  
While the military authorities and police had improved their methods and capabilities for combating drug trafficking by acquiring greater logistical , financial and human resources , international cooperation still remained essential , since it enabled the States concerned to exchange reliable information and advanced technologies .  
With regard to accountability of United Nations military and civilian police observers for losses of or damage to United Nations property caused by them , the current common practice in field missions is to withhold two weeks of mission subsistence allowance entitlements prior to the departure of the military or police observers concerned , in respect of cases in which they are involved , pending the taking of a decision by the Headquarters Property Survey Board .  
Underscores the fact that , as pointed out by the Commission to Follow up the Implementation of the Peace Agreements , key reforms remain outstanding , including the fiscal , judicial , military and electoral reforms , and therefore stresses the critical importance of continued compliance with the peace agreements in 2000 ;  
Article 40 of the Military Service Act provides that any person who fails to present himself for the military service medical examination to determine his physical fitness and ascertain whether he is suffering from any contagious disease or disability that would preclude his enlistment for military service is liable to a fine ranging from 30 to 100 dinars .  
It was also printed out that compulsory military service does not consist solely in combat duties ; there are many administrative , technical and clerical posts in which military service can be performed in a manner consistent with every persons physical and mental aptitudes .  
The Permanent Mission of Kuwait also informed the Secretary-General that ( i ) n the few cases in which objection is expressed to compulsory military service , most of the persons concerned are found to be suffering from psychological and nervous disorders and such cases are exempted from military service .  
Although Mexican legislation does not recognize the right to conscientious objection , the Ministry of National Defence is empowered under the Military Service Act and Regulations to exempt those persons who do not meet the requirements for military service , including on the grounds of physical , moral or social impediments as provided in article 10 of the Act and the Regulations .  
The interviews with political , military and police authorities , public officials , accused persons , witnesses and victims of the attacks , and members of the public chosen at random in Havana , formed a body of first-hand material as a basis for as thorough and objective an investigation as possible into the subject assigned to the Special Rapporteur .  
According to the information received by the Special Rapporteur and the observations he has made during his various missions , mercenary activities continue to be carried on both through traditional means of recruitment and hiring and in new forms , including recruitment by private companies offering military security services , which take part in armed conflicts in specific countries by virtue of contracts signed with Governments .  
All training activities carried out under the OHCHR technical cooperation programme continue to include sessions on the human rights of women , with a specific focus on concerns relevant to each professional group addressed by the training - judges , police officers , members of non-governmental organizations , government officials , military , peacekeeping personnel , human rights monitors and others .  
Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
The military authorities specifically reiterated their public pledge not only to support the ongoing peace and democratic processes but also to transform the armed forces into a more professional republican army subordinate to civilian authorities following the elections .  
Georgia , as a democratic State guided by the principles of humanism and strictly adhering to its international commitments , could not deny grant of asylum to thousands of women , children and elderly people fleeing military operations , or deny medical assistance to the sick and seriously wounded . 
The excesses of the so-called military justice , a regular cause of arbitrary detention and impunity for human rights violations , as demonstrated by cases brought before the Working Group , have prompted the Group , in its recommendations in previous reports , to underline the need for an international conference to analyse the subject and seek to limit the actual powers of the military justice system ;  
Meanwhile , short - and medium-term measures include confidence-building at the regional and global levels , transparency in the field of armaments , a steady reduction of military expenditures , the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in the interim .  
We are troubled to see that in a world dominated by a single military and technological Power , we are today less safe than during the difficult years of the cold war .  
This policy has also included the organization and support of armed groups ; air and naval raids against our territory ; the hatching of over 600 plots to assassinate the leader of our revolution ; a military invasion by a mercenary army ; the most serious threat ever of a global nuclear conflict , in October 1962 ; and finally , a brutal commercial and financial blockade and a ferocious economic war against my country that have now lasted 40 years .  
Because of this situation , the world has witnessed a series of deep and rapid-moving changes that have led to the emergence of many areas of political and military conflicts with dangerous consequences reflected in the human , economic and social conditions of many regions in the world .  
As we approach the new millennium , Egypt hopes that international efforts will be directed steadfastly towards the liquidation of established military arsenals , the implementation and universality of disarmament agreements and the achievement of their ultimate goal , which is the welfare of humankind and the provision of a safer world for future generations , a world free of nuclear risks and environmental threats .  
In the context of nuclear energy development , Russia considers the reduction and disposal of nuclear armaments to be connected with the peaceful use of the tremendous scientific and technological potential that used to be the exclusive domain of military programmes .  
In Syria we look forward to a Middle East region where a just , lasting and comprehensive peace prevails , a peace based on international legality , not on expansion , occupation and the monopoly of nuclear military power , which can only lead to increased tension in the Middle East .  
Although humanitarian action takes place in contexts in which political , economic , social and military factors are inextricably connected , it is absolutely vital for humanitarian institutions to preserve the strictly non-political and impartial character of their mission .  
Here we saw the iron curtain descend on Europe , that line of separation which subsequently hung for several decades and embodied multi-faceted confrontation ideological , political , military and economic confrontation between totalitarian and democratic systems .  
The sponsors have included land as a natural resource in this operative paragraph because the Special Committee has been informed of a desire by petitioners from one particular Territory that all unused and excess land not required for military purposes be returned to the original landowners .  
The Second Protocol goes further to develop the Conventions protective powers with regard to military involvement and the need to strengthen the system of protection for those categories of cultural property deemed of vital importance to mankind or whose exceptional cultural and historical value is recognized by national legislation .  
There is no doubt that this report assumes special importance at a time when we are experiencing an increasing need to deepen and enhance cooperation between the two organizations in development , social , economic , military , political , diplomatic and other fields , all of which aim at serving the common interests of the African continent in general , and at upgrading the structure and institutional capacities of the OAU , in particular . 
With a unified currency , with unified political , economic and foreign policies , with defined borders and now with the planned military deterrence force of its own , it is obvious that a regional seat is a logical necessity and consequence .  
While most concepts on transparency in military matters have been developed and implemented in a regional context , progress on the global level has been modest , and much remains to be done by the international community .  
In Europe the only military bloc left over from the cold war , under its new strategic concept , bypassed the United Nations Security Council and bombed , with the worlds most powerful and sophisticated military machinery , a weak sovereign State , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , turning the Balkan region , which has experienced so much misery in this century , into a testing ground for its new strategy .  
The Working Group was concerned at the continuing abusive treatment of women , including custodial deaths , torture , rape , abduction , disappearances , arbitrary arrests , forced abortions and sterilizations , harassment and arson by security forces , including military and police forces , or by other governmental authorities , particularly where separatist movements were reported .  
The enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights is hindered by the absence of the rule of law , the existence in Nigeria of military governments , the suspension of the Constitution in favour of rule by military decree and the concomitant resort to intimidation , and the negative effects of widespread corruption on the functioning of governmental institutions .  
Globalization had taken real power from States and vested it in an apparatus governing the world ' s political , financial , economic and military systems , consisting principally of the Group of Seven , IMF , the World Bank , WTO ( and , by extension , the major transnational corporations ) , the Security Council and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .  
Recalling its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
It is no secret that the Government of the United Kingdom joined the United States administration in carrying out its threats to use force , heedless of the Security Council , the United Nations and world public opinion , in its comprehensive military attack on Iraq from 16 to 20 December 1998 , which destroyed a large number of Iraqi civilian installations and led to the death and injury of a large number of Iraqi people .  
The general trend , noticeable to varying degrees in the provinces visited , was the gradual dismantling of the larger camps for the displaced and regrouped and the creation of smaller , decentralized sites , located near military outposts and inhabited by people from the neighbouring hills .  
Once again he drew the attention of the Burundi authorities to the urgent need to ensure the observance of international standards of humanitarian law and human rights , which prohibited indiscriminate attacks against the civilian population and civilian targets during military operations .  
At the initiative of Burkina Faso , joint military exercises , entitled Kompienga Unity 98 , for the purpose of training personnel for peacekeeping operations was held from 16 to 21 April 1998 ; the armed forces of Benin , Burkina Faso , Cte dIvoire , Ghana , the Niger , Nigeria , Togo and Chad had taken part in the exercises , in which a great deal of attention had been given to humanitarian issues .  
Peacekeeping operations had originally been intended as a means of controlling dangerous regional conflicts and had involved such tasks as monitoring ceasefires , separating hostile parties and maintaining buffer zones , whereas today the proliferation of conflicts stemming from various factors had resulted in more complex missions , involving political , military and humanitarian activities simultaneously . 
While it acknowledged the independence of the mandates of individual organizations , the Republic of Belarus , on the basis of Article 53 of the Charter of the United Nations , considered inadmissible any unilateral enforcement action carried out by regional arrangements , especially in the military sphere , without the relevant authorization of , or circumventing , the Security Council .  
While obviously limited in payload mass , volume and power , but with very real and attractive advantages in terms of cost and response time , microsatellites complemented traditional large satellites by providing an alternative gap-filler for affordable quick-response or exploratory missions with both civil and military objectives .  
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,  
Since the beginning of 1998 , the Serbian military and police forces had launched a military attack against the Albanian population which had left thousands of innocent victims , including pregnant women , children and elderly people.They had deliberately shelled Albanian villages , destroying one third of the houses and forcing more than 300 , 000 people to flee , and had brought about a catastrophic humanitarian situation , with people living in the open without shelter , food or medical assistance .  
Realizing that education was a necessary condition for the protection of human rights , it had introduced universal primary education and had embarked , in cooperation with regional organizations and the United Nations , on a national human rights education programme for all population groups and particularly officials in the judiciary or the executive , legislative and military branches . 
Hiring private companies providing security and military assistance and advice is no substitute for maintaining a collective regional security system and genuinely professional national armed forces and security forces loyal to the democratic legal order.It is a false solution . 
Without obviating the need to clarify , refine , update and expand the rules of customary international and treaty law to combat mercenary activity , it should be established as a principle that , in essence , the aim of such rules is to condemn a mercenary act in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to the humanitarian standards that apply to armed conflicts and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
In the previous report he submitted to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ fourth session ( E CN . 4-1998-31 ) , the Special Rapporteur dealt fully with private companies operating in the international market offering security services and military assistance and advice , normally matters reserved for the State and for which the State must assume responsibility .  
These companies are developing their offers more and more aggressively , putting forward arguments for legitimacy based on military efficiency , cheaper operations , their personnel ' s proven experience and an alleged comparative advantage that would make it feasible or desirable to hire them for peace _ building or peacekeeping operations such as those conducted by the United Nations or ECOWAS .  
The Political Constitution of the Republic of Costa Rica of 1949 , which is still in force , stipulates in its article 12 that the army as a permanent institution is proscribed , that military forces may be organized only through continental agreement or for the national defence and that they shall always be subordinate to the civil power .  
The projection provides for the retention in MINURCA of 1 , 350 military personnel , inclusive of the 35 additional military personnel referred to in paragraph 44 of my main report , and 25 civilian police advisers , supported by 179 international and local staff .  
On 6 January 1993 , the United States , the United Kingdom and France each handed our Permanent Representative in New York a written position in which , after making reference to the imposition of a no-fly zone south of parallel 32 , they stated that Iraqi military aircraft had been recurrently observed in the said zone in violation of the no-fly zone and that Iraq had moved SAM missile batteries to new sites south of parallel 32 , thus posing a threat to the aircraft of those States .  
They demanded that the missile batteries be withdrawn and returned to their original sites within 48 hours of the date of the above position ; that there should be no flights of any civilian or military fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters south of the 32 nd parallel ; and that Iraq should undertake no illumination or tracing by radar of any aircraft and should flash no signals indicating a hostile intention .  
While military observers and most of the international civilian staff left the mission area by 30 September 1997 as scheduled , owing to the unforeseen scope and complexity of residual administrative tasks involving , inter alia , the re-creation of the Missions financial records lost during hostilities in April 1996 , the Missions in situ liquidation was extended until 28 February 1998 , with a small liquidation team continuing work at United Nations Headquarters until 30 June 1998 .  
The basic premise is to encourage bilateral and multilateral dialogue so as to promote international understanding and cooperation on the basis of the concepts identified in the preambular paragraphs of this draft : that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress and science and technology for civilian applications need to be maintained and encouraged.There are two operational components to this draft resolution . 
This is why we will not support proposals that are designed to subordinate respect for human rights in the context of armed conflict , in accordance with international humanitarian law , to questionable military requirements .  
The circulation of press organs is not authorized , permission is not given for the functioning of new non _ governmental human rights organizations , which have been waiting for years to be recognized , the movements of the population within the country are controlled by military checkpoints , there is oppressive supervision of all private activity and in practice political dissent is viewed almost as a crime , particularly by the peripheral authorities of the mainland region .  
A further review during the past six months has focused on bringing UNFICYP into line with the approaches in more recently established peacekeeping missions , while achieving additional efficiencies by integrating civilian and military personnel in terms of sharing responsibilities and decision-making , establishing more transparency and better financial control .  
The scope of such an international document should therefore cover all fissile material potentially usable in the manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices throughout the world , including the military stocks of these materials possessed by all States , on an equal footing .  
Egypt regrets that all the efforts made to expand the scope of the United Nations Register have not yet yielded the required results since the Register remains limited to the annual notification of transfers of seven categories of conventional arms and continues to disregard other sophisticated and lethal types of conventional arms as well as weapons of mass destruction and advanced technologies with military applications .  
A civic training programme , centred mainly on essential aspects of democracy , the South African Constitution , the Human Rights Charter , international humanitarian law , cultural diversity and military ethics , has been published in a manual entitled South African National Defense Force Civic Education Guidelines and is being implemented .  
The Government of the Republic of Zambia wishes to confirm that on 14 January 1999 , it received a letter from the Government of Angola in which the latter alleged that it has in its possession " credible information " confirming substantial involvement of the Zambian authorities in the logistic and military support sent to Dr . Savimbi inside Angola to perpetuate the war and the suffering of the Angolan people .  
In the statement it issued on the occasion of General Ivachov ' s visit , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Azerbaijani Republic indicated that the frank and unambiguous statements by the above-mentioned military official of the Russian Federation strengthened Azerbaijan ' s apprehension regarding the purpose of this new phase of political and military cooperation between Russia and Armenia , which had thus been lifted to a qualitatively different strategic level .  
The visit was an occasion for examining specific technical questions raised by the considerable strengthening of the 102 nd military base established in Armenia , the new aircraft unit to be supplied to that base , the improvement of the operation of the unified air defence system which was to be equipped with modern armaments , including S-300 surface-to-air missile batteries , and questions concerning of the permanent deployment in the territory of Armenia of Russian Mig-29 aircraft .  
I should therefore like to assure you once again that I am determined to proceed with the effective implementation of a whole range of political , structural , economic and military reforms that are required in order to consolidate peace and promote sustainable development .  
This criminal military attack on peaceful regions , which follows constant military attacks by the United States and the United Kingdom on long-suffering Iraq , is indicative of an established policy of those two States designed to achieve their political objectives , their goal being to violate the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of Iraq .  
With the uncertainties associated with the transitional nature of the global order , a tremendous obsession is evident to preserve military supremacy or assume a more prominent global role in the future order through acquisition of more advanced weapons of greater range , accuracy and lethality , something that might quite unravel the progress towards disarmament achieved earlier in this decade .  
In order to achieve the objectives described therein , the plan of operations for the Observer Mission headed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General , calls for the phased deployment , as security conditions permit , of the authorized strength of 70 military observers , a 15 - person medical unit and 5 civilian police advisers supported by 50 international civilian and 48 local staff .  
During the budget period , owing to the poor road infrastructure and prevailing security situation , the MI-8 helicopter would be utilized for the transportation of UNOMSIL military and civilian personnel , logistical support and supply resupply tasking , as well as for casualty and medical evacuation , if required .  
It was therefore imperative that the international community should pursue ways and means of enhancing the safety of all United Nations personnel both military and civilian in order to maintain the effective functioning and timely deployment of peacekeeping operations .  
Our approach is guided by a set of basic principles : the preservation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo ; the belief that there can be no military solution to the underlying problems of the region ; and the belief that the human and humanitarian rights of all peoples in the conflict must be respected .  
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,  
Condemning the grave violations of human rights in Kosovo , affecting ethnic Albanians prior to the arrival of United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo personnel and troops of the international security presence , the Kosovo Force , as demonstrated in the many reports of torture , indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by the Yugoslav police and military ,  
By resolution 1132 ( 1997 ) , adopted on 8 October 1997 , the Security Council , gravely concerned at the continued violence following the military coup of 25 May 1997 and determining that the situation in Sierra Leone constituted a threat to international peace and security in the region , imposed a regime of mandatory sanctions , under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations , against Sierra Leone .  
The upward trend in military expenditures and their impact on national and international development strategies must be reversed , so that States can transfer resources now driving the arms race spiral into socioeconomic development .  
In this era , when there are no natural enemies , and thus no natural allies , some seek to advance their political and military ambitions by playing on racial and religious fears to give life to the dangerous doctrine of an impending clash of civilizations .  
They build on the fundamental norm of the law of armed conflict that military necessity in armed conflict has to be constantly set against the humanitarian objective of preventing unnecessary suffering .  
We understand that it demands coordinated and concerted efforts on the multilateral level and requires a thorough study of the political , military and economic aspects , in particular States legitimate defence and security needs .  
Intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to religion , education , art , science or charitable purposes , historic monuments , hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected , provided they are not military objectives ;  
There remained a huge disparity between military expenditure at the national level and the resources set aside at the international level for preventative diplomacy , peacemaking and peacekeeping .  
Determining actual and reasonable costs is often difficult for troop contributors to do , especially when they move matriel and personnel by military means and can not therefore easily provide documentary evidence of an acceptable national commercial rate .  
Some also expressed concern that not requiring that military firearms be marked and recorded would make them untraceable if they later fell into nonmilitary possession as a result of loss in armed conflicts , theft or other diversions .  
Thus this single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum has been incapable of continuing negotiations on halting the production of fissile material for military purposes , known as cutoff , negotiations which were started in 1998 .  
As the Panel 's report makes clear in paragraph 2 , the underlying objective of the sanctions is to foster a durable political settlement to the civil war in Angola by limiting UNITA 's ability to pursue its objectives by military means .  
The Special Committee stresses the importance of having senior military commanders , police commissioners and key staff personnel selected , prepared and trained prior to their deployment to a peacekeeping operation .  
First , peacekeeping operations must be endowed with a clear , realistic mandate commensurate with the established goals and backed by the necessary political , military and moral decisions .  
The ability of the Tribunal to recruit additional translators is limited by the scarcity of professional translators who are not only versed in legal vocabulary , but also familiar with the terminology of , inter alia , ballistic , forensic and military reports .  
These options could further include voluntary measures regarding weaponsusable fissile material related to military inventories with a view to achieving increased transparency , which could prepare the ground for ultimately agreed irreversible net reductions .  
Some also expressed concern that not requiring that military firearms be marked and recorded would make them untraceable if they later fell into nonmilitary possession as a result of loss in armed conflicts , theft or other diversions .  
Although the full resource requirements of MONUC were yet to be determined and its full deployment was subject to political , military and logistical constraints , the enormous task of the United Nations in the Congo required adequate financial support .  
Decides also that the measures imposed by paragraph 6 above shall not apply to supplies of nonlethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian use , as approved in advance by the Committee established by paragraph 8 below ;  
Decides also that the measures imposed by paragraph 6 above shall not apply to supplies of nonlethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian use , as approved in advance by the Committee established by paragraph 8 below ;  
Preparing comprehensive military operational plans for new peacekeeping operations , participating in fact finding missions to current and potential mission areas and , as required , revising and modifying plans for current operations ;  
Although confidencebuilding measures whether they be military , political , economic , commercial , cultural or humanitarian are no substitute for concrete disarmament measures , they can play an important role in progress towards disarmament .  
The international community should make any assistance political , diplomatic , financial , material or military to parties to armed conflict contingent on their observing standards for the protection of children .  
The preferred collective approach , therefore , should be to concentrate efforts for a political solution based on a robust and credible international military presence .  
The concept of security and stability in the Mediterranean region is not based solely on the military dimension but is a comprehensive concept based on the political , economic , social , cultural and human dimensions .  
The prohibition on attacks against civilians is based on the most fundamental distinction drawn in international humanitarian law between the civilian and the military and the absolute prohibition on directing attacks against the former .  
The proliferation of nuclear weapons and the growing emphasis on military doctrines , missile proliferation and the potential deployment of national missile defence are additional factors that pose alarming dangers to international security .  
At the time of the initial sighting , the location of the submarine was verified by a fishermans global positioning system , and its position inside Republic of Korea territorial waters was later confirmed by military positionlocating equipment .  
Once again , we have witnessed with dreary familiarity a major military offensive late this past summer , with all the consequent displacement and suffering of the civilian population .  
It requires comprehensive strategies involving all relevant actors and embracing multiple sectors of activity , including political , military , diplomatic , development , human rights , humanitarian and many others .  
It can not be separated from the political , military , economic and social situations prevailing in other West African countries , and particularly from the growing instability on the common border between Sierra Leone , Guinea and Liberia .  
With regard to Guinea-Bissau , which is geographically outside the Mano River Union , the prevailing precarious and unstable situation in the country resulted from a lengthy crisis that occurred in three stages the overthrow of the legal Government of President Nino , the establishment of a long period of transition dominated by the military and , finally , the organization of presidential and legislative elections to install a new regime and has left its mark on the economic and social structure of the country . 
First , the peace process in the Congo has lately witnessed a number of consecutive steps that have served to maintain the current momentum aimed at implementing the Lusaka Agreement in both its military and political components and at reaching a final and comprehensive settlement of the conflict , which has been tearing the Congo apart and draining the energies of its neighbours for almost three years . 
Societies in which citizens can openly air their grievances ; choose their governments in free , open elections ; have a say , through elected local bodies , in aspects of governance that touch their daily lives the most ; and get redress when they need it from an independent judiciary that upholds the rule of law , are far less likely to erupt into domestic conflict than those under totalitarian or military rule .  
Sanctions should be restricted to the acquisition of arms , military equipment and dual-use materials as stipulated in relevant Security Council resolutions , especially the resolutions relating to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , be they nuclear , chemical or biological , and of any other military potential that might endanger the sovereignty , safety , security and stability of neighbouring countries .  
In his speech at the beginning of this month at the annual conference of his party , Mr . Tony Blair , Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , referring to a moral duty to provide international military and humanitarian assistance to any country in need , stressed that if the world continued to ignore the suffering of the African nations , like the Democratic Republic of the Congo , ravaged by war , that would incite anger and frustration that could threaten global stability . 
Reinforcement and strengthening of the GCC process in terms of enhanced coordination , cooperation , interlinkage and integration , by adopting a unified strategy in the political , economic , security , military , social , information , cultural and scientific fields based on unity of purpose and a common destiny .  
The Special Rapporteur then examines the differences between traditional and new forms of mercenary activities , the relationship between terrorism and mercenary activities , the problems raised in connection with respect for human rights and international humanitarian law by private security and military assistance companies operating internationally and the limits and shortcomings of the legal definition of mercenary activities .  
The aim of the rules of customary international and treaty law is , in essence , to combat mercenary acts in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to prevailing standards of international humanitarian law applying to armed conflicts and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
These meetings must in particular consider the concepts of operation , which may bear the stamp of concepts developed by military alliances proposing deployments and tasks that can be carried out by relatively small numbers of troops only if , as their national or alliance strategic doctrines also require , they have limitless mobility , seamless cooperation between units , interoperability of the most modern equipment and a range of force multipliers in close support .  
The Missions administrative and technical personnel , military security detachment and logistical support services were required to support the liquidation of MONUA , in particular , in connection with the protracted negotiations with the Government of Angola regarding the disposition of the substantial amount of surplus assets not required by other peacekeeping operations and subsequently handed over to the Government in April 2000 in accordance with the contract of sale concluded in March 2000 .  
Moreover , pending the conclusion of consultations with the Government of Angola and until the establishment by the Security Council in its resolution 1268 ( 1999 ) of 15 October 1999 of the United Nations Office in Angola , the substantive MONUA personnel required to maintain liaison with the political , military , police and other civilian authorities of Angola , as well as its human rights component , were also retained in the country as part of the Observer Missions staffing establishment .  
This inadmissible claim highly simplifies a complex historical and social matter ; it ignores the military and financial autonomy of the paramilitaries and the extremely clear and increasing instances of lethal acts of aggression against public servants .  
The measures provided for under subparagraphs ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) of the present decree do not apply to supplies of non-lethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian or protective purposes , related technical assistance or training approved in advance by the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267 ( 1999 ) or to protective clothing , including flak jackets and military helmets imported into Afghanistan by United Nations personnel , representatives of the media and the staff of humanitarian organizations for their personal use only .  
The provisional expansion of UNOMSIL was supported by additional resources utilized for the deployment of military observers and additional international civilian staff in the fields of political and civil affairs and human rights , as well as for the necessary administrative , technical and logistical support services .  
While UNAMSIL took over the substantive civilian and military components of UNOMSIL , as well as its assets , the significant expansion of the Mission necessitated commensurate strengthening of its civilian staffing establishment , logistical and technical support structures , the provision of additional communications , electronic data-processing and other equipment , acquisition of vehicles and contracting additional air assets .  
In view of the unstable security situation in the country and in order to avoid potential security gaps related to the continuing repatriation of ECOMOG troops , significant resources were utilized for the transportation by air of contingent-owned equipment , stores and supplies , as well as for the strengthening of UNAMSIL air operations capability by enhancing its helicopter fleet with armed military helicopters and commercial heavy-lift rotary aircraft .  
Owing to the development on the ground during the reporting period , additional resources were utilized under the other official travel budget line item to support intensive political negotiations and consultations , especially in the aftermath of the breakout of hostilities in May 2000 , as well as for the travel to the mission area of the United Nations assessment team , military planning , political , public information , administrative , technical and logistical personnel and stress counsellors to provide counselling to the United Nations military personnel released from detention .  
In the light of the developing situation on the ground and particularly the resumption of hostilities in May 2000 , which necessitated the rapid reinforcement of the military component of the Mission and consequently the rapid transportation of contingent-owned equipment to the mission area , 10,635 and 2,057 metric tons of contingent-owned equipment were transported by air and surface , respectively , resulting in the unforeseen additional requirements totalling $ 22,023,000 .  
A provision of $ 337,500 was made to cover the cost of peacekeeping assistance team seminars in South America , training courses for military and civilian police and national trainers on peacekeeping , human rights and humanitarian assistance at the International Training Centre of the International Labour Organization at Turin , Italy , as well as for assistance to national and regional training and to multilateral and multidimensional exercises .  
Those realities were nothing more than the consequences of illegal acts which had gone unpunished and of the unacceptable partition imposed through the use of force and sustained by military strength in violation of every norm of international law ; they presupposed the constant denial of the individual and collective rights of 200,000 refugees ( more than a third of the Greek Cypriot population of Cyprus ) , who had been forcibly expelled from their homes since the Turkish invasion .  
Strongly condemns the continued use of disproportionate and indiscriminate force by Russian military forces , federal servicemen and State agents , including attacks against civilians and other breaches of international law as well as serious violations of human rights , such as forced disappearances , extrajudicial , summary and arbitrary executions , torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment , and calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation to comply with its international human rights and humanitarian law obligations in its operations against Chechen fighters and to take all measures to protect the civilian population ;  
Calls upon the Russian Federation to ensure that both civilian and military prosecutors offices undertake systematic , credible and exhaustive criminal investigations and prosecutions of all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights , in particular of those members of federal forces , federal servicemen and the personnel of law enforcement agencies against civilians allegedly implicated in war crimes and human rights violations and to pursue with rigour the cases which have been referred to them ;  
Encourages Governments , United Nations bodies and organs , the specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as appropriate , to initiate , coordinate or support programmes designed to train and educate military forces , law enforcement officers and government officials , as well as members of United Nations peacekeeping or observer missions , on human rights and humanitarian law issues connected with their work , and appeals to the international community to support endeavours to that end ;  
Proclaiming its agreement to the talks , the Islamic State of Afghanistan , however , in the light of the opening paragraphs of the document , is surprised by the notion expressed in the unnumbered third paragraph , namely that the lack of positive results in bringing about an Afghan settlement is linked to the determination of the warring Afghan sides to settle the conflict solely by military means .  
The committee meets with the Council when any change in the mandate is contemplated , in particular , the broadening or narrowing of scope of the mission , the introduction of new or additional functions or components , or a change in the authorization to use force ; the renewal of a mandate ; significant or serious political , military or humanitarian developments ; a rapid deterioration of the security situation on the ground ; the termination , withdrawal or scaling down in size of the operation , including the transition from peacekeeping to post-conflict peace-building .  
The recent surge in these activities by Pakistan , however , is a mere supplement to its widespread presence in Afghanistan , as Pakistan maintains thousands of military personnel , non-commissioned officers , armed nationals belonging to numerous Pakistan-based extremist organizations and volunteers from religious schools called the Madrassa , fighting alongside the Taliban mercenaries .  
The international community , during the course of last year and still in the year 2001 , witnessed how the Pakistan military junta played host to public mass gatherings of terrorist networks of the region and the extremist religious groups of Pakistan on its soil , who clearly and explicitly proclaimed their agenda and expressed intentions for expanding their realm of influence in the region through setting up extremist and radical regimes in countries of the region .  
The United States of America and the United Kingdom are committing acts of aggression and violating Iraqs airspace and territory on a daily basis on the pretext of allegedly enforcing the illegal and unlawful no-flight zones that were imposed by these two countries in a pathological display of military power that poses a threat to the security and safety of innocent civilian citizens and represents an assault on the sovereignty of an independent Member State of the United Nations .  
It would be quite a different matter , however , if the real intentions regarding outer space were to flout the obligations of international legal instruments and to seek unilateral and absolute military and strategic superiority based on political , economic and military strength .  
It also agreed to the importance of peace-building as a broad-based approach to conflict prevention , and stressed the need to address the political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic root causes of conflicts .  
The occupying power may , then , invoke its long occupancy as proof that its occupation is legitimate and characterize any and all use of force against it as terrorism . [ 115 ] ( b ) There is a situation of nascent civil war - i.e . , a situation where there are armed groups who either do not control sufficient territory , or who engage in military activities that are more than sporadic but less than sustained , or whose actions do not qualify as military actions under the laws and customs of war . 
In view of declining levels of official development assistance , he observed that developing countries would have to depend more on mobilizing their own resources for development and , to that end , they must examine the percentages of their gross national product and central government budgets that are devoted to military expenditures .  
It can not but be recognized that small arms are , paradoxically , those that claim the most victims , both civilian and military , given the nature of the current conflicts afflicting many countries , small arms and light weapons , apart from their undeniable advantage in terms of cost , proving to be the most adapted to the terrain and to the actions engaged in : easily transportable , they can be rapidly distributed and concealed . 
By way of the no-flight zones in northern and southern Iraq , they have been continuing their military aggression against our people on a daily basis since 1991 by virtue of a unilateral and illegal decision taken by their governments in flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
The heightened attention of the Council to the situation in Burundi was dictated by the rapidly deteriorating military situation in the country at the end of February and the beginning of March and the increased violence , including the attacks by Burundian armed groups on the capital .  On 2 March , the Council members , during consultations of the whole , heard a briefing by the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Kieran Prendergast , on the current political , military , humanitarian and socio-economic situation in Burundi and developments in the Arusha peace process in the past months .  
The currently accepted meaning or use of the term mercenary is primarily focused on including in this rubric the hiring of the professional services of persons with a military background who are paid to intervene in an armed conflict in a country other than their own .  
The aim of the rules of customary international and treaty law is , in essence , to combat mercenary acts in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to the prevailing rules of international humanitarian law and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
In addition to continuing with efforts to improve the well-being of the poor , IMF contributes to the monitoring of progress towards international development goals in three ways : disseminating information of growth rates in countries ; reporting the composition of government expenditures with a view to encouraging countries to reduce unproductive expenditures , such as excessive military expenditures ; and tracking trends in social expenditures and social indicators in low-income countries and transition economies .  
Similar provisions protecting religious freedom and prohibiting any discrimination against citizens whether or not they are believers are contained in criminal law , civil law , legislation governing regional autonomy for national minorities and military service , compulsory education legislation , the electoral law relating to the Peoples Congress and the law establishing village committees .  
The Ivorian patriots were just savouring that victory , so dearly yet so proudly won over the military regime , whose rule had been marked by numerous barbaric acts committed against civilian populations , when , to their great surprise , there rang out over foreign radio stations appeals by the Rassemblement des Rpublicains ( RDR ) , calling upon its militants to oppose the victory of candidate Laurent Gbagbo and thereby calling into question the presidential election of 22 October 2000 .  
Finally , blurred lines between the civilian and military character of camps expose civilians inside to the risk of attack by opposing forces , where camps are perceived to serve as launching pads for renewed fighting .  
Member States are nevertheless still reluctant to support the work of humanitarian agencies in these circumstances , because of the perceived security risk to their military personnel and the risk of further exacerbating the conflict by direct confrontations with armed elements .  Ensuring security in camps requires the involvement of police and military forces , not least in disarming and demobilizing militias and transferring them to different sites .  
The Permanent Mission of the Republic of San Marino to the United Nations would like to point out the fact that , given the characteristics of the San Marino armed forces , the Government of the Republic of San Marino deemed it inconvenient to fill out the questionnaire [ entitled Instrument for standardized international reporting of military expenditures ] and preferred to send the attached sheet of information .  
Synergy and complementarity of the action taken by the various agencies will be decisive in mobilizing sufficient funds both to meet the challenges represented by the problems of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to seize the opportunities offered by the new political , economic and military situation .  The strategy for ending the crisis itself must combine humanitarian action and intervention for the purpose of rehabilitation and development .  
In addition to its traditional responsibility for identifying requirements , establishing aircraft technical specifications , evaluating technical compliance , administering air charters , and managing expenditures , its responsibilities now include the development and promulgation of institutional standards and operating guidelines for all types of aeronautical activities , such as the operation of aerodromes , and the integrated employment of civil and military aircraft from diverse regulatory regimes , to ensure that peacekeeping air operations always comply with international standards regardless of the condition of the aeronautical infrastructure within the mission areas .  
Further phases are planned and the eventual decision support system will contain all tactical information required to support the planning assumptions for rapid mission deployment , mission liquidation and redeployment of assets , build-up and deployment of surplus assets , personnel and contingent placements and mobilization , military and civilian mobilization , and financial and administrative information to support budget planning and financial analyses ( $ 150,000 ) . 
To standardize police training and adapt it to the Sierra Leone environment , the Section has finalized arrangements with the UNAMSIL Civilian Police to produce a training manual for the police , internal human rights awareness training for incoming UNAMSIL peacekeepers and military observers occurs on a regular basis and the Section provided training on human rights and humanitarian law for the Pakistani Brigade in Pakistan prior to its deployment to UNAMSIL .  
During the summit , there was a general consensus of the urgent need for the implementation of an immediate ceasefire in the areas of military operation in southern Sudan in order to accelerate the flow of humanitarian assistance to the needy civilian population in those areas , and to facilitate for constructive negotiations between the Government and the rebel movement ( SPLM / A ) , with the ultimate aim of reaching a peaceful resolution of the conflict in the south . 
However , it is now well known that SPLM / A , continuing its intransigent stance , not only vehemently opposed the proposed immediate ceasefire , but also provoked the situation by launching intensive military operations in western Bahr-El-Ghazal state , causing the loss of the lives of a considerable number of innocent civilians and the displacement of thousands of others , thus creating , once again , a humanitarian crisis in the state and its immediate environs , as it did in early 1998 .  
These responsibilities encompass the identification of requirements , the establishment of aircraft technical specifications , the evaluation of contractors technical compliance , the administration of air charters , the management of expenditures , the development and promulgation of institutional standards and operating guidelines for all types of aeronautical activities , and the integrated use of civil and military aircraft from diverse regulatory regimes ;  
It is easy to see that we are dealing with an act devoid of any military objective whose sole aim was simply to spread death , suffering and destruction of our people in the most atrocious way .  
Deeply concerned that systematic rape , sexual slavery and slavery-like practices are still being used to humiliate civilians and military personnel , to destroy society and diminish prospects for a peaceful resolution of conflicts and that the resulting severe physical and psychological trauma endanger not only personal recovery but post-conflict reconstruction of the whole society , as pointed out in the above-mentioned report ;  
After so many years of fruitless endeavours , the intergovernmental organs of the United Nations , in particular the Security Council , might wish to consider adopting a comprehensive approach to the settlement of Afghanistan , in its political , military , humanitarian and human rights dimensions , setting forth the basic requirements for a settlement of the conflict and the principles on which it should be based , together with a coherent strategy to resolve the conflict .  
Calls also for arrangements by all nuclear-weapon States to place , as soon as practicable , the fissile material designated by each of them as no longer required for military purposes under International Atomic Energy Agency or other relevant international verification and arrangements for the disposition of such material for peaceful purposes in order to ensure that such material remains permanently outside military programmes ;  
This resolution , however , representing as it does a dangerous precedent in which the Security Council gives unlimited authorization to States cooperating with the Government of Kuwait to interfere with civilian trade , is not based on Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations and does not therefore make it permissible to use coercive military measures for its enforcement .  
The United Nations must play a crucial role in combating international terrorism by adopting a global strategy that should include clear political , military , diplomatic , economic and legal measures in order to eliminate it . 
The Secretary-General has also recommended the Member States ensure that their military , civilian and police personnel involved in United Nations peacekeeping operations be trained with regard to international human rights , humanitarian law and refugee law , especially as concerns the rights and protection of children and women , in advance of troop deployment to United Nations operations .  
Following these positive changes of the last few years that have strengthened the need for a renewed strategic vision of peace and stability throughout the world , it is necessary that international security be separated from military factors and go beyond security concepts based on nuclear weapons .  
Iraq rejects all the flimsy excuses and pretexts stemming from this illegal decision that are used by these States in engaging in this hostile terrorist action in an attempt on their part to justify their military aggression against our country .  The logistic support made available by the governments of Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and Turkey to the United States and the United Kingdom , which includes the provision of air bases , has made them key partners in the terrorist aggression against Iraq , so that they bear international responsibility under international law .  
Beyond complying with the Tribunal , the Framework Agreement places responsibility on the domestic authorities to undertake crucial measures , including the prosecution , dismissal or transfer , as appropriate , of persons in military , paramilitary and police forces and other public servants , responsible for serious violations of the basic rights of persons belonging to ethnic or minority groups . 2 It is essential to the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina that an adequate legal framework to effect such duties be established . 
The situation of military detentions by KFOR is based on rather more obscure legal grounds . 9 The Special Representative is informed that KFOR routinely arrests and detains individuals on an extrajudicial basis , mostly ethnic Albanians suspected of fighting in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and southern Serbia , citing resolution 1244 ( 1999 ) , the Kumanovo Military Technical Agreement with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and customary international law as the legal sources of KFOR authority for detentions . 
The expected American military action on Afghanistan , backed by the support of the allied States , was launched on the seventh of this month as a response to the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington last month , which shook the whole world with the heavy losses of the lives of innocent people , and the extensive destruction of a number of public and private properties it caused in the United States of America . 
MONUC is also in the process of establishing four coordination centres , which will provide command and control for the military observers in areas distant from the sector headquarters and will improve the logistical support in the interior of the country , in addition to providing an enhanced medical evacuation capacity and increased forward mobility .  
The Missions initial objective in phase III would be to establish a mixed civilian and military presence , as well as a forward support base , in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
The proposed operational and logistics base would be established at Kindu , which is located at the western fringe of an area characterized by many of the military , security , political and humanitarian and human rights problems that MONUC is likely to be confronted with in phase III .  
The radio will provide accurate , credible and impartial information about all aspects of the peace process , including military and political developments , the inter-Congolese dialogue and the many humanitarian assistance programmes operating in the country .  
Preparations are under way for recruitment and deployment of adequate numbers of United Nations civilian personnel to accompany the military deployment , including political , human rights , humanitarian , child protection , public information , disarmament , demobilization and reintegration and logistical personnel .  
Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
The international community continues to witness an accelerated race to develop strategic nuclear reactors for military purposes and increase the range and power of ballistic missiles and rockets with nuclear , chemical and biological warheads despite the pledges of the heads of State and Government at the Millennium Summit last year for , among other things , the gradual multilateral reduction of arsenals of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction .  
In this context , and given the decline in official development assistance , the former Secretary-General of the United Nations , Mr . Javier Prez de Cullar , speaking on the subject of the link between disarmament and development on 11 June at the opening of a workshop in Lima , noted that developing countries needed to rely more on their own resources and , to that end , to re-examine the percentage of their gross domestic product and national budgets used for military spending .  
The plan provides for an integrated peacekeeping mission headed by a Special Representative of the Secretary-General , which would be composed of a military component , a civilian police component , and a small civilian component , including experts who would provide crucial assistance to the emergent East Timorese administration .  The latter component will be essential to the functioning of the government in the immediate post-independence period .  
The widening gap in technological capabilities encompassed by the so-called revolution in military affairs and in the disparity of size of military budgets between the rich and the poor , the big and the smaller nations is increasing the imbalance in conventional force capabilities at the international and regional levels .  
But we are prepared for cooperation as sovereign equals , in accordance with the new realities of a world where the principal national objectives of States can be achieved through economic and political cooperation , rather than military conquest or regional or global domination .  
These are of fundamental importance in assuring that the customary rules of international humanitarian law governing the choice of weapons are faithfully applied to specific weapons likely to have indiscriminate effects and cause suffering beyond military necessity or which simply are abhorrent .  
The revised concept of operation of UNAMSIL is based on the forward deployment , in successive phases and in an integrated fashion , of the Missions military force of 17,500 personnel as well as United Nations civil affairs , civilian police and human rights personnel , representatives of humanitarian agencies and government personnel and assets to establish and consolidate State authority and basic services in areas controlled by RUF , including diamond producing regions , and in some border areas .  
In addition , pursuant to Security Council resolution 1308 ( 2000 ) of 17 July 2000 , and in the light of the potential spread of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection among the population of Sierra Leone as well as among the Missions military and civilian personnel , it is proposed that a post for an HIV / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) policy officer be established at the P-4 level .  
The primary strategic objective of the Missions public information programme is to project , country-wide , the efforts of the military and civilian components of UNAMSIL in facilitating the peace process in Sierra Leone and the promotion of a better understanding of the mandate of the Mission and the activities of other international organizations that are operating in the country .  
The Office of the Spokesman includes a civilian spokesman and a military spokesman who jointly conduct twice-weekly press briefings and speak on behalf of the Mission , aggressively and strategically utilizing the Missions achievements at press briefings ; participating in weekly briefings of members of UNAMSIL civilian and military staff , as well as other United Nations agencies ; organizing and conducting tours for journalists ; providing timely and aggressive responses to negative or inaccurate media coverage ; and regularly participating in local radio and television programmes . 
Shortly after it took off , the helicopter was shot down close to the entrance of the valley , 20 kilometres east of Sukhumi , killing all nine unarmed people on board , including four United Nations military observers , two locally employed United Nations staff members and all three members of the contracted helicopter crew .  
Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile materials and calls for arrangements by all the nuclear-weapon States to place , as soon as practicable , the fissile material designated by each of them as no longer required for military purposes under the International Atomic Energy Agency or other relevant international verification and arrangements for the disposition of such material for peaceful purposes in order to ensure that such material remains permanently outside military programmes ;  
Recalling that international law set strict limits on the use of outer space for military purposes , she said that the issue of ways and means of maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes should be studied in depth by all the bodies concerned within the context of their respective mandates .
