At the same time as this , the new authorities ignored the requests of the widespread public in Taiwan for easing up , improvement and development of cross-strait relations , and ignored the urgent requests of numerous industrial and business circles to quicken cross-strait economic interchanges and cooperation .

This will stop the phones from functioning in areas where their use is restricted , thus resolving the problem of their use in public venues . Other controversies still exist .  
But as Hsueh Cheng-tai points out , when you consider the daily routine of most foreign workers and how little free time it leaves them for breaking the law , and bear in mind that the crime rate among illegal foreign workers is far higher than for the legal ones , the problem does indeed merit attention .

That Liu Shao-tang 's death elicited such a huge response at a time when all of Taiwan 's media are packed with electoral news in the run-up to the March presidential ballot , is not only a measure of the widespread respect which Liu earned by his lifelong professionalism and refusal to lower standards , but also shows that Taiwan is still a place with deep feelings and concern for intellectual matters .

I call them " local armed fighting groups , " and in fact what they did was to fight and grab territory .

The power shortage has also led to widespread suspicions that Taiwan Power is technologically inept and unable to handle crises . As a result , its chairman Lin Wen-yuan tendered his resignation .

Also recommends that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
In conclusion , the Commission may wish to note that , historically , major socio-economic changes ( comparable to the scale of change required to restructure production and consumption in industrialized countries ) have occurred as a response to perceived opportunities ( for example , widespread availability of affordable cars ) not to government prescription .  
Unsolved problems relating to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities are widely recognized as a major source of international and internal conflicts involving widespread human rights violations .  
The cross-national and global impacts of unsustainable patterns of production and consumption , particularly in industrialized countries , environmental degradation , demographic changes , widespread and persistent poverty , and social and economic inequality are clearly visible .  
With strong support from the interim secretariat , bilateral donors and United Nations agencies , national awareness seminars are widespread and are doing a good job of educating key national actors , in both the public and private sectors , about the significance of the Convention .

Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , according to which genocide and systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
The Council recognized that it continued to be a widespread international activity frequently involving highly organized international syndicates that trafficked in human cargo without regard to the dangerous and inhumane conditions to which they were subjected , and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards .  
Such a method of operation may be characterized by widespread use of bribery and favours to ensure the malleability of key positions and agencies ; political funding to ensure that politicians elected to office will be indebted to the criminal organizations ; carefully targeted " payoffs " to law enforcement personnel to provide intelligence ; and the provision of financial incentives to members of the judiciary to ensure that the penalties for criminal activities are either not imposed or are modest .  
In other countries , such as has been independently reported in Malaysia , traditional healing as a means of treatment of dependence is sometimes based on beliefs that persons are vulnerable to supernatural influences , as well as physical causes , which increase the probability of dependence arising . 56 In such instances , traditional healers focus upon the well-being of the individual , and detoxification involves the use of herbal medicines , physical exercise and the promotion of physical health .  NULLThe role of acupuncture in the treatment of dependence has become more widespread in recent years .  
Behind the trafficking in children were situations involving poverty and abandonment , which often stemmed from social and economic problems of families , such as widespread unemployment ; little State support for large families or for families with little income ; young persons quitting school because of financial problems of their families ; debts of families contracted with usurers or with criminal organizations repaid by illicit work or illicit activities involving minors ; and moral or social degeneration in suburbs .  
With regard to the external debt , it is also relevant to point out the Declaration of the Support Group for Nicaragua of 16 April 1996 , which considers that , within the framework of a sound and responsible macroeconomic policy that encourages domestic savings , resources released as a result of a comprehensive approach to the debt problem should be used to support productive and social development .  Alleviation of the external debt burden would thus help to eliminate widespread poverty among the Nicaraguan population .  
UNICEF 's review of country experiences where remarkable social progress has been achieved shows that their common features include strong political commitment to the well-being of children , widespread community participation in the delivery of basic social services and the allocation of adequate resources to the cause of children .

In general , the urban renewal strategy has developed from solid and concentrated work in limited areas to more widespread work in which publicly subsidized urban renewal is used as a catalyst and locomotive and in which the affected owners and tenants are given a major say in the result .  
From the standpoint of improvement of agricultural productivity the optimal management of public land constitutes a priority means of substantially raising the contribution of such land to increased output and helping , by a multiplier effect , to disseminate advanced techniques .  Accordingly , a reform of the methods of managing this national land has been adopted after widespread national consultation .  
Mr . MAHUGU ( Kenya ) , after endorsing the statement made by Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China , said that while current economic indicators revealed widespread world economic growth , with the developing countries having registered an aggregate GDP growth of over 5 per cent , that growth rate concealed sharp regional , subregional and national differences .  
The fundamental changes in the world scene and the promise they held in the early 1990s , which many celebrated as the " new world order " , must not be allowed to degenerate into a dismal landscape of internal armed conflicts , widespread ethnic rivalries , unbridled nationalism and a multitude of humanitarian problems adversely affecting human well-being in all continents .  
That being said , it was obvious that there were still dramatic variations between regions , and the question was whether the current relatively robust growth in the developing countries as a whole would translate itself into a widespread improvement of living conditions and especially into poverty reduction worldwide . 
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
His delegation particularly welcomed the inclusion of crimes against United Nations and associated personnel and the use in armed conflict of methods and means of warfare calculated to cause widespread , long-term and severe damage to the natural environment , particularly in the light of their emergence as crimes under customary international law .  
The widespread incorporation of information technology in production and communications has considerably reduced the physical size of factories ( by increasing the versatility of machines , thereby lowering the number of machines required for different sequences of operations ) , expanded the variety of jobs that can be performed , and improved the precision in production and quality control that can be achieved by a worker , and ( through instant information connectivity ) greatly enhanced intra - and inter-firm spatial networking to maximize location-specific advantages .

Typically : host institution may not benefit from widespread local support ; staff may be divided as to advisability of foreign assistance ; there may be solid resistance to necessary change ; circumstances ( financial and material ) may be poor and so on .  
Bridging the data gap will require a strategy of more widespread participation in data collection and assessment , bringing together Governments , scientists , non-governmental organizations , the private sector ( including industry ) , local authorities , and even the general public in coherent efforts to document key issues and trends as a basis for management decisions at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
Subsidies in the energy sector for conventional energy sources and nuclear power tend to hamper widespread development and application of renewable energy sources . 6 Policy changes that will lead to the full internalization of environmental costs in prices through the use of economic and fiscal instruments and the removal of permanent subsidies are required if a sustainable energy path is to be pursued . 
As mentioned in his previous report , the Special Rapporteur continued to receive reports and information on grave and widespread violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms by government agents , and abuses and atrocities committed against the life , liberty and security of individuals by members of different parties to the armed conflict in the country other than the Government of the Sudan in the areas under their control .
