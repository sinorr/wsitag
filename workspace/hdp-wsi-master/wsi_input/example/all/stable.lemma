The impact of this policy would have been all the greater on reproductive health and family-planning questions if the adequate financial means had been available to complement the limited capacities of my country , which has been shaken by an unprecedented financial crisis and the political transition difficulties of establishing stable democratic institutions .  
Therefore , the public sector can play a catalytic role by helping to promote stable and profitable housing finance systems , the introduction of new products that satisfactorily meet demand , the introduction and adoption of banking regulations and , most of all , by promoting a housing policy model that takes the long-term view and that is based on a partnership between the public and private sectors .

The draft resolution is entitled Towards a strengthened and stable international financial architecture responsive to the priorities of growth and development , especially in developing countries , and to the promotion of economic and social equity .  
In that struggle we need not systems based on assistance , but genuine , responsible , mutually advantageous partnership based on consistent , open and practical reactions and mechanisms that will make a difference and will be effective and stable .  
We have also realized that the creation of a better , more equitable world ensuring equal opportunities for all people requires stable economic policies , longterm social programmes and concerted international action .  
At the national level , UNCTAD could contribute to sound domestic macroeconomic and financial policies , administrative reforms and continuing efforts to promote a stable and transparent national legal and regulatory framework favourable to development .

Emphasizing that stable , predictable and adequate funding is a prerequisite for improved governance and should constitute a central aspect of deliberations on improving international environmental governance ,  
To do this , we need to address four major objectives : first , consolidate the secure and stable environment that presently exists ; secondly , steer East Timor through the creation of democratic institutions and successful , peaceful elections ; thirdly , put in place the building blocks for the management of public finances and policy-making ; and fourthly , establish the framework for a sustainable and effective Government administration .

Mohammad Khatami , assured me in no uncertain terms that , because the see the establishment of a stable and representative Government accountable to all Afghans to be in their own national interests , they would like the United Nations to play a pivotal role in the process of finding a political solution .  
It consists of the need to help the people of Afghanistan establish a responsible , representative , accountable and stable Government which enjoys internal and external legitimacy ; is committed to respecting and promoting the rights of all its men , women and children ; enjoys peaceful and friendly relations with all its neighbours ; and is able to ensure that Afghanistan will never again be used as a breeding and staging ground for terrorists or drug-traffickers .

We are convinced that the United Nations should play the central role in facilitating the transformation of Afghanistan into a normal , stable and prosperous state not only because averting the threat to regional and international security emanating from Taliban-controlled territory falls squarely within the purview of the Security Council and the General Assembly , but also because we believe that only within the context of the United Nations can we find practical solutions that would be acceptable to all parties to the peace process , thereby ensuring the parties cooperation in their implementation .  
For the next election process to be perceived as free and fair , and for the full recognition of legitimacy in the authorities elected , the international community expects a stable environment , where fundamental rights can be guaranteed , where freedom of movement and expression is assured and where democracy can indeed be exercised .

Under the dual impact of the two tidal waves of world economic globalization and regional blocs formation , Taiwan 's hope of sustained , stable economic development lies in the mainland of the motherland , without which Taiwan 's economic development would certainly be faced with a predicament .
