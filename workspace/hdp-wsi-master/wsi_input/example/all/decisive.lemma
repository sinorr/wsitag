In June 1995 , Li Teng-hui paid a visit to the United States in a so-called " private " capacity .  The Chinese Government launched a decisive anti-splittism and anti - " Taiwan independence " struggle and lodged a strong protest against the action of the US Government openly allowing Li Teng-hui to visit the United States , which violated the pledges made by the United States in the three Sino-US joint communiques and serious damaged China 's sovereignty , and solemnly and justly took up the matter with the US side .  
It has been proven by historical experiences that without the heartfelt endorsement and vigorous support of the broad masses of people , our Party could not possibly have developed from a weak and small beginning into a strong and large force and displayed decisive historical roles in putting an end to the situation of China being carved up by foreign powers and laboring people being oppressed and exploited by reactionary ruling classes and in the struggles of changing the look of poverty and backwardness in China .  
Teachers are engineers of human souls ; improving teachers ' ideological and political qualities and ethics cultivation will be of decisive significance to the comprehensive ethical , intellectual , physical , and aesthetic development of children and youths and to training qualified personnel for modernization construction .  
In the new historical period , our party must always meet the requirements in the development of the advanced social productive forces in China , adhere to the advancing orientation of China 's progressive culture , and faithfully represent the fundamental interests of the broadest majority of the Chinese people , and a basic and decisive condition for this is that the party must persistently arm the minds of the entire membership and rally the people with the correct ideal and belief .  
According to international oil market experts , Saudi Arabia , as the world 's largest oil producer and exporter whose output accounts for 40 percent of the total of OPEC , has always played a decisive role in the organization .  In addition , Mexico , Norway , and other non-OPEC oil producers have also agreed to increase output .  Therefore , it will be inevitable for the present OPEC ministerial meeting to decide to increase crude oil extraction .  
The relationship between " one center " and " two basic points " embodies the dialectical and unified relationship between the economic base and the superstructure , including ideology and politics , in which the former plays a role as the final and decisive factor and the latter plays a tremendous reactive role in supporting the former .  
It urged that in the year of fighting a decisive battle to reform state-owned enterprises and lift them from difficulties , effective efforts should be made to implement the series of important policy measures defined by the party Central Committee and the State Council , accelerate establishment of the modern enterprise system in a standardized and down-to-earth manner , vigorously promote scientific enterprise management , and continuously improve the competitive edge and economic efficiency of SOEs .  
As Taiwan Island is a narrow and small area , its military targets are relatively concentrated .  Moreover , Taiwan is close to the mainland , these relatively concentrated targets , in time of war , are susceptible to attacks from all directions and in various forms , and will be destroyed very quickly .  It is difficult to conserve the strength for the second attack and decisive battle .  
After watching the exercise , Chi Haotian said : The Air Force is a hi-tech service which fights decisive battles in the air but relies on ground support .  Without strong logistics support , the Air Force would be deprived of strong combat effectiveness .  Chi stressed and pointed out : Conducting scientific and technological training is a major measure for implementing Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking on building a strong force through science and technology ;  
The most conspicuous feature is that , the air force has now replaced the 70-year-old classic theory concerning " air supremacy " with the theory that the " air force , surrounding its central mission of ensuring ' air supremacy , ' should become the strategic service of first choice having the capabilities of ensuring supremacy on land , at sea , in the air , and in the electromagnetic space ; and a force that can play a decisive role in waging a high-tech regional war . "  
In future regional wars , our strong adversaries who possess high-tech weaponry may engage us in aerial battles with their superior technology .  These battles will be abrupt and decisive .  Our adversaries will go all out to seize the initiative by taking full advantage of nighttime and complex weather conditions .  
Party committees and governments as well as departments concerned in key areas seriously affected by illegal drugs should promptly swing into action to conduct careful investigation , make earnest arrangements , and adopt decisive measures to change the conditions of the localities within a specified time in accordance with the principles guiding the handling of the most serious problems of illegal drugs specific to the localities .  
Taiwan 's armed forces believe that they are bound to lose in any " decisive battle on their beaches and shores " because Taiwan Island is small , shallow in strategic depth , and lacking a room for maneuver , and with the development of modern weaponry , the Taiwan Strait is becoming less and less effective as a natural defense for Taiwan .  
The core of Taiwan armed forces ' thinking of " decisive battle outside border " is : They will offer tenacious resistance on offshore islands , make timely landing raids on enemy shores , take advantage of the advanced performance of their main naval and air weapons to first impose war on the enemy , let war start on the enemy 's shore , and prevent war from reaching their own " doorstep " .  
Amid a wave of criticisms , Tang Yao-ming , chief of the general staff of the Taiwan military , had no choice but to hold an urgent news conference on 7 July . Using fallacious reasoning , he claimed : The so-called " fighting a decisive battle offshore " is very different in meaning from " fighting an offshore decisive battle " .  
In future international competitions , able personnel and the quality of man will become two decisive factors , and whoever can successfully seize the commanding heights in the field of able personnel and can hold in possession rich human sources will be able to gain the upper hand in competition .  
The most visible intention was the new Taiwan leader 's public putting forward the military strategic concept of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " in an attempt to turn defensive into offensive and to issue a military threat to the mainland .  
A Japanese reporter said in the Tokyo Shimbun that the circum-Pacific military exercise in which the United States plays a leading role was designed to enhance the technological level of naval vessels in a decisive battle , but its nature has changed a great deal " .  " The recent military exercises are a part of the ' non-war military operations ' strategy drawn up by the US Army " .  
When the fighting entered the decisive stage , our armored troops , which had driven through snowy mountains , icy paths , marshland , and obstacles , suddenly pounced on the " enemy troops " , which were paradropped .  In this way , the " enemy 's " attempt to attack us from the front and the rear simultaneously was foiled .  
Facts have proved that economic operating pattern is the decisive factor of stimulating and attracting talented personnel , and the foundation for bringing up new-type personnel with the special characteristics of having enterprising spirits , competitive awareness , concepts of law and credibility , and professional ethics lies in the market economy .  The WTO is an invisible and powerful pointer as well as the soil for breeding and hastening parturition .  
Scientific and technological progress and innovation are decisive factors for developing productive forces and are increasingly becoming the leading force for the economic and social developments .  Only by quickening scientific and technological progress and improving the capability of technical innovation can we promote structural readjustment , enhance the overall quality of national economy , and realize bigger development of social productive forces .  
Not only does information industry have a decisive impact on the livelihood of the ordinary people in China today but also , more importantly , it has become an important indicator of China 's comprehensive national strength .  Moreover , it has been universally acknowledged as China 's strategic industry in its economic and social development in the next century .  
To establish the structural design of nuclear weapons devices , Guo Yonghuai proposed " proceeding along two parallel roads and choosing the superior one in the end " in order to determine the optimum plan for the first nuclear bomb detonation , which played a decisive role in deciding several critical questions .  
Dialectical materialism adheres to the unity of material and spirit , emphasizes the decisive role played by material product in the social development and gives full light to the active role played by spiritual strength in the course where people reconstruct the objective world .  
Korea 's ruling party and opposition parties also issued a statement specifically saying that they unanimously and strongly blamed Japan for planning to pass this history textbook , and achieving the evil goal of twisting history and whitewashing their past barbaric behavior towards Asian people .  They also demanded that the Korean government marshall all its forces to take a decisive counteraction toward Japan .  
The US military believes that , based on its technical superiority , in future joint operations they " will be able to achieve decisive superiority through asymmetric actions using the power of joint forces to strike at the enemy 's weak points and the skillful use of troops in terms of time and space . "  
What integrated strategic operations basically means is the overall , multidimensional use in the air , ground , sea , space , and electromagnetic realms of the information warfare capabilities , long-range precision strike capabilities , and mobility of integrated units , creating a decisive posture involving complete space-time control of the battlefield and focused directly at the enemy 's center of gravity .  
If this posture is insufficient to achieve the strategic scheme , then full-dimensional protection will be used to keep one 's own losses to an absolute minimum , maintaining military action freedom and , at the same time , bringing to bear the operational might of integrated C4ISR systems and strike systems to carry out controlled strikes against the enemy 's center of gravity to achieve a decisive victory quickly .  
While enforcing the task of flying to tail and monitor the US military reconnaissance airplane , Comrade Wang Wei was resolute and decisive , calm and cool-headed , and courageous and indomitable .  In order to safeguard state sovereignty and national dignity , he dedicated his valuable life , thus putting the aim of our army into practice with his utterly fearless revolutionary behavior .  
The decision further urges them to emulate Wang Wei 's dauntless spirit of not fearing strong enemies , not evading difficulties and dangers , and daring to conquer all enemies , so that they will constantly temper their military style of being heroic and indomitable , making decisive struggle , and winning decisive victory .  This will also enable them to strenuously learn modern knowledge of science and technology , become versed in using the weapons in their hands , and truly raise their ability to defend the country under modern conditions .  
It urged them to learn from Wang Wei 's spirit of being undaunted by the enemy , not evading difficulties and dangers , and daring to overwhelm all enemies ; and to learn from his combat style of continuing to toughening himself , fighting heroically and unyieldingly , and fighting a decisive battle to final victory .  The decision called on all officers and men to apply themselves to studying modern science and technology , to become skillful in using their weapons and equipment , and truly enhance their abilities to fight a defensive war under modern conditions .  
The fact that the Taiwan authorities are putting forward the dangerous strategic concept of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " and attempting to " rely on arms to resist reunification " has a lot to do with the wrong signal sent by the United States to the Taiwan authorities on the question of arms sales .  
Both the " offshore decisive battle " and the " crippling battle " are ideas developed from the same strategic concept of " effective deterrence and solid defense , " but the actual intention is to internationalize the Taiwan issue , stretch the battlefield to the mainland and even the Pacific region , create the pretext for intervention by external forces , and then launch an attack first if the mainland shows signs of using military force , thereby crushing the mainland at one go .  
Most of the weapons tested were long-range attack weapons , underscoring the Taiwan military 's new " offshore decisive battle " strategic concept .  The exercise also stressed the combined tactical applications of new types of weapons , in order to test the tactics and the weapons ' technical performance and give full play to the overall combat capabilities of various types of weapons .  
Since the implementation of the new system governing noncommissioned officers over a year ago , noncommissioned officers have been playing a very prominent role at the basic-level units .  They have become backbone forces in military units ' combat training , education , and study of specialized technical skills , playing a decisive role in military units ' basic and long-range developments .  
Not long ago , he even put forth a fairly provocative slogan of " fighting a decisive battle outside the territory " and repeatedly sought more and more advanced and offensive weapons .  Recently , when the purchase order of foreign weapons was finalized , he just could not hide being quite pleased with himself .  
and externally , they have gone all out in their pursuit of a " pragmatic diplomacy , " a " money diplomacy , " and a " secret diplomacy . "  Particularly , they have invited a " guardian god " from abroad , expanded their military purchases , and threatened to " fight a decisive offshore battle . "  
What should be even more highly shocking to people is that the Bian administration continues to confront the mainland by pursuing a line of " resisting reunification with weapons , " professing that he wants a " decisive battle outside the boundaries , " ordering a large number of advanced weapons from the United States , and actively coordinating with the United States to revise their global strategy , and acting as a willing pawn of the international anti-China forces working to " contain " China .  
Before being sworn in to office , President Chen had once put forth the idea of " fighting a decisive battle outside our territory . "  Whether or not this idea is realistically and strategically feasible , it has at least reflected the psychology shared by some fellow countrymen , who have all along hated , dodged , and rejected a war .  
In military affairs , he has advocated a " decisive battle offshore " , increased military spending , intensified the purchase of advanced offensive weapons , and advocated that the United States should " coordinate in the defense of Taiwan " and help Taiwan to resist an " attack " by the mainland .  
A year after a sharp change took place in the Taiwan Strait situation , Taiwan people built their own views and judgement on Taiwan authorities ' threats of " fighting a decisive war offshore " and " bombing the coastal cities on the west side of the strait " .  
Recently , the Chinese Communists ' high-level departments concerned , including the Central Political Science and Law Group , have proclaimed that the campaign to suppress Falungong has achieved fruitful results at this stage , adding that this is entirely attributable to the central authorities ' decision plus the " decisive and resolute " action taken by the public security sector .  
Li Lanqing stressed : In rectifying and regulating the market economic order , we must proceed our tasks in a quick , responsible , and extensive manner , and adopt strong policies .  Party committees and governments at all levels must firmly uphold the principle of tackling current and long-term tasks , realistically strengthen leadership in this work , divide the work , cooperate closely , and work with concerted efforts to achieve a decisive victory .  
Not only is a new round of multilateral trade talks a major issue that concerns all countries today , but APEC 's 21 APEC member nations account for about half of world trade and half of the global economy .  Their voice has a decisive role on the international economic stage .  
After hearing reports by responsible persons of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and the 15 provinces , municipalities , and cities , including Guangdong , Jiangsu , Shanghai , Zhejiang , Shanddong , Fujian , Liaoning , Tianjin , Beijing , Hebei , Anhui , Sichuan , Shenzhen , Ningbo , and Dalian , Wu Yi pointed out : At present , export in foreign trade has occupied a decisive position in our country 's economic development and become an important task that has a bearing on the overall situation of the national economic development .  
Vice-Principal Feng Guoqiang of the Party school of the Shangxi provincial Party committee said that the thinking of " three represents " precisely grasps the three most fundamental and decisive factors about social order , most clearly reflects the advanced nature of our Party , brings to light the content of our Party 's advanced nature , and answers the issue of how to maintain the advanced nature of our Party from an ideological point of view .  
They point out that the establishment of the strategic partnership marked by equality and trust was a correct historical choice , and it has decisive significance for strengthening cooperation between the People 's Republic of China and the Russian Federation in all areas , for consolidating friendship between the Chinese and Russian peoples , and for building a just and rational international new order .  
During the talks , the Chinese and Russian heads of state have earnestly reviewed the development of Sino-Russian ties over the past 10 years .  They pointed out : Establishing a strategic cooperative partnershipthat is equal and trusting is a correct historic choice , and has decisive impacts on the following : when China and Russia strive to comprehensively strengthen cooperation , when China and Russia strive to consolidate their peoples ' friendship , and when the world strives to establish a fair and rational new international order .  
Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " heretical cult have the decisive nature of brutally injuring and killing people and causing grave harm to the state and the people .  However , with the pressure from the general populace and public opinion , this cult has been unable to completely expose itself and unwilling to let society and its practitioners understand the truth ; still less it dares to confront miserable facts .  
According to " New York Times , " the US Department of Defense recently decided to make a major adjustment in its military strategy , replacing the strategy of " fighting and winning two major wars simultaneously " implemented since 1991 with a new strategy requiring troops to " win a decisive victory " in a major regional war and , at the same time , maintain sufficient capability to fulfill other important tasks .  
and attempted to sever the kinship forged with blood , which is thicker than water , between the people on two sides .  As if that is not enough , the Taiwan authorities have time and time again spent the hard-earned money of the general public in buying advanced weapons from abroad .  They advocate " fighting a decisive battle outside our borders " and wish to enter into a military alliance with the United States and Japan against the mainland .  
Moreover , the Taiwan authorities have repeatedly used the money earned by onerous toil of the ordinary people to buy advanced weapons from foreign countries , advocated " a decisive battle offshore , " and intended to form a military alliance against the mainland with the United States and Japan .  
As the Chinese have more and more profoundly realized the decisive effect of the ever-advancing science and technology on the economy , it can be predicted that the SOEs will pay greater attention , either in an active or passive attitude , to the import , assimilation , and development of the new high technology , and a new technological innovative system with enterprises as its center will be established in China too .  
However , if there is any major incident of making Taiwan break away from China in any name , if there occurs foreign occupation of Taiwan , or if the Taiwan authorities indefinitely refuse to peacefully resolve the issue of unification of the two sides of the strait through negotiation , the Chinese government will be forced to take all possible decisive measures , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and to complete the great cause of unification of China .  
On the decisive factors in the outcome of war , he said : Taiwan 's weaknesses in terms of political , geographical , climatic , war potential and other factors are things that no advanced weaponry can make up .  Take its geographical conditions for an example .  Taiwan 's geographical environment is such that it is impossible to bring the maximum capability of high-performance weapons into play .  
From this interview , people can see that the Chinese Government and people have won a decisive victory in the struggle against the " Falungong " cult .  They also can see that Li Hongzhi has turned from a cult founder into a political tool of the international anti-China forces .  This means that our struggle against the " Falungong " cult in the future will still be a protracted , acute , and complicated one .

In terms of technological structure , the low technological level is a grave defect of the non-public economy .  In the sections where the technological level plays a decisive role , such as the manufacturing section and the new economic section , the non-public enterprises are usually at an unfavorable position while competing with foreign enterprises .  
Science and technology constitute a primary productive force , and scientific and technological progress is a decisive factor impacting economic development .

The remarks of Xin Qi , a Chinese expert on the Taiwan issue , made at a discussion held recently by the Society for the Chinese in western America were reported by a newspaper under an eye-catching title of " Surely attack if independence , and surely win if attacking - - no fear of launching a nuclear war to fight a decisive battle . "  The newspaper also claimed that by voicing the " appalling words , " he will " definitely reinforce his image of commonly deemed the spokesman for the People 's Liberation Army . "  
As the longest river in China , Chang Jiang has 1.7 square kilometers of drainage areas , one fourth of the country 's cultivated areas , and one third of the country 's entire population ; and turns out two fifths of the country 's total industrial and agricultural output value .  The Chang Jiang valley plays a decisive role in China 's national economic and social development .  
Regarding the defense strategy of Taiwan 's troops , Chen Shui-bian emphasized that Taiwan " still should follow the policy of ' effective deterrence , tenacious defense ' and regard the procedures for exercising control over the air and sea and for anti-landing , and the concepts of ' precise and accurate in-depth attacks , providing earlier warning , seeking advantage in information , ' and ' fighting a decisive battle outside the boundary ' as the direction of army building and preparation against war . "  
Wu Shih-wen pointed out : President Chen [ Ch'en Shui-pien ] ' s idea of " fighting a decisive offshore battle " is also an army building rationale the Nationalist forces have all along upheld , which differs in no way in spirit from such a strategic thinking as " effective deterrent , tenacious defense . "  
The earliest military strategy of Taiwan based itself on " recovering the mainland . "  Finally , to face reality , Taiwan changed its strategy into fighting a " decisive war on the island , " the core of which was a " decisive battle on the beach and offshore ; " that is , " destroying the enemy forces at the waterfront and annihilating them on beachheads . "  
The trends described above indicate that the Taiwan authorities and the military are transforming a " passive defensive strategy " into an " active defensive strategy , " the core of which is to strengthen military " deterrence , " avoid as much as possible a decisive battle on the island , and make great efforts to push the battle ground off the island or even to the west of the center line of the strait or within the mainland .  
The thinking of a " decisive battle offshore " and any overconfident military and political provocations are no doubt nonsensical and crazy practices and a risk that invites self-destruction .  Some people in Taiwan should rein in on the brink of the precipice .  
Through two and a half years of arduous efforts , the losses incurred by Liaoning 's large and medium-sized state enterprises in the state appraisal list were down from over 60 percent to 39.9 percent , while 80 of 100 large and medium-sized state enterprises under the state plan have undergone corporate restructuring .  The provincial industrial economic operation has not only shown a pickup but also witnessed structural changes , laying a solid foundation for securing a decisive victory in the reform and turnaround of state enterprises .  
He is really waiting for the ripe time to fulfill his second dream - - setting up a " Taiwan Republic . " To this end , he is ready to counter the CPC by force of arms , " fighting a decisive war with the CPC outside the borders . "  This has made the cross-strait situation more uncertain and has increased the possibility of a cross-strait war .  
However , an analysis of Taiwan 's military combat capability , especially of its naval and air forces , will readily show that the Taiwan military 's so-called " decisive battle offshore " can only be described as a dangerous and dubious wishful thinking .  
President Chen Shui-bian 's [ Chen Shui-bien 's ] idea of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " has not been mentioned in the report .  However , Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen emphasized in the foreword that the change of the strategic idea of the national troops to " effective deterrence and strong entrenchment " does not mean we are having an arms race with the Chinese communist troops .  
In fact , since taking office Chen Shuibian has never acknowledged the " one China " principle ; he has repeatedly said that " Taiwan is a sovereign independent state , " blocked cross-strait political contacts and negotiations , and glibly talked about a " decisive battle offshore , " in a bid to reject reunification by using armed force ; and all this is related to the continual wrong signals being given by the United States .

In the first 10 months of this year , the overall level of consumer prices rose by only 0.1 percentage point .

The decisive role of the relationship between market supply and demand is still quite unstable .  
Such a will takes its source from strong national feeling and the sense of the sacred mission of achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation ; it is built on the realistic basis of the development of national strength , on the basis of a comprehensive and cool assessment of the international situation , and also on the basis of full confidence in China 's future development , and it will eventually play a decisive role in settling the Taiwan issue .

Therefore , it will be inevitable for the present OPEC ministerial meeting to decide to increase crude oil extraction .  
The relationship between " one center " and " two basic points " embodies the dialectical and unified relationship between the economic base and the superstructure , including ideology and politics , in which the former plays a role as the final and decisive factor and the latter plays a tremendous reactive role in supporting the former .

As Taiwan Island is a narrow and small area , its military targets are relatively concentrated .

It is difficult to conserve the strength for the second attack and decisive battle .  
After watching the exercise , Chi Haotian said : The Air Force is a hi-tech service which fights decisive battles in the air but relies on ground support .  Without strong logistics support , the Air Force would be deprived of strong combat effectiveness .  Chi stressed and pointed out : Conducting scientific and technological training is a major measure for implementing Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking on building a strong force through science and technology ;  
The most conspicuous feature is that , the air force has now replaced the 70-year-old classic theory concerning " air supremacy " with the theory that the " air force , surrounding its central mission of ensuring ' air supremacy , ' should become the strategic service of first choice having the capabilities of ensuring supremacy on land , at sea , in the air , and in the electromagnetic space ; and a force that can play a decisive role in waging a high-tech regional war . "  
In future regional wars , our strong adversaries who possess high-tech weaponry may engage us in aerial battles with their superior technology .  These battles will be abrupt and decisive .  Our adversaries will go all out to seize the initiative by taking full advantage of nighttime and complex weather conditions .  
Party committees and governments as well as departments concerned in key areas seriously affected by illegal drugs should promptly swing into action to conduct careful investigation , make earnest arrangements , and adopt decisive measures to change the conditions of the localities within a specified time in accordance with the principles guiding the handling of the most serious problems of illegal drugs specific to the localities .  
Taiwan 's armed forces believe that they are bound to lose in any " decisive battle on their beaches and shores " because Taiwan Island is small , shallow in strategic depth , and lacking a room for maneuver , and with the development of modern weaponry , the Taiwan Strait is becoming less and less effective as a natural defense for Taiwan .  
The core of Taiwan armed forces ' thinking of " decisive battle outside border " is : They will offer tenacious resistance on offshore islands , make timely landing raids on enemy shores , take advantage of the advanced performance of their main naval and air weapons to first impose war on the enemy , let war start on the enemy 's shore , and prevent war from reaching their own " doorstep " .  
Amid a wave of criticisms , Tang Yao-ming , chief of the general staff of the Taiwan military , had no choice but to hold an urgent news conference on 7 July . Using fallacious reasoning , he claimed : The so-called " fighting a decisive battle offshore " is very different in meaning from " fighting an offshore decisive battle " .  
In future international competitions , able personnel and the quality of man will become two decisive factors , and whoever can successfully seize the commanding heights in the field of able personnel and can hold in possession rich human sources will be able to gain the upper hand in competition .

A Japanese reporter said in the Tokyo Shimbun that the circum-Pacific military exercise in which the United States plays a leading role was designed to enhance the technological level of naval vessels in a decisive battle , but its nature has changed a great deal " .  " The recent military exercises are a part of the ' non-war military operations ' strategy drawn up by the US Army " .  
When the fighting entered the decisive stage , our armored troops , which had driven through snowy mountains , icy paths , marshland , and obstacles , suddenly pounced on the " enemy troops " , which were paradropped .  In this way , the " enemy 's " attempt to attack us from the front and the rear simultaneously was foiled .  
Facts have proved that economic operating pattern is the decisive factor of stimulating and attracting talented personnel , and the foundation for bringing up new-type personnel with the special characteristics of having enterprising spirits , competitive awareness , concepts of law and credibility , and professional ethics lies in the market economy .

Dialectical materialism adheres to the unity of material and spirit , emphasizes the decisive role played by material product in the social development and gives full light to the active role played by spiritual strength in the course where people reconstruct the objective world .  
Korea 's ruling party and opposition parties also issued a statement specifically saying that they unanimously and strongly blamed Japan for planning to pass this history textbook , and achieving the evil goal of twisting history and whitewashing their past barbaric behavior towards Asian people .

The US military believes that , based on its technical superiority , in future joint operations they " will be able to achieve decisive superiority through asymmetric actions using the power of joint forces to strike at the enemy 's weak points and the skillful use of troops in terms of time and space . "  
What integrated strategic operations basically means is the overall , multidimensional use in the air , ground , sea , space , and electromagnetic realms of the information warfare capabilities , long-range precision strike capabilities , and mobility of integrated units , creating a decisive posture involving complete space-time control of the battlefield and focused directly at the enemy 's center of gravity .  
If this posture is insufficient to achieve the strategic scheme , then full-dimensional protection will be used to keep one 's own losses to an absolute minimum , maintaining military action freedom and , at the same time , bringing to bear the operational might of integrated C4ISR systems and strike systems to carry out controlled strikes against the enemy 's center of gravity to achieve a decisive victory quickly .  
While enforcing the task of flying to tail and monitor the US military reconnaissance airplane , Comrade Wang Wei was resolute and decisive , calm and cool-headed , and courageous and indomitable .  In order to safeguard state sovereignty and national dignity , he dedicated his valuable life , thus putting the aim of our army into practice with his utterly fearless revolutionary behavior .  
The decision further urges them to emulate Wang Wei 's dauntless spirit of not fearing strong enemies , not evading difficulties and dangers , and daring to conquer all enemies , so that they will constantly temper their military style of being heroic and indomitable , making decisive struggle , and winning decisive victory .  This will also enable them to strenuously learn modern knowledge of science and technology , become versed in using the weapons in their hands , and truly raise their ability to defend the country under modern conditions .  
It urged them to learn from Wang Wei 's spirit of being undaunted by the enemy , not evading difficulties and dangers , and daring to overwhelm all enemies ; and to learn from his combat style of continuing to toughening himself , fighting heroically and unyieldingly , and fighting a decisive battle to final victory .  The decision called on all officers and men to apply themselves to studying modern science and technology , to become skillful in using their weapons and equipment , and truly enhance their abilities to fight a defensive war under modern conditions .  
The fact that the Taiwan authorities are putting forward the dangerous strategic concept of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " and attempting to " rely on arms to resist reunification " has a lot to do with the wrong signal sent by the United States to the Taiwan authorities on the question of arms sales .  
Both the " offshore decisive battle " and the " crippling battle " are ideas developed from the same strategic concept of " effective deterrence and solid defense , " but the actual intention is to internationalize the Taiwan issue , stretch the battlefield to the mainland and even the Pacific region , create the pretext for intervention by external forces , and then launch an attack first if the mainland shows signs of using military force , thereby crushing the mainland at one go .  
Most of the weapons tested were long-range attack weapons , underscoring the Taiwan military 's new " offshore decisive battle " strategic concept .  The exercise also stressed the combined tactical applications of new types of weapons , in order to test the tactics and the weapons ' technical performance and give full play to the overall combat capabilities of various types of weapons .  
Since the implementation of the new system governing noncommissioned officers over a year ago , noncommissioned officers have been playing a very prominent role at the basic-level units .  They have become backbone forces in military units ' combat training , education , and study of specialized technical skills , playing a decisive role in military units ' basic and long-range developments .  
Not long ago , he even put forth a fairly provocative slogan of " fighting a decisive battle outside the territory " and repeatedly sought more and more advanced and offensive weapons .  Recently , when the purchase order of foreign weapons was finalized , he just could not hide being quite pleased with himself .  
and externally , they have gone all out in their pursuit of a " pragmatic diplomacy , " a " money diplomacy , " and a " secret diplomacy . "  Particularly , they have invited a " guardian god " from abroad , expanded their military purchases , and threatened to " fight a decisive offshore battle . "  
What should be even more highly shocking to people is that the Bian administration continues to confront the mainland by pursuing a line of " resisting reunification with weapons , " professing that he wants a " decisive battle outside the boundaries , " ordering a large number of advanced weapons from the United States , and actively coordinating with the United States to revise their global strategy , and acting as a willing pawn of the international anti-China forces working to " contain " China .  
Before being sworn in to office , President Chen had once put forth the idea of " fighting a decisive battle outside our territory .

Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " heretical cult have the decisive nature of brutally injuring and killing people and causing grave harm to the state and the people .

According to " New York Times , " the US Department of Defense recently decided to make a major adjustment in its military strategy , replacing the strategy of " fighting and winning two major wars simultaneously " implemented since 1991 with a new strategy requiring troops to " win a decisive victory " in a major regional war and , at the same time , maintain sufficient capability to fulfill other important tasks .

However , if there is any major incident of making Taiwan break away from China in any name , if there occurs foreign occupation of Taiwan , or if the Taiwan authorities indefinitely refuse to peacefully resolve the issue of unification of the two sides of the strait through negotiation , the Chinese government will be forced to take all possible decisive measures , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and to complete the great cause of unification of China .

Regarding the defense strategy of Taiwan 's troops , Chen Shui-bian emphasized that Taiwan " still should follow the policy of ' effective deterrence , tenacious defense ' and regard the procedures for exercising control over the air and sea and for anti-landing , and the concepts of ' precise and accurate in-depth attacks , providing earlier warning , seeking advantage in information , ' and ' fighting a decisive battle outside the boundary ' as the direction of army building and preparation against war . "  
Wu Shih-wen pointed out : President Chen [ Ch'en Shui-pien ] ' s idea of " fighting a decisive offshore battle " is also an army building rationale the Nationalist forces have all along upheld , which differs in no way in spirit from such a strategic thinking as " effective deterrent , tenacious defense . "  
The earliest military strategy of Taiwan based itself on " recovering the mainland . "  Finally , to face reality , Taiwan changed its strategy into fighting a " decisive war on the island , " the core of which was a " decisive battle on the beach and offshore ; " that is , " destroying the enemy forces at the waterfront and annihilating them on beachheads . "  
The trends described above indicate that the Taiwan authorities and the military are transforming a " passive defensive strategy " into an " active defensive strategy , " the core of which is to strengthen military " deterrence , " avoid as much as possible a decisive battle on the island , and make great efforts to push the battle ground off the island or even to the west of the center line of the strait or within the mainland .

However , an analysis of Taiwan 's military combat capability , especially of its naval and air forces , will readily show that the Taiwan military 's so-called " decisive battle offshore " can only be described as a dangerous and dubious wishful thinking .  
President Chen Shui-bian 's [ Chen Shui-bien 's ] idea of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " has not been mentioned in the report .  However , Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen emphasized in the foreword that the change of the strategic idea of the national troops to " effective deterrence and strong entrenchment " does not mean we are having an arms race with the Chinese communist troops .  
In fact , since taking office Chen Shuibian has never acknowledged the " one China " principle ; he has repeatedly said that " Taiwan is a sovereign independent state , " blocked cross-strait political contacts and negotiations , and glibly talked about a " decisive battle offshore , " in a bid to reject reunification by using armed force ; and all this is related to the continual wrong signals being given by the United States .
