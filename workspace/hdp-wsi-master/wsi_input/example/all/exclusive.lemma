Viet Nam will continue its consistent policy of settling disputes through negotiation in the spirit of equality , mutual respect and understanding , with due respect to international law , particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , and to the sovereign rights and jurisdiction of coastal States over their respective continental shelves and exclusive economic zones .

Given the complementary and non _ exclusive nature of the protective norms of international law , it is extremely important to consider the positive linkage that exists with international humanitarian law and , in particular , at what point article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions , which also establishes fundamental guarantees during internal armed conflicts , enters into force .

This silence is alarming inasmuch as there are situations in which a countrys press reports in abundant detail on the presence of companies involved in matters of national security and public safety without regard for human rights and in open contradiction with constitutional provisions that categorically state that internal order and security are the exclusive responsibility of the State .  
Questions have arisen as to whether such exclusive arrangements with limited membership have been truly effective in achieving their stated purpose of strengthening the international non-proliferation regime , especially with regard to scientific and technological applications connected with advanced weapons as well as weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery .
