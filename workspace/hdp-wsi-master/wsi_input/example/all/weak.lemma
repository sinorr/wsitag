The Republic of China has already passed the stage where its comparative advantage lies in a cheap labor supply , " says Wu Hui-lin of the Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research . " We 've moved into a period where technologically advanced and capital-intensive industries are more important . For mainland China in the short term to compete with us in the area of heavy industry would just be matching their weak point against our strongest . "  
Unless we further accelerate the training of technical personnel , it will be difficult for us to join the ranks of the industrialized nations . 4 ) Sluggish renovation of technology by private enterprise . The most fundamental reason why the nation 's industrial structure is weak and its speed of adjustment is slow is that the level of creativity in products and production processes is inadequate and technological renovation by private enterprise is sluggish .  
What stands out in this history of blood and tears is their pitiful quandary as a weak people caught between powerful empires , and their unbending determination to seek autonomy and freedom . Passing through Philadelphia you might chance upon them - - typical oriental faces , yellow skin , black hair , slanting eyes , high cheekbones . . . .  
In the process of economic development , the government should actively invest more in social welfare , and should , based on the particular circumstances of our country , learn from the experiences of more advanced countries and design a concrete program for the welfare of all the people , so that our citizens can live and work in safety and harmony , and the aged , weak , and handicapped can receive the care they need .  
The prime meaning of the word kan or " stem " is a strong and powerful tree trunk , representing the Yang or male principle ; the word chih or " branch " originally meant a weak and tender twig , thus representing the Yin or female principle .  
" One male patient received a heart from a female donor , and was worried he would turn into a woman , " recalls Dr . Chu with a smile . In fact the patient 's weak heart had arrested his physical development , and after receiving the strong and healthy transplant heart he grew bigger and his whiskers sprouted with new vigor . " The transplant actually made him more masculine ! "  
This Chinese Hamlet is a story of emotional entanglements and moral dilemmas , because Chinese drama is strong on narrative , weak on emotional outpourings , and depends more on beautiful literary language than on philosophical content .  
For most people , if there is only isolated pressure which is neither extreme nor sustained leading to headaches , heart palpitations , stomach disorders or soreness in the muscles , it 's not a serious problem . But if physically one has some inherited weaknesses , past illnesses or a relatively weak capacity to endure pressure , then it is very possible that an illness would be brought on or worsened when he or she is faced with relatively greater pressure or emotional change .  
The economic takeoff is helpful for raising the quality of culture . But from another angle , some people believe that the roots of culture in Taiwan are weak . Sudden wealth at this time is by no means an unmixed blessing . This is especially true with the percolation of a " get rich quick " attitude into the arts , which will do even more to erode the roots of cultural development .  
Exercise : The Stepping Stone to Rehabilitation : Taking sufferers from infantile paralysis as an example , Wu says that if no rehabilitation treatment is administered , lower limbs are too weak to support the body and normal walking is impossible . Excessive joint friction , ineffectual muscles , and numbness are common consequences , resulting in " second-degree disability . " Some cerebral palsy victims sometimes reach the point where their entire bodies need rehabilitative treatment , Wu explains .  
In particular , the influence of applied science on technological development has led to increasing global polarization - - countries with advanced science and technology are becoming increasingly wealthy as they turn out products with high profit margins , leading to greater economic growth and improvements in their quality of life , while countries that are weak in science and technology have had to spend a correspondingly greater amount in exchange for them , leading to sluggish economies and poorer living conditions .  
In the past two years , headlines such as these have been continuously appearing in local newspapers and magazines . Not only have the " weak and brittle " small and medium enterprises been moving in droves to mainland China and Southeast Asia , even the rock-solid transnational corporations are letting out the word that their capital will go elsewhere because of environmental disputes , or the rising costs of land and labor .  
We 're constantly seeing cases of leaders being rejudged in the light of history , finding they may have been strong in ability but were weak in morals , or vice versa . Inter-level communicationQ : In your book you analyzed the main cause for the decline of China through the ages and concluded that it lay in the rift between the upper and middle levels and between the middle and lower ones . Is cross-level interaction and communication really that difficult ?  
Since the 1960s women in Taiwan have been entering the labor market in droves , making a major contribution to the island 's economic miracle . There are equal educational opportunities , greater opportunities in the work place , and an ever more diverse society . . . . These have allowed Taiwanese women to break through the historical Chinese mold for women as weak , dependent and subservient , revealing active , independent and self-motivated women striving for personal achievement .  
The more powerful the backwave , the faster the base will be washed away . Given this vicious cycle , both dikes made of steel reinforced concrete or " breakwaters " made up of huge concrete tetrapods dropped into the ocean off the coast are both are basically weak structures that require continual repair . Dikes must be periodically raised and new concrete tetrapods laid down .  
One of the features of tea is that it can be made stronger or weaker . It has its own striking flavor when strong ; when it is weak , it is more like water , suitable for mixing with various flavorings like jasmine , lemon , pomegranate , or whatever . This special feature combining rich flavors with diverse selection is just the thing for the youthful desire for constant change and novelty .  
Looking in turn at the three major forms of enterprises in the mainland today , state-run enterprises still labor under a heavy burden of weak incentives created by the " iron rice bowl " ; private enterprises are still in their infancy ; and township collective enterprises , which stand between these first two types in terms of scale , are mainly rural , and still lack the capital , information , and trained personnel to pose a direct challenge to Taiwan firms .  
In life Among the Society of Beggars he stated that problems making ends meet combined with unfilial sons and grandchildren or unharmonious family relations forced many of the old and weak to beg . Shih described other beggars who pretended they were old and blind to support the opium habit of their wives .  
He practiced medicine in his " Pochilum Clinic . " In an age of turmoil when China was weak and prey to Western invaders , with one hand he struck at the foreign sowers of intrigue and disorder , and with the other he fought against the corrupt and treacherous elements within China which sprang up to bedevil the country in its hour of difficulty . In the Chinese cinema of the l990s , the heroic figure of Huang Fei-hong bears strong parallels with Bruce Lee , who was the sensation of the film world 20 years ago .  
In the earliest days , mankind 's power to fend off natural dangers was very weak , and people were terrified of the strength and ferocity of the tiger . This fear gave rise to respect , and a certain degree of mystification . The stone carvings and bronzeware of the Shang and Chou dynasties all emphasize the tiger 's sharp claws and fierce countenance . " At the dawn of civilization , this was humankind 's main impression of the tiger , " believes Lin Po-ting , curator of painting and calligraphy at the National Palace Museum .  
Looking at the evolution of " sexual affairs " in dynasties down the ages , a regular pattern emerges : the more prosperous and powerful a dynasty was , the less restrictions it placed on people in sexual matters ; while the more weak and corrupt a dynasty was , the more tightly it controlled people 's lives , and the more severe the constraints it placed on sex .  
For instance , irregular meal times have given him digestion problems ; he has hemorrhoids from long hours in the driver 's seat ; driving with the windows closed and the air conditioning on to keep out the polluted air gives him aching joints ; watching the road and traffic signals all day tires his eyes and makes his vision blurry ; using the clutch constantly in stop-go traffic leaves his left leg painful and weak , and so on .  
The government units charged with protecting species are weak , their funding limited , and their enforcement abilities lacking , and so the lists must put priority on those species facing pressures from hunting and international illegal trade in their parts : " They have the practical need of resolving pressing problems in society first . "  
Animals are spread throughout the island , yet many county and city governments lack any formal wildlife preservation unit , with perhaps only one person responsible for all wildlife protection efforts . Or maybe this work is given to already existing units as a secondary responsibility - - and treated accordingly . Coordination between central and local authorities is weak , and so it was the Council of Agriculture , rather than local officials , that broke the recent Yunlin dolphin meat case .  
The panda , the focus of world attention , may have difficulties getting pregnant and generally weak propagation abilities , and its powers of adaption may have declined and its population aged ; but man , by threatening the bamboo forests and destroying its natural habitat so that it has less space to forage , is even more the cause of its demise . The Formosan landlocked salmon , regarded as a national treasure , lives only in the upper stretches of the Tachia River , where the temperature is low and water quality high .  
In fact the requirements are very broad : people over the age of 65 living on their own - - no matter whether they are weak , lonely , poor or just plain bored - - are all qualified .  
Huang explains that turtle shell 's effects should n't be so narrowly defined . Rather it should be regarded as increasing general vitality , just as developing skills in waidan kung fu can develop one 's qi . And so whether one suffers from a sore back , nagging sore throat , or weak blood and qi ; whether one is male or female , old or young ; there are appropriate prescriptions containing turtle shell that vary according to age and condition .  
Yang Hsien-hung left PTV because of the perpetual delays in starting operation , and he is now serving as the news department manager at Formosa Television , Taiwan 's fourth broadcast TV station , scheduled to begin broadcasting next year . Yang believes that as long as it does not compromise with governmental or commercial forces , PTV news will be quite competitive , because " their rivals are very weak ! "  
" However , I found out he was n't happy , " says Li . " On the one hand , my son strained his brain too much , and he did n't get enough exercise .

" They are an important reminder to Taiwan 's society to open its eyes and see the poor and the weak among us , " says Li Chia-tung , Dean of Providence University and a one-time volunteer in a Calcutta hospice . He feels that people , especially people who live in self-proclaimed wealthy and civilized countries , love beauty and do their best to avoid seeing ugly and painful things . This even includes many who work in the field of religion .  
What one sees is what is left after the violence , circles of shards amid the silence . With Tsong Pu 's exquisite and mature installation technique , the small and large pottery shards arranged in their disordered way create a rhythm between strong and weak and rising and falling that is similar to what is found in poetry .  
For the Rukai , living at the foot of the mountains , land belonged to the tribal chief , who was responsible for looking after the old and weak . But hunting land rights were determined by general agreement . Hunters did not necessarily leave their hunting grounds to their own children , and any child with an instinct for hunting could go into the mountains to learn from an elder huntsman .  
" In 1982 Chien Ssu-liang , who was then president of the Academia Sinica , visited the East Coast of the United States and gathered together a group of us overseas members of the Academia Sinica , " Luke Yuan recalls . " He noted that Taiwan was doing pretty well in terms of applied science-using science to advance industrial and commercial development . But in basic research , especially in fields dependent on scientific experiments , Taiwan was quite weak . He asked us for our opinions and advice . "  
My legs would get weak . I could n't keep stable , and I could n't keep my head up when I went into a low stance . After about a half year of training , though , I did n't have that problem any more . " As his training progressed , he developed a feel for what the classics mean when they talk about remaining " loose and unperturbed . "  
Says Liu , " These names show that society at that time had not yet come to hold the two sexes to such very different standards . " Although they were gradually beginning to use specifically feminine names alluding to a gentle and submissive nature , such traits as a resolute spirit and an agile , tough body were also seen as virtues in a woman . " The notion of the ideal woman being soft and weak was not so universally accepted then as it would later come to be . "  
The biggest weak point of the joint entrance exam is that only people that excel on pen-and-paper examinations come out on top . People with a strong spatial sense , musical talent or athletic prowess are neglected . The movement to replace the joint entrance exam is based on this kind of reasoning .  
However , WTO regulations require that exemptions be declared prior to application for entry . Given Taiwan 's current weak diplomatic position , unless the PRC agrees to the exemption , it will be difficult for Taiwan to get the required support of two-thirds of the 137 WTO member states for this escape clause . In sum , Kinmen people remain optimistic that the arguments in favor of the little three links will win out .  
With regard to foreign aid , he said that helping diplomatic partners is Taiwan 's right and also its duty . Though these countries are not rich or powerful , " you ca n't measure everything by the same yardstick . " Though the economies of some diplomatic partners are too weak , and their democracies are immature , Taiwan must be willing to share its experience , in which economic takeoff spurred political democratization , and work together with diplomatic partner states to " stand up and move on out . "  
In Taiwan , there is no integration among the academic disciplines of zoology , botany , marine life , climate , soil conservation , and the like . Environmental protection agencies are weak , and research funding is limited . Thus there is little concrete knowledge about the numbers of various species and whether these numbers are rising or falling , not to mention any understanding of what concrete steps can be taken to solve specific problems .  
Twenty years ago theorists proposed that the magnetic field extended down below the sun 's surface to a depth of 0.7 solar radii from the center of the sun surface , but signals from the magnetic field are very weak , and could not be detected by the methods and instruments then available . But today acoustic imaging has enabled Chou Dean-yi to find much stronger evidence in support of the 20-year-old theory , and this is highly significant for solar astronomy .  
One figure in the business privately complains , " The government has always coddled Taiwan 's banks under the rubric of ' maintaining financial stability , ' and the banks have gotten used to it . You ca n't ask them to get lean and mean overnight . " The financial sector serves as the circulatory system feeding economic development . Taiwan has a powerful manufacturing sector , but a weak financial sector , which has always been a drag on overall national development .  
Regarding the international emphasis on " global " culture , Soyinka pointed out that the TIBE was featuring ancient Chinese culture , Czech culture , his own traditional Yoruba culture , as well as authors of Caribbean and American backgrounds , all exhibiting at the same time . This reveals that Taiwan is not a country that is culturally weak . In contrast to the strong centralizing trend of globalization , the TIBE assumed the appearance of an " anti-globalization " book exhibition , which felt marvelous .  
Professor Lin Wan-i of National Taiwan University 's Social Work Department points out that a third of all foreign brides under the age of 20 tend to be physically , emotionally and socially immature . They are on average three to five years behind their Taiwan counterparts educationally . Not only is their own competitive advantage low , it adversely affects the rearing of their children and creates the problem of continued weak competitiveness for the next generation .  
In it he compared Taiwan to a sick patient : " During its youth in the Zheng Chenggong era , the patient was nimble and healthy , of noble character and excellent behavior . But since the Qing Dynasty it has been infected by toxic policy , becoming physically weak and lacking in willpower , and is now ' a retarded child ' among world cultures . "  
The Taiwan Minpao carried many excerpts from the notebooks that Chiang kept in prison . From them we can see that he not only made friends with gangsters , but was quite interested in the culture and language of their world , and planned to produce a dictionary of gangster lingo after coming out of prison . At the same time , he was deeply pained by the way the gangsters wasted their courage on fighting against their guards , frequently being injured and growing weak and dispirited as a result .  
The traditional style of face painting that Tsai Lien passed down at Juyi Tsengshoutang involves evenly spreading a base color across the actor 's face and waiting for it to dry before getting on with the main painting work , which is highlighting the characteristics of the individual characters . This tradition of first applying a base and then applying the facial lines promotes speed and convenience . Its weak point is that the colors easily run .

With small national markets , a weak human resource base , inadequate physical and institutional infrastructures and narrow production structures , the majority of African countries do not meet the requirements to be dynamic economic entities . 
Poverty eradication and social and economic policies for standards of living must be based on a recognition of the human dignity of the poor , the weak and the humble .  
The pious promises of the developed world to allocate a minuscule percentage of national income to the provision of aid for the developing world have shrunk to non-fulfilment ; the thought of the strong economies helping the weak has shrivelled like a raisin in the sun .  
At this crucial juncture in human history we are compelled by social and economic imperatives , characterized by growing poverty and marginalization of the powerless and the weak , to choose a course of action that will empower the citizens of the world to develop their full potential in order to enable them to secure their basic needs and improve their livelihood .  
This relates , above all , to attacking on a priority basis the structural factors hindering its development , namely : inadequate infrastructure ; weak institutions ; poor use of human resources ; high vulnerability to natural and climatic disasters ; unfavourable fluctuations in the terms of trade ; the enormous debt burden ; unchecked population growth ; and environmental degradation .  
However , in an increasingly competitive world economy , in which the weak position of African countries is tantamount to marginalization , there is an urgent need to re-examine the importance of cooperation and focus more on those critical facets of Africa 's development in the context of the present and future political and social and economic environment of the continent .  
Indeed , since 1990 official development assistance for Africa has continued to decline , and direct foreign investment remains weak in a very difficult international situation characterized by fierce trade competition , which the Uruguay Round agreements have made even more onerous for the African countries . 
P �� ez-Otermin ( Uruguay ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : For the past 50 years , the First Committee has been the most important multilateral forum in areas related to international peace and security , a forum to which each and every one of the members of the international community be they rich or poor , weak or strong contributes with the overwhelming sense of being equal under the Charter .  
African countries , in particular , required more imaginative long-term solutions to overcome their competitive disadvantage deriving from dependency on primary exports , a weak industrial and export base and technological backwardness .  
The Workshops noted that the dissemination of census results had been weak and that national statistical offices had failed to give the issue sufficient attention , had not been adequate in terms of their awareness of users ' requirements , or had continued to use only traditional methods in situations where newer technology could have been effective .  
The most important symptoms reflecting insufficient capacity include the slow pace of policy and institutional reform ; weak intersectoral coordination ; the non-adoption of forestry programmes as priorities at the highest political levels ; the lack of clearly defined priorities ; and a continuing over-reliance on external technical assistance .  
Among the African countries in the franc zone , it has experienced the longest period of political instability - nearly 30 years of recurrent civil wars and border conflicts - thus its socio-economic infrastructure is rudimentary and concentrated in the capital ; the administrative capacity is very weak , and the private sector has little structure and is dominated by informal and black market activities .

In many Latin American countries , the paradox of overabundant legislation and overemphasized democracy contrasting with the fragmentation of society , deep economic inequalities and the low level of political participation suggests that the ruling \ x { 5e68 } ite is attempting to overcome the weak integration of society by developing the legal framework of a democratic state of law addressing the whole people .  
In most developing countries , the process of technological capability-building might be hampered by , inter alia , declining rates of investment , misallocation of resources , external imbalances , lack of diverse and sophisticated skills , weak linkages between domestic research and development institutes and enterprises as well as unfavourable external factors .  
NULLWhile one reason the abuses , human rights violations or crimes allegedly committed by military commissioners and members of CVDCs , whether for political or general reasons , continue is that the people are afraid to say anything , the main reason they continue is that , in much of Guatemala the institutions responsible for maintaining public order and administering justice either do not exist or are very weak . 
The tendency for the Bretton Woods institutions to become increasingly involved in direct economic management in the developing countries , instead of playing a role of global governance was cause for great concern , particularly since they were often incapable of redressing the imbalances in world monetary and financial markets , which usually operated against weak economies .  
The Committee identified as major factors and difficulties in implementing the Convention : the weak State machinery to effectively maintain the peace process ; the difficult process of national reconciliation ; the breakdown of public infrastructure and private support systems ; the large number of Rwandan refugees and internally displaced persons ; the great number of militias and some civilians who are still armed ; and the shattered economy and extreme poverty .  
We must face up to terrorism and muster the national will to work collectively on a global level to stamp out the root causes of this plague which afflicts both the weak and the strong , the poor and the rich , for , in the final analysis , terrorism is not susceptible to reason ; it stems from bigotry , traumatizes the innocent , resorts to violence and seeks no dialogue .  
There is no doubt that the more representative the United Nations is , the more democratic it will be ; and that the more accountable the United Nations is , the more effective it will be , thus benefitting us all , small or large , weak or powerful , rich or poor .  
Our collective reflection clearly revealed that , without the United Nations , the world would only have been more violent , more unstable and insecure , more unjust and cruel especially to the weak , who are prey to power politics and arbitrary decisions .  
Since 1991 , official development assistance for Africa has been shrinking , and direct foreign investments remain weak in a very difficult international context that is marked by a fierce commercial competition that the Uruguay agreements have made even more onerous for the African countries .

A forest inventory report prepared by FAO shows that in most developing countries the existing institutional capacity is either inadequate or too weak to collect and update basic information on the area and type of forests , species composition , existing growing stock and volume of harvest .  
There is ample evidence that a weak bureaucracy , coupled with an ineffective judicial system , tends to generate an inefficient implementation of the formal institutional structure .  
Most of them continued progressing towards macroeconomic stability with growth , but with notable weak spots , and in many cases their growth was not sufficient to reduce the social deficits accumulated in earlier years .  
Environmental conditions deteriorated further in many areas in the ESCWA region in 1995 .  The causes of environmental degradation included rapid population growth , inappropriate economic and social policies , weak regulatory and administrative systems , and insufficient public awareness .  
Strengthened by a five-year mandate , the new Government has moved quickly to address the fundamental problems impeding development , such as weak governmental institutions , economic inefficiency and corruption , and has laid out economic policies which seek to stimulate growth and reduce inflation by encouraging domestic investment and job-creating programmes .  
The focus of the subprogramme is to maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , in particular the least developed as well as certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , including those countries which are commodity-dependent , into the international trading system .  
Notwithstanding the above , the Government 's compliance with the commitment to supporting and strengthening institutions for the protection of human rights is still highly inadequate , as shown by the absence or weak presence of such institutions in wide areas of the country and the fact that the bodies responsible for implementing this commitment lack a comprehensive policy in criminal matters .  
At the ninth session of the Conference , member States decided that the main role of UNCTAD in the field of trade in goods and services should be to help maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , particularly the least developed countries and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , into the international trading system so as to promote their development .  
Much of sub-Saharan Africa suffers from severe shortages of technical , managerial and entrepreneurial skills , acute infrastructure bottlenecks , weak institutional capabilities , severe limitations in the capacity to import , and continued dependence on exports of a few primary commodities .  
In the least developed countries and in a number of African countries where the private sector was weak , the public sector should play an active role in establishing the basic essential infrastructure , and international cooperation should focus on countries and sectors where the lack of such infrastructure was most acute .  
The focus of the subprogramme is to maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , in particular the least developed and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , including those countries which are commodity-dependent , into the international trading system .

Non-democratic States over time tend to generate conditions inimical to development : politicized military rule ; a weak middle class ; a population constrained to silence ; prohibitions on travel ; censorship ; restrictions on the practice of religion or imposition of religious obligations ; and pervasive and often institutionalized corruption .  
In situations where the constraints on domestic resources are most severe , owing to weak economic performance , inadequate infrastructure , and the shortage of trained personnel , it is expected that most of the needed resources will be supplied through external population assistance .  
In contrast , if there is a low level of cooperation in the establishment of the rules of the game , and if competitive forces are weak , then national governments may be more likely to adopt a relatively passive stance , which is characteristic of the Cargo Cult scenario .  
In situations where the constraints on domestic resources are most severe owing to weak economic performance , inadequate infrastructure and the shortage of trained personnel , it is expected that most of the needed resources will be supplied through external population assistance .

Given the tremendous scale and severity of the violations of human rights and humanitarian law that were perpetrated during the traumatic days of the Rwandan civil war in 1994 - a time which saw the brutal carrying out of one of this century 's worst genocides - and the weak response of the international community at this critical time in Rwanda 's history , the Government is to be commended for its cooperation with the members of the international community active in human rights matters in Rwanda .  
The main constraints to increasing agricultural production and raising productivity included the low priority accorded to the sector , poor physical infrastructure , limited utilization of advanced technologies , inadequate access to credit and appropriate technologies for small-scale farmers and the weak linkages between research institutions and farmers .

Recurrent drought in the southern Africa region this decade , the weak economic base of the country , which is almost exclusively agricultural , a rather unbalanced social infrastructure , which is partly due to the low literacy rate inherited from the previous regime , and the problem of disease , including HIV / AIDS , pose a serious threat to our nascent democracy .  
We feel that the United Nations system should be made stronger , more effective and more efficient in order to meet the priorities set by all its Members not just the priorities of the economically strong and the militarily powerful but , especially , the priorities of the weak and vulnerable States , which should be prevented from becoming outsiders in the global economy .  
Consumption will stay relatively weak , reflecting sluggish personal income growth and growing household debt , which increased from 65 per cent of personal disposable income in 1991 to almost 95 per cent in 1996 ; but the weakest component of demand will remain government spending owing to the continuation of fiscal austerity at all levels of government .  
Its cultural and linguistic ties with both the United States and Europe , its geographical proximity to the United States mainland and its weak institutional structures contribute to the continued use of the Caribbean subregion as a major transit point in international drug trafficking .  
Even in some low-income countries that are pursuing sound policies , their low level of development - characterized by structural rigidities , weak institutions and administration , poorly functioning markets and deficiencies in skills and infrastructure - have prevented a rapid and strong response to reform efforts , which may delay the provision of relief under the initiative . 
In developing countries with a weak industrial base , a rapid and sustained rise in the levels of income depends on increasing investment , which has a very high import content .  
In the light of mutual suspicions and the weak administrative , social and economic environment , the implementation of the peace agreement was a complex and fragile process , which required a continuous commitment on the part of the signatories and the extensive support of the international community .

A recent study1 has stressed that a current account deficit of more than 5 per cent is likely to become a problem only when a range of conditions apply : when the export sector is small , debt service is large , domestic savings are low , and the financial sector is weak and dominated by banks subject to weak regulation .  
The crises of the past year or so in Albania and Bulgaria have highlighted the issues in a dramatic fashion , but many of the constituent elements of the problems in those countries - low quality of banks ' asset portfolios , " cosy relationships " between banks , state-owned enterprises and ministries , weak or non-existent regulation , and a widespread , popular mistrust of the banking system - are present in varying degrees elsewhere in eastern Europe and in the CIS .  
In many ways the performance of the Canadian economy last year was closer to that of western Europe than that of the United States : annual growth averaged some 1.5 per cent , rather less than in 1995 ; relatively weak labour markets and increased taxes held back the growth of personal disposable income , although consumption picked up to a large extent because of a steep fall in the savings ratio ; and business fixed investment is also more concerned with rationalization than expanding capacities .  
Many developing countries , particularly the low-income and least developed ones , are weak in designing policy packages that would enable them to use international trade as an effective tool of sustained economic growth and sustainable development .  
In many cases , those responsible for violations of economic , social and cultural rights and of the collective rights with an economic content such as the right to development or the right to a healthy environment , are sometimes international entities applying policies which constitute veritable sources of large-scale and serious violations of collective and individual rights in the countries with weak economies .  
For many developing countries , in particular LDCs and other structurally weak and vulnerable economies , supply-side constraints continue to limit their capabilities to take full advantage of new trading opportunities , become more attractive locations for foreign investment and integrate themselves into regional and global production networks of transnational enterprises .  
Major impediments on the supply side are production and export structures that concentrate on only a few products , poor endowment with financial and human capital , weak technological capacity , inadequate legal and regulatory frameworks , and bottlenecks in physical infrastructure . 
The ability of the domestic industries of weak economies to respond to competition is impeded by inefficiencies which are due to inappropriate technology , obsolete equipment , inadequate infrastructure and support services , and previously excessive levels of protection .  Although in due course import liberalization will have dynamic positive effects on growth and employment , in the short run there is a risk of the failure of inefficient domestic firms , with the attendant social costs if workers lose their jobs and can not shift immediately to produce static efficiency gains from more productive employment elsewhere .  
We want it to be a strong , principled and effective body , the common inheritance of all mankind , not the preserve of a few wealthy and powerful States , but the guardian of all , especially the poor , the weak and the defenceless . 
It must be prevented through legal means established by the international community , which will reinvigorate the weak and sometimes absent State institutions and give meaning to the revitalizing commitment of their essential participants .  
Institutional constraints normally linked to weak capital markets and inadequate regulations should be addressed in order to strengthen the confidence of investors , both domestic and foreign , and decrease the volatility of financial flows .

The remark was also made that the topic of diplomatic protection involved a series of complicated theoretical and practical questions and had an unfortunate history , having been regarded as an extension of colonial power or a system imposed by powerful States on weak States .  
The access to rights , be they civil and political or economic , social and cultural , by the poor , the excluded and the marginalized has never been easy , with Governments , in the developed and developing world alike , often preferring to respond to the pressures of the more powerful and articulate groups in society rather than to protect the rights of the generally silent and politically weak poor .  
In some developing countries , a combination of weak or nonexistent policies on the one hand and the efforts of private firms on the other has already stimulated a shift from food production for subsistence for local communities to large-scale production of few crops and varieties for national and international markets , resulting in a loss of diversity .  
The UNCTAD regular programme of technical cooperation will be coordinated to ensure an appropriate balance among developing regions with priority assigned to the specific needs of the least developed countries and other countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies . 
The study found that while weak financial infrastructure , financial liberalization and speculation were to blame for the crisis , if reliable accounting information had been available , excessive financial exposure would have been detected earlier , permitting corrective action to be taken , and thus possibly diminishing the magnitude of the crisis .  
Instead of improving on the relatively weak performance in 1997 , gross domestic product ( GDP ) in Eastern Europe rose on average by just 2 per cent , less than half the rate implied by the official forecasts and nearly a percentage point lower than in 1997 ( see table 2 ) .  
As the fallout from the initial financial crisis in Thailand enters its third year , weak international trade and the negligible improvement in private financial inflows mean that most developing and transition economies continue to face a tight external payments constraint .  
Considers intolerable that more than 800-million people , especially women and children , throughout the world , and particularly in developing countries , do not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs , which infringes their fundamental human rights and at the same time can generate additional pressures upon the environment in ecologically weak areas ;  
The gruesome fact is that the past 70 _ odd days of indiscriminate bombing on a small and weak country have wounded and killed thousands of civilians and seriously damaged the national economy and living conditions in Yugoslavia .  
The lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with conditions of inadequate infrastructure , imbalance of trade , inefficient transport organization , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems , poses serious constraints on the trade and economic development of landlocked developing countries .  
Measures to deal with the transit problems of such countries have to address a broad range of factors , such as inadequate infrastructure , imbalance of trade , inefficient transport organization , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
Being a developing country with a vast territory , a varied topography , a large population and a weak economic foundation , China is confronted with a tremendous challenge of modernization and construction , and space technology , as one of the most sophisticated technologies in the contemporary world , is not only a representation of the overall national strength , but also an important means to transcend the phase of traditional development and accelerate economic and social development .  
The experience of developing countries during the past several years has also demonstrated that financial crises are contagious ; that is , once difficulties emerge , markets do not adequately discriminate between countries with strong and weak fundamentals , or between those with strong and weak economic structures and macroeconomic management . 
Resulting exchange rate appreciation and abrupt compensatory movements in fiscal and monetary policies that accentuate the cyclical movements of foreign capital can entail high development costs , especially if domestic financial systems are weak and not well regulated and supervised .

The weakening of economic performance in the past two years due to , inter alia , unfavourable climatic conditions and weak commodity prices , together with a more challenging global economic environment , suggest that the recent economic performance of the least developed countries might be difficult to sustain without further diversification of their economies so as to reduce their vulnerability to exogenous shocks .  
The precarious socio-economic situation in the least developed countries and the structural weaknesses inherent in their economies continue unabated and relegated these countries to a weak competitive position in the current global economic setting .

The precarious socio-economic situation of LDCs , the structural weaknesses inherent in their economies and the adverse external environment they faced relegated those countries to a weak competitive position .  
A broad range of non-physical obstacles such as poor utilization of assets , weak and inefficient transport management , cumbersome and incompatible procedures , outmoded financial , regulatory and institutional systems , trade imbalances and inadequate security , often accompanied by very high user charges ;  
The inherent burdens of a weak banking and financial system , insignificant foreign investment , unfavourable market conditions and inefficient State enterprises , coupled with a lack of free - market traditions and experience , have compounded the reform challenge .  
In addition , the enormous force of globalization , driven by the advancement of science and technology , instead of serving to unify humankind in a determined and conscious assault against the persistent and systemic problems of our time , is continuously being used to press the advantage of the strong over the weak , and is thereby widening the gap between the developed and the developing worlds .  
In Europe the only military bloc left over from the cold war , under its new strategic concept , bypassed the United Nations Security Council and bombed , with the worlds most powerful and sophisticated military machinery , a weak sovereign State , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , turning the Balkan region , which has experienced so much misery in this century , into a testing ground for its new strategy .  
Where backward linkages between tourism and other sectors of the economy are weak or absent , income and employment multipliers from tourism are lower because the potential stimulus to indirect spending is dissipated by increased imports rather than domestic production , as happens with many small island developing States .  
The participation of developing countries - in particular the least developed countries , and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies - and countries with economies in transition , and in particular of their enterprise sectors , in electronic commerce will be an essential ingredient for growth and wealth creation at the global level .

As such , the ambitions of his own country and others for the creation of an effective and transparent international criminal system in which it was not simply a case of the strong accusing the weak had been disappointed .  
An open , rulebased , equitable , secure , nondiscriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system that accorded preferential treatment to the weak and vulnerable would be vital to that end .  
Either by promoting weak decisions , watered down by the need to find a compromise acceptable to the permanent members , or by imposing immobility on the Security Council , the hidden veto can often be more negative than the expressed veto .

Thus it is very natural for the Chinese people bullied and humiliated by superpowers from Western countries and domestic reactionary forces over the past 100-plus years ? to look forward to the socialist ideal - expect their country to be prosperous , rich and strong , but without the phenomena of a huge gap between the rich and the poor and the weak being bullied by the strong .  
they display the quintessence of the party 's glorious deeds and record the brilliant journey that , over the last 80 years , our party has traveled - - how our party has developed from a small party to a big one , from a weak party to a strong one , and how it has applied itself to struggling for national independence and liberation of the Chinese nation ;  
For example , insofar as fighting opportunities are concerned , a belligerent will have to strike at the enemy at its weak points , with unusual tactics , at a time , in a zone , and in a way detrimental to the enemy , thereby rendering it impossible for the enemy to concentrate its " capability " within a short period of time .  
From 1994 to 2000 , all localities throughout the country sent more than 3-million organizational cadres group by group to townships and villages to help them carry out rectification work .  Some 356,000 weak , listless , and paralytic village party branches , backward villages , and poverty-stricken village party branches were rectified , accounting for 48.8 percent of the total number of rural party branches ;  
The fact that radar antenna occupies huge space , radar includes many parts , and radar equipment has limited functions will bring problems to the task of mobilization and transfer .  In order to overcome the problems , the unit has organized a small group for technological innovation , and fully applied more than 20 innovation achievements to this model of radar .  As a result , the unit has resolved such problems as below-standard transmitting power of the radar launcher and weak signals received by the receiver .  
The party needs to realize the most extensive great unity with all allied forces not only when the party is weak but also when the party has grown stronger , not only when the party is fighting to seize the political power but also when the party is holding the ruling status , not only when the party is carrying out revolution but also when the party is engaged in construction and reforms .  
Under the guidance of these scientific theories and under the correct leadership of the three generations of leadership groups respectively with Comrades Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin as the core , our Party has put an end to times when our country was as loose and split as a plate of sand , poor , weak and carved up at the whim of foreign countries .  
Why has our Party been able to have become eminent among various political forces in modern Chinese society , turned from small to big and from weak to strong , developed from only more than 50 people at the very beginning to the biggest ruling party in the world with more than 64-million Party members , and achieved these brilliant achievements ? 
In the first 80-year period , the feudal rulers surrendered the country 's sovereign rights under humiliating terms , the whole society was thrown into utter chaos caused by wars , the country became impoverished and weak and the people lived in hunger and cold .  
We have actively advocated and safeguarded the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , and resolutely opposed hegemonism and power politics with the strong domineering over the weak .  We have upheld principle and justice , striving to let justice prevail and safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of the vast developing countries , and pushed the establishment of a just and reasonable new international political and economic order .  
Over the 80 years under the correct leadership of the three generations of leading collectives headed by Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin , the CPC has grown from small to large and from weak to strong .  It led the Chinese people to advance wave upon wave , wage tenacious struggles , found the new China , establish the socialist system , explore ways to building socialism with Chinese characteristics , and write a magnificent chapter in the historical development of the Chinese nation .  
To promote productive forces under the national condition that ours is a big and populous country with scarce farmland and a weak economic foundation , we must keep strict control over population growth , and must work hard to improve the population quality .  
In his speech at the forum , Wu Bangguo said : We should conscientiously study the new situations and new problems arising from the conditions of the socialist market economy , effectively strengthen the supervision and control of the market , particularly crack down on fake and shoddy products bearing on the vital interests of the people and endangering their lives and health , and do a good job in solving problems , such as being slack in crackdown , replacing imprisonment for criminal offenses with lighter punishment , and weak links .  
11 .  The two sides reiterate that all countries - - be they large or small , strong or weak , poor or rich - - have the right to decide their own fates , have the right to choose their political , economic , and social development courses in accordance with their national conditions , and have an equal right in participating in the discussion and settlement of world affairs .  
We should try to find out the real situation , analyze current developments , pay close attention to both the key areas and the weak links of our work , lay stress on the work at the township and town level , and work out measures to ensure a sound fulfillment of responsibilities .  
An informed person in Beijing said that because of weak foreign demand , the State Council has decided to continue the policy of expanding domestic demand in the second half of the year .  The Ministry of Finance will apply to the National People 's Congress next month for an additional issue of 50-billion yuan of constructive treasury bonds , and plans to distribute them to commercial banks in late October after the approval .  
In the 80 years since its founding , the CPC has grown from a small and weak force to a big and strong one .  It has defeated formidable enemies in extremely difficult conditions and kept forging ahead in a tortuous course of exploration , accumulating very rich experiences .  
A country divided and ravaged by incessant war , corruption in politics , and economic backwardness - - this is the image a chronically poor and weak China projected in the 1930s ; this is also an important reason why Japanese militarists dared to launch a war of aggression against China in a flagrant manner .  
Under the CPC 's leadership , the Chinese people , driven by a deep hatred of the common enemy , fought a bloody war in an indomitable spirit and performed a miracle in which a weak country under semi-colonial rule defeated a strong imperialist country .  As a result , a century-old disgrace was wiped out .  
In the first 80-year period , the feudal lords surrendered the country 's sovereign rights under humiliating terms , the whole society was thrown into utter chaos caused by wars , the country became impoverished and weak and the people lived in hunger and cold .  
It is said that during the amphibious landing joint military exercise on Dongshan Island , the Chinese Communist once more used large commercial vessels to ship supporting firepower cannons and rockets .  The purpose is nothing more than making up for the severe shortage of conventional amphibious landing vessels .  But this action will only be feasible under the condition of possessing superior naval and air forces .  These vessels are big and weak targets , but not a miraculous cure as they appear to be .  
This is because the natural conditions in some areas are abominable , the distance between cities in the region is very long , and that between the western cities and the eastern developed areas is even longer , and the infrastructure , economic foundation , and social and human conditions are relatively weak .  The development of the western region needs a huge amount of input , but the return rate of some input items is low in the short time .  
In a modern war where the use of force sees no bounds , the weak are still nations outside of the West , because the Western nations so far are in control of the initiative for technological and scientific advancements and the resulting military advantages .  In a war where the two opposite sides have no rules but make massacre their ultimate goal , the victor will still be the side with technology and material superiority .

To be sure , we are fully aware that China is a developing country with over 1.2 billion inhabitants , a weak economic base , a low per-capita output value , and imbalance between its different parts in their economic development standards .  Therefore , we have put forth an important strategy to promote the development of west China .  
Countries , large or small , rich or poor , and strong or weak , all have their equal right to actively participate in international economic organizations and join the common effort to formulate various rules of the game governing " liberalization " in all areas , in an endeavor to establish a fair and just new global economic order in the 21st century .  
Third , the legal system for urban and rural planning is unsound and the plans drawn up are lacking in authority .  Some leading cadres have a weak legal concept .  They make decisions as they please and do not act according to plan .  
Regarding the issue of economic globalization , Chairman Li Peng emphasized that the economic globalization has brought about new opportunities of economic development for all countries in the world .  Nevertheless , as the disparity between the rich and the poor in the world has been widening and the contradictions between the South and the North have become more outstanding , those developing countries which are in a weak position are confronting bigger risks and challenges .  
Personages from economic circles here also noticed that despite the important progress in the turnaround of state enterprises , underlying contradictions accumulated for many years among state enterprises have not been resolved .  The foundation for the turnaround of state enterprises is relatively weak .  While economic efficiency has been recovered , the achievements attained in the turnaround of state enterprises remain to be further consolidated .  
While the economy has taken a key turn and the stock market is skyrocketing , we also need to clearly recognize that deflation remains the key limiting factor to a macroeconomic rebound , with our inherent economic growth grounds remaining quite weak .  
Another weak point of the Taiwan military is that it purchases weapons from a variety of countries ; their quality , performance , and operating regulations differ , with the result that it is very difficult to form the weapon systems into a complete perfect set , and this has a direct impact on taking advantage of their combat capability .  
Social conditions are complex here , the grassroots organizations are weak , the rural propaganda , ideological , and cultural position has not been built effectively , the work style of certain grassroots cadres is rather simple and crude , cadre-masses relations are relatively tense , and rural development and stability have been affected to some extent .  
So long as we seize the opportune time to implement the spirit of the central ideological and political work conference , seriously sum up our successful experience of the preceding stage , and earnestly overcome the weak links in our work , we will certainly be able raise the " double thinking " educational activities to a higher level .  
The Taiwan public believes that " diplomatic relations " established on " money " are like " fair weather friends , " and will not last long .  Moreover , the " financial aid " countries are all weak and backward countries , and are of absolutely no use .  
Countries , whether they are great or small , rich or poor , strong or weak , are all equal members in the international community , should follow the purposes of the " UN Charter " and other norms governing international relations , should mutually respect sovereignty and territorial integrity , should practice non-aggression , should not interfere in each other internal affairs , and should thoroughly discard the Cold War mentality .  
We also clearly realize that China is a developing country with a population of 1.2 billion , its economic foundation is weak , and its regional development is uneven .  For China to become strong and rich , long and unremitting efforts are still needed .  
To Effectively control the population scale is conducive to relaxing the pressure of the population on the weak ecological environment and the economic and social development , to improving the population quality and structure , and to increasing manpower and capital of the western region .  It is necessary to strengthen consciousness and the sense of urgency of correctly handling the relationship between development and population control .  
It should be soberly noted , however , that ours is a developing country with a population of 1.2 billion , a weak economic foundation , and uneven regional economic development , that our per capita output value is not high , and that the gap between our country and developed countries remains very wide .  
Checked by the definition of the US ' China strategy and the choice of policies , the younger Bush deliberately adopted an uncompromising attitude toward numerous issues concerning China while Gore was unwilling to leave an impression of being weak .  Although the two men 's specific views on China are not completely the same , it is difficult for people to find any substantial differences in their views on China .  
Zeng : Since reform and opening up , tremendous achievements have been scored in the economic and social development in the western region , but quite a few problems still exist , which are primarily manifested in the weak infrastructure facilities , inadequate irrigation works , few highway and railway networks , backward power grid construction , and low telephone popularization rate . 
Bush will certainly feel uneasy sitting in the Oval Office because he lost the popular vote to Gore by 500,000 votes , fought a 36-day battle over vote recounts , emerged from more than 40 fierce lawsuits by way of a US Supreme Court " ruling , " and endured continual derision , jabs , and " knocks " from Democrats and the media even before taking office .  Moreover , signs of a weak administration are appearing in numerous places .  
The French evil cults are also strongly fraudulent in nature , for they often recruit followers from among unemployed or frustrated people , by rescuing the small or saving the weak , by assisting the lonely or helping the handicapped , and by pumping funds into bankrupt companies as well .  
( 3 ) Compared with his economic achievements , Clinton was weak and inept in diplomatic strategy .  Since it is very difficult for Bush to demonstrate his economic aptitude within a short period of time , he has to use underhand method to score some points first in foreign affairs .  
The direct cause of the inability to reduce farmers ' burden is that township financial budgets have to support too great a population , have to meet goals and upgrade in various activities , and complete " cosmetic projects " which can not be halted despite repeated attempts to do so .  This leaves townships with weak financial budgets and a heavy debt load .  
All social circles should greatly promote and carry forward the fine moral and conduct of helping the weak and disabled , giving relief to those in danger and in difficulty , and respecting the old and cherishing the young , thus making greater contributions to the comprehensive economic and social progress in our country in the 10th Five-Year Plan .  
Kim Tae-chung maintained that the DPRK Government 's commitment to improve relations with the United States and the ROK is based on sincerity and is a " strategic choice " made through careful and deep consideration .  But , he added , the relaxed situation in the Korean Peninsula is very weak , just like a fleeting opportunity .  
All Hong Kong assets have been devalued and shrunk to a large extent within a few months .  In the first quarter of this year , a negative economic growth at 2 per cent of GDP was recorded .  The rising unemployment rate at the end of May , the continually weak economy in Japan and the drastic devaluation of the Yen have added more uncertainties to the already bleak economic outlook for Hong Kong .  
Volatile capital flows and defects in the international financial architecture have been an important component of the crisis , but it is clear enough from the summary I have given that many of the problems are closer to home and institutional in nature : lending excesses , poor risk management , political interference , weak supervision , lack of transparency , and so on .  
With exports of services rising on the back of improved regional demand but imports of services still falling amidst a weak local demand , the invisible trade surplus surged to $ 80.7 billion in 1999 , from $ 66.7 billion in 1998 .  
Members considered a number of options for HKMA operations on the strong side , ranging from the current generally passive approach to an explicit two-way convertibility undertaking at the limits of a narrow band , either centred on 7.80 or bounded on the weak side at 7.80 .  
For the purpose of comparison , the paper focused in particular on the recent financial crisis in Argentina , which , like Hong Kong , operated a currency board system .  The paper noted that the crisis in Argentina was induced more by public finance problems ( such as extensive external debt and a weak fiscal position ) than by any weakness in the monetary system .  
Trading activity was weak in the first quarter , dampened by concern over deterioration in the external economic environment , sharp correction in the local stock market , and an ample supply of new flats coming on stream .  
Mr Leung said : " The global financial system remains under stress , given large external deficit of the US , extended deflation and weak banking system in Japan , significant correction in major equity markets , more volatility and misalignments in exchange rates , and problems in key emerging markets like Argentina and Turkey . "  
A weak cold front arrived at the south China coastal areas on October 4 .  The weather in Hong Kong turned hazy at first and became cloudy with thundery showers in the afternoon .  Around 80 millimetres of rainfall were recorded over parts of the Lantau Island .  
The spokesman pointed out that major faults found on most motor-driven bicycles and skateboards included weak and misaligned vehicle frames , weak steering handle bar and seating frame , insufficient and unreliable braking system , inadequate lightings and reflectors , lacking essential equipment such as rear view mirror and speedometer .  
Landslides are mainly caused by steep slopes or hillsides , weak weathered rock and rise of groundwater .  Furthermore , some human activities such as unauthorised cultivation , unprotected excavation also cause destruction to the slope surfaces .  As a result , rain water can infiltrate into the slope and soak the soil inside .  The slope then becomes unstable and landslides may easily occur .  
A satisfactory resolution of a situation is dependent upon close co-operation among team members .  In a large-scale or drawn-out negotiation , every team member - the negotiator , the strategist and the requirement officer - contributes equally to a successful negotiation . "  Mr Lau said : " The key to negotiation is to allow the subject persons to unburden themselves and freely express their own feelings .  During the talk , negotiators can then detect the ' weak points ' at the bottom of their hearts and talk them out of the attempt . "  
The strong current account surplus reflected both an improvement in competitiveness , resulting from the depreciation of the real effective exchange rate , and weak domestic demand .  
Though the advent of free markets is supposed to have brought improvements in amounts of goods for sale and improved service , the shabby stalls , aged vendors and lack of variety in commodities gave mute evidence of weak purchasing power , low consumption standards , and general poverty .  
The Republic of China has already passed the stage where its comparative advantage lies in a cheap labor supply , " says Wu Hui-lin of the Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research . " We 've moved into a period where technologically advanced and capital-intensive industries are more important . For mainland China in the short term to compete with us in the area of heavy industry would just be matching their weak point against our strongest . "  
Unless we further accelerate the training of technical personnel , it will be difficult for us to join the ranks of the industrialized nations . 4 ) Sluggish renovation of technology by private enterprise . The most fundamental reason why the nation 's industrial structure is weak and its speed of adjustment is slow is that the level of creativity in products and production processes is inadequate and technological renovation by private enterprise is sluggish .  
What stands out in this history of blood and tears is their pitiful quandary as a weak people caught between powerful empires , and their unbending determination to seek autonomy and freedom . Passing through Philadelphia you might chance upon them - - typical oriental faces , yellow skin , black hair , slanting eyes , high cheekbones . . . .  
In the process of economic development , the government should actively invest more in social welfare , and should , based on the particular circumstances of our country , learn from the experiences of more advanced countries and design a concrete program for the welfare of all the people , so that our citizens can live and work in safety and harmony , and the aged , weak , and handicapped can receive the care they need .  
The prime meaning of the word kan or " stem " is a strong and powerful tree trunk , representing the Yang or male principle ; the word chih or " branch " originally meant a weak and tender twig , thus representing the Yin or female principle .  
" One male patient received a heart from a female donor , and was worried he would turn into a woman , " recalls Dr . Chu with a smile . In fact the patient 's weak heart had arrested his physical development , and after receiving the strong and healthy transplant heart he grew bigger and his whiskers sprouted with new vigor . " The transplant actually made him more masculine ! "  
This Chinese Hamlet is a story of emotional entanglements and moral dilemmas , because Chinese drama is strong on narrative , weak on emotional outpourings , and depends more on beautiful literary language than on philosophical content .  
For most people , if there is only isolated pressure which is neither extreme nor sustained leading to headaches , heart palpitations , stomach disorders or soreness in the muscles , it 's not a serious problem . But if physically one has some inherited weaknesses , past illnesses or a relatively weak capacity to endure pressure , then it is very possible that an illness would be brought on or worsened when he or she is faced with relatively greater pressure or emotional change .  
The economic takeoff is helpful for raising the quality of culture . But from another angle , some people believe that the roots of culture in Taiwan are weak . Sudden wealth at this time is by no means an unmixed blessing . This is especially true with the percolation of a " get rich quick " attitude into the arts , which will do even more to erode the roots of cultural development .  
Exercise : The Stepping Stone to Rehabilitation : Taking sufferers from infantile paralysis as an example , Wu says that if no rehabilitation treatment is administered , lower limbs are too weak to support the body and normal walking is impossible . Excessive joint friction , ineffectual muscles , and numbness are common consequences , resulting in " second-degree disability . " Some cerebral palsy victims sometimes reach the point where their entire bodies need rehabilitative treatment , Wu explains .  
In particular , the influence of applied science on technological development has led to increasing global polarization - - countries with advanced science and technology are becoming increasingly wealthy as they turn out products with high profit margins , leading to greater economic growth and improvements in their quality of life , while countries that are weak in science and technology have had to spend a correspondingly greater amount in exchange for them , leading to sluggish economies and poorer living conditions .  
In the past two years , headlines such as these have been continuously appearing in local newspapers and magazines . Not only have the " weak and brittle " small and medium enterprises been moving in droves to mainland China and Southeast Asia , even the rock-solid transnational corporations are letting out the word that their capital will go elsewhere because of environmental disputes , or the rising costs of land and labor .  
We 're constantly seeing cases of leaders being rejudged in the light of history , finding they may have been strong in ability but were weak in morals , or vice versa . Inter-level communicationQ : In your book you analyzed the main cause for the decline of China through the ages and concluded that it lay in the rift between the upper and middle levels and between the middle and lower ones . Is cross-level interaction and communication really that difficult ?  
Since the 1960s women in Taiwan have been entering the labor market in droves , making a major contribution to the island 's economic miracle . There are equal educational opportunities , greater opportunities in the work place , and an ever more diverse society . . . . These have allowed Taiwanese women to break through the historical Chinese mold for women as weak , dependent and subservient , revealing active , independent and self-motivated women striving for personal achievement .  
The more powerful the backwave , the faster the base will be washed away . Given this vicious cycle , both dikes made of steel reinforced concrete or " breakwaters " made up of huge concrete tetrapods dropped into the ocean off the coast are both are basically weak structures that require continual repair . Dikes must be periodically raised and new concrete tetrapods laid down .  
One of the features of tea is that it can be made stronger or weaker . It has its own striking flavor when strong ; when it is weak , it is more like water , suitable for mixing with various flavorings like jasmine , lemon , pomegranate , or whatever . This special feature combining rich flavors with diverse selection is just the thing for the youthful desire for constant change and novelty .  
Looking in turn at the three major forms of enterprises in the mainland today , state-run enterprises still labor under a heavy burden of weak incentives created by the " iron rice bowl " ; private enterprises are still in their infancy ; and township collective enterprises , which stand between these first two types in terms of scale , are mainly rural , and still lack the capital , information , and trained personnel to pose a direct challenge to Taiwan firms .  
In life Among the Society of Beggars he stated that problems making ends meet combined with unfilial sons and grandchildren or unharmonious family relations forced many of the old and weak to beg . Shih described other beggars who pretended they were old and blind to support the opium habit of their wives .  
He practiced medicine in his " Pochilum Clinic . " In an age of turmoil when China was weak and prey to Western invaders , with one hand he struck at the foreign sowers of intrigue and disorder , and with the other he fought against the corrupt and treacherous elements within China which sprang up to bedevil the country in its hour of difficulty . In the Chinese cinema of the l990s , the heroic figure of Huang Fei-hong bears strong parallels with Bruce Lee , who was the sensation of the film world 20 years ago .  
In the earliest days , mankind 's power to fend off natural dangers was very weak , and people were terrified of the strength and ferocity of the tiger . This fear gave rise to respect , and a certain degree of mystification . The stone carvings and bronzeware of the Shang and Chou dynasties all emphasize the tiger 's sharp claws and fierce countenance . " At the dawn of civilization , this was humankind 's main impression of the tiger , " believes Lin Po-ting , curator of painting and calligraphy at the National Palace Museum .  
Looking at the evolution of " sexual affairs " in dynasties down the ages , a regular pattern emerges : the more prosperous and powerful a dynasty was , the less restrictions it placed on people in sexual matters ; while the more weak and corrupt a dynasty was , the more tightly it controlled people 's lives , and the more severe the constraints it placed on sex .  
For instance , irregular meal times have given him digestion problems ; he has hemorrhoids from long hours in the driver 's seat ; driving with the windows closed and the air conditioning on to keep out the polluted air gives him aching joints ; watching the road and traffic signals all day tires his eyes and makes his vision blurry ; using the clutch constantly in stop-go traffic leaves his left leg painful and weak , and so on .  
The government units charged with protecting species are weak , their funding limited , and their enforcement abilities lacking , and so the lists must put priority on those species facing pressures from hunting and international illegal trade in their parts : " They have the practical need of resolving pressing problems in society first . "  
Animals are spread throughout the island , yet many county and city governments lack any formal wildlife preservation unit , with perhaps only one person responsible for all wildlife protection efforts . Or maybe this work is given to already existing units as a secondary responsibility - - and treated accordingly . Coordination between central and local authorities is weak , and so it was the Council of Agriculture , rather than local officials , that broke the recent Yunlin dolphin meat case .  
The panda , the focus of world attention , may have difficulties getting pregnant and generally weak propagation abilities , and its powers of adaption may have declined and its population aged ; but man , by threatening the bamboo forests and destroying its natural habitat so that it has less space to forage , is even more the cause of its demise . The Formosan landlocked salmon , regarded as a national treasure , lives only in the upper stretches of the Tachia River , where the temperature is low and water quality high .  
In fact the requirements are very broad : people over the age of 65 living on their own - - no matter whether they are weak , lonely , poor or just plain bored - - are all qualified .  
Huang explains that turtle shell 's effects should n't be so narrowly defined . Rather it should be regarded as increasing general vitality , just as developing skills in waidan kung fu can develop one 's qi . And so whether one suffers from a sore back , nagging sore throat , or weak blood and qi ; whether one is male or female , old or young ; there are appropriate prescriptions containing turtle shell that vary according to age and condition .  
Yang Hsien-hung left PTV because of the perpetual delays in starting operation , and he is now serving as the news department manager at Formosa Television , Taiwan 's fourth broadcast TV station , scheduled to begin broadcasting next year . Yang believes that as long as it does not compromise with governmental or commercial forces , PTV news will be quite competitive , because " their rivals are very weak ! "  
" However , I found out he was n't happy , " says Li . " On the one hand , my son strained his brain too much , and he did n't get enough exercise . His physique was skinny and weak , and he seemed fairly melancholy and introverted . What 's more , the gifted students ' class laid a lot of stress on grades , so the competition was acute .  
" The strong prey on the weak , the old consume the young , " sighs one telecom company manager . Early on , the DGT earned huge profits with its exorbitant mobile phone charges ; it was this fat market that private firms yearned for .  
" They are an important reminder to Taiwan 's society to open its eyes and see the poor and the weak among us , " says Li Chia-tung , Dean of Providence University and a one-time volunteer in a Calcutta hospice . He feels that people , especially people who live in self-proclaimed wealthy and civilized countries , love beauty and do their best to avoid seeing ugly and painful things . This even includes many who work in the field of religion .  
What one sees is what is left after the violence , circles of shards amid the silence . With Tsong Pu 's exquisite and mature installation technique , the small and large pottery shards arranged in their disordered way create a rhythm between strong and weak and rising and falling that is similar to what is found in poetry .  
For the Rukai , living at the foot of the mountains , land belonged to the tribal chief , who was responsible for looking after the old and weak . But hunting land rights were determined by general agreement . Hunters did not necessarily leave their hunting grounds to their own children , and any child with an instinct for hunting could go into the mountains to learn from an elder huntsman .  
" In 1982 Chien Ssu-liang , who was then president of the Academia Sinica , visited the East Coast of the United States and gathered together a group of us overseas members of the Academia Sinica , " Luke Yuan recalls . " He noted that Taiwan was doing pretty well in terms of applied science-using science to advance industrial and commercial development . But in basic research , especially in fields dependent on scientific experiments , Taiwan was quite weak . He asked us for our opinions and advice . "  
My legs would get weak . I could n't keep stable , and I could n't keep my head up when I went into a low stance . After about a half year of training , though , I did n't have that problem any more . " As his training progressed , he developed a feel for what the classics mean when they talk about remaining " loose and unperturbed . "  
Says Liu , " These names show that society at that time had not yet come to hold the two sexes to such very different standards . " Although they were gradually beginning to use specifically feminine names alluding to a gentle and submissive nature , such traits as a resolute spirit and an agile , tough body were also seen as virtues in a woman . " The notion of the ideal woman being soft and weak was not so universally accepted then as it would later come to be . "  
The biggest weak point of the joint entrance exam is that only people that excel on pen-and-paper examinations come out on top . People with a strong spatial sense , musical talent or athletic prowess are neglected . The movement to replace the joint entrance exam is based on this kind of reasoning .  
However , WTO regulations require that exemptions be declared prior to application for entry . Given Taiwan 's current weak diplomatic position , unless the PRC agrees to the exemption , it will be difficult for Taiwan to get the required support of two-thirds of the 137 WTO member states for this escape clause . In sum , Kinmen people remain optimistic that the arguments in favor of the little three links will win out .  
With regard to foreign aid , he said that helping diplomatic partners is Taiwan 's right and also its duty . Though these countries are not rich or powerful , " you ca n't measure everything by the same yardstick . " Though the economies of some diplomatic partners are too weak , and their democracies are immature , Taiwan must be willing to share its experience , in which economic takeoff spurred political democratization , and work together with diplomatic partner states to " stand up and move on out . "  
In Taiwan , there is no integration among the academic disciplines of zoology , botany , marine life , climate , soil conservation , and the like . Environmental protection agencies are weak , and research funding is limited . Thus there is little concrete knowledge about the numbers of various species and whether these numbers are rising or falling , not to mention any understanding of what concrete steps can be taken to solve specific problems .  
Twenty years ago theorists proposed that the magnetic field extended down below the sun 's surface to a depth of 0.7 solar radii from the center of the sun surface , but signals from the magnetic field are very weak , and could not be detected by the methods and instruments then available . But today acoustic imaging has enabled Chou Dean-yi to find much stronger evidence in support of the 20-year-old theory , and this is highly significant for solar astronomy .  
One figure in the business privately complains , " The government has always coddled Taiwan 's banks under the rubric of ' maintaining financial stability , ' and the banks have gotten used to it . You ca n't ask them to get lean and mean overnight . " The financial sector serves as the circulatory system feeding economic development . Taiwan has a powerful manufacturing sector , but a weak financial sector , which has always been a drag on overall national development .  
Regarding the international emphasis on " global " culture , Soyinka pointed out that the TIBE was featuring ancient Chinese culture , Czech culture , his own traditional Yoruba culture , as well as authors of Caribbean and American backgrounds , all exhibiting at the same time . This reveals that Taiwan is not a country that is culturally weak . In contrast to the strong centralizing trend of globalization , the TIBE assumed the appearance of an " anti-globalization " book exhibition , which felt marvelous .  
Professor Lin Wan-i of National Taiwan University 's Social Work Department points out that a third of all foreign brides under the age of 20 tend to be physically , emotionally and socially immature . They are on average three to five years behind their Taiwan counterparts educationally . Not only is their own competitive advantage low , it adversely affects the rearing of their children and creates the problem of continued weak competitiveness for the next generation .  
In it he compared Taiwan to a sick patient : " During its youth in the Zheng Chenggong era , the patient was nimble and healthy , of noble character and excellent behavior . But since the Qing Dynasty it has been infected by toxic policy , becoming physically weak and lacking in willpower , and is now ' a retarded child ' among world cultures . "  
The Taiwan Minpao carried many excerpts from the notebooks that Chiang kept in prison . From them we can see that he not only made friends with gangsters , but was quite interested in the culture and language of their world , and planned to produce a dictionary of gangster lingo after coming out of prison . At the same time , he was deeply pained by the way the gangsters wasted their courage on fighting against their guards , frequently being injured and growing weak and dispirited as a result .  
The traditional style of face painting that Tsai Lien passed down at Juyi Tsengshoutang involves evenly spreading a base color across the actor 's face and waiting for it to dry before getting on with the main painting work , which is highlighting the characteristics of the individual characters . This tradition of first applying a base and then applying the facial lines promotes speed and convenience . Its weak point is that the colors easily run .  
Eddington , the airline 's chief executive , said : " The airline market is expected to remain weak but the quick and decisive actions we have taken have shown we are determined to return the business to acceptable levels of profitability . "  
" China has consistently held that all countries , big or small , strong or weak and regarless of geographical locations , should be equal members of the international community , " said Jiang " We believe that bilateral relations based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence will enjoy smooth development "  
Li said that China holds that all nations , big or small , strong or weak , rich or poor , are equal members of the international community China is ready to increase friendly cooperation with Estonia in every area , economic and trade areas in particular  
He reiterated that the Chinese government has always adopted an independent foreign policy for peace and held that all countries , no matter they are big or small , rich or poor , strong or weak , should be on an equal footing  
despite all these favorable factors , however , germany 's economic recovery will be weak and slow this is because the country 's labor cost is still high , its social welfare burdens are heavy , and the recovery in other major western economies still lacks steam  
The attractiveness of Africa as a location for foreign direct investment continued to be constrained by the small size of most markets , weak private sectors , poor physical infrastructure , an uneven skill level and the heavy reliance on primary exports .  
With small national markets , a weak human resource base , inadequate physical and institutional infrastructures and narrow production structures , the majority of African countries do not meet the requirements to be dynamic economic entities . 
Poverty eradication and social and economic policies for standards of living must be based on a recognition of the human dignity of the poor , the weak and the humble .  
The pious promises of the developed world to allocate a minuscule percentage of national income to the provision of aid for the developing world have shrunk to non-fulfilment ; the thought of the strong economies helping the weak has shrivelled like a raisin in the sun .  
At this crucial juncture in human history we are compelled by social and economic imperatives , characterized by growing poverty and marginalization of the powerless and the weak , to choose a course of action that will empower the citizens of the world to develop their full potential in order to enable them to secure their basic needs and improve their livelihood .  
This relates , above all , to attacking on a priority basis the structural factors hindering its development , namely : inadequate infrastructure ; weak institutions ; poor use of human resources ; high vulnerability to natural and climatic disasters ; unfavourable fluctuations in the terms of trade ; the enormous debt burden ; unchecked population growth ; and environmental degradation .  
However , in an increasingly competitive world economy , in which the weak position of African countries is tantamount to marginalization , there is an urgent need to re-examine the importance of cooperation and focus more on those critical facets of Africa 's development in the context of the present and future political and social and economic environment of the continent .  
Indeed , since 1990 official development assistance for Africa has continued to decline , and direct foreign investment remains weak in a very difficult international situation characterized by fierce trade competition , which the Uruguay Round agreements have made even more onerous for the African countries . 
P �� ez-Otermin ( Uruguay ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : For the past 50 years , the First Committee has been the most important multilateral forum in areas related to international peace and security , a forum to which each and every one of the members of the international community be they rich or poor , weak or strong contributes with the overwhelming sense of being equal under the Charter .  
African countries , in particular , required more imaginative long-term solutions to overcome their competitive disadvantage deriving from dependency on primary exports , a weak industrial and export base and technological backwardness .  
The Workshops noted that the dissemination of census results had been weak and that national statistical offices had failed to give the issue sufficient attention , had not been adequate in terms of their awareness of users ' requirements , or had continued to use only traditional methods in situations where newer technology could have been effective .  
The most important symptoms reflecting insufficient capacity include the slow pace of policy and institutional reform ; weak intersectoral coordination ; the non-adoption of forestry programmes as priorities at the highest political levels ; the lack of clearly defined priorities ; and a continuing over-reliance on external technical assistance .  
Among the African countries in the franc zone , it has experienced the longest period of political instability - nearly 30 years of recurrent civil wars and border conflicts - thus its socio-economic infrastructure is rudimentary and concentrated in the capital ; the administrative capacity is very weak , and the private sector has little structure and is dominated by informal and black market activities .  
Open : in its conception , preparation and convening , the Summit involved all nations as well as a large number of public and private institutions and organizations , placing particular emphasis on the poor , weak and vulnerable , not only to address their problems but also to give them a voice in local , national and international forums . 
In many Latin American countries , the paradox of overabundant legislation and overemphasized democracy contrasting with the fragmentation of society , deep economic inequalities and the low level of political participation suggests that the ruling \ x { 5e68 } ite is attempting to overcome the weak integration of society by developing the legal framework of a democratic state of law addressing the whole people .  
In most developing countries , the process of technological capability-building might be hampered by , inter alia , declining rates of investment , misallocation of resources , external imbalances , lack of diverse and sophisticated skills , weak linkages between domestic research and development institutes and enterprises as well as unfavourable external factors .  
NULLWhile one reason the abuses , human rights violations or crimes allegedly committed by military commissioners and members of CVDCs , whether for political or general reasons , continue is that the people are afraid to say anything , the main reason they continue is that , in much of Guatemala the institutions responsible for maintaining public order and administering justice either do not exist or are very weak . 
The tendency for the Bretton Woods institutions to become increasingly involved in direct economic management in the developing countries , instead of playing a role of global governance was cause for great concern , particularly since they were often incapable of redressing the imbalances in world monetary and financial markets , which usually operated against weak economies .  
The Committee identified as major factors and difficulties in implementing the Convention : the weak State machinery to effectively maintain the peace process ; the difficult process of national reconciliation ; the breakdown of public infrastructure and private support systems ; the large number of Rwandan refugees and internally displaced persons ; the great number of militias and some civilians who are still armed ; and the shattered economy and extreme poverty .  
We must face up to terrorism and muster the national will to work collectively on a global level to stamp out the root causes of this plague which afflicts both the weak and the strong , the poor and the rich , for , in the final analysis , terrorism is not susceptible to reason ; it stems from bigotry , traumatizes the innocent , resorts to violence and seeks no dialogue .  
There is no doubt that the more representative the United Nations is , the more democratic it will be ; and that the more accountable the United Nations is , the more effective it will be , thus benefitting us all , small or large , weak or powerful , rich or poor .  
Our collective reflection clearly revealed that , without the United Nations , the world would only have been more violent , more unstable and insecure , more unjust and cruel especially to the weak , who are prey to power politics and arbitrary decisions .  
Since 1991 , official development assistance for Africa has been shrinking , and direct foreign investments remain weak in a very difficult international context that is marked by a fierce commercial competition that the Uruguay agreements have made even more onerous for the African countries .  
The Committee identified as major factors and difficulties in implementing the Convention : ( a ) the weak State machinery to effectively maintain the peace process , including national reconciliation efforts ; ( b ) the breakdown of mutual support systems ; ( c ) the large number of Rwandan refugees and internally displaced persons ; ( d ) the great number of militias and some civilians who are still armed ; ( e ) the shattered economy and extreme poverty .  
A forest inventory report prepared by FAO shows that in most developing countries the existing institutional capacity is either inadequate or too weak to collect and update basic information on the area and type of forests , species composition , existing growing stock and volume of harvest .  
There is ample evidence that a weak bureaucracy , coupled with an ineffective judicial system , tends to generate an inefficient implementation of the formal institutional structure .  
Most of them continued progressing towards macroeconomic stability with growth , but with notable weak spots , and in many cases their growth was not sufficient to reduce the social deficits accumulated in earlier years .  
Environmental conditions deteriorated further in many areas in the ESCWA region in 1995 .  The causes of environmental degradation included rapid population growth , inappropriate economic and social policies , weak regulatory and administrative systems , and insufficient public awareness .  
Strengthened by a five-year mandate , the new Government has moved quickly to address the fundamental problems impeding development , such as weak governmental institutions , economic inefficiency and corruption , and has laid out economic policies which seek to stimulate growth and reduce inflation by encouraging domestic investment and job-creating programmes .  
The focus of the subprogramme is to maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , in particular the least developed as well as certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , including those countries which are commodity-dependent , into the international trading system .  
Notwithstanding the above , the Government 's compliance with the commitment to supporting and strengthening institutions for the protection of human rights is still highly inadequate , as shown by the absence or weak presence of such institutions in wide areas of the country and the fact that the bodies responsible for implementing this commitment lack a comprehensive policy in criminal matters .  
At the ninth session of the Conference , member States decided that the main role of UNCTAD in the field of trade in goods and services should be to help maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , particularly the least developed countries and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , into the international trading system so as to promote their development .  
Much of sub-Saharan Africa suffers from severe shortages of technical , managerial and entrepreneurial skills , acute infrastructure bottlenecks , weak institutional capabilities , severe limitations in the capacity to import , and continued dependence on exports of a few primary commodities .  
In the least developed countries and in a number of African countries where the private sector was weak , the public sector should play an active role in establishing the basic essential infrastructure , and international cooperation should focus on countries and sectors where the lack of such infrastructure was most acute .  
The focus of the subprogramme is to maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , in particular the least developed and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , including those countries which are commodity-dependent , into the international trading system .  
LDCs also suffer from an extremely limited internal savings capacity and underdeveloped financial markets , geographical disadvantages ( as in the case of many land-locked and small island LDCs ) , inadequate infrastructure , poor communications and low education levels which are reflected , inter alia , in weak managerial and administrative capacity and in a severe shortage of skilled and trained manpower .  
He called on the secretariat to take into account , in all aspects of its work , the prevailing critical situation of those Latin American and Caribbean countries that had structurally weak and vulnerable economies , especially in the application of technical cooperation programmes , with a view to enabling governments to create an environment that was conducive to sustainable development and strengthening these countries ' capacity to participate fully in the international economy , trade and investment .  
Non-democratic States over time tend to generate conditions inimical to development : politicized military rule ; a weak middle class ; a population constrained to silence ; prohibitions on travel ; censorship ; restrictions on the practice of religion or imposition of religious obligations ; and pervasive and often institutionalized corruption .  
In situations where the constraints on domestic resources are most severe , owing to weak economic performance , inadequate infrastructure , and the shortage of trained personnel , it is expected that most of the needed resources will be supplied through external population assistance .  
In contrast , if there is a low level of cooperation in the establishment of the rules of the game , and if competitive forces are weak , then national governments may be more likely to adopt a relatively passive stance , which is characteristic of the Cargo Cult scenario .  
In situations where the constraints on domestic resources are most severe owing to weak economic performance , inadequate infrastructure and the shortage of trained personnel , it is expected that most of the needed resources will be supplied through external population assistance .  
These include weak domestic employment capacity , uneven sectoral growth , weak intersectoral articulation , severe marketing bottlenecks , poorly coordinated and fragmented new investments in both public and private ventures and structural imbalances among macroeconomic aggregates .  
In the Midrand Declaration , 7 member States of the Conference stated that it should be recognized that countries entered the new rules-based system of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) from very different starting points ; that , accordingly , the impact of globalization and liberalization was uneven ; and that the least developed countries , particularly those in Africa , remained constrained by weak supply capabilities and were unable to benefit from trade . 
Many of the structural constraints that have frustrated the response of the economy to the new policy initiatives , such as weak technological capacity , lack of entrepreneurial and managerial skills and inadequate physical infrastructure , have to be tackled systematically .  
Two representatives from North and South America respectively complained about the role of the United Nations which was considered to be too weak ; one of them lamented the paternalistic approach of the United Nations towards indigenous issues ; the other stressed the need for the United Nations to take a more active role along with its speciliazed agencies , in particular as far as the voluntary funds were concerned .  
A public sector that is either too weak or too large can lead to serious ethnic , religious , political and economic conflicts , undermining sound governance and efforts to promote human development .  
Given the tremendous scale and severity of the violations of human rights and humanitarian law that were perpetrated during the traumatic days of the Rwandan civil war in 1994 - a time which saw the brutal carrying out of one of this century 's worst genocides - and the weak response of the international community at this critical time in Rwanda 's history , the Government is to be commended for its cooperation with the members of the international community active in human rights matters in Rwanda .  
The main constraints to increasing agricultural production and raising productivity included the low priority accorded to the sector , poor physical infrastructure , limited utilization of advanced technologies , inadequate access to credit and appropriate technologies for small-scale farmers and the weak linkages between research institutions and farmers .  The Forum urged that African countries give higher priority to agriculture and , in particular , to the need for diversification of production in the sector .  
These included the provision of assistance , on a national or regional basis , in vertical and horizontal diversification as well as in related human capacities ; creation of self-financing mechanisms for commodity diversification activities ; and effectively addressing the weak technological base , market access problems and other commodity-related problems .  
These included the provision of assistance , on a national or regional basis , in vertical and horizontal diversification as well as in related human capacities ; creation of self-financing mechanisms for commodity diversification activities ; and effectively addressing the weak technological base , market access problems and other commodity-related problems .  
Among the cross-cutting development constraints hampering the private sector were an ineffective or shallow financial sector ; lack of a legal and regulatory system ; weak infrastructure ; obsolete technology , poor on - and off-farm storage facilities , high taxation , and generally inadequate support services ; an inadequate policy framework ; an inefficient and overly dominant public enterprise sector ; misdirected development assistance ; high transaction costs ; and lack of trust in the interaction between the Government and the private sector .  
Recurrent drought in the southern Africa region this decade , the weak economic base of the country , which is almost exclusively agricultural , a rather unbalanced social infrastructure , which is partly due to the low literacy rate inherited from the previous regime , and the problem of disease , including HIV / AIDS , pose a serious threat to our nascent democracy .  
We feel that the United Nations system should be made stronger , more effective and more efficient in order to meet the priorities set by all its Members not just the priorities of the economically strong and the militarily powerful but , especially , the priorities of the weak and vulnerable States , which should be prevented from becoming outsiders in the global economy .  
Consumption will stay relatively weak , reflecting sluggish personal income growth and growing household debt , which increased from 65 per cent of personal disposable income in 1991 to almost 95 per cent in 1996 ; but the weakest component of demand will remain government spending owing to the continuation of fiscal austerity at all levels of government .  
Its cultural and linguistic ties with both the United States and Europe , its geographical proximity to the United States mainland and its weak institutional structures contribute to the continued use of the Caribbean subregion as a major transit point in international drug trafficking .  
Even in some low-income countries that are pursuing sound policies , their low level of development - characterized by structural rigidities , weak institutions and administration , poorly functioning markets and deficiencies in skills and infrastructure - have prevented a rapid and strong response to reform efforts , which may delay the provision of relief under the initiative . 
In developing countries with a weak industrial base , a rapid and sustained rise in the levels of income depends on increasing investment , which has a very high import content .  
In the light of mutual suspicions and the weak administrative , social and economic environment , the implementation of the peace agreement was a complex and fragile process , which required a continuous commitment on the part of the signatories and the extensive support of the international community .  
Among the inhibiting domestic structures and growth-constraining factors in Africa are the internal social disarticulation at almost all levels of production ; weak and undiversified production base ; economic delusion and fragmented domestic factor and product markets ; low level of endogenous human resource development and capacity utilization ; and weak physical , institutional and technical capacities .  
A recent study1 has stressed that a current account deficit of more than 5 per cent is likely to become a problem only when a range of conditions apply : when the export sector is small , debt service is large , domestic savings are low , and the financial sector is weak and dominated by banks subject to weak regulation .  
The crises of the past year or so in Albania and Bulgaria have highlighted the issues in a dramatic fashion , but many of the constituent elements of the problems in those countries - low quality of banks ' asset portfolios , " cosy relationships " between banks , state-owned enterprises and ministries , weak or non-existent regulation , and a widespread , popular mistrust of the banking system - are present in varying degrees elsewhere in eastern Europe and in the CIS .  
In many ways the performance of the Canadian economy last year was closer to that of western Europe than that of the United States : annual growth averaged some 1.5 per cent , rather less than in 1995 ; relatively weak labour markets and increased taxes held back the growth of personal disposable income , although consumption picked up to a large extent because of a steep fall in the savings ratio ; and business fixed investment is also more concerned with rationalization than expanding capacities .  
Many developing countries , particularly the low-income and least developed ones , are weak in designing policy packages that would enable them to use international trade as an effective tool of sustained economic growth and sustainable development .  
In many cases , those responsible for violations of economic , social and cultural rights and of the collective rights with an economic content such as the right to development or the right to a healthy environment , are sometimes international entities applying policies which constitute veritable sources of large-scale and serious violations of collective and individual rights in the countries with weak economies .  
For many developing countries , in particular LDCs and other structurally weak and vulnerable economies , supply-side constraints continue to limit their capabilities to take full advantage of new trading opportunities , become more attractive locations for foreign investment and integrate themselves into regional and global production networks of transnational enterprises .  
Major impediments on the supply side are production and export structures that concentrate on only a few products , poor endowment with financial and human capital , weak technological capacity , inadequate legal and regulatory frameworks , and bottlenecks in physical infrastructure . 
The ability of the domestic industries of weak economies to respond to competition is impeded by inefficiencies which are due to inappropriate technology , obsolete equipment , inadequate infrastructure and support services , and previously excessive levels of protection .  Although in due course import liberalization will have dynamic positive effects on growth and employment , in the short run there is a risk of the failure of inefficient domestic firms , with the attendant social costs if workers lose their jobs and can not shift immediately to produce static efficiency gains from more productive employment elsewhere .  
We want it to be a strong , principled and effective body , the common inheritance of all mankind , not the preserve of a few wealthy and powerful States , but the guardian of all , especially the poor , the weak and the defenceless . 
It must be prevented through legal means established by the international community , which will reinvigorate the weak and sometimes absent State institutions and give meaning to the revitalizing commitment of their essential participants .  
Institutional constraints normally linked to weak capital markets and inadequate regulations should be addressed in order to strengthen the confidence of investors , both domestic and foreign , and decrease the volatility of financial flows .  
Institutional constraints normally linked to weak capital markets and inadequate regulations should be addressed in order to strengthen the confidence of investors , domestic and foreign , and decrease the volatility of financial flows .  
There are many obstacles to resolving the acute problems and to raising public awareness of the need to protect the environment during the current period of financial difficulties and economic instability coupled with poverty and weak discipline .  
The remark was also made that the topic of diplomatic protection involved a series of complicated theoretical and practical questions and had an unfortunate history , having been regarded as an extension of colonial power or a system imposed by powerful States on weak States .  
The access to rights , be they civil and political or economic , social and cultural , by the poor , the excluded and the marginalized has never been easy , with Governments , in the developed and developing world alike , often preferring to respond to the pressures of the more powerful and articulate groups in society rather than to protect the rights of the generally silent and politically weak poor .  
In some developing countries , a combination of weak or nonexistent policies on the one hand and the efforts of private firms on the other has already stimulated a shift from food production for subsistence for local communities to large-scale production of few crops and varieties for national and international markets , resulting in a loss of diversity .  
The UNCTAD regular programme of technical cooperation will be coordinated to ensure an appropriate balance among developing regions with priority assigned to the specific needs of the least developed countries and other countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies . 
The study found that while weak financial infrastructure , financial liberalization and speculation were to blame for the crisis , if reliable accounting information had been available , excessive financial exposure would have been detected earlier , permitting corrective action to be taken , and thus possibly diminishing the magnitude of the crisis .  
Instead of improving on the relatively weak performance in 1997 , gross domestic product ( GDP ) in Eastern Europe rose on average by just 2 per cent , less than half the rate implied by the official forecasts and nearly a percentage point lower than in 1997 ( see table 2 ) .  
As the fallout from the initial financial crisis in Thailand enters its third year , weak international trade and the negligible improvement in private financial inflows mean that most developing and transition economies continue to face a tight external payments constraint .  
Considers intolerable that more than 800-million people , especially women and children , throughout the world , and particularly in developing countries , do not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs , which infringes their fundamental human rights and at the same time can generate additional pressures upon the environment in ecologically weak areas ;  
The gruesome fact is that the past 70 _ odd days of indiscriminate bombing on a small and weak country have wounded and killed thousands of civilians and seriously damaged the national economy and living conditions in Yugoslavia .  
The lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with conditions of inadequate infrastructure , imbalance of trade , inefficient transport organization , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems , poses serious constraints on the trade and economic development of landlocked developing countries .  
Measures to deal with the transit problems of such countries have to address a broad range of factors , such as inadequate infrastructure , imbalance of trade , inefficient transport organization , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
Being a developing country with a vast territory , a varied topography , a large population and a weak economic foundation , China is confronted with a tremendous challenge of modernization and construction , and space technology , as one of the most sophisticated technologies in the contemporary world , is not only a representation of the overall national strength , but also an important means to transcend the phase of traditional development and accelerate economic and social development .  
The experience of developing countries during the past several years has also demonstrated that financial crises are contagious ; that is , once difficulties emerge , markets do not adequately discriminate between countries with strong and weak fundamentals , or between those with strong and weak economic structures and macroeconomic management . 
Resulting exchange rate appreciation and abrupt compensatory movements in fiscal and monetary policies that accentuate the cyclical movements of foreign capital can entail high development costs , especially if domestic financial systems are weak and not well regulated and supervised .  
The gender relationships associated with other characteristics of LDCs were also discussed : weak infrastructure , environmental degradation , low level of and access to technology , high of unemployment , a small tax base and restricted government revenues / expenditures ; inability to attract full FDI , problems of government , high rates of capital flight and the effects of exogenous factors , such as natural disasters .  
The weakening of economic performance in the past two years due to , inter alia , unfavourable climatic conditions and weak commodity prices , together with a more challenging global economic environment , suggest that the recent economic performance of the least developed countries might be difficult to sustain without further diversification of their economies so as to reduce their vulnerability to exogenous shocks .  
The precarious socio-economic situation in the least developed countries and the structural weaknesses inherent in their economies continue unabated and relegated these countries to a weak competitive position in the current global economic setting .  
He stated that the basic problem of landlocked developing countries long recognized by the General Assembly of the United Nations was lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with an inadequate infrastructure , as well as trade imbalances , inefficient transport systems , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
A broad range of non-physical obstacles such as poor utilization of assets , weak and inefficient transport management , cumbersome and incompatible procedures , outmoded financial , regulatory and institutional systems , trade imbalances and inadequate security often accompanied by very high user charges ;  
According to the first African Competitiveness Report , published by the World Economic Forum in 1998 , the most important problematic factors for doing business in sub-Saharan Africa are , inter alia , ( a ) tax regulation regimes , ( b ) difficulties in raising local financing , ( c ) weak infrastructure and ( d ) poor economic governance .  
He stated that the basic problem of landlocked developing countries , long recognized by the General Assembly of the United Nations , was the lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with an inadequate infrastructure , as well as trade imbalances , inefficient transport systems , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
A broad range of non-physical obstacles such as poor utilization of assets , weak and inefficient transport management , cumbersome and incompatible procedures , outmoded financial , regulatory and institutional systems , trade imbalances and inadequate security often accompanied by very high user charges ;  
A comprehensive approach was needed in addressing Africa 's structural constraints , including its weak infrastructure and high transport costs , which continued to undermine the expected gains from economic reforms , making it difficult to attract adequate foreign private investment .  
The precarious socio-economic situation of LDCs , the structural weaknesses inherent in their economies and the adverse external environment they faced relegated those countries to a weak competitive position .  
A broad range of non-physical obstacles such as poor utilization of assets , weak and inefficient transport management , cumbersome and incompatible procedures , outmoded financial , regulatory and institutional systems , trade imbalances and inadequate security , often accompanied by very high user charges ;  
The inherent burdens of a weak banking and financial system , insignificant foreign investment , unfavourable market conditions and inefficient State enterprises , coupled with a lack of free - market traditions and experience , have compounded the reform challenge .  
In addition , the enormous force of globalization , driven by the advancement of science and technology , instead of serving to unify humankind in a determined and conscious assault against the persistent and systemic problems of our time , is continuously being used to press the advantage of the strong over the weak , and is thereby widening the gap between the developed and the developing worlds .  
In Europe the only military bloc left over from the cold war , under its new strategic concept , bypassed the United Nations Security Council and bombed , with the worlds most powerful and sophisticated military machinery , a weak sovereign State , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , turning the Balkan region , which has experienced so much misery in this century , into a testing ground for its new strategy .  
Where backward linkages between tourism and other sectors of the economy are weak or absent , income and employment multipliers from tourism are lower because the potential stimulus to indirect spending is dissipated by increased imports rather than domestic production , as happens with many small island developing States .  
The participation of developing countries - in particular the least developed countries , and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies - and countries with economies in transition , and in particular of their enterprise sectors , in electronic commerce will be an essential ingredient for growth and wealth creation at the global level .  
Considers intolerable that more than 800-million people , especially women and children , throughout the world , and particularly in developing countries , do not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs , which infringes their fundamental human rights and at the same time can generate additional pressures upon the environment in ecologically weak areas ;  
In that connection , the preparatory committee for the special session would need to address a number of issues , including foreign debt , the decline in official development assistance , factors impeding access to foreign markets and weak financial flows to countries in economic and political transition .  
The Commission also recognized that its discussions and the analysis of the trade issues by the secretariat as well as the technical cooperation activities undertaken had made a positive contribution to the effective integration of developing countries , particularly LDCs and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , as well as the economies in transition , into the international trading system .  
Let us look towards a new vision for a future that will incorporate the weak and strong , the rich and poor and the developed and developing world , so that none will be marginalized .  
The North must be gracious and generous , and give enough of what has been acquired from global resources to assist poor and weak countries to help propel them into the orbit of sustainable and irreversible social and economic growth .  
As we are aware , the financial situation of the continent is characterized by an enormous external debt , stagnant national savings , as well as declining official development assistance and weak private capital flows .  
This can be attained only through generous financial assistance from the industrialized world directed towards improving and enhancing weak infrastructures and augmenting national institutional capacities .  
In developing countries with a weak industrial base , a rapid and sustained rise in the levels of income depends on increasing investment , which has a very high import content .  
The interstate wars of the Cold War years had been succeeded by intrastate armed conflicts , often underpinned by political transition , economic dislocation , weak civil society and a weakening of the State , leading to virtual anarchy .  
Inadequate budgetary allocations for the social sectors , slow disbursement of available funds , weak institutional and human resources capacities , and unreasonably low salary levels for civil servants are constraints common to all sectors .  
These problems may include geographical and demographical problems , poor institutional setups , ethnic tensions ( 18 African LDCs have been involved in armed conflicts since independence ) and weak , often dualistic , product markets .  
The position of women is traditionally weak and subordinate in Nepalese society , rendering the CPN programmes , with their strong emphasis on equality , attractive , both among the growing cadre of educated women and those of the disadvantaged in rural areas .  
Three sets of factors can be proffered : the low savings base ( subsistence income levels ) ; weak institutional base for intermediation ( thin , fragile , fragmented financial system with limited financial instruments ) ; and decapitalization . 
The Conference needs to focus on finding solutions to the inherent problem of weak productive capacities in LDCs through improved domestic policy frameworks , human capital development , traderelated capacity building and improved physical infrastructure .  
Such solidarity , based on the interdependence of economic , political , cultural and spiritual elements , should inspire the wealthy to feel responsible for the poor and the marginalized and help the weak and the poor to overcome passivity and hopelessness .  
As such , the ambitions of his own country and others for the creation of an effective and transparent international criminal system in which it was not simply a case of the strong accusing the weak had been disappointed .  
An open , rulebased , equitable , secure , nondiscriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system that accorded preferential treatment to the weak and vulnerable would be vital to that end .  
Either by promoting weak decisions , watered down by the need to find a compromise acceptable to the permanent members , or by imposing immobility on the Security Council , the hidden veto can often be more negative than the expressed veto .  
There is very limited scope , in the foreseeable future , to meet these multiple development finance requirements with domestic resources because of sluggish growth or economic stagnation , widespread poverty and a weak domestic corporate sector .  
In our view , the seeds of civil strife can invariably be found in places where Governments lack legitimacy , where governance is weak or unrepresentative , where irrational values such as fundamentalism , racism , tribalism , ethnic discrimination , social injustice , and violation of human rights are practised officially or unofficially .  
The reasons were weak economic governance , lack of response to stabilization measures , weak institutional and physical infrastructure , small domestic markets and limited access to regional and global markets , and also the absence of a critical mass of small - and medium-sized enterprises .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .
