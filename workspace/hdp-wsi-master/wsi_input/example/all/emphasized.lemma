The period of tsarist conservatism at the end of the nineteenth century emphasized study of the classics and intellectuals were not allowed to delve into the natural sciences .

This in turn drew on the neoclassical style that appeared in Europe in the mid-18th century . That style emphasized " reason " and rationality , which designers of the period found embodied in the nearly pure geometric shapes of classical architecture .

To be sure , for most unsophisticated and conservative women , the feminist theory that Awakening emphasized was a little too obscure and remote . It could do nothing to solve the urgent problems of abused or abandoned women .

It is just like scholars who stayed in their poorly heated rooms studying for ten years - - by passing the exams , they then set themselves up for life and did n't have to work hard again .

The most important thing emphasized is that whatever has been most recently learned is great learning , useful learning . Everything else is thrown away .

The period of tsarist conservatism at the end of the nineteenth century emphasized study of the classics and intellectuals were not allowed to delve into the natural sciences .

This in turn drew on the neoclassical style that appeared in Europe in the mid-18th century . That style emphasized " reason " and rationality , which designers of the period found embodied in the nearly pure geometric shapes of classical architecture .

To be sure , for most unsophisticated and conservative women , the feminist theory that Awakening emphasized was a little too obscure and remote . It could do nothing to solve the urgent problems of abused or abandoned women .

It is just like scholars who stayed in their poorly heated rooms studying for ten years - - by passing the exams , they then set themselves up for life and did n't have to work hard again .

The most important thing emphasized is that whatever has been most recently learned is great learning , useful learning . Everything else is thrown away .  
" For example , I discovered the Focolare Movement , founded fifty years ago by an Italian woman , Chiara Lubich .

In military affairs , after the PRC unilaterally broke off negotiations in 1995 , they initiated a series of missile tests in the Taiwan Strait .

In Hero , Zhang Yimou similarly emphasized symbolic , highly visualized fighting sequences . One example is the fight scene at the chess pavilion between Jet Li and Donnie Yen .
