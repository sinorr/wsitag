The leader of the project , Dai Sirui , from Southwest Agricultural University , said the project involved the study and demonstration of key technologies of people 's working and living , ecological problems , city waste water and garbage disposal , landslide monitoring warning , pasture and husbandry sectors ' development , advantageous and unique sector 's development , and ecological and economic system reconstruction after the Three Gorges Dam conserved water .  
The expert evaluation panel , including Professor Chen Huanchun from Huazhong Agricultural University who was also a member of the Academy of Engineering , said research of these key technologies had reached an advanced level domestically and some were leading the world level , which offered firm technological backing to the ecological environment as well as the social and economic development of the Three Gorges Dam area .  
The desert around Qinghai Lake is increasing at an average of 10.12 square kilometers annually .  Dunes , in particular , on the western bank of the lake came into being over the last decade and have become an area with the fastest desertification .  The wetland 's ecological system has been damaged with the biological diversity decreasing .  
With regard to ecological protection , the law stipulates : The destruction of public welfare forests , mangrove forests , wetlands , and natural scenery resources protected by law by any unit and individual is prohibited .  The engagement in activities that endanger the survival of rare ocean species of Xiamen and species inside state-level reserves by any unit and individual are prohibited .  
The basic framework of the study includes : The current population situation and developmental conditions of the Yangtze Delta Region , the regional property development , the developmental trends in property structure and employment population , the developmental trends in urbanization and the development of cities , the total population and the ecological carrying capacity of population resources , the aging of the population , and the social security system of urban and rural areas .  
and carry out internal restructuring of overall agriculture , by " returning farmland to forest " in mountain areas , " returning farmland to grassland " in pastoral areas , and " returning farmland to fishery " in lake areas ; that is , we should abandon the method of developing agriculture and grain production at the cost of sacrificing the ecological environment , and open up a broad space for increasing new products that suit the demand of the international market and have competitive advantage .  
At the same time , when we intensify our efforts in the implementation of the natural forest protection project , we should also experiment with the practice of gradually returning the grain plots to forestry and husbandry in a well-planned way , do a good job in protecting and building a sound ecological environment , clothe barren mountains and wasteland with greenery , restore the vegetation cover , and bring gradual changes to the deteriorating ecological environment in the western region .  
In light of Hainan 's actual conditions , we have defined " one province , two localities " as our industrial development strategy and the construction of Hainan to be a symbol of an ecological province as our sustainable development strategy .  We have also defined the strategy of promoting reform and development through opening to the outside world and the strategy of invigorating Hainan on the strength of science and education .  Hainan will make more rapid and steady strides with still firmer confidence .  
We should increase our support of expenditures in the public welfare area to ensure that science and technology , education , social security , agriculture , ecological conservation , and other key areas and fields have the necessary funds to meet their expenditure needs .  We should increase our financial support for the establishment of a disaster prevention system , for projects designed to protect natural forests and to return grain plots to forestry , for poverty relief work , and for raising the peasants ' income .  
Drawing a lesson from the bitter experience , Hainan has since then set sights on its good ecological environment and its unique resources and re-established the industrial strategy of building itself as a base of tropical and high-efficiency agriculture and as an island tourist resort .  At the same time , it has developed high-technology , high-value-added , and high-efficiency industry which does not cause pollution , does not require redundant construction , and does not destroy resources .  
Key topics discussed by the deputies in their speeches were active efforts to seize the great opportunities presented to Sichuan by the development of the western region , exploitation of resources , ecological protection , economic structural adjustment , better incomes for the peasants , and vigorous efforts to develop scientific educational undertakings .  
Deputies Chen Dejing , Huang Xuejiu , Zhang Zuoha , and Li Lemin respectively expressed their opinions and made suggestions on the issues of how to strengthen water conservancy construction when developing the western region , development of high and new technological industries ; accelerating the development of educational undertakings in ethnic regions ; and strengthening ecological environmental protection during the development of western region .  
In view of this , we feel it a must to integrate the work of returning grain plots with the development of the rural economy , and with the task of extricating peasants from poverty and making them rich ; and a must to find practical and earnest solutions to major problems that are most concerned by the masses , such as sufficient food and firewood as well as increases in their income .  Only in this way can we do a good job in protecting the ecological environment from the basics .  
Proceeding from the special needs of the economic and social development in China 's western region , we should lay stress on the spread and application of improved varieties of agricultural products , dry farming and water-economizing farming , a comprehensive utilization of resources , new materials and new energies , and advanced technologies in the aspect of ecological environmental protection .  
Delegate Zhou Benli said Anhui , although a central region province , should also seize opportunities and accelerate its own development to take part in the grand development of China 's western regions .  Anhui should not only step up infrastructure construction and accelerate the pace of structural readjustment but also effect the spread and transfer of industrial sectors in a selected way , cooperate with western regions to do well in ecological environment protection and construction , implement the strategy of " marching to the east and west , " and energetically develop the market .  
Practice over the past 21 years has proved that the policy of " the whole society engaging in afforestation and the whole nation committed to turning the country green " has brought into play the superiority of the socialist system and suits the actual condition of our country , which is faced with an arduous task of ecological building but lacks capital .  It has also significantly increased people 's awareness of the need to keep the country green .  
We should continue to uphold the principle of attaching simultaneous attention to preventing and improving pollution and protecting the ecology , strive to control the total discharge of pollutants and strengthen pollution prevention and treatment in major cities , rivers and regional sea areas in a bid to improve environmental quality and promote ecological balance .  
Now , the vast majority of the rest of the poor are those living in remote areas which are hard to get to and lacking in resources and where the ecological environment is extremely bad .  
Zeng Peiyan said : We must control population growth , protect and develop the ecological environment , and save and effectively utilize resources to truly base economic and social development on constant scientific and technological advancement , the sustained utilization of resources , an ecological balance , and a clean environment .  
It is necessary to make use of the unique ecological resources of the western region , strengthen the building of the ecological environment , focus efforts on developing agriculture with special characteristics , water-saving agriculture and ecological agriculture , and promote the processing of agricultural products to increase their added value so that more agricultural products will be sold to the international market .  
The deterioration of the ecological environment is severely jeopardizing and hampering the sustainable development of our national economy and society .  Improving the ecological environment has become an urgent requirement of economic and social development and the effort to improve the people 's standard of living .  
Tian Fengshan said : The Ministry of Land and Natural Resources has initially formulated an " outline for development and utilization of land and natural resources in the western region " to ensure that the tapping of minerals and use of underground water will be handled in coordination with the work of ecological protection and returning grain plots to other uses in an orderly manner .  
Tian Fengshan finally told this reporter : In the foreseeable future , the Ministry of Land and Natural Resources will strengthen work in four fields to cope with the needs of large-scale development of the western region : First , we will strengthen the investigation and evaluation of the situation of land and natural resources in China 's western region so as to provide information for economic construction in the western region , especially the rational planning of infrastructure facilities , and to support the harnessing of major rivers , protection of ecological environment and prevention of disasters . 
Carrying out a positive fiscal policy , strengthening infrastructure construction , supporting agricultural basic construction and construction for the ecological environment , supporting economic restructuring , speeding up the development of hi-tech industry , revamping old industrial bases and traditional industries , practicing the policy of rejuvenating the nation through science and education and the strategy of sustainable development , and establishing a social security system all require corresponding increase of input and state financial support .  
In the course of economic globalization , floating capital is mainly controlled by the financial and business magnates of Western developed countries .  While the environment issue in Western countries has increasingly become a popular concern , to reap super profits , these magnates moved their enterprises that promise high profits but cause serious pollution to developing countries , thus sparking a global ecological crisis .  
At the same time , in the roadway development for the western region , we must put intense emphasis on ecological and environmental protection and management , protecting cultivated lands , economizing on land use , and industriously integrating roadway development with the improvement of the surrounding environment .  We do this in order to improve the ecology and environment of the west , and to contribute to the enhancement of environmental quality .  
The input into the construction of ecological construction has been noticeably increased .  The engineering projects of returning grain plots to forestry and protecting natural forests and the projects of harnessing " three rivers " ( Huaihe River , Liaohe River , and Haihe River ) and " three lakes " ( Taihu Lake , Dianchi Lake , and Chaohu Lake ) have obtained phased achievements .  The environmental quality in urban areas has improved and the sense of environmental protection among the whole people has noticeably enhanced .  
The state has increased the intensity of investment in the ecological construction , carried out the natural forest protection project in a comprehensive way , activated the experimental project of returning land unfit for cultivation to forestry , prevented and controlled desertification , engaged in the work of soil and water conservation vigorously , controlled the water pollution in some major rivers to reach the targets within the time limit , and took the perpetual use of natural resources and the coordinated development of economy and environment more seriously than ever before .  
Zhou Yongkang said : According to the arrangements made by the Sichuan provincial party committee and provincial government , in the next 10 years , Sichuan 's general objective of speeding up economic development is to build up an ecological shield in the upper valley of the Chang Jiang , effect coordinated economic and social development , and make development by leaps and bounds to turn Sichuan into an economically advanced province . 
the legal system of market economy is still unsound , the phenomenon of corruption is spread wide , and there are plenty of ecological environmental problems and so on .  All these are pressing practical issues with an impact on our country 's national economic and social development , which must be tackled through market-oriented reforms .  
To impose one 's own favored undiversified model on others can only artificially destroy social and political ecological equilibrium , a course of action which is neither rational not feasible .  
If we say that since the 1963 National Agro-technology Conference , we have solved the problem of increasing agricultural output , then this session of the National Agro-technology Conference made a strategic adjustment to the direction of the development of agro-technology .  It sets the direction for the development of agricultural technology with optimizing the structure of agriculture , raising agricultural efficiency , improving the rural ecological environment , and strengthening capabilities in the sustainable development of agriculture as the main points for resolving the problem of developing agricultural efficiency .  
As a developing country with a huge population , China is short on per capita resources and has practiced extensive development for years .  Despite its low income level , therefore , China is forced to deal with those problems that other countries did not have to tackle until their incomes reached a high level .  China 's resource and ecological situation is very grim .  
All sectors of the society , all cadres and the masses must adopt the perspective of the strategy of a strong nation , prosperous people , and peaceful world and fully recognize the extreme importance of protecting and reasonably utilizing natural resources .  Furthermore , protecting natural resources and optimizing the ecological environment must become conscious actions .  
It is necessary to actively promote legal administration , to intensify law enforcement inspections , to strengthen law enforcement oversight , to firmly implement the principles of following existing laws , strict law enforcement , and tracking down offenses against the law , to curb waste and destruction of resources , and to effectively improve the ecological environment in order to provide effective guarantees for sustainable economic and social development .  
The state has decided to make infrastructure construction the base , strengthening the protection and construction of the ecological environment the main content , grasping the readjustment of the industrial structure the key , developing scientific and technological education the basic condition , and thorough reform and expanded open up the strong driving force of development .  
On the one hand , the troops should participate in and support the ecological and environmental constructions , and on the other hand , they should take the lead to clean up the sources of pollution and focus on the comprehensive treatment of the garrisons ' everyday waste water , the oil-polluted water used to clean equipment , the waste water discharged from hospitals and clinics , and smoke and dust emission from boilers and so on to make sure that the sources of pollution will meet the emission and discharge standards after the treatment .  
Over the past few years , in particular , under the conditions of a large base figure of population , limited per capita resources , and relatively backward economic and scientific and technological levels , our rapid economic development has brought enormous pressures to the originally weak ecological environment , so that the situation in environment is even grimmer .  
To solve the problem of " insufficient services " from the government in the course of structural adjustment , the party committee and government of Linyi County have intensified market forecast and perspective study , put forward the objectives of building Linyi into a " large agricultural county free of environmental pollution " , and led the peasants in developing ecological agriculture , unique agriculture , sophisticated agriculture , and agriculture in which production is carried out on orders .  
He said that party committees and governments at all levels in Sichuan have seriously implemented a series of central principles and policies to strengthen the protection and improvement of the ecological environment , taken the lead in launching the project to protect natural forests and making experiments on returning farmland to forests , taken prompt actions with a resolute attitude , done solid work and adopted effective measures .  They have enabled the people to consciously implement the party 's policies , accumulated much successful experience , and attained remarkable achievements .  
Zhu Rongji emphasized that at present , the supply of grain and industrial consumer goods is greater than demand and this has provided a golden opportunity for returning farmland land to forests and improving the ecological environment .  We must firmly grasp this rare opportunity and actively and prudently push forward work in this respect .  
By guiding foreign investment toward infrastructural construction , the exploration of mineral resources , the development of tourist resources , the ecological environmental protection , the agricultural and livestock products processing , the transformation of existing production capacities , and to such scientific and technological projects as the development and manufacturing of new-type electronic components in its western region , China will provide a host of investment and trade opportunities for foreign investors , said Deng Zhan .  
Second , in order to expand domestic demand , should give 900-million farmers priority in benefiting from infrastructure investment that the state should be making in the countryside , including increasing road networks , water supply networks , electric supply networks , communications networks and radio and television networks between cities and the countryside , as well as inputs for the fundamental construction of farms , water conservancy and the ecological environment in the countryside , absorbing as many temporary farmers as possible and creating more employment opportunities for them .  
Investment by the state and financial aid from the central government are primarily used for the construction of relevant facilities in farming and animal husbandry industries , infrastructure , scientific and technological education and political power at the grass-roots levels , as well as protection and construction of the ecological environment , all with stress on solving " bottleneck " and prominent difficulties restricting the development of Tibet .  
The two parties will cooperate in protecting and improving the environment , in preventing cross-border pollution , in the fair and rational use of biological resources in waters in the border area and in the north Pacific and border river courses , and will work together to protect rare plants and animals and the natural ecological system in the border areas , and cooperate in preventing natural disasters and major accidents arising from technical causes and in eliminating their consequences .  
Despite Pronk 's proposal not being completely satisfactory , developing countries , keeping in mind the general interests of improving the international ecological environment , finally agreed to accept Pronk 's proposal in order to enable the " Kyoto Protocol " to go into force at an early date and to compel developed countries to take practical and effective measures to reduce greenhouse gases emissions .  
However , if Western developed countries continue to turn a blind eye to the global wide gap between the rich and the poor , large quantity of unemployment , and ecological damage , and if they continue to turn a deaf ear to the voice of developing countries and ordinary people , President Bush perhaps will see more miserable tragedies in greater numbers , and it will also be difficult for the United States not to get involved .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out that during the " Ninth Five-Year Plan , " through comprehensive agricultural development , we improved agricultural production conditions , protected and improved the ecological environment , raised comprehensive agricultural production capabilities and efficiency , and increased agricultural citizen income .  We thus made important contributions to the historical transformation from the long-term deficiency in chief agricultural products to an overall balance and years of surplus .  In our practice we also created many effective experiences .  
We upheld the comprehensive management of earth resources , and the comprehensive development of agriculture , forestry , animal husbandry and semi-aquatics .  In regard to inputs of manpower , financial power , material resources , and science and technology , we realized the integrated raising of agricultural economic efficiency , ecological efficiency , and social efficiency .  
We must widen the extent of ecological and environmental construction in key areas including the areas around Beijing and Tianjin , the Hebei region , the Inner Mongolia region , and the northwest region .  We thus will make contributions to improving the environmental quality of the entire country , especially the region surrounding Beijing . c . )  
This development has rescued the " Kyoto Protocol " which is facing the danger of falling apart , has established operable guidelines for the protection of the global environment on which humans depend on to exist , and is of a great significance to improving the world 's climatic conditions and ecological system .  
We want to basically curb the trend toward worsening ecological damages and environmental pollution on land and in the rivers and the oceans .  We want to begin to improve the urban and rural environmental qualities and tentatively set up a comprehensive ecological and environmental monitoring and warning system .  We want to boost our disaster prevention and reduction capabilities and further raise the level of comprehensive resource utilization .  
In view of this , we should make a full use of abundant local animal and plant resources , act in line with the requirement of seeking a unity between economic efficiency and ecological efficiency , and gear ourselves to the needs of the market and rely on scientific and technological advances .  We should intensify the structural adjustment of agriculture and the rural economy ; vigorously develop a highly efficient production of fine-quality medicinal materials , special foodstuffs , and green foodstuffs ;  
Some localities have planned to increase investment , and others have begun returning land unfit for farming to forestry and animal husbandry , raising the curtain on ecological construction .  Braving the piercingly cold wind , quite a few cadres from the western region went to the eastern and southern parts of the country , busying themselves with the introduction of projects .  
to look into and put forward proposals regarding rural economic development , key infrastructure construction , protection and building of the ecological environment , restructuring , resource exploitation , and the arrangement of major projects , and to organize and coordinate the enactment and implementation of plans for returning farmland to forest ( grassland ) ;  
With a view to enhancing the economic returns of their agricultural products , all provinces and autonomous regions in the western region should base themselves on each 's local geographic , climatic , and resource conditions ; and develop a specialty agriculture in the light of each 's local conditions , including an ecological agriculture , water-economizing agriculture , and an agriculture of " two highs and one superior . "  At the same time , they should also rely on scientific and technological progresses , and heighten the scientific and technological contents of agriculture .  
Tian pointed out : The western regions are rich in natural resources but have a rather fragile ecological environment .  In particular , they are short of river resources and have suffered from serious soil erosion .  Thus the scientific and technological units and scientific and education personnel should directly participate in the work of harnessing soil erosion and building the ecological environment .  
Fifth , speaking of the country 's agricultural development , China has adopted a comprehensive policy of readjusting the internal industrial structure of agriculture , promoting an industrialized operation of agriculture , paying close attention to the building of the ecological environment , and speeding up the development of small cities and towns ; and has moved to resolve problems that are currently existing among its peasants and in its rural areas and agriculture .  
We should adhere to the basic national policies of family planning , environmental protection , and energy conservation , increase the intensity of implementing the sustainable development strategy , control the population growth , protect and construct ecological environment , and economize on and effectively use resources so that economic and social development is genuinely built on the bases of continuous progress of science and technology , rational utilization of resources , and constant improvement of ecological environment .  
To enable China 's agriculture to make positive reactions to the opportunities and challenges brought about by China 's participation in WTO and at the same time , support the great development of China 's west and protect agricultural resources and ecological environment , the National People 's Congress [ NPC ] will quicken the pace of agricultural legislation , more intensively formulate laws and regulations to meet urgent needs , and to make timely reexamination and revision of the laws and regulations which are not suited to the development of the situation .  
At present , the work of formulating laws and regulations should be focused on the issues of promoting the structural adjustment and industrialization in agriculture ; standardizing the rural market , the rural cooperatives , and the joint-stock cooperative system in rural areas ; protecting peasants ' legitimate rights and interests ; supporting and protecting agricultural development ; supporting the development of the western region ; protecting agricultural resources and the ecological environment , and promoting social development in rural areas .  
Some localities have planned to increase investment , and others have begun returning land unfit for farming to forestry and animal husbandry , raising the curtain on ecological construction .  Braving the piercingly cold wind , quite a few cadres from the western region went to the eastern and southern parts of the country , busying themselves with the introduction of projects .

Li Tieying stressed : The development of the western regions is a massive and systematic project involving ecological environmental protection , infrastructure construction , industrial restructuring , scientific and technological education , reform and opening up , and ethnic and religious issues .  
Chongqing will invest 20.4 billion yuan on the project .  Its various key ecological enhancement tasks include protecting natural forests , reverting cultivated farmland to forests or grasslands , afforesting barren hills and slopes , and remedying soil erosion .  
Introducing the practice of a comprehensive agricultural development which mainly aims at strengthening the building of basic agricultural facilities , protecting and improving the ecological environment , and developing a high-quality agriculture with a high yield and a high efficiency conforms to the requirements of the WTO 's " green box " policy ; and is also an important way for the government to support and protect agriculture at a time when China 's agriculture is heading for internationalization , he stressed .  
He pointed out : In the new stage , the major tasks for China 's comprehensive agricultural development are to continue strengthening agricultural infrastructure construction , support and promote agricultural structural readjustment , actively push forward agricultural scientific and technological advancement , and protect and improve the ecological environment .  
Xiang Huaicheng stressed : In comprehensive agricultural development , we must abide by the natural law and strengthen ecological environmental development to bring about sustainable economic and social development .  
Wang Shucheng , minister of water resources , indicated that the contradictions between shortage of water resources and accelerated economic development have become increasingly larger over the past few years .  Besides the shortage of water for agricultural and industrial production and domestic use , the drought has directly worsened the ecological environment .  
In order to meet with the challenges , it is imperative for the Chinese government to make some adjustments to its economic policies , vigorously develop modern agriculture , and quicken the tempo of agricultural modernization , upgrading of industrial structure , construction of infrastructure facilities , protection of ecological environment , and development of the central and western regions .  
Li Peng , member of the Standing Committee of the political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the NPC Standing Committee , stressed at the forum : In developing the western regions , we must properly handle relations between economic development and environmental protection ; ensure a benign cycle for resources exploitation and ecological protection ; and leave our future generations with space for sustainable development .  
We should develop the western regions on a large scale and with firm efforts by proceeding in a planned and orderly way and advancing step by step ; should properly handle relations between economic development and environmental protection ; and should never sabotage ecological environment in this process .  
Actively seek to create the conditions for improvement of the ecological environment of the western area , for improvement of plant and animal products , and for restructuring the agricultural industry .  Introduce superior foreign breeding stock , poultry chicks , seeds , seedlings , and such , into the western area , and give priority technical support to the entry and quarantine inspection of them .  
The radioactive pollution resulting from the unlimited use of uranium-poor bombs in the war , together with the pollution and poison-bearing smoke and clouds caused by the accidental bombings of refineries , fertilizer plants , and pharmaceutical factories , has brought to Yugoslavia and the entire Balkan Peninsula a long-term ecological crisis hard to wipe out , resulting in persistent genetic freaks , leukemia , lung cancer , and other abnormal diseases .  
In doing the anti-drought work , we must make overall plans , take all factors into consideration , bring about temporary as well as permanent solutions to the problem , and give comprehensive treatment by combining engineering measures with biological measures and management measures , combining capital construction of water conservancy works with construction of ecological environment , and combining rational development with strict protection and scientific utilization in a bid to properly manage , protect , and utilize the limited water resources .  
At the same time , it is necessary to step up environmental protection and ecological construction in the dam area , do a good and steady job in the resettlement of local people , and intensify the restructuring of enterprises moved from the area , so as to achieve coordinated development of economic and social undertakings and of ecological environment construction in the dam area .  
The meeting pointed out that improving environmental protection and ecological construction in the dam area is of great practical and historic significance for implementing the central strategy on major development of west China , ensuring the normal operation of the pivotal three gorges project , promoting sustainable development in the dam area , and creating a good image of the project .  
At present and for a time to come , it is necessary to speed up the progress of projects for dealing with water pollution and garbage in the dam area , vigorously carry out projects for natural forest protection , step up comprehensive measures to deal with soil erosion , develop ecological agriculture , and build the dam area into a new-style economic zone with flourishing economy , green hills and clear waters , and beautiful environment , where people are happy to live and work .  
In the Drought Agriculture Ecology Laboratory , which is a key state project , a young professor gave Jiang Zemin an account of one of their scientific research achievements : In view of the unique drought and cold geographical conditions of the west region , Professor Zhao Songlin , the first director of the laboratory , proposed a brand new idea of developing " catchment type ecological agriculture , " which was successful in practice .  
The effective protection and rational utilization of scenic and historical resources are of great importance to the improvement of the ecological environment , the development of tourism , the promotion of ethnic culture , the stimulation of patriotic passion , and the enrichment of people 's cultural life .  
have intensified our financial support for social security system building ; have continually increased our input in agricultural , forestry , water conservancy , as well as ecological or environmental protection projects ; have comprehensively implemented the CPC Central Committee 's decision on banning the army , the armed police , or the political and legal affairs organs from engaging in commercial activities ;  
intensified the support of the treasury for the development of the social security system ; continued to increase the input into agriculture , forestry , and water resources management , as well as the protection of the ecological environment ; comprehensively implemented the decision taken by the CPC Central Committee to stop armed forces , the armed police force , and political and judicial organs from engaging in business activities ;  
Since the proactive fiscal policy was put into practice in the second half of 1998 , the Chinese Government has cumulatively issued around 270 billion yuan worth of additional treasury bonds and the funds raised through the bonds have mainly been used for infrastructure construction , technological transformation , environmental protection and ecological projects , and the construction of educational and cultural facilities .  
It has rich natural resources , diverse plant and animal species , a beautiful ecological environment , inhabitants comprising of many nationalities , and very broad prospects for international cooperation and development .  
The " headlong mass action " has laid emphasis on the surface form but neglected the realistic work , giving rise to the " tofukasu project . "  This brings nothing but harm to the ongoing ecological construction .  
Qian Qichen pointed out that protecting and improving the ecological environment and improving the environmental quality is an important task that must be accomplished in developing the western region .  
Both economic development and the improvement in the ecological environment should depend on progress in science and technology .  Only through using new science and technology achievements to transform the traditional industries , developing high-tech industries , and continuously enabling technology to develop by leaps and bounds will it be possible to gradually narrow the gap between the western region and the developed region .  
In particular , the city should pay attention to depending on and applying new scientific and technological achievements to intensify the building of infrastructure , the development of energy resources , and building in an ecological environment .  The city should also vigorously plant trees and grass , endeavor to make its urban environment beautiful , enhance the level and efficiency of development and construction , and make sustained efforts to build itself into a major base that supports the development of Qaidam Basin .  
China will greatly promote the strategic readjustment of its economic structure , accelerate the computerization of the national economic and social sectors , greatly develop science , education , and cultural undertakings , step up developing such new and high technologies like information technology , biotechnology , new material technology , and advanced manufacturing technology , further step up infrastructure building in water conservancy , communications , and energy , and intensify efforts on ecological building and environmental protection .  
In deciding on relevant projects , it is necessary to give overall consideration to economic benefit , social benefit and ecological benefit so as to bring about a coordinated development of natural resources , ecology , economy , population and society in the western region .  
To Effectively control the population scale is conducive to relaxing the pressure of the population on the weak ecological environment and the economic and social development , to improving the population quality and structure , and to increasing manpower and capital of the western region .  It is necessary to strengthen consciousness and the sense of urgency of correctly handling the relationship between development and population control .  
Centering on this major topic of discussion , the members of the Central Committee will discuss various issues , such as adjusting the economic structure ; quickening the pace of reforming state-owned enterprises , the administrative management structure , the organizational structure , and the personnel system for cadres ; and putting forward concrete plans for finishing infrastructure construction in western China and transforming the ecological environment .  
Qian Qichen said : Shanxi Province boasts very rich tourist resources .  In recent years , Shanxi has entered tourism into the list of the province 's superior industries , increased the work intensity of transforming the advantages in tourist resources into the industrial advantages , initially formed a few tourist zones with special characteristics , and taken firm control of the tourist infrastructure construction , environmental protection , ecological construction , historical relics protection , and the deep-level development of tourist serial products , with a view to repeatedly optimizing and upgrading tourism .  
According to the report , the " substantive " steps made in the large-scale western development since the beginning of this year include : Formulating and introducing the unified policies for the western development , losing no time in drafting the overall plan for the western development , carrying out the work to accelerate infrastructure construction , speeding up the work of ecological environment protection and construction , and intensifying the scientific and technological and educational work , among other things .  
In the meantime , the report points out that this year , the state has focused on 19 projects to be selected as the demonstration projects of high-tech industrialization in the western region , in a bid to support the local environmental protection , ecological construction , and transformation of advantageous resources for value appreciation , with the total investment amounting to nearly 2.4 billion yuan .  
Wu Bangguo pointed out : " Closing coal pits and reducing production " and eliminating backward production capacity are aimed at creating external conditions for helping Datong Coal Mine end deficits and eliminate difficulties .  In addition , this is also an essential requirement for Shanxi Province to adjust economic structure , raise economic efficiency , and improve the ecological environment , and is an important link for successfully running state-owned key coal enterprises .  We must be determined to firmly grasp this work well .  
China has also instituted a strategy of sustainable development ; while vigorously promoting sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development , China has made efforts to ensure the sustainable use and protection of its natural resources , to ultimately achieve coordinated economic and ecological development .  
Through conducting in-depth investigation and study and earnest inspection and argumentation , the provincial party committee and government has elaborately formulated a development plan and proposed to build Sichuan into an economically powerful province in the western region in China as well as an ecological defense for the upper reaches of the Changjiang River through making efforts for 10 years and realize a coordinated economic and social development .  
The Chongqing Municipality has proposed to make efforts to do well four major things like the task of migrating people out of the Three Gorges Reservoir areas , the reform and development of state-owned enterprises , the development of rural economy , and the construction of ecological environments , take an active part in the Big West Development , constantly strengthen its economic strength and city functions , and strive to realize the strategic objective of " building Chongqing into an economic center in the upper reaches of the Changjiang River . "  
Sichuan has actively implemented the strategic policy decisions of the central authorities regarding the " great development of the western region , " and has put forth the overall working idea of building Sichuan - - with 10 years of struggle - - into an economic powerhouse province in China 's western region and an ecological barrier in the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang , of harmoniously developing the economy and society , and of realizing new strides . 
Wen Jiabao said that in the past 20 years , China has persistently taken economic construction as the center , constantly increased its comprehensive national strength , and laid a solid material and technical foundation of environmental protection and ecological construction .  
This year alone , the funds used by the central finance in the key ecological projects such as returning cultivated land unfit for grain production to forestry reached 18.8 billion yuan , which has almost doubled last year 's figure .  According to Xiang Huaicheng , minister of finance , more than 91 million mu of cultivated land will become plots of luxuriant vegetation so that the Chinese nation will suffer fewer catastrophes caused by yellow sand .  
The circular said : Currently and in the near future , the key tasks in implementing the policy of the great development of the western region are : speeding up infrastructure construction , stepping up ecological and environmental protection and building , strengthening agriculture 's position as the basic industry , adjusting the industrial structure , developing tourism featuring special attractions of the western region , and developing science and technology education and cultural and public health work .  
. facing this unprecedented ecological crisis , we must establish an intense sense of historical responsibility , premising our actions on the future development of mankind , taking as our starting point the sustainable development of our posterity and future generations , and pursuing a comprehensive approach and taking action .  
These are the key tasks in the development of the west now and in the foreseeable future : Accelerate infrastructural construction , step up ecological and environmental protection , consolidate the status of agriculture as the base , adjust the industrial structure , develop specialty tourism , and develop scientific , technological , education , cultural , and public health undertakings .  
Vice Minister of Agriculture Liu Chengguo said : From now on , the coastal areas and outskirts of large and medium-sized cities in east China will mainly be engaged in the production of cash crops with a high value-added and specialty farm produce for export ; the central region will lay particular emphasis on giving play to its advantages in producing premium grain , special-purpose grain , and feed grain ; and the western region will return the grain plots to forestry and husbandry and vigorously develop ecological agriculture .  
and commercial housing .  In 1999 and 2000 , the state separately issued another 110 billion yuan 's and 150 billion yuan 's worth of long-term construction bonds , and while making arrangements to continue the state bond-funded projects already under construction , some new projects were added .  They included some technological transformation projects in key trades and industries , the installation of Chinese-made equipment in major projects and the industrialization of advanced technologies , some environmental and ecological construction projects , and some educational infrastructure projects .  
The large-scale project to return grain plots to forestry and pasture is being implemented in the western region as a permanent solution to the adverse ecological conditions in the west .  Some 70 million mu of cultivated land with a slope of more than 25 degrees in the upper reaches of Chang Jiang and the upper and middle reaches of Huang He will all be returned and planted with trees and grass .  
In the coming 10 to 15 years , we must strive by every possible means to resolve the scientific and technological problems in terms of optimizing agricultural structure , heightening agricultural efficiency , improving rural ecological environment , augmenting international competitive power , and so on to facilitate the fundamental change of agriculture from mainly seeking quantity to stressing quality and efficiency .  
It is necessary to vigorously work hard at ecological environment protection and construction , with the focus on closing the hillsides to grow trees , returning farmland to forest and pasture , and preventing the formation of stone deserts in stony mountain areas ; we must persist in seeking truth from facts , act in light of local conditions , and make active and steady progress .  
The western areas should proceed from their actual conditions , make full use of the preference policies of the state in shifting more financial input to the western areas , more effectively implement the strategy of " relying on science and education for national regeneration , " first make substantial developments in the fields of science and technology , education , infrastructure construction , and ecological environmental construction , and thus lay a solid foundation for comprehensive economic development and social progress in the future .  
2 ) It took actual steps to protect forestry resources by taking decisive measures to prohibit logging in the natural woodlands on the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang and the Huang He .  3 ) It gave top priority to improving the ecological environment during the course of developing western China ;  
In the development of western China , procuratorial organs in western China prosecuted more than 300 cases relevant to crimes committed in handling key construction projects , ravaging the ecological environment , and mismanaging money and goods meant for people stricken by poverty and natural disasters ; and authorized the arrest of 3,891 criminal suspects who destroyed communications , energy , or telecommunications infrastructure or ravaged the ecological environment .  
Deputy Shu Huiguo , who had been engaged in research on strategies for the development of the ecological economy for years , said : The ecological economy has become the trend of world economic development , and green barriers have constituted a new protection network for trade in the international market .  With green mountains and clear waters , Jiangxi is rich in resources ; it is less polluted and has a good ecological environment ;  
Shu Huiguo stressed : Developing an ecological economy is an inevitable choice for Jiangxi in order to bring about great-leap-forward economic development in the 10th Five-Year Plan period .  In the coming five years , Jiangxi should put the strategy of sustainable development in an ever more salient place .  Jiangxi should focus on building " a province famous for its ecological economy " and do solid work in this regard ;  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that in environmental protection work it is necessary to understand the long-term , arduous , and complex nature of controlling pollution and improving the environment ; while maintaining sustained and healthy economic development , we must achieve some improvement in the state of environmental pollution , curb the trend of ecological deterioration , and improve environmental quality in key cities and regions .  
We shall give greater support to the faster and better development of the central area of this province with Xian at the center , and turn this area into a core base for the great development of the western part of the country .  Northern Shaanxi will be developed into our country 's major sample zone for the sustainable development of energy sources and the building of the ecological environment .  The southern part of Shaanxi will be developed into a diversified economic zone for developing biological resources , tourist resources , and water resources .  
The following is Sichuan 's overall target for accelerating its development in the first decade of the 21st century : The province is to build itself into an economically strong province in China 's western region and an ecological protective screen at the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang , bring about a well-coordinated economic and social development , and strive to make new leaps forward . 
In the face of various tasks , Deputy Uyunqimg believed : In the 10th Five-Year Plan period , Inner Mongolia will seize the historic opportunity brought by the large-scale development of the west , effectively strengthen ecological and environmental protection , bring about sustainable economic and social development , and create conditions for its development coordinated with nationwide development step by step .  
Yet , while we benefit from a rich material life and the sophisticated infrastructures we have developed , we shall never overlook the problems that come with our development .  Some of the major concerns of people at large are the air quality , marine and river pollution , and some indiscernible ecological problems .  
In recognition of the ecological importance of Long Valley , KCRC has carefully studied alternative alignments in addition to the gazetted alignment for the eastern end of the railway project , having regard to important factors including potential environmental impact , land use , planning requirements , engineering and operational feasibility as well as impact on local community .  
( a ) strengthen co-operation with the Guangdong Authorities in order to critically assess and announce the extent to which the ecological environment and the quality of the water supplied to Hong Kong have been affected by the sharp rise of the pollutant level of the original water supply course and the back-flow of the effluent into Dongjiang caused by the works on the closed aqueduct , and assess the additional resources required to remedy the damage to and the pollution of the local ecological environment and the Dongjang water source ;  
The Chief Curator of the Museum Dr Joseph Ting Sun-pao noted that the exhibition was the soul of the Museum and also a showcase of the dedicated hard work done by the Museum staff in the past 26 years in collecting , preserving and researching the history and development of Hong Kong . He also noted that with a rich mixture of ecological settings , panoramic screens , dioramas , interactive programmes and artefacts , the exhibition outlined the natural environment , cultural heritage and historical development of Hong Kong in a life-like manner .  
The public consultation exercise is to seek public views on : ( a ) the introduction of a scoring system for assessing , in a more objective and systematic manner , the relative ecological importance of sites with the objective of reaching a consensus within the community on the priority sites for enhanced conservation ; and ( b ) practicable ways to better conserve ecologically important sites that are under private ownership within limited resources .  
Falling within this area are coastal areas mainly below the 20-metre contour .  This zone is intended to conserve and retain the natural coastlines and the sensitive coastal natural environment including attractive geological features , physical landform or areas of high landscape , scenic or ecological value .  
The public consultation exercise is to seek public views on the introduction of a scoring system for assessing , in a more objective and systematic manner , the relative ecological importance of sites with the objective of reaching a consensus within the community on the priority sites for enhanced conservation ; and practicable ways to better conserve ecologically important sites that are under private ownership within limited resources .  
At the same time , the government should also thoroughly implement ecological protection and prevention of public hazards , while improving traffic , public safety , and living environment conditions . In this way the people will not only have access to plentiful resources for their everyday life , but will also enjoy a rich and meaningful spiritual life , thus thoroughly realizing the ideals of prosperity and equitable distribution of wealth as prescribed in our Principle of the People 's Well-Being .  
The natural distribution of heavy metals has been disturbed and they have been dispersed from their originally secure ecological position . In the course of life and industrial production people lack any real sense of alarm about all this . With the failure to take precautions the situation has gradually become harder to contain .  
Before the discovery of the microscope , and before " ecological observation " became popular , when our ancestors saw these insects emerge from soft earth and light up , they imagined that the firefly was a metamorphosis from rotting leaves or decaying bamboo . The saying , " On summer nights , rotting grass turns into fireflies , " was a natural result of observing transformations as the weather changed from season to season .  
Such painting for the scientific record was concerned primarily with seeking factual truth . When tools were developed to aid in the appreciation of nature and ecological research took off , conservationism swept the world and the number of bird watchers increased daily . Scientific illustrations were produced in great quantities and the demands of the art market gave rise to the ecological art of today .  
In 1989 the Wildlife Conservation Law was passed . Besides being concerned about Taiwan 's image , the Council of Agriculture , which is responsible for ecological preservation work , is even more worried that the mountains are being scarred by ever-larger development projects , which are destroying the habitat of wild animals . It is feared that this destruction of habitat , combined with the Chinese belief that monkey brain is especially fortifying in the winter , will make the Formosan Rock Monkey an endangered species .  
Beginning two years ago , foreign conservation groups started attacking Taiwan as a " rhino terminator , " and then in April of this year Taiwan became the first country against which the United States implemented trade sanctions for ecological reasons . The Chinese medical community has become a favorite public punching bag . As a doctor of Chinese medicine , Huang Ming-teh has had to face this problem .  
Twelve years ago the first book in the ROC to promote ecological conservation , We Only Have One Earth , was published . From that time until today , a rich selection of publications focusing on the natural environment has been produced in Taiwan , following the progressive development of environmental consciousness here . Recently a publishing house has even been established specializing in books about nature .  
The Formosan landlocked salmon was the main reason for the establishment of Shei-Pa National Park ; the Formosan clouded leopard was fielded by the newly formed Green Party as its presidential candidate ; and NT $ 200 million has been spent on the rehabilitation of the Formosan sika deer . But by the ecological definition , because these three species ' wild populations are so small that they can no longer reproduce healthily , in effect they are already extinct .  
Paul Perng says it used to be thought that clear targets were needed to bring about ecological protection , and so preservation areas were created for specific animals , such as the clouded leopard or panda . But in the future nature reserves wo n't be devoted to a single rare species but rather will be aimed at protecting the greatest diversity of ecology . Even areas that appear to contain nothing special but are nonetheless ecologically important will require protection .  
He faces a number of urgent problems . One is how to balance economic growth and environmental protection in a Taiwan that is densely crowded and has already suffered serious ecological damage and pollution . Another is how to create a sound investment environment that will keep local capital at home and attract foreign investment .  
Yet the fact is that many flowers are soft , clean and fragrant . The lotus , however , has special ecological characteristics that set it apart from other plants and make it symbolic of Buddhism . " Early Buddhists ' high regard for the lotus was based on the way it propagated itself , " writes Lin Liang-yi , one of the older generation of Japanese art scholars , in his work , " The Decorative Lines of Buddhist Art . "  
Its logic is simple . Taiwan 's aborigines have coexisted with nature here for millennia , and , despite their hunting and farming , nature remained as robust as ever , and aboriginal peoples did not hunt animals to extinction . If we can learn their ecological wisdom , perhaps we can do better at resource management and conservation . Meanwhile , some aborigines will have the chance to choose their traditional way of life , thus helping to keep their culture and communities intact .  
Fan also wrote China 's first fish farming manual , thus paving the way for the aquaculture industry of later generations . From the Tang dynasty onwards , it became common practice to raise such fish as common carp , mud carp , blunt snout bream , black carp and grass carp together , with the different species-some carnivorous and some herbivorous-occupying different niches within the waters of the same pond . " From a modern perspective this was very scientific , and consistent with maintaining an ecological balance , " says aquaculture nutritionist Chuang Chien-lung .  
The botanist Chen Yu-feng has written : " The process of mountain formation in Taiwan has already passed its most active phase , and the arrangement of its tall mountains has basically been established . These provide a wide range of climates and habitats for many different forms of plant and animal life . " The island has an astounding array of ecological diversity .  
The year before last , the United Nations nominated over 20 ecologically important areas worldwide as biosphere reserves , to be the subject of major conservation efforts with the support of the international community . But although East Asia was recognized as one of the regions of greatest biodiversity , a lack of detailed species lists and ecological background data prevented many areas being listed .  
After work on the plant resumes , there will be neither an immediate nuclear risk nor an immediate benefit of power generation . But environmentalists are convinced that the marine habitat of Yenliao , lying within a marine resource conservation area immensely rich in both the number of species and their populations , will be devastated , and that the three-kilometer golden beach of fine quartz sand which runs from Yenliao to Fulung , one of the priceless ecological and tourist resources of the northeast coast , may be lost along with it .  
Rising almost 4000 meters above sea level , Yushan is not only the tallest peak on Taiwan , it is also the source of the three major river systems that provide water for the island , has the most intact ecological system , verdant forests , varied flowers and fauna plus the nearby historical relics of Patungkuan and the rich cultural history of the Aborigines . " It is natural that this area is a topographical symbol of Taiwanese identity , just like Mt . Fuji in Japan or the Alps in Switzerland , " says Professor Tai .  
Compound Eyes examines the question of environmental ethics , and tells a riveting ecological tale that juxtaposes the huge and the miniscule , the distant and the near , the perfect and the flawed .  
Furthermore , modern people may lack ecological and environmental knowledge . Or they may know that natural resources are limited and that biodiversity is important , but be unable to refuse materialistic temptations , lack the time to recycle , and be powerless to refuse their children 's requests for the fashionable pet of the moment . More knowledge does not necessarily help in easing environmental deterioration .  
Farm director Chang Yu-sen explains , " We base the camps on our existing crops and cultivation areas . We 've set up activities including bird and insect watching and stargazing , premised on the idea of no additional land development and using the abundant resources of the surrounding virgin forests . We also have ecological gardens and displays of seed samples and dried flowers . "  
Helanshan Mountain , extending more than 250 kilometers to the north and south , is situated in the border area of Ningxia and Inner Mongolia , two large autonomous regions .  It is an important natural and geographical border , a water resource conservation forest and a natural ecological defense for the attacks of Tenggeli desert and Siberia cold wave .  
Mt . Helan , stretching 250 kilometers from south to north and located between Ningxia and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regions , is the most important geographic line and water conservation forest region in China 's western areas .  It is also a natural ecological fence to prevent the eastward encroachment of Tengger Desert and the cold waves from Siberia .  
Sustained and accelerated economic growth in developing countries would make for global ecological sustainability and should be central to development efforts at the national and international levels .  
Thus , a new impetus to foster regional cooperation is needed in order to address adequately the economic , social , cultural and ecological dimensions for a sustainable and systemic development of the ESCWA region .  
The primary concern now is how to sustain the social gains that have been realized in ecological and economic environments that are becoming increasingly hostile , thus menacing the already fragile environment of the young child .  
The sustainable management of natural resources and the improvement of environmental quality are mechanisms for protecting the ecological processes and the genetic diversity essential for the maintenance of life .  
Although the United Nations Environment Programme was an important step forward for the protection of the biosphere , consideration should be given the possibility of creating , after proper study , an ecological response embodied in a United Nations environmental security council composed of Member States with a permanent 15-member executive committee and a secretary-general with executive powers . 
The international community 's ability to offer a decent and secure existence to all its citizens is called into question by the numerous human tragedies , atrocities of war , terrorism , traffic in illegal drugs and long-term ecological degradation of our planet .  It is self-evident that global cooperation and effective action is a sine qua non for effectively combating these and other evils tormenting world society .  
The globalization of socio-economic activities calls for an integrated and universal approach , for if the development of the world economy is not accompanied by regulations and corrective mechanisms , it runs the risk of increasing destabilization and of breeding social and ecological imbalances . 
This integrated Central American initiative is one of national and regional development in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , involving policies , programmes and actions in the short - , medium - and long-term .  
Indeed , given the presence and the flow of refugees and displaced persons on our territory , and aware of the importance of international solidarity which was manifest during the ecological catastrophe at Lake Nyos in Cameroon in 1986 and of the need to confront unpredictable situations in an uncertain future , my Government decided to establish within Cameroon 's armed forces a specialized unit for peace-keeping and humanitarian assistance operations .  
As regards Africa , the steady deterioration of economic and social conditions can only contribute to confirming the pessimistic views regarding a continent that has been marginalized and left to its own devices to deal with the many political , economic , social and ecological crises besetting it .

Certain countries have developed systems of ecological zoning , which they are using as a basis for identification of threatened ecosystems and development of ecological modelling at various levels , from the regional and national to the level of individual natural habitats . 
One form of non-governmental organization follow-up to the Rio de Janeiro Conference has thus been a continuing constructive critique of SARD concepts , emphasizing such elements as democracy , participation , equitable access to resources , local solutions , cultural values , social justice and equity , and ecological agricultural systems often adapted from traditional methods .  
UNESCO is developing its own electronic network and information service on biosphere reserves and ecological sciences ( MABNet ) , as well as its own database on national and cultural world heritage sites .  29 .  WCMC continued to compile and update substantial databases on habitats and threatened animals and plants for the red data books and biodiversity status reports that it publishes .  
Mountain farming furthermore relies on the exploitation of highly variable and complex ecological niches , where local knowledge is often superior to what extension agents can offer based on research and experience derived from extensive lowland farming systems .  
Women , particularly indigenous women , have pivotal roles in environmental conservation , owing to their combined roles and responsibilities in the family and the community , their knowledge of ecological links and fragile ecosystem management and their concern for the quality and sustainability of life for present and future generations .  
Biotechnology applications have the potential for making major contributions to the health and welfare of humanity , although biotechnology is still perceived by many to have undesirable and partly unforeseeable ecological , socio-economic , legal and ethical implications .  
An understanding was reached that military or any other hostile use of herbicides as an environmental modification technique was a method of warfare prohibited by the Convention if such use of herbicides upset the ecological balance of the region , thus causing widespread , long-lasting or severe effects as a means of destruction , damage or injury to any State party .  
To integrate environment and development in the policies and practices of each country effectively , it is necessary to develop and implement integrated , enforceable and effective laws and regulations that are based upon sound social , ecological , economic and scientific principles .  
However , the principle that harm which does not entail economic loss should be compensated is not a new absolute in law , as can be seen in the universal acceptance , in domestic and international law , of compensation for moral injury , which is as difficult to evaluate in monetary terms as ecological harm .  
In that resolution , the General Assembly , bearing in mind the serious crisis which had shaken Rwanda to its very foundations , expressed its deep concern about the grave social , economic , health and ecological impact of the massive and unexpected presence of refugees in the neighbouring countries .

This endeavour includes the aspiration to receive fair treatment in international economic relations ; to try to save children from starvation and disease ; to promote emergency assistance to refugees and disaster victims ; to attempt to combat crime , drug addiction and disease ; to promote education and the development of human resources ; and to tackle the enormous task of halting or slowing the progressive ecological deterioration of our planet .  
All these falsities , many of them recorded in United Nations documents , hide the bankruptcy of development prospects for most of the poor countries , which is already threatening world stability and aggravating the ecological deterioration we all recognized several years ago at the historic Rio Conference .  
The Republic of Belarus deeply appreciates the efforts made by all the programmes , funds and specialized agencies of the United Nations system towards providing increased , speedier and better quality assistance to the various countries and regions suffering from armed conflicts , natural disasters , industrial ecological catastrophes and other emergency circumstances .  
One can not but conclude that the progressive development and codification of international law would benefit from the recognition of the primacy of national laws in their interaction with applicable international law in the conduct of States ; in the preservation of the environment and ecological balance ; in respect for basic human rights and fundamental freedoms ; in the need to contain and eradicate the inordinate and indiscriminate bite of terrorism ; and in the espousal of the democratic ideal .  
The current international political and security situation is burdened with many crises , cases of blatant violation of international law , the uncontrolled hoarding of arms , upsets of the ecological balance , disrespect for human rights , widespread international terrorism , and tensions in economic and social development .  
A solution to the problems of personal security in the region will thus require a comprehensive and interrelated view of all aspects of sustainable development in Central America in its political , economic , social , cultural and ecological dimensions ;  
In operational terms , sustainable forest management includes the formulation and implementation of forest management plans , which help to control and regulate harvesting of specified goods , combined with silvicultural and protective measures applied in varying intensity to sustain or to enhance the social , ecological and economic value of subsequent generations of the managed forests .  
Lack of implementation is partially attributed to lack of resources , expertise and political commitment and to insufficient availability of factual and scientific information on , for example , successional change and variables such as growth and yield of tree species under varying intensities of forest management , relationship between harvesting practices and forest ecosystem functions etc .  The lack of scientifically sound information is even more acute in relation to ecological processes on which increasing emphasis has been made in recent years .  
The project aims at identifying those criteria and indicators that can be considered objective , cost-effective and relevant in the assessment of the sustainability of prevailing forest management practices , taking into account parameters related to ecological , institutional , social and economic conditions and needs .  
In these forums , special reference has been made to the need to expand activities to cover all kinds of forests , with a view to arriving at a complete global coverage of clearly defined criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management , applicable to countries in all geographic and ecological regions of the world .

The intense work undertaken during the interim period has laid some of the needed foundations for the necessary convergency between the efforts of affected country Parties and developed country Parties , thus paving the way for gradual progress at the field level of the arid lands marginalized by ecological degradation and poverty .  
Accordingly , the developing countries committed themselves to doing everything to preserve and protect the environment , while the developed countries , beyond their ecological obligations , were to provide new and additional financial resources in order to create an international economic environment conducive to the struggle against poverty .  
It is also understood that global sustainability will remain mere wishful thinking so long as the rich industrialized countries continue to undermine the ecological life-support system of the human family by wasting resources .  
It needs to be questioned to what extent this secrecy is compatible with the access to information necessary for democratic practice and social justice and whether , in some cases , instead of contributing to long-term security , it may conceal information about processes ( ecological , financial , military , etc . ) which are a potential threat to everyone and which need therefore to be addressed collectively . 
Be adapted to the specific legal , social , economic , ecological and cultural conditions prevalent in a given project region ;  
Alternative development programmes should be adapted to the specific , legal , social , economic , ecological and cultural conditions prevalent in a given project region .  
Be adapted to the specific legal , social , economic , ecological and cultural conditions prevalent in a given project region ;  
Developing countries , with their diverse agro-climatic situation , high and unstable mountains , perennial waterways coupled with peak seasonal discharge , as well as arid and semi-arid ecological conditions , are vulnerable to drought and desertification .  
His Government considered regional and international coordination of primary importance for such activities , as it was impossible to solve ecological problems on a purely national level .  
The broad-based concept of partnership with all actors in civil society has been widely recognized as a key feature of the Habitat Agenda and for making human settlements sustainable in ecological , social and economic terms .  
Be adapted to the specific legal , social , economic , ecological and cultural conditions prevalent in a given project region ;  
The elements needed for good governance in the fisheries sector are well recognized : the need for a strategy explicitly aimed at ecological , economic and social sustainability ; effective fisheries agencies and research institutions ; a cooperative , organized and informed fisheries sector ; adequate laws and legal institutions , including deterrent monitoring , control and surveillance ; and appropriate linkages with regional and international bodies .  
In other words , it aimed at finding ways and means to strike a true balance between present and future economic , social and ecological needs on the one hand , and laying the foundations for a world partnership based on shared understanding of needs and interests with a view to attaining sustainable development on the other .  
Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , we stress that there are measurable , anthropogenic impacts on the global climate , that these impacts are on the rise , and that continued unchecked growth in greenhouse gas concentrations will result in dire ecological , social , and economic consequences .  
In its report on its fourth session ( E / CN . 17 / 1997 / 12 ) , IPF concluded that there is a need for a broad set of reliable data of high integrity , covering social , cultural , economic , ecological , institutional and legal aspects of forests , in order to have an adequate grasp of progress as well as of the impact of the state of forests on the environment , human well-being and the economy .  
Additional information is needed on approaches that can be used to devise markets for forest products , and the role of the public and private sector in assuring that new or expanded markets are consistent with the social , economic and ecological components of sustainable forest management .  
The financial needs of developing countries with low forest cover require special consideration , balancing their genuine need for forest products and services with ecological , technical , financial and social feasibility .  
Urged countries with low forest cover to establish or expand networks of protected areas , buffer zones and ecological corridors , where possible , in order to conserve biological diversity , particularly in unique types of forests , working in close liaison with the parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant international environmental agreements .  
The selection and management of additional protected forest areas should be based on their value as representative or unique forest types ; their potential to generate information on ecological processes ; the conservation of biological diversity and ecosystem services ; and due consideration to the livelihoods of the communities depending on them .  
In his delegations view , the following UNIDO activities should be strengthened : ( a ) attracting foreign investment in the industrial and technological sectors ; ( b ) developing international environmental protection standards for industry ; ( c ) enhancing the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in science and technology and in industry ; ( d ) establishing regional industrial development and ecological production centres ; and ( e ) promoting certification and standardization in industry . 
The programme is aimed at families living on municipal , State _ owned or private land , involving negotiations between landowners , the community and the municipal government , or families who have been relocated , through the new organized settlements programme , to the above _ mentioned land because they had previously been living in high-risk areas , on rights of way , in ecological or archeological reserves or on private property .  
The programme is aimed at poor families living in minimal housing conditions and in high-risk areas , on rights of way , in ecological or archaeological reserves or on private property , persons over 18 years of age , and persons who belong to a family unit with an income of less than two monthly minimum wages when they can prove that the family has no assets and have expressed a desire to purchase a plot . 
Discussions of land management at the eighth session might focus on the integrated management and planning of agricultural and non-agricultural land , including forests , watersheds , protected eco-systems and settlements , so as to meet the growing needs of rural and urban populations for food , water and forest products , while protecting essential ecosystems and ecological services .  
The precise meaning of adequacy is to a large extent determined by prevailing social , economic , cultural , climatic , ecological and other conditions , while sustainability incorporates the notion of long-term availability and accessibility .  
In the field of natural gas , two projects technological and ecological norms , required for the design and operation of the gas distribution networks , and existing standards and regulations on permissible concentrations of harmful components in gaseous fuels and gaseous fuels combustion products have been launched .  
The group is helping to prepare case studies in rural and urban areas on the linkages between ecological factors , disaster preparedness and the level of damages sustained by natural phenomena , as well as to formulate regional projects for presentation to the international community .  
Damage to oil refineries , fuel dumps and chemical and fertilizer factories , as well as the toxic smoke from huge fires and the leakage of harmful chemicals into the soil and the water table have contributed to as yet unassessed levels of environmental pollution in some urban areas , which may in turn have a negative impact on health and ecological systems .  
Underscores that sustainable development depends upon a healthy local , national , regional and global environment and that the United Nations Environment Programme has a major role to play in promoting actions at all levels that are designed to sustain the continued adequate functioning of ecological systems ;  
The Special Rapporteur further recommends State authorities not to take up or continue to engage in development projects that may impair the environment of indigenous lands and / or adversely affect their traditional economic activities , religious ceremonies or cultural heritage , without previously commissioning the appropriate ecological studies to determine the actual negative impact those projects will have .  
The content of adequacy is to some extent determined by prevailing social , economic , cultural , climatic , ecological and other conditions , but there are some core elements which are applicable under all circumstances and are spelled out in greater detail by the Committee .  
The precise meaning of adequacy is to a large extent determined by prevailing social , economic , cultural , climatic , ecological and other conditions , while sustainability incorporates the notion of long-term availability and accessibility .  
Technological and human-induced ecological hazards , such as accidental releases of chemicals in surface water catchments , dumping of toxic and radioactive materials in coastal zones or on the high seas , and hydrological and climatic problems created by excessive withdrawals from large water bodies etc . add to or complicate problems related to natural hazards , particularly in CIS countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia . 
That combination could only be created and maintained for so long because of the perverse mechanism that linked it to external markets ( in the northern states of the USA , by contrast , slavery never took a hold because the ecological conditions for export crops based on plantations were absent ) .  
At the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , the international community reiterated its recognition of the specific constraints faced by small island developing States and the need for particular support in their efforts to advance sustainable development due to their small size and remoteness , ecological fragility , vulnerability to climate change and economic vulnerabilities .  
At the second Consultative Group Meeting for the Reconstruction and Transformation of Central America , co-hosted by the Inter-American Development Bank and the Government of Sweden and held in Stockholm , from 25 to 28 May 1999 , the Governments of the region , the principal donors and civil society representatives renewed their commitment to democratic change and sustainable human development as the best means of reducing social and ecological vulnerability to future disasters .  
A panel of technical experts held during the Consultative Group Meeting , which included representatives from UNICEF and other United Nations organizations , suggested that reducing ecological and social vulnerability to natural hazard is a core regional development issue and that the primary responsibility for reducing vulnerability lies with sectoral institutions and with local communities . 
The group is helping to prepare case studies in rural and urban areas on the linkages between ecological factors , disaster preparedness and the level of damage sustained by natural phenomena , as well as to formulate regional projects for presentation to the international community .  
We see , on the one hand , astounding developments in many fields of human endeavour and , on the other , national and international conflicts , resulting in mass destruction of human life and infrastructure as well as the almost irreversible compromising of the ecological system .  
This shows not only our deep understanding of the importance of this Treaty , but also our desire to make a real contribution towards resolving the problems of nuclear non-proliferation , improving the ecological condition of the planet and strengthening global security and regional stability .  
At the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , the international community reiterated its recognition of the specific constraints faced by small island developing States and the need for particular support in their efforts to advance sustainable development due to their small size and remoteness , ecological fragility , vulnerability to climate change and economic vulnerabilities .  
An ecological branch of the police force was established in 1994 to curb ecological crime , carry out investigations at the request of the public prosecutor , enforce respect of protected areas and prevent the illicit dumping of dangerous and toxic substances which are injurious to the environment and human life and health .  
In 1989 , the ecological organization Greenpeace had revealed the existence of a letter of intent signed by a German waste-processing firm , Pick Up Problems , and these dignitaries in Paraguay , who were acting in a personal capacity , for the export of 1 , 200 , 000 tons of waste which were to be processed in the Chaco region , where there were plans to build an incineration plant .  
CHEC has played an active participatory role in most of the major United Nations global conferences since the early 1970 s , with human ecology introducing Commonwealth professionals , international and national NGOs and Governments to the connections between social , economic and ecological systems and human development .  
The economic , ecological , social and cultural systems of small island developing States are fragile and highly sensitive to external environmental , social and economic change .  
Such a decision ignored the erosion of trade preferences , the CARICOM countries ecological and economic vulnerability and the fact that most of their economies lacked the resilience to recover quickly from natural disasters which could obliterate their physical infrastructure , industrial base and agricultural assets . 
Forest valuation should reflect the social , cultural , economic and ecological context and consider values that are important to local and / or indigenous communities , private forest owners , gender aspects , and distributional impacts .  
Urged countries to engage in raising awareness of the ecological , social , cultural and economic roles that planted and natural forests might fulfil in the rehabilitation and sustainable management of forests in environmentally critical areas ;  
It was evident , however , that the results obtained had been modest and that new measures were required in order to improve regulation and prevent the adoption of protectionist measures based on technical , health , social or ecological criteria .  
The third assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was cited , which underscored that human activities are affecting the Earths climate , with potentially significant ecological and economic effects , and that it would be necessary to understand the interrelationships between transportation systems , technology and local and global atmospheric effects as the way forward is being planned . 
Global Education Associates ( GEA ) is an association of individual and institutional associates in more than 90 countries , working to advance global systems that will ensure ecological integrity , peace , human rights , economic and social well-being , and democratic participation , with special care to include the voices and perspectives of poor and marginalized people of diverse cultural and religious traditions . 
Acknowledging also the special economic and social importance of the Danube River and its tributaries as a major European river with multiple uses and functions , as well as its ecological significance and its value as a natural habitat for numerous wildlife species ,  
To do this , we must : ( i ) maintain the integrity of ecosystems and the continued health of the planets life-support system which sustain the productivity , adaptability of renewal of all life ; ( ii ) maintain biological diversity in the variety of life on which ecological processes depend processes that provide a stream of current and future benefits to human beings ; and ( iii ) ensure sustainable population dynamics ( size of population , growth rate and distribution ) , as it often exerts pressures on the environment .  
The Ministers noted with appreciation enhanced CEI cooperation in the fields of promoting sustainable social , economic and ecological development , infrastructure and private sector investment , SME development , transborder and interregional cooperation ( such as the enhanced Szeged Process ) , human resource development , cultural as well as scientific and technological cooperation ( such as the Italian-Slovenian transfrontier television project ) , including in the field of geodesy , combating organized crime , protection of minorities , womens entrepreneurship and youth affairs .  
Emphasizing also , as documented by the United Nations Environment Programme , that ecological crises facing humanity are deeply rooted in a complex web of political , economic , social , technological as well as inadequate societal attitudes , belief systems and perceptions ,  
At the crossroads of three continents , the Mediterranean is in a state of constant tension and must cope with major political , economic , ecological and demographic challenges , let alone a host of global social scourges that affect this region .  
The interlinkages between international migration and development were complex in the sense that they brought into play a multiplicity of factors economic , technological , demographic , social , ecological , historical and cultural depending on regional characteristics .  
The first victims of whatever military actions are undertaken will be the billions of people living in the poor and underdeveloped world , with their unbelievably serious economic and social problems , their unpayable debts and the ruinous prices of their basic commodities ; their growing natural and ecological disasters ; their hunger and extreme poverty ; the massive undernourishment of their children , teenagers and adults ; their terrible AIDS epidemic ; and their malaria , tuberculosis and infectious diseases , which threaten whole nations with extermination .  
To reduce the level of vulnerability to natural disasters based on planning instruments such as ecological and economic land management ; and to promote a culture of risk awareness to further their prevention and mitigation through educational processes and improved information and early warning systems while encouraging participation on the part of civil society .  
The role of science and engineering in the current policy-making process at national and global levels regarding the three pillars of sustainable development social , economic and ecological is insufficient .  
Forest management is the stewardship and use of forests in a way , and at a rate , that maintains their biodiversity , productivity , regeneration capacity , vitality and potential to fulfil , now and in the future , relevant ecological , economic and social functions , at local , national and global levels , and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems ;  
The leader of the project , Dai Sirui , from Southwest Agricultural University , said the project involved the study and demonstration of key technologies of people 's working and living , ecological problems , city waste water and garbage disposal , landslide monitoring warning , pasture and husbandry sectors ' development , advantageous and unique sector 's development , and ecological and economic system reconstruction after the Three Gorges Dam conserved water .  
The expert evaluation panel , including Professor Chen Huanchun from Huazhong Agricultural University who was also a member of the Academy of Engineering , said research of these key technologies had reached an advanced level domestically and some were leading the world level , which offered firm technological backing to the ecological environment as well as the social and economic development of the Three Gorges Dam area .  
The desert around Qinghai Lake is increasing at an average of 10.12 square kilometers annually .  Dunes , in particular , on the western bank of the lake came into being over the last decade and have become an area with the fastest desertification .  The wetland 's ecological system has been damaged with the biological diversity decreasing .  
With regard to ecological protection , the law stipulates : The destruction of public welfare forests , mangrove forests , wetlands , and natural scenery resources protected by law by any unit and individual is prohibited .  The engagement in activities that endanger the survival of rare ocean species of Xiamen and species inside state-level reserves by any unit and individual are prohibited .  
The basic framework of the study includes : The current population situation and developmental conditions of the Yangtze Delta Region , the regional property development , the developmental trends in property structure and employment population , the developmental trends in urbanization and the development of cities , the total population and the ecological carrying capacity of population resources , the aging of the population , and the social security system of urban and rural areas .  
and carry out internal restructuring of overall agriculture , by " returning farmland to forest " in mountain areas , " returning farmland to grassland " in pastoral areas , and " returning farmland to fishery " in lake areas ; that is , we should abandon the method of developing agriculture and grain production at the cost of sacrificing the ecological environment , and open up a broad space for increasing new products that suit the demand of the international market and have competitive advantage .  
At the same time , when we intensify our efforts in the implementation of the natural forest protection project , we should also experiment with the practice of gradually returning the grain plots to forestry and husbandry in a well-planned way , do a good job in protecting and building a sound ecological environment , clothe barren mountains and wasteland with greenery , restore the vegetation cover , and bring gradual changes to the deteriorating ecological environment in the western region .  
In light of Hainan 's actual conditions , we have defined " one province , two localities " as our industrial development strategy and the construction of Hainan to be a symbol of an ecological province as our sustainable development strategy .  We have also defined the strategy of promoting reform and development through opening to the outside world and the strategy of invigorating Hainan on the strength of science and education .  Hainan will make more rapid and steady strides with still firmer confidence .  
We should increase our support of expenditures in the public welfare area to ensure that science and technology , education , social security , agriculture , ecological conservation , and other key areas and fields have the necessary funds to meet their expenditure needs .  We should increase our financial support for the establishment of a disaster prevention system , for projects designed to protect natural forests and to return grain plots to forestry , for poverty relief work , and for raising the peasants ' income .  
Drawing a lesson from the bitter experience , Hainan has since then set sights on its good ecological environment and its unique resources and re-established the industrial strategy of building itself as a base of tropical and high-efficiency agriculture and as an island tourist resort .  At the same time , it has developed high-technology , high-value-added , and high-efficiency industry which does not cause pollution , does not require redundant construction , and does not destroy resources .  
Key topics discussed by the deputies in their speeches were active efforts to seize the great opportunities presented to Sichuan by the development of the western region , exploitation of resources , ecological protection , economic structural adjustment , better incomes for the peasants , and vigorous efforts to develop scientific educational undertakings .  
Deputies Chen Dejing , Huang Xuejiu , Zhang Zuoha , and Li Lemin respectively expressed their opinions and made suggestions on the issues of how to strengthen water conservancy construction when developing the western region , development of high and new technological industries ; accelerating the development of educational undertakings in ethnic regions ; and strengthening ecological environmental protection during the development of western region .  
In view of this , we feel it a must to integrate the work of returning grain plots with the development of the rural economy , and with the task of extricating peasants from poverty and making them rich ; and a must to find practical and earnest solutions to major problems that are most concerned by the masses , such as sufficient food and firewood as well as increases in their income .  Only in this way can we do a good job in protecting the ecological environment from the basics .  
Proceeding from the special needs of the economic and social development in China 's western region , we should lay stress on the spread and application of improved varieties of agricultural products , dry farming and water-economizing farming , a comprehensive utilization of resources , new materials and new energies , and advanced technologies in the aspect of ecological environmental protection .  
Delegate Zhou Benli said Anhui , although a central region province , should also seize opportunities and accelerate its own development to take part in the grand development of China 's western regions .  Anhui should not only step up infrastructure construction and accelerate the pace of structural readjustment but also effect the spread and transfer of industrial sectors in a selected way , cooperate with western regions to do well in ecological environment protection and construction , implement the strategy of " marching to the east and west , " and energetically develop the market .  
Practice over the past 21 years has proved that the policy of " the whole society engaging in afforestation and the whole nation committed to turning the country green " has brought into play the superiority of the socialist system and suits the actual condition of our country , which is faced with an arduous task of ecological building but lacks capital .  It has also significantly increased people 's awareness of the need to keep the country green .  
We should continue to uphold the principle of attaching simultaneous attention to preventing and improving pollution and protecting the ecology , strive to control the total discharge of pollutants and strengthen pollution prevention and treatment in major cities , rivers and regional sea areas in a bid to improve environmental quality and promote ecological balance .  
Now , the vast majority of the rest of the poor are those living in remote areas which are hard to get to and lacking in resources and where the ecological environment is extremely bad .  
Zeng Peiyan said : We must control population growth , protect and develop the ecological environment , and save and effectively utilize resources to truly base economic and social development on constant scientific and technological advancement , the sustained utilization of resources , an ecological balance , and a clean environment .  
It is necessary to make use of the unique ecological resources of the western region , strengthen the building of the ecological environment , focus efforts on developing agriculture with special characteristics , water-saving agriculture and ecological agriculture , and promote the processing of agricultural products to increase their added value so that more agricultural products will be sold to the international market .  
The deterioration of the ecological environment is severely jeopardizing and hampering the sustainable development of our national economy and society .  Improving the ecological environment has become an urgent requirement of economic and social development and the effort to improve the people 's standard of living .  
Tian Fengshan said : The Ministry of Land and Natural Resources has initially formulated an " outline for development and utilization of land and natural resources in the western region " to ensure that the tapping of minerals and use of underground water will be handled in coordination with the work of ecological protection and returning grain plots to other uses in an orderly manner .  
Tian Fengshan finally told this reporter : In the foreseeable future , the Ministry of Land and Natural Resources will strengthen work in four fields to cope with the needs of large-scale development of the western region : First , we will strengthen the investigation and evaluation of the situation of land and natural resources in China 's western region so as to provide information for economic construction in the western region , especially the rational planning of infrastructure facilities , and to support the harnessing of major rivers , protection of ecological environment and prevention of disasters . 
Carrying out a positive fiscal policy , strengthening infrastructure construction , supporting agricultural basic construction and construction for the ecological environment , supporting economic restructuring , speeding up the development of hi-tech industry , revamping old industrial bases and traditional industries , practicing the policy of rejuvenating the nation through science and education and the strategy of sustainable development , and establishing a social security system all require corresponding increase of input and state financial support .  
In the course of economic globalization , floating capital is mainly controlled by the financial and business magnates of Western developed countries .  While the environment issue in Western countries has increasingly become a popular concern , to reap super profits , these magnates moved their enterprises that promise high profits but cause serious pollution to developing countries , thus sparking a global ecological crisis .  
At the same time , in the roadway development for the western region , we must put intense emphasis on ecological and environmental protection and management , protecting cultivated lands , economizing on land use , and industriously integrating roadway development with the improvement of the surrounding environment .  We do this in order to improve the ecology and environment of the west , and to contribute to the enhancement of environmental quality .  
The input into the construction of ecological construction has been noticeably increased .  The engineering projects of returning grain plots to forestry and protecting natural forests and the projects of harnessing " three rivers " ( Huaihe River , Liaohe River , and Haihe River ) and " three lakes " ( Taihu Lake , Dianchi Lake , and Chaohu Lake ) have obtained phased achievements .  The environmental quality in urban areas has improved and the sense of environmental protection among the whole people has noticeably enhanced .  
The state has increased the intensity of investment in the ecological construction , carried out the natural forest protection project in a comprehensive way , activated the experimental project of returning land unfit for cultivation to forestry , prevented and controlled desertification , engaged in the work of soil and water conservation vigorously , controlled the water pollution in some major rivers to reach the targets within the time limit , and took the perpetual use of natural resources and the coordinated development of economy and environment more seriously than ever before .  
Zhou Yongkang said : According to the arrangements made by the Sichuan provincial party committee and provincial government , in the next 10 years , Sichuan 's general objective of speeding up economic development is to build up an ecological shield in the upper valley of the Chang Jiang , effect coordinated economic and social development , and make development by leaps and bounds to turn Sichuan into an economically advanced province . 
the legal system of market economy is still unsound , the phenomenon of corruption is spread wide , and there are plenty of ecological environmental problems and so on .  All these are pressing practical issues with an impact on our country 's national economic and social development , which must be tackled through market-oriented reforms .  
To impose one 's own favored undiversified model on others can only artificially destroy social and political ecological equilibrium , a course of action which is neither rational not feasible .  
If we say that since the 1963 National Agro-technology Conference , we have solved the problem of increasing agricultural output , then this session of the National Agro-technology Conference made a strategic adjustment to the direction of the development of agro-technology .  It sets the direction for the development of agricultural technology with optimizing the structure of agriculture , raising agricultural efficiency , improving the rural ecological environment , and strengthening capabilities in the sustainable development of agriculture as the main points for resolving the problem of developing agricultural efficiency .  
As a developing country with a huge population , China is short on per capita resources and has practiced extensive development for years .  Despite its low income level , therefore , China is forced to deal with those problems that other countries did not have to tackle until their incomes reached a high level .  China 's resource and ecological situation is very grim .  
All sectors of the society , all cadres and the masses must adopt the perspective of the strategy of a strong nation , prosperous people , and peaceful world and fully recognize the extreme importance of protecting and reasonably utilizing natural resources .  Furthermore , protecting natural resources and optimizing the ecological environment must become conscious actions .  
It is necessary to actively promote legal administration , to intensify law enforcement inspections , to strengthen law enforcement oversight , to firmly implement the principles of following existing laws , strict law enforcement , and tracking down offenses against the law , to curb waste and destruction of resources , and to effectively improve the ecological environment in order to provide effective guarantees for sustainable economic and social development .  
The state has decided to make infrastructure construction the base , strengthening the protection and construction of the ecological environment the main content , grasping the readjustment of the industrial structure the key , developing scientific and technological education the basic condition , and thorough reform and expanded open up the strong driving force of development .  
On the one hand , the troops should participate in and support the ecological and environmental constructions , and on the other hand , they should take the lead to clean up the sources of pollution and focus on the comprehensive treatment of the garrisons ' everyday waste water , the oil-polluted water used to clean equipment , the waste water discharged from hospitals and clinics , and smoke and dust emission from boilers and so on to make sure that the sources of pollution will meet the emission and discharge standards after the treatment .  
Over the past few years , in particular , under the conditions of a large base figure of population , limited per capita resources , and relatively backward economic and scientific and technological levels , our rapid economic development has brought enormous pressures to the originally weak ecological environment , so that the situation in environment is even grimmer .  
To solve the problem of " insufficient services " from the government in the course of structural adjustment , the party committee and government of Linyi County have intensified market forecast and perspective study , put forward the objectives of building Linyi into a " large agricultural county free of environmental pollution " , and led the peasants in developing ecological agriculture , unique agriculture , sophisticated agriculture , and agriculture in which production is carried out on orders .  
He said that party committees and governments at all levels in Sichuan have seriously implemented a series of central principles and policies to strengthen the protection and improvement of the ecological environment , taken the lead in launching the project to protect natural forests and making experiments on returning farmland to forests , taken prompt actions with a resolute attitude , done solid work and adopted effective measures .  They have enabled the people to consciously implement the party 's policies , accumulated much successful experience , and attained remarkable achievements .  
Zhu Rongji emphasized that at present , the supply of grain and industrial consumer goods is greater than demand and this has provided a golden opportunity for returning farmland land to forests and improving the ecological environment .  We must firmly grasp this rare opportunity and actively and prudently push forward work in this respect .  
By guiding foreign investment toward infrastructural construction , the exploration of mineral resources , the development of tourist resources , the ecological environmental protection , the agricultural and livestock products processing , the transformation of existing production capacities , and to such scientific and technological projects as the development and manufacturing of new-type electronic components in its western region , China will provide a host of investment and trade opportunities for foreign investors , said Deng Zhan .  
Second , in order to expand domestic demand , should give 900-million farmers priority in benefiting from infrastructure investment that the state should be making in the countryside , including increasing road networks , water supply networks , electric supply networks , communications networks and radio and television networks between cities and the countryside , as well as inputs for the fundamental construction of farms , water conservancy and the ecological environment in the countryside , absorbing as many temporary farmers as possible and creating more employment opportunities for them .  
Investment by the state and financial aid from the central government are primarily used for the construction of relevant facilities in farming and animal husbandry industries , infrastructure , scientific and technological education and political power at the grass-roots levels , as well as protection and construction of the ecological environment , all with stress on solving " bottleneck " and prominent difficulties restricting the development of Tibet .  
The two parties will cooperate in protecting and improving the environment , in preventing cross-border pollution , in the fair and rational use of biological resources in waters in the border area and in the north Pacific and border river courses , and will work together to protect rare plants and animals and the natural ecological system in the border areas , and cooperate in preventing natural disasters and major accidents arising from technical causes and in eliminating their consequences .  
Despite Pronk 's proposal not being completely satisfactory , developing countries , keeping in mind the general interests of improving the international ecological environment , finally agreed to accept Pronk 's proposal in order to enable the " Kyoto Protocol " to go into force at an early date and to compel developed countries to take practical and effective measures to reduce greenhouse gases emissions .  
However , if Western developed countries continue to turn a blind eye to the global wide gap between the rich and the poor , large quantity of unemployment , and ecological damage , and if they continue to turn a deaf ear to the voice of developing countries and ordinary people , President Bush perhaps will see more miserable tragedies in greater numbers , and it will also be difficult for the United States not to get involved .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out that during the " Ninth Five-Year Plan , " through comprehensive agricultural development , we improved agricultural production conditions , protected and improved the ecological environment , raised comprehensive agricultural production capabilities and efficiency , and increased agricultural citizen income .  We thus made important contributions to the historical transformation from the long-term deficiency in chief agricultural products to an overall balance and years of surplus .  In our practice we also created many effective experiences .  
We upheld the comprehensive management of earth resources , and the comprehensive development of agriculture , forestry , animal husbandry and semi-aquatics .  In regard to inputs of manpower , financial power , material resources , and science and technology , we realized the integrated raising of agricultural economic efficiency , ecological efficiency , and social efficiency .  
We must widen the extent of ecological and environmental construction in key areas including the areas around Beijing and Tianjin , the Hebei region , the Inner Mongolia region , and the northwest region .  We thus will make contributions to improving the environmental quality of the entire country , especially the region surrounding Beijing . c . )  
This development has rescued the " Kyoto Protocol " which is facing the danger of falling apart , has established operable guidelines for the protection of the global environment on which humans depend on to exist , and is of a great significance to improving the world 's climatic conditions and ecological system .  
We want to basically curb the trend toward worsening ecological damages and environmental pollution on land and in the rivers and the oceans .  We want to begin to improve the urban and rural environmental qualities and tentatively set up a comprehensive ecological and environmental monitoring and warning system .  We want to boost our disaster prevention and reduction capabilities and further raise the level of comprehensive resource utilization .  
In view of this , we should make a full use of abundant local animal and plant resources , act in line with the requirement of seeking a unity between economic efficiency and ecological efficiency , and gear ourselves to the needs of the market and rely on scientific and technological advances .  We should intensify the structural adjustment of agriculture and the rural economy ; vigorously develop a highly efficient production of fine-quality medicinal materials , special foodstuffs , and green foodstuffs ;  
Some localities have planned to increase investment , and others have begun returning land unfit for farming to forestry and animal husbandry , raising the curtain on ecological construction .  Braving the piercingly cold wind , quite a few cadres from the western region went to the eastern and southern parts of the country , busying themselves with the introduction of projects .  
to look into and put forward proposals regarding rural economic development , key infrastructure construction , protection and building of the ecological environment , restructuring , resource exploitation , and the arrangement of major projects , and to organize and coordinate the enactment and implementation of plans for returning farmland to forest ( grassland ) ;  
With a view to enhancing the economic returns of their agricultural products , all provinces and autonomous regions in the western region should base themselves on each 's local geographic , climatic , and resource conditions ; and develop a specialty agriculture in the light of each 's local conditions , including an ecological agriculture , water-economizing agriculture , and an agriculture of " two highs and one superior . "  At the same time , they should also rely on scientific and technological progresses , and heighten the scientific and technological contents of agriculture .  
Tian pointed out : The western regions are rich in natural resources but have a rather fragile ecological environment .  In particular , they are short of river resources and have suffered from serious soil erosion .  Thus the scientific and technological units and scientific and education personnel should directly participate in the work of harnessing soil erosion and building the ecological environment .  
Fifth , speaking of the country 's agricultural development , China has adopted a comprehensive policy of readjusting the internal industrial structure of agriculture , promoting an industrialized operation of agriculture , paying close attention to the building of the ecological environment , and speeding up the development of small cities and towns ; and has moved to resolve problems that are currently existing among its peasants and in its rural areas and agriculture .  
We should adhere to the basic national policies of family planning , environmental protection , and energy conservation , increase the intensity of implementing the sustainable development strategy , control the population growth , protect and construct ecological environment , and economize on and effectively use resources so that economic and social development is genuinely built on the bases of continuous progress of science and technology , rational utilization of resources , and constant improvement of ecological environment .  
To enable China 's agriculture to make positive reactions to the opportunities and challenges brought about by China 's participation in WTO and at the same time , support the great development of China 's west and protect agricultural resources and ecological environment , the National People 's Congress [ NPC ] will quicken the pace of agricultural legislation , more intensively formulate laws and regulations to meet urgent needs , and to make timely reexamination and revision of the laws and regulations which are not suited to the development of the situation .  
At present , the work of formulating laws and regulations should be focused on the issues of promoting the structural adjustment and industrialization in agriculture ; standardizing the rural market , the rural cooperatives , and the joint-stock cooperative system in rural areas ; protecting peasants ' legitimate rights and interests ; supporting and protecting agricultural development ; supporting the development of the western region ; protecting agricultural resources and the ecological environment , and promoting social development in rural areas .  
Some localities have planned to increase investment , and others have begun returning land unfit for farming to forestry and animal husbandry , raising the curtain on ecological construction .  Braving the piercingly cold wind , quite a few cadres from the western region went to the eastern and southern parts of the country , busying themselves with the introduction of projects .  
to look into and put forward proposals regarding rural economic development , key infrastructure construction , protection and building of the ecological environment , restructuring , resource exploitation , and the arrangement of major projects , and to organize and coordinate the enactment and implementation of plans for returning farmland to forest ( grassland ) ;  
With a view to enhancing the economic returns of their agricultural products , all provinces and autonomous regions in the western region should base themselves on each 's local geographic , climatic , and resource conditions ; and develop a specialty agriculture in the light of each 's local conditions , including an ecological agriculture , water-economizing agriculture , and an agriculture of " two highs and one superior . "  At the same time , they should also rely on scientific and technological progresses , and heighten the scientific and technological contents of agriculture .  
Tian pointed out : The western regions are rich in natural resources but have a rather fragile ecological environment .  In particular , they are short of river resources and have suffered from serious soil erosion .  Thus the scientific and technological units and scientific and education personnel should directly participate in the work of harnessing soil erosion and building the ecological environment .  
Fifth , speaking of the country 's agricultural development , China has adopted a comprehensive policy of readjusting the internal industrial structure of agriculture , promoting an industrialized operation of agriculture , paying close attention to the building of the ecological environment , and speeding up the development of small cities and towns ; and has moved to resolve problems that are currently existing among its peasants and in its rural areas and agriculture .

Li Tieying stressed : The development of the western regions is a massive and systematic project involving ecological environmental protection , infrastructure construction , industrial restructuring , scientific and technological education , reform and opening up , and ethnic and religious issues .  
Chongqing will invest 20.4 billion yuan on the project .  Its various key ecological enhancement tasks include protecting natural forests , reverting cultivated farmland to forests or grasslands , afforesting barren hills and slopes , and remedying soil erosion .  
Introducing the practice of a comprehensive agricultural development which mainly aims at strengthening the building of basic agricultural facilities , protecting and improving the ecological environment , and developing a high-quality agriculture with a high yield and a high efficiency conforms to the requirements of the WTO 's " green box " policy ; and is also an important way for the government to support and protect agriculture at a time when China 's agriculture is heading for internationalization , he stressed .  
He pointed out : In the new stage , the major tasks for China 's comprehensive agricultural development are to continue strengthening agricultural infrastructure construction , support and promote agricultural structural readjustment , actively push forward agricultural scientific and technological advancement , and protect and improve the ecological environment .  
Xiang Huaicheng stressed : In comprehensive agricultural development , we must abide by the natural law and strengthen ecological environmental development to bring about sustainable economic and social development .  
Wang Shucheng , minister of water resources , indicated that the contradictions between shortage of water resources and accelerated economic development have become increasingly larger over the past few years .  Besides the shortage of water for agricultural and industrial production and domestic use , the drought has directly worsened the ecological environment .  
In order to meet with the challenges , it is imperative for the Chinese government to make some adjustments to its economic policies , vigorously develop modern agriculture , and quicken the tempo of agricultural modernization , upgrading of industrial structure , construction of infrastructure facilities , protection of ecological environment , and development of the central and western regions .  
Li Peng , member of the Standing Committee of the political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the NPC Standing Committee , stressed at the forum : In developing the western regions , we must properly handle relations between economic development and environmental protection ; ensure a benign cycle for resources exploitation and ecological protection ; and leave our future generations with space for sustainable development .  
We should develop the western regions on a large scale and with firm efforts by proceeding in a planned and orderly way and advancing step by step ; should properly handle relations between economic development and environmental protection ; and should never sabotage ecological environment in this process .  
Actively seek to create the conditions for improvement of the ecological environment of the western area , for improvement of plant and animal products , and for restructuring the agricultural industry .  Introduce superior foreign breeding stock , poultry chicks , seeds , seedlings , and such , into the western area , and give priority technical support to the entry and quarantine inspection of them .  
The radioactive pollution resulting from the unlimited use of uranium-poor bombs in the war , together with the pollution and poison-bearing smoke and clouds caused by the accidental bombings of refineries , fertilizer plants , and pharmaceutical factories , has brought to Yugoslavia and the entire Balkan Peninsula a long-term ecological crisis hard to wipe out , resulting in persistent genetic freaks , leukemia , lung cancer , and other abnormal diseases .  
In doing the anti-drought work , we must make overall plans , take all factors into consideration , bring about temporary as well as permanent solutions to the problem , and give comprehensive treatment by combining engineering measures with biological measures and management measures , combining capital construction of water conservancy works with construction of ecological environment , and combining rational development with strict protection and scientific utilization in a bid to properly manage , protect , and utilize the limited water resources .  
At the same time , it is necessary to step up environmental protection and ecological construction in the dam area , do a good and steady job in the resettlement of local people , and intensify the restructuring of enterprises moved from the area , so as to achieve coordinated development of economic and social undertakings and of ecological environment construction in the dam area .  
The meeting pointed out that improving environmental protection and ecological construction in the dam area is of great practical and historic significance for implementing the central strategy on major development of west China , ensuring the normal operation of the pivotal three gorges project , promoting sustainable development in the dam area , and creating a good image of the project .  
At present and for a time to come , it is necessary to speed up the progress of projects for dealing with water pollution and garbage in the dam area , vigorously carry out projects for natural forest protection , step up comprehensive measures to deal with soil erosion , develop ecological agriculture , and build the dam area into a new-style economic zone with flourishing economy , green hills and clear waters , and beautiful environment , where people are happy to live and work .  
In the Drought Agriculture Ecology Laboratory , which is a key state project , a young professor gave Jiang Zemin an account of one of their scientific research achievements : In view of the unique drought and cold geographical conditions of the west region , Professor Zhao Songlin , the first director of the laboratory , proposed a brand new idea of developing " catchment type ecological agriculture , " which was successful in practice .  
The effective protection and rational utilization of scenic and historical resources are of great importance to the improvement of the ecological environment , the development of tourism , the promotion of ethnic culture , the stimulation of patriotic passion , and the enrichment of people 's cultural life .  
have intensified our financial support for social security system building ; have continually increased our input in agricultural , forestry , water conservancy , as well as ecological or environmental protection projects ; have comprehensively implemented the CPC Central Committee 's decision on banning the army , the armed police , or the political and legal affairs organs from engaging in commercial activities ;  
intensified the support of the treasury for the development of the social security system ; continued to increase the input into agriculture , forestry , and water resources management , as well as the protection of the ecological environment ; comprehensively implemented the decision taken by the CPC Central Committee to stop armed forces , the armed police force , and political and judicial organs from engaging in business activities ;  
Since the proactive fiscal policy was put into practice in the second half of 1998 , the Chinese Government has cumulatively issued around 270 billion yuan worth of additional treasury bonds and the funds raised through the bonds have mainly been used for infrastructure construction , technological transformation , environmental protection and ecological projects , and the construction of educational and cultural facilities .  
It has rich natural resources , diverse plant and animal species , a beautiful ecological environment , inhabitants comprising of many nationalities , and very broad prospects for international cooperation and development .  
The " headlong mass action " has laid emphasis on the surface form but neglected the realistic work , giving rise to the " tofukasu project . "  This brings nothing but harm to the ongoing ecological construction .  
Qian Qichen pointed out that protecting and improving the ecological environment and improving the environmental quality is an important task that must be accomplished in developing the western region .  
Both economic development and the improvement in the ecological environment should depend on progress in science and technology .  Only through using new science and technology achievements to transform the traditional industries , developing high-tech industries , and continuously enabling technology to develop by leaps and bounds will it be possible to gradually narrow the gap between the western region and the developed region .  
In particular , the city should pay attention to depending on and applying new scientific and technological achievements to intensify the building of infrastructure , the development of energy resources , and building in an ecological environment .  The city should also vigorously plant trees and grass , endeavor to make its urban environment beautiful , enhance the level and efficiency of development and construction , and make sustained efforts to build itself into a major base that supports the development of Qaidam Basin .  
China will greatly promote the strategic readjustment of its economic structure , accelerate the computerization of the national economic and social sectors , greatly develop science , education , and cultural undertakings , step up developing such new and high technologies like information technology , biotechnology , new material technology , and advanced manufacturing technology , further step up infrastructure building in water conservancy , communications , and energy , and intensify efforts on ecological building and environmental protection .  
In deciding on relevant projects , it is necessary to give overall consideration to economic benefit , social benefit and ecological benefit so as to bring about a coordinated development of natural resources , ecology , economy , population and society in the western region .  
To Effectively control the population scale is conducive to relaxing the pressure of the population on the weak ecological environment and the economic and social development , to improving the population quality and structure , and to increasing manpower and capital of the western region .  It is necessary to strengthen consciousness and the sense of urgency of correctly handling the relationship between development and population control .  
Centering on this major topic of discussion , the members of the Central Committee will discuss various issues , such as adjusting the economic structure ; quickening the pace of reforming state-owned enterprises , the administrative management structure , the organizational structure , and the personnel system for cadres ; and putting forward concrete plans for finishing infrastructure construction in western China and transforming the ecological environment .  
Qian Qichen said : Shanxi Province boasts very rich tourist resources .  In recent years , Shanxi has entered tourism into the list of the province 's superior industries , increased the work intensity of transforming the advantages in tourist resources into the industrial advantages , initially formed a few tourist zones with special characteristics , and taken firm control of the tourist infrastructure construction , environmental protection , ecological construction , historical relics protection , and the deep-level development of tourist serial products , with a view to repeatedly optimizing and upgrading tourism .  
According to the report , the " substantive " steps made in the large-scale western development since the beginning of this year include : Formulating and introducing the unified policies for the western development , losing no time in drafting the overall plan for the western development , carrying out the work to accelerate infrastructure construction , speeding up the work of ecological environment protection and construction , and intensifying the scientific and technological and educational work , among other things .  
In the meantime , the report points out that this year , the state has focused on 19 projects to be selected as the demonstration projects of high-tech industrialization in the western region , in a bid to support the local environmental protection , ecological construction , and transformation of advantageous resources for value appreciation , with the total investment amounting to nearly 2.4 billion yuan .  
Wu Bangguo pointed out : " Closing coal pits and reducing production " and eliminating backward production capacity are aimed at creating external conditions for helping Datong Coal Mine end deficits and eliminate difficulties .  In addition , this is also an essential requirement for Shanxi Province to adjust economic structure , raise economic efficiency , and improve the ecological environment , and is an important link for successfully running state-owned key coal enterprises .  We must be determined to firmly grasp this work well .  
China has also instituted a strategy of sustainable development ; while vigorously promoting sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development , China has made efforts to ensure the sustainable use and protection of its natural resources , to ultimately achieve coordinated economic and ecological development .  
Through conducting in-depth investigation and study and earnest inspection and argumentation , the provincial party committee and government has elaborately formulated a development plan and proposed to build Sichuan into an economically powerful province in the western region in China as well as an ecological defense for the upper reaches of the Changjiang River through making efforts for 10 years and realize a coordinated economic and social development .  
The Chongqing Municipality has proposed to make efforts to do well four major things like the task of migrating people out of the Three Gorges Reservoir areas , the reform and development of state-owned enterprises , the development of rural economy , and the construction of ecological environments , take an active part in the Big West Development , constantly strengthen its economic strength and city functions , and strive to realize the strategic objective of " building Chongqing into an economic center in the upper reaches of the Changjiang River . "  
Sichuan has actively implemented the strategic policy decisions of the central authorities regarding the " great development of the western region , " and has put forth the overall working idea of building Sichuan - - with 10 years of struggle - - into an economic powerhouse province in China 's western region and an ecological barrier in the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang , of harmoniously developing the economy and society , and of realizing new strides . 
Wen Jiabao said that in the past 20 years , China has persistently taken economic construction as the center , constantly increased its comprehensive national strength , and laid a solid material and technical foundation of environmental protection and ecological construction .  
This year alone , the funds used by the central finance in the key ecological projects such as returning cultivated land unfit for grain production to forestry reached 18.8 billion yuan , which has almost doubled last year 's figure .  According to Xiang Huaicheng , minister of finance , more than 91 million mu of cultivated land will become plots of luxuriant vegetation so that the Chinese nation will suffer fewer catastrophes caused by yellow sand .  
The circular said : Currently and in the near future , the key tasks in implementing the policy of the great development of the western region are : speeding up infrastructure construction , stepping up ecological and environmental protection and building , strengthening agriculture 's position as the basic industry , adjusting the industrial structure , developing tourism featuring special attractions of the western region , and developing science and technology education and cultural and public health work .  
. facing this unprecedented ecological crisis , we must establish an intense sense of historical responsibility , premising our actions on the future development of mankind , taking as our starting point the sustainable development of our posterity and future generations , and pursuing a comprehensive approach and taking action .  
These are the key tasks in the development of the west now and in the foreseeable future : Accelerate infrastructural construction , step up ecological and environmental protection , consolidate the status of agriculture as the base , adjust the industrial structure , develop specialty tourism , and develop scientific , technological , education , cultural , and public health undertakings .  
Vice Minister of Agriculture Liu Chengguo said : From now on , the coastal areas and outskirts of large and medium-sized cities in east China will mainly be engaged in the production of cash crops with a high value-added and specialty farm produce for export ; the central region will lay particular emphasis on giving play to its advantages in producing premium grain , special-purpose grain , and feed grain ; and the western region will return the grain plots to forestry and husbandry and vigorously develop ecological agriculture .  
and commercial housing .  In 1999 and 2000 , the state separately issued another 110 billion yuan 's and 150 billion yuan 's worth of long-term construction bonds , and while making arrangements to continue the state bond-funded projects already under construction , some new projects were added .  They included some technological transformation projects in key trades and industries , the installation of Chinese-made equipment in major projects and the industrialization of advanced technologies , some environmental and ecological construction projects , and some educational infrastructure projects .  
The large-scale project to return grain plots to forestry and pasture is being implemented in the western region as a permanent solution to the adverse ecological conditions in the west .  Some 70 million mu of cultivated land with a slope of more than 25 degrees in the upper reaches of Chang Jiang and the upper and middle reaches of Huang He will all be returned and planted with trees and grass .  
In the coming 10 to 15 years , we must strive by every possible means to resolve the scientific and technological problems in terms of optimizing agricultural structure , heightening agricultural efficiency , improving rural ecological environment , augmenting international competitive power , and so on to facilitate the fundamental change of agriculture from mainly seeking quantity to stressing quality and efficiency .  
It is necessary to vigorously work hard at ecological environment protection and construction , with the focus on closing the hillsides to grow trees , returning farmland to forest and pasture , and preventing the formation of stone deserts in stony mountain areas ; we must persist in seeking truth from facts , act in light of local conditions , and make active and steady progress .  
The western areas should proceed from their actual conditions , make full use of the preference policies of the state in shifting more financial input to the western areas , more effectively implement the strategy of " relying on science and education for national regeneration , " first make substantial developments in the fields of science and technology , education , infrastructure construction , and ecological environmental construction , and thus lay a solid foundation for comprehensive economic development and social progress in the future .  
2 ) It took actual steps to protect forestry resources by taking decisive measures to prohibit logging in the natural woodlands on the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang and the Huang He .  3 ) It gave top priority to improving the ecological environment during the course of developing western China ;  
In the development of western China , procuratorial organs in western China prosecuted more than 300 cases relevant to crimes committed in handling key construction projects , ravaging the ecological environment , and mismanaging money and goods meant for people stricken by poverty and natural disasters ; and authorized the arrest of 3,891 criminal suspects who destroyed communications , energy , or telecommunications infrastructure or ravaged the ecological environment .  
Deputy Shu Huiguo , who had been engaged in research on strategies for the development of the ecological economy for years , said : The ecological economy has become the trend of world economic development , and green barriers have constituted a new protection network for trade in the international market .  With green mountains and clear waters , Jiangxi is rich in resources ; it is less polluted and has a good ecological environment ;  
Shu Huiguo stressed : Developing an ecological economy is an inevitable choice for Jiangxi in order to bring about great-leap-forward economic development in the 10th Five-Year Plan period .  In the coming five years , Jiangxi should put the strategy of sustainable development in an ever more salient place .  Jiangxi should focus on building " a province famous for its ecological economy " and do solid work in this regard ;  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that in environmental protection work it is necessary to understand the long-term , arduous , and complex nature of controlling pollution and improving the environment ; while maintaining sustained and healthy economic development , we must achieve some improvement in the state of environmental pollution , curb the trend of ecological deterioration , and improve environmental quality in key cities and regions .  
We shall give greater support to the faster and better development of the central area of this province with Xian at the center , and turn this area into a core base for the great development of the western part of the country .  Northern Shaanxi will be developed into our country 's major sample zone for the sustainable development of energy sources and the building of the ecological environment .  The southern part of Shaanxi will be developed into a diversified economic zone for developing biological resources , tourist resources , and water resources .  
The following is Sichuan 's overall target for accelerating its development in the first decade of the 21st century : The province is to build itself into an economically strong province in China 's western region and an ecological protective screen at the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang , bring about a well-coordinated economic and social development , and strive to make new leaps forward . 
In the face of various tasks , Deputy Uyunqimg believed : In the 10th Five-Year Plan period , Inner Mongolia will seize the historic opportunity brought by the large-scale development of the west , effectively strengthen ecological and environmental protection , bring about sustainable economic and social development , and create conditions for its development coordinated with nationwide development step by step .  
Yet , while we benefit from a rich material life and the sophisticated infrastructures we have developed , we shall never overlook the problems that come with our development .  Some of the major concerns of people at large are the air quality , marine and river pollution , and some indiscernible ecological problems .  
In recognition of the ecological importance of Long Valley , KCRC has carefully studied alternative alignments in addition to the gazetted alignment for the eastern end of the railway project , having regard to important factors including potential environmental impact , land use , planning requirements , engineering and operational feasibility as well as impact on local community .  
( a ) strengthen co-operation with the Guangdong Authorities in order to critically assess and announce the extent to which the ecological environment and the quality of the water supplied to Hong Kong have been affected by the sharp rise of the pollutant level of the original water supply course and the back-flow of the effluent into Dongjiang caused by the works on the closed aqueduct , and assess the additional resources required to remedy the damage to and the pollution of the local ecological environment and the Dongjang water source ;  
The Chief Curator of the Museum Dr Joseph Ting Sun-pao noted that the exhibition was the soul of the Museum and also a showcase of the dedicated hard work done by the Museum staff in the past 26 years in collecting , preserving and researching the history and development of Hong Kong . He also noted that with a rich mixture of ecological settings , panoramic screens , dioramas , interactive programmes and artefacts , the exhibition outlined the natural environment , cultural heritage and historical development of Hong Kong in a life-like manner .  
The public consultation exercise is to seek public views on : ( a ) the introduction of a scoring system for assessing , in a more objective and systematic manner , the relative ecological importance of sites with the objective of reaching a consensus within the community on the priority sites for enhanced conservation ; and ( b ) practicable ways to better conserve ecologically important sites that are under private ownership within limited resources .  
Falling within this area are coastal areas mainly below the 20-metre contour .  This zone is intended to conserve and retain the natural coastlines and the sensitive coastal natural environment including attractive geological features , physical landform or areas of high landscape , scenic or ecological value .  
The public consultation exercise is to seek public views on the introduction of a scoring system for assessing , in a more objective and systematic manner , the relative ecological importance of sites with the objective of reaching a consensus within the community on the priority sites for enhanced conservation ; and practicable ways to better conserve ecologically important sites that are under private ownership within limited resources .  
At the same time , the government should also thoroughly implement ecological protection and prevention of public hazards , while improving traffic , public safety , and living environment conditions . In this way the people will not only have access to plentiful resources for their everyday life , but will also enjoy a rich and meaningful spiritual life , thus thoroughly realizing the ideals of prosperity and equitable distribution of wealth as prescribed in our Principle of the People 's Well-Being .  
The natural distribution of heavy metals has been disturbed and they have been dispersed from their originally secure ecological position . In the course of life and industrial production people lack any real sense of alarm about all this . With the failure to take precautions the situation has gradually become harder to contain .  
Before the discovery of the microscope , and before " ecological observation " became popular , when our ancestors saw these insects emerge from soft earth and light up , they imagined that the firefly was a metamorphosis from rotting leaves or decaying bamboo . The saying , " On summer nights , rotting grass turns into fireflies , " was a natural result of observing transformations as the weather changed from season to season .  
Such painting for the scientific record was concerned primarily with seeking factual truth . When tools were developed to aid in the appreciation of nature and ecological research took off , conservationism swept the world and the number of bird watchers increased daily . Scientific illustrations were produced in great quantities and the demands of the art market gave rise to the ecological art of today .  
In 1989 the Wildlife Conservation Law was passed . Besides being concerned about Taiwan 's image , the Council of Agriculture , which is responsible for ecological preservation work , is even more worried that the mountains are being scarred by ever-larger development projects , which are destroying the habitat of wild animals . It is feared that this destruction of habitat , combined with the Chinese belief that monkey brain is especially fortifying in the winter , will make the Formosan Rock Monkey an endangered species .  
Beginning two years ago , foreign conservation groups started attacking Taiwan as a " rhino terminator , " and then in April of this year Taiwan became the first country against which the United States implemented trade sanctions for ecological reasons . The Chinese medical community has become a favorite public punching bag . As a doctor of Chinese medicine , Huang Ming-teh has had to face this problem .  
Twelve years ago the first book in the ROC to promote ecological conservation , We Only Have One Earth , was published . From that time until today , a rich selection of publications focusing on the natural environment has been produced in Taiwan , following the progressive development of environmental consciousness here . Recently a publishing house has even been established specializing in books about nature .  
The Formosan landlocked salmon was the main reason for the establishment of Shei-Pa National Park ; the Formosan clouded leopard was fielded by the newly formed Green Party as its presidential candidate ; and NT $ 200 million has been spent on the rehabilitation of the Formosan sika deer . But by the ecological definition , because these three species ' wild populations are so small that they can no longer reproduce healthily , in effect they are already extinct .  
Paul Perng says it used to be thought that clear targets were needed to bring about ecological protection , and so preservation areas were created for specific animals , such as the clouded leopard or panda . But in the future nature reserves wo n't be devoted to a single rare species but rather will be aimed at protecting the greatest diversity of ecology . Even areas that appear to contain nothing special but are nonetheless ecologically important will require protection .  
He faces a number of urgent problems . One is how to balance economic growth and environmental protection in a Taiwan that is densely crowded and has already suffered serious ecological damage and pollution . Another is how to create a sound investment environment that will keep local capital at home and attract foreign investment .  
Yet the fact is that many flowers are soft , clean and fragrant . The lotus , however , has special ecological characteristics that set it apart from other plants and make it symbolic of Buddhism . " Early Buddhists ' high regard for the lotus was based on the way it propagated itself , " writes Lin Liang-yi , one of the older generation of Japanese art scholars , in his work , " The Decorative Lines of Buddhist Art . "  
Its logic is simple . Taiwan 's aborigines have coexisted with nature here for millennia , and , despite their hunting and farming , nature remained as robust as ever , and aboriginal peoples did not hunt animals to extinction . If we can learn their ecological wisdom , perhaps we can do better at resource management and conservation . Meanwhile , some aborigines will have the chance to choose their traditional way of life , thus helping to keep their culture and communities intact .  
Fan also wrote China 's first fish farming manual , thus paving the way for the aquaculture industry of later generations . From the Tang dynasty onwards , it became common practice to raise such fish as common carp , mud carp , blunt snout bream , black carp and grass carp together , with the different species-some carnivorous and some herbivorous-occupying different niches within the waters of the same pond . " From a modern perspective this was very scientific , and consistent with maintaining an ecological balance , " says aquaculture nutritionist Chuang Chien-lung .  
The botanist Chen Yu-feng has written : " The process of mountain formation in Taiwan has already passed its most active phase , and the arrangement of its tall mountains has basically been established . These provide a wide range of climates and habitats for many different forms of plant and animal life . " The island has an astounding array of ecological diversity .  
The year before last , the United Nations nominated over 20 ecologically important areas worldwide as biosphere reserves , to be the subject of major conservation efforts with the support of the international community . But although East Asia was recognized as one of the regions of greatest biodiversity , a lack of detailed species lists and ecological background data prevented many areas being listed .  
After work on the plant resumes , there will be neither an immediate nuclear risk nor an immediate benefit of power generation . But environmentalists are convinced that the marine habitat of Yenliao , lying within a marine resource conservation area immensely rich in both the number of species and their populations , will be devastated , and that the three-kilometer golden beach of fine quartz sand which runs from Yenliao to Fulung , one of the priceless ecological and tourist resources of the northeast coast , may be lost along with it .  
Rising almost 4000 meters above sea level , Yushan is not only the tallest peak on Taiwan , it is also the source of the three major river systems that provide water for the island , has the most intact ecological system , verdant forests , varied flowers and fauna plus the nearby historical relics of Patungkuan and the rich cultural history of the Aborigines . " It is natural that this area is a topographical symbol of Taiwanese identity , just like Mt . Fuji in Japan or the Alps in Switzerland , " says Professor Tai .  
Compound Eyes examines the question of environmental ethics , and tells a riveting ecological tale that juxtaposes the huge and the miniscule , the distant and the near , the perfect and the flawed .  
Furthermore , modern people may lack ecological and environmental knowledge . Or they may know that natural resources are limited and that biodiversity is important , but be unable to refuse materialistic temptations , lack the time to recycle , and be powerless to refuse their children 's requests for the fashionable pet of the moment . More knowledge does not necessarily help in easing environmental deterioration .  
Farm director Chang Yu-sen explains , " We base the camps on our existing crops and cultivation areas . We 've set up activities including bird and insect watching and stargazing , premised on the idea of no additional land development and using the abundant resources of the surrounding virgin forests . We also have ecological gardens and displays of seed samples and dried flowers . "  
Helanshan Mountain , extending more than 250 kilometers to the north and south , is situated in the border area of Ningxia and Inner Mongolia , two large autonomous regions .  It is an important natural and geographical border , a water resource conservation forest and a natural ecological defense for the attacks of Tenggeli desert and Siberia cold wave .  
Mt . Helan , stretching 250 kilometers from south to north and located between Ningxia and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regions , is the most important geographic line and water conservation forest region in China 's western areas .  It is also a natural ecological fence to prevent the eastward encroachment of Tengger Desert and the cold waves from Siberia .  
Sustained and accelerated economic growth in developing countries would make for global ecological sustainability and should be central to development efforts at the national and international levels .  
Thus , a new impetus to foster regional cooperation is needed in order to address adequately the economic , social , cultural and ecological dimensions for a sustainable and systemic development of the ESCWA region .  
The primary concern now is how to sustain the social gains that have been realized in ecological and economic environments that are becoming increasingly hostile , thus menacing the already fragile environment of the young child .  
The sustainable management of natural resources and the improvement of environmental quality are mechanisms for protecting the ecological processes and the genetic diversity essential for the maintenance of life .  
Although the United Nations Environment Programme was an important step forward for the protection of the biosphere , consideration should be given the possibility of creating , after proper study , an ecological response embodied in a United Nations environmental security council composed of Member States with a permanent 15-member executive committee and a secretary-general with executive powers . 
The international community 's ability to offer a decent and secure existence to all its citizens is called into question by the numerous human tragedies , atrocities of war , terrorism , traffic in illegal drugs and long-term ecological degradation of our planet .  It is self-evident that global cooperation and effective action is a sine qua non for effectively combating these and other evils tormenting world society .  
The globalization of socio-economic activities calls for an integrated and universal approach , for if the development of the world economy is not accompanied by regulations and corrective mechanisms , it runs the risk of increasing destabilization and of breeding social and ecological imbalances . 
This integrated Central American initiative is one of national and regional development in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , involving policies , programmes and actions in the short - , medium - and long-term .  
Indeed , given the presence and the flow of refugees and displaced persons on our territory , and aware of the importance of international solidarity which was manifest during the ecological catastrophe at Lake Nyos in Cameroon in 1986 and of the need to confront unpredictable situations in an uncertain future , my Government decided to establish within Cameroon 's armed forces a specialized unit for peace-keeping and humanitarian assistance operations .  
As regards Africa , the steady deterioration of economic and social conditions can only contribute to confirming the pessimistic views regarding a continent that has been marginalized and left to its own devices to deal with the many political , economic , social and ecological crises besetting it .  
The participation of youth groups in gathering environmental data and in understanding ecological systems and actual environmental action should be encouraged as a means of improving both their knowledge of the environment and their personal engagement in caring for the environment .

Strengthening participation of youth in the protection ,  
Improving the use of data and information at all stages of planning and management , making systematic and simultaneous use of social , economic , developmental , ecological and environmental data ; analysis should stress interactions and synergisms ; a broad range of analytical methods should be encouraged so as to provide various points of view ;  
Certain countries have developed systems of ecological zoning , which they are using as a basis for identification of threatened ecosystems and development of ecological modelling at various levels , from the regional and national to the level of individual natural habitats . 
One form of non-governmental organization follow-up to the Rio de Janeiro Conference has thus been a continuing constructive critique of SARD concepts , emphasizing such elements as democracy , participation , equitable access to resources , local solutions , cultural values , social justice and equity , and ecological agricultural systems often adapted from traditional methods .  
UNESCO is developing its own electronic network and information service on biosphere reserves and ecological sciences ( MABNet ) , as well as its own database on national and cultural world heritage sites .  29 .  WCMC continued to compile and update substantial databases on habitats and threatened animals and plants for the red data books and biodiversity status reports that it publishes .  
Mountain farming furthermore relies on the exploitation of highly variable and complex ecological niches , where local knowledge is often superior to what extension agents can offer based on research and experience derived from extensive lowland farming systems .  
Women , particularly indigenous women , have pivotal roles in environmental conservation , owing to their combined roles and responsibilities in the family and the community , their knowledge of ecological links and fragile ecosystem management and their concern for the quality and sustainability of life for present and future generations .  
Biotechnology applications have the potential for making major contributions to the health and welfare of humanity , although biotechnology is still perceived by many to have undesirable and partly unforeseeable ecological , socio-economic , legal and ethical implications .  
An understanding was reached that military or any other hostile use of herbicides as an environmental modification technique was a method of warfare prohibited by the Convention if such use of herbicides upset the ecological balance of the region , thus causing widespread , long-lasting or severe effects as a means of destruction , damage or injury to any State party .  
To integrate environment and development in the policies and practices of each country effectively , it is necessary to develop and implement integrated , enforceable and effective laws and regulations that are based upon sound social , ecological , economic and scientific principles .  
However , the principle that harm which does not entail economic loss should be compensated is not a new absolute in law , as can be seen in the universal acceptance , in domestic and international law , of compensation for moral injury , which is as difficult to evaluate in monetary terms as ecological harm .  
In that resolution , the General Assembly , bearing in mind the serious crisis which had shaken Rwanda to its very foundations , expressed its deep concern about the grave social , economic , health and ecological impact of the massive and unexpected presence of refugees in the neighbouring countries .  
NULLThe participation of youth groups in gathering environmental data and in understanding ecological systems and actual environmental action should be encouraged as a means of improving both their knowledge of the environment and their personal engagement in caring for the environment .  
NULLIn recent years , the frequency and magnitude of major disasters , whether of a natural , technological or ecological origin , have made the world community aware of the immense loss of human life and economic resources that are regularly caused by such calamities .  
The participation of youth groups in gathering environmental data and in understanding ecological systems and actual environmental action should be encouraged as a means of improving both their knowledge of the environment and their personal engagement in caring for the environment .  
The FS initiated partnerships with international , Federal , State , and private organizations for ecosystem assessment , leading to greater use of satellite data and increased understanding of global ecological processes .  
Taking into consideration the will of the Central American presidents to adopt a national and regional strategy entitled " Alliance for Sustainable Development " 4 / as a comprehensive initiative in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , which includes a re-defining of the relations of Central America with the international community and is aimed at improving the well-being of the peoples of the subregion ,

a decision adopted on 28 April 1995 , the High Council of the Republic , the transitional parliament , bearing in mind all the adverse consequences for the Zairians which resulted from the presence of refugees from Rwanda and Burundi , including ecological problems , criminal acts and attempts to dominate the indigenous inhabitants , had decided to demand the unconditional return , without delay , of all refugees and immigrants from those countries .  
was no doubt that international law had a key role to play in the search for solutions to the problems of an interdependent world in which economic , social and ecological issues had assumed paramount importance , and Indonesia was therefore committed to working towards the codification of that law .  
The wealth of the Caspian Sea , its unique biological and mineral structure and fragile ecological system call for a comprehensive and balanced approach , free from short-term profit or political advantage .  
This endeavour includes the aspiration to receive fair treatment in international economic relations ; to try to save children from starvation and disease ; to promote emergency assistance to refugees and disaster victims ; to attempt to combat crime , drug addiction and disease ; to promote education and the development of human resources ; and to tackle the enormous task of halting or slowing the progressive ecological deterioration of our planet .  
All these falsities , many of them recorded in United Nations documents , hide the bankruptcy of development prospects for most of the poor countries , which is already threatening world stability and aggravating the ecological deterioration we all recognized several years ago at the historic Rio Conference .  
The Republic of Belarus deeply appreciates the efforts made by all the programmes , funds and specialized agencies of the United Nations system towards providing increased , speedier and better quality assistance to the various countries and regions suffering from armed conflicts , natural disasters , industrial ecological catastrophes and other emergency circumstances .  
One can not but conclude that the progressive development and codification of international law would benefit from the recognition of the primacy of national laws in their interaction with applicable international law in the conduct of States ; in the preservation of the environment and ecological balance ; in respect for basic human rights and fundamental freedoms ; in the need to contain and eradicate the inordinate and indiscriminate bite of terrorism ; and in the espousal of the democratic ideal .  
The current international political and security situation is burdened with many crises , cases of blatant violation of international law , the uncontrolled hoarding of arms , upsets of the ecological balance , disrespect for human rights , widespread international terrorism , and tensions in economic and social development .  
A solution to the problems of personal security in the region will thus require a comprehensive and interrelated view of all aspects of sustainable development in Central America in its political , economic , social , cultural and ecological dimensions ;  
In operational terms , sustainable forest management includes the formulation and implementation of forest management plans , which help to control and regulate harvesting of specified goods , combined with silvicultural and protective measures applied in varying intensity to sustain or to enhance the social , ecological and economic value of subsequent generations of the managed forests .  
Lack of implementation is partially attributed to lack of resources , expertise and political commitment and to insufficient availability of factual and scientific information on , for example , successional change and variables such as growth and yield of tree species under varying intensities of forest management , relationship between harvesting practices and forest ecosystem functions etc .  The lack of scientifically sound information is even more acute in relation to ecological processes on which increasing emphasis has been made in recent years .  
The project aims at identifying those criteria and indicators that can be considered objective , cost-effective and relevant in the assessment of the sustainability of prevailing forest management practices , taking into account parameters related to ecological , institutional , social and economic conditions and needs .  
In these forums , special reference has been made to the need to expand activities to cover all kinds of forests , with a view to arriving at a complete global coverage of clearly defined criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management , applicable to countries in all geographic and ecological regions of the world .  
This continuing rise in anthropogenic emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases poses potentially substantial risks to global physical and ecological systems , human health and socio-economic sectors .  
To integrate environment and development in the policies and practices of each country effectively , it is necessary to develop and implement integrated , enforceable and effective laws and regulations that are based on sound social , ecological , economic and scientific principles .

To identify new and emerging trends in the ecological , economic , social , technical and legislative spheres that influence sustainable human settlements development in the ECE region ;  
The humanitarian community will have to consider how it will relate in the future to global economic and social adjustments , to environmental and ecological concerns , and to human rights .  
In 1993 , the President of the Republic of Kalmykia , K . Ilyumzhinov , declared an ecological state of emergency owing to the rapid deterioration of the ecological situation in the territory of the Republic as a result of the increased impact in recent decades of the anthropogenic burden on the environment combined with the region 's extreme natural conditions .  
Holders of TFRK will need to feel secure in their land tenure arrangements ; reassured that they have been accorded status equal to that of the other members of the partnerships ; convinced of a common purpose compatible with their cultural and ecological values .  
Cancelled : ( iii ) implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity ; ( iv ) one issue on regional implementation of the Convention on Desertification ; ( v ) sustainable development : methodologies , approaches and assessment ( 1996 ) ; ( vi ) ecological tourism development ; and ( xiii ) geology for land-use planning and environmental management .  
It proposes the establishment of a new oceanic order in the twenty-first century , as well as the joint management and scientific development of marine resources on an equitable and peaceful basis so as to maintain the ecological balance of oceans and achieve the sustainable development of marine resources .  It calls on States parties to the Convention to strengthen cooperation and establish joint management and development zones of marine resources .  
These should fully recognize the ecological , social , cultural and [ religious ] [ spiritual ] values of forests [ and pay particular attention to global dimensions of climate change and the sustainable use , conservation and equitable sharing of the benefits of biological diversity . ]  
Criteria and indicators for application at the national level should be [ simple , ] [ practical , ] scientifically based and cost effective and reflect , inter alia , economic , social , biological and ecological circumstances . 
The continued presence of Rwandan refugees in neighbouring countries has had a number of serious , closely linked consequences of several kinds : humanitarian ( suffering endured ) , economic ( depleted humanitarian assistance ) , political and strategic ( interests of States ) , ecological ( destruction of host States ' ecosystems ) and security ( military and paramilitary activities of former FAR and militia members , as well as border insecurity ) . 
Holders of TFRK will need to be represented by their own representatives ; to feel secure in their land tenure arrangements ; to be reassured that they have been accorded status equal to that of the other members of the agreements ; and to be convinced of a common purpose compatible with their cultural and ecological values .  
There is a need for a broad spectrum of quantitative , qualitative and descriptive indicators covering social , cultural , economic , ecological , institutional , legal and policy elements , including land tenure .  
Governments are needed to create the conditions that will allow consistent and realistic goals to be developed and met goals that are based on good science and the sound assessment of risk , and which balance ecological , economic and social objectives .  
This Union will enable all Central American social sectors to take full advantage of the region 's strategic geographical location , economic potential , vast ecological wealth and robust and abundant human resources within the new international order , and to confront the challenges of the next millennium .  
The most pressing problem in all three affected countries is the maintenance of those forests in a stable condition , and to this end an efficient technology for reforestation and cultivation must be elaborated , together with a long-term management strategy allowing a maximum economic , social and ecological contribution to society .  
With regard to migration , that extremely complex phenomenon was linked to many demographic , social , ecological , psychological , historical and technological factors .  
Subsequently , the importance of managing wildfire hazards became the dominant policy promoted through the collaborating interests of public authorities , commercial interests and local commitments driven by a combination of balanced economic , social and ecological values .  
Accordingly , he continuously advocated in his lifetime the creation of a new global human order premised on sustainable economic development , equity and social and ecological justice , and based on the creation of a separate global development fund for assistance to both the North and the South .  
Convinced of the need effectively to tackle the problems confronting them in this area , they have committed themselves to creating an economic , social , political , cultural and ecological environment that is conducive to social development , as well as to giving priority to national and international policies and initiatives aimed at eliminating poverty , promoting employment , combating unemployment and fostering social integration .  
A revised version of that paper , together with separate reports on the economic and ecological vulnerabilities of small island developing States to be prepared by consultants , will form the basis for discussions by an expert group meeting scheduled for the second half of 1997 .  
There is an increased willingness to work across national borders marked by mountain chains , in particular for scientific reasons , such as to study the behaviour of migratory species , for environmental conservation purposes , and for ecological / economic reasons among countries sharing major watercourses .  
The authorities of the National Committee for Aid to Refugees , Returnees and Displaced Persons ( CEAR ) have said that the working strategies in the area concerned the management of the process of return : consolidation of reintegration ; land-use planning in conjunction with agro _ ecological studies and definition of the population base ; consolidation of return : socio _ economic reintegration process to promote integrated community development , legal security of land , legal and moral responsibility in paying for property , and planning strategies .  
At the theoretical level , the Conference scientifically established the organic interrelationship between the natural state of mountains and climatic conditions arising in mountainous areas , on the one hand , and the disruption of the ecological balance and level of social and economic development of peoples living in mountainous areas , on the other .  
The Penal Code lays down offences of an ecological nature , dealing , for example , with the unlawful destruction of raw materials , trees , agricultural or industrial products or means of production , such destruction being detrimental to national wealth or consumption , as well as with the protection of mammals or marine vertebrates and aquatic species .  
The intense work undertaken during the interim period has laid some of the needed foundations for the necessary convergency between the efforts of affected country Parties and developed country Parties , thus paving the way for gradual progress at the field level of the arid lands marginalized by ecological degradation and poverty .  
Accordingly , the developing countries committed themselves to doing everything to preserve and protect the environment , while the developed countries , beyond their ecological obligations , were to provide new and additional financial resources in order to create an international economic environment conducive to the struggle against poverty .  
It is also understood that global sustainability will remain mere wishful thinking so long as the rich industrialized countries continue to undermine the ecological life-support system of the human family by wasting resources .  
It needs to be questioned to what extent this secrecy is compatible with the access to information necessary for democratic practice and social justice and whether , in some cases , instead of contributing to long-term security , it may conceal information about processes ( ecological , financial , military , etc . ) which are a potential threat to everyone and which need therefore to be addressed collectively . 
Be adapted to the specific legal , social , economic , ecological and cultural conditions prevalent in a given project region ;  
Alternative development programmes should be adapted to the specific , legal , social , economic , ecological and cultural conditions prevalent in a given project region .  
Be adapted to the specific legal , social , economic , ecological and cultural conditions prevalent in a given project region ;  
Developing countries , with their diverse agro-climatic situation , high and unstable mountains , perennial waterways coupled with peak seasonal discharge , as well as arid and semi-arid ecological conditions , are vulnerable to drought and desertification .  
His Government considered regional and international coordination of primary importance for such activities , as it was impossible to solve ecological problems on a purely national level .  
The broad-based concept of partnership with all actors in civil society has been widely recognized as a key feature of the Habitat Agenda and for making human settlements sustainable in ecological , social and economic terms .  
Be adapted to the specific legal , social , economic , ecological and cultural conditions prevalent in a given project region ;  
The elements needed for good governance in the fisheries sector are well recognized : the need for a strategy explicitly aimed at ecological , economic and social sustainability ; effective fisheries agencies and research institutions ; a cooperative , organized and informed fisheries sector ; adequate laws and legal institutions , including deterrent monitoring , control and surveillance ; and appropriate linkages with regional and international bodies .  
In other words , it aimed at finding ways and means to strike a true balance between present and future economic , social and ecological needs on the one hand , and laying the foundations for a world partnership based on shared understanding of needs and interests with a view to attaining sustainable development on the other .  
Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , we stress that there are measurable , anthropogenic impacts on the global climate , that these impacts are on the rise , and that continued unchecked growth in greenhouse gas concentrations will result in dire ecological , social , and economic consequences .  
In its report on its fourth session ( E / CN . 17 / 1997 / 12 ) , IPF concluded that there is a need for a broad set of reliable data of high integrity , covering social , cultural , economic , ecological , institutional and legal aspects of forests , in order to have an adequate grasp of progress as well as of the impact of the state of forests on the environment , human well-being and the economy .  
Additional information is needed on approaches that can be used to devise markets for forest products , and the role of the public and private sector in assuring that new or expanded markets are consistent with the social , economic and ecological components of sustainable forest management .  
The financial needs of developing countries with low forest cover require special consideration , balancing their genuine need for forest products and services with ecological , technical , financial and social feasibility .  
Urged countries with low forest cover to establish or expand networks of protected areas , buffer zones and ecological corridors , where possible , in order to conserve biological diversity , particularly in unique types of forests , working in close liaison with the parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant international environmental agreements .  
The selection and management of additional protected forest areas should be based on their value as representative or unique forest types ; their potential to generate information on ecological processes ; the conservation of biological diversity and ecosystem services ; and due consideration to the livelihoods of the communities depending on them .  
In his delegations view , the following UNIDO activities should be strengthened : ( a ) attracting foreign investment in the industrial and technological sectors ; ( b ) developing international environmental protection standards for industry ; ( c ) enhancing the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in science and technology and in industry ; ( d ) establishing regional industrial development and ecological production centres ; and ( e ) promoting certification and standardization in industry . 
The programme is aimed at families living on municipal , State _ owned or private land , involving negotiations between landowners , the community and the municipal government , or families who have been relocated , through the new organized settlements programme , to the above _ mentioned land because they had previously been living in high-risk areas , on rights of way , in ecological or archeological reserves or on private property .  
The programme is aimed at poor families living in minimal housing conditions and in high-risk areas , on rights of way , in ecological or archaeological reserves or on private property , persons over 18 years of age , and persons who belong to a family unit with an income of less than two monthly minimum wages when they can prove that the family has no assets and have expressed a desire to purchase a plot . 
Discussions of land management at the eighth session might focus on the integrated management and planning of agricultural and non-agricultural land , including forests , watersheds , protected eco-systems and settlements , so as to meet the growing needs of rural and urban populations for food , water and forest products , while protecting essential ecosystems and ecological services .  
The precise meaning of adequacy is to a large extent determined by prevailing social , economic , cultural , climatic , ecological and other conditions , while sustainability incorporates the notion of long-term availability and accessibility .  
In the field of natural gas , two projects technological and ecological norms , required for the design and operation of the gas distribution networks , and existing standards and regulations on permissible concentrations of harmful components in gaseous fuels and gaseous fuels combustion products have been launched .  
The group is helping to prepare case studies in rural and urban areas on the linkages between ecological factors , disaster preparedness and the level of damages sustained by natural phenomena , as well as to formulate regional projects for presentation to the international community .  
Damage to oil refineries , fuel dumps and chemical and fertilizer factories , as well as the toxic smoke from huge fires and the leakage of harmful chemicals into the soil and the water table have contributed to as yet unassessed levels of environmental pollution in some urban areas , which may in turn have a negative impact on health and ecological systems .  
Underscores that sustainable development depends upon a healthy local , national , regional and global environment and that the United Nations Environment Programme has a major role to play in promoting actions at all levels that are designed to sustain the continued adequate functioning of ecological systems ;  
The Special Rapporteur further recommends State authorities not to take up or continue to engage in development projects that may impair the environment of indigenous lands and / or adversely affect their traditional economic activities , religious ceremonies or cultural heritage , without previously commissioning the appropriate ecological studies to determine the actual negative impact those projects will have .  
The content of adequacy is to some extent determined by prevailing social , economic , cultural , climatic , ecological and other conditions , but there are some core elements which are applicable under all circumstances and are spelled out in greater detail by the Committee .  
The precise meaning of adequacy is to a large extent determined by prevailing social , economic , cultural , climatic , ecological and other conditions , while sustainability incorporates the notion of long-term availability and accessibility .  
Technological and human-induced ecological hazards , such as accidental releases of chemicals in surface water catchments , dumping of toxic and radioactive materials in coastal zones or on the high seas , and hydrological and climatic problems created by excessive withdrawals from large water bodies etc . add to or complicate problems related to natural hazards , particularly in CIS countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia . 
That combination could only be created and maintained for so long because of the perverse mechanism that linked it to external markets ( in the northern states of the USA , by contrast , slavery never took a hold because the ecological conditions for export crops based on plantations were absent ) .  
At the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , the international community reiterated its recognition of the specific constraints faced by small island developing States and the need for particular support in their efforts to advance sustainable development due to their small size and remoteness , ecological fragility , vulnerability to climate change and economic vulnerabilities .  
At the second Consultative Group Meeting for the Reconstruction and Transformation of Central America , co-hosted by the Inter-American Development Bank and the Government of Sweden and held in Stockholm , from 25 to 28 May 1999 , the Governments of the region , the principal donors and civil society representatives renewed their commitment to democratic change and sustainable human development as the best means of reducing social and ecological vulnerability to future disasters .  
A panel of technical experts held during the Consultative Group Meeting , which included representatives from UNICEF and other United Nations organizations , suggested that reducing ecological and social vulnerability to natural hazard is a core regional development issue and that the primary responsibility for reducing vulnerability lies with sectoral institutions and with local communities . 
The group is helping to prepare case studies in rural and urban areas on the linkages between ecological factors , disaster preparedness and the level of damage sustained by natural phenomena , as well as to formulate regional projects for presentation to the international community .  
We see , on the one hand , astounding developments in many fields of human endeavour and , on the other , national and international conflicts , resulting in mass destruction of human life and infrastructure as well as the almost irreversible compromising of the ecological system .  
This shows not only our deep understanding of the importance of this Treaty , but also our desire to make a real contribution towards resolving the problems of nuclear non-proliferation , improving the ecological condition of the planet and strengthening global security and regional stability .  
At the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , the international community reiterated its recognition of the specific constraints faced by small island developing States and the need for particular support in their efforts to advance sustainable development due to their small size and remoteness , ecological fragility , vulnerability to climate change and economic vulnerabilities .  
An ecological branch of the police force was established in 1994 to curb ecological crime , carry out investigations at the request of the public prosecutor , enforce respect of protected areas and prevent the illicit dumping of dangerous and toxic substances which are injurious to the environment and human life and health .  
In 1989 , the ecological organization Greenpeace had revealed the existence of a letter of intent signed by a German waste-processing firm , Pick Up Problems , and these dignitaries in Paraguay , who were acting in a personal capacity , for the export of 1 , 200 , 000 tons of waste which were to be processed in the Chaco region , where there were plans to build an incineration plant .  
CHEC has played an active participatory role in most of the major United Nations global conferences since the early 1970 s , with human ecology introducing Commonwealth professionals , international and national NGOs and Governments to the connections between social , economic and ecological systems and human development .  
The economic , ecological , social and cultural systems of small island developing States are fragile and highly sensitive to external environmental , social and economic change .  
Such a decision ignored the erosion of trade preferences , the CARICOM countries ecological and economic vulnerability and the fact that most of their economies lacked the resilience to recover quickly from natural disasters which could obliterate their physical infrastructure , industrial base and agricultural assets . 
Forest valuation should reflect the social , cultural , economic and ecological context and consider values that are important to local and / or indigenous communities , private forest owners , gender aspects , and distributional impacts .  
Urged countries to engage in raising awareness of the ecological , social , cultural and economic roles that planted and natural forests might fulfil in the rehabilitation and sustainable management of forests in environmentally critical areas ;  
It was evident , however , that the results obtained had been modest and that new measures were required in order to improve regulation and prevent the adoption of protectionist measures based on technical , health , social or ecological criteria .  
The third assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was cited , which underscored that human activities are affecting the Earths climate , with potentially significant ecological and economic effects , and that it would be necessary to understand the interrelationships between transportation systems , technology and local and global atmospheric effects as the way forward is being planned . 
Global Education Associates ( GEA ) is an association of individual and institutional associates in more than 90 countries , working to advance global systems that will ensure ecological integrity , peace , human rights , economic and social well-being , and democratic participation , with special care to include the voices and perspectives of poor and marginalized people of diverse cultural and religious traditions . 
Acknowledging also the special economic and social importance of the Danube River and its tributaries as a major European river with multiple uses and functions , as well as its ecological significance and its value as a natural habitat for numerous wildlife species ,  
To do this , we must : ( i ) maintain the integrity of ecosystems and the continued health of the planets life-support system which sustain the productivity , adaptability of renewal of all life ; ( ii ) maintain biological diversity in the variety of life on which ecological processes depend processes that provide a stream of current and future benefits to human beings ; and ( iii ) ensure sustainable population dynamics ( size of population , growth rate and distribution ) , as it often exerts pressures on the environment .  
The Ministers noted with appreciation enhanced CEI cooperation in the fields of promoting sustainable social , economic and ecological development , infrastructure and private sector investment , SME development , transborder and interregional cooperation ( such as the enhanced Szeged Process ) , human resource development , cultural as well as scientific and technological cooperation ( such as the Italian-Slovenian transfrontier television project ) , including in the field of geodesy , combating organized crime , protection of minorities , womens entrepreneurship and youth affairs .  
Emphasizing also , as documented by the United Nations Environment Programme , that ecological crises facing humanity are deeply rooted in a complex web of political , economic , social , technological as well as inadequate societal attitudes , belief systems and perceptions ,  
At the crossroads of three continents , the Mediterranean is in a state of constant tension and must cope with major political , economic , ecological and demographic challenges , let alone a host of global social scourges that affect this region .  
The interlinkages between international migration and development were complex in the sense that they brought into play a multiplicity of factors economic , technological , demographic , social , ecological , historical and cultural depending on regional characteristics .  
The first victims of whatever military actions are undertaken will be the billions of people living in the poor and underdeveloped world , with their unbelievably serious economic and social problems , their unpayable debts and the ruinous prices of their basic commodities ; their growing natural and ecological disasters ; their hunger and extreme poverty ; the massive undernourishment of their children , teenagers and adults ; their terrible AIDS epidemic ; and their malaria , tuberculosis and infectious diseases , which threaten whole nations with extermination .  
To reduce the level of vulnerability to natural disasters based on planning instruments such as ecological and economic land management ; and to promote a culture of risk awareness to further their prevention and mitigation through educational processes and improved information and early warning systems while encouraging participation on the part of civil society .  
The role of science and engineering in the current policy-making process at national and global levels regarding the three pillars of sustainable development social , economic and ecological is insufficient .  
Forest management is the stewardship and use of forests in a way , and at a rate , that maintains their biodiversity , productivity , regeneration capacity , vitality and potential to fulfil , now and in the future , relevant ecological , economic and social functions , at local , national and global levels , and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems ;
