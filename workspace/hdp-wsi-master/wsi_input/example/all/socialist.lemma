He said that next year 's main tasks of economic system reform will be : maintaining the direction of socialist market economy reform , further adjusting and perfecting ownership structures ; accelerating the pace of creating a modern enterprise system for state-owned enterprises , vigorously promoting strategic reform of the state owned economy ; accelerating restructuring , to appropriately arrange placement for extraneous personnel leaving posts , implementing re-employment projects ; deepening financial system reforms , continuing to strengthen and improve macroscopic control ;  
He said China was in a critical period of building up a socialist market economy system and increasing the pace of its modernization build-up , but a huge , overwhelming growth in population was still restraining the social and economic development , affecting the further improvement of the living standard of the people , and has also brought about heavy pressure on the natural resources and the natural environment .  
We are firmly convinced that under the leadership of the CPC , with the support of the people across the country , and giving full play to the superiority of the socialist system , the cadres and people in the western region will certainly be able to use their wisdom and exert themselves to build a prosperous homeland with social progress , a stable life , national unity , and beautiful rivers and mountains .  
On a foundation of extensive development of S &amp; T training for troops , the Military Region in an organized way guided units to be active in probing for , researching , and discussing the demands of local war under high-tech conditions , the effect of the development of the socialist market economy on the driving force of training of officers and soldiers , what difficulties remained in training itself , and other issues , and to find corresponding countermeasures and methods .  
establish an education structure that is compatible with the socialist market economic structure and the inherent law of education and that integrates different types of education .  This will create an unprecedentedly relaxed macroenvironment and effective condition for the implementation of policies and measures designed to provide opportunities for those leaving schools to pursue advanced studies and for " burden reduction . "  
They are in the prime of life , have received a relatively high level of education , are relatively active in thinking , dare to forge ahead in a pioneering spirit , and have done much hard work to implement the party 's line and central policy-decisions , and to promote socialist modernization .  However , it is also necessary to be aware that some clear weak points and shortcomings also exist among some cadres at this level .  
The CPC Central Commission for Guiding the Spiritual Civilization Building held its seventh plenary session today to study the gist of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important directive on strengthening and improving the ideological and political work , and to make work arrangements for further reinforcing the building of socialist spiritual civilization and for earnestly grasping the party 's ideological and political work under the present new situation .  
It is necessary to enable the broad masses of cadres and people to fully understand the superiority of the party 's correct leadership and the socialist system , which can concentrate efforts on doing big things , and to fully understand that the correct line , principles and policies for reform , opening up and modernization formulated by our party under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping are the fundamental guarantee to bringing about rapid economic and social development in our country .  
Since our party represents the direction of the development of the advanced culture , all comrades of the party must always take Marxism as the guidance , strive to inherit and develop all fine cultural traditions of the Chinese nation , and strive to learn from and absorb all outstanding cultural achievements of foreign countries in order to continuously create and promote the socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , enable the coordinated development of the socialist material and spiritual civilization , and enable comprehensive progress of the society .  
The Ninth National People 's Congress [ NPC ] and its Standing Committee have continuously strengthened the legislative work over the past year , with a total of 33 draft laws examined and 24 of them approved .  The annual target of legislative work was thus achieved , and the endeavor of initially forming a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics during this term was moved forward .  
Just as an article published recently by " Renmin Ribao " stated , quickening China 's " entry into WTO " negotiations and enabling China to accede to WTO on an earlier date is at once a natural choice for China in developing a socialist market economy and a need for China in furthering her reform and opening up .  
Since the founding of new China , the party and government have attached great importance to developing the people 's education and devoted great efforts to it ; there have been tremendous developments in China 's education and large numbers of outstanding talented people have been trained for socialist construction .  
constitutes a fundamental guiding ideology for China 's educational reform and development under the historical conditions of socialist market economic development , reform , and opening up ; serves as a guide to action for deepening educational reform and promoting quality education in an all-around manner ; and has great , practical significance as a guide as well as far-reaching historical significance .  
General Secretary Jiang Zemin sent a letter to the National Conference on Popularizing Science , pointing out : We must strengthen in real earnest the work of popularizing science by taking it as an important task aimed at implementing the strategy of " national rejuvenation through science and education " and as an important content of socialist spiritual civilization building ; should energetically popularize scientific knowledge in the whole society ; and should advocate the spirit of science ; publicize scientific thinking ; and disseminate scientific measures ;  
The CPPCC is an organization of the Chinese people 's patriotic united front , with the most extensive representation organizationally and the greatest accommodation politically .  It is an important organization for realizing the political system of multi-party cooperation and political consultations under the leadership of the CPC , as well as an important form of socialist democratic politics which conforms with the Chinese national conditions and serves the fundamental interests of the people .  
Fourth , all localities in Guangdong must constantly enhance the ideological and ethical qualities , as well as the scientific and cultural qualities , of the people ; strengthen the building of a socialist spiritual civilization ; and bring about a well-coordinated economic and social development .  
Faced with an international and domestic situation that is undergoing profound changes and a glorious and arduous mission , the deputies will be thoroughly studying major issues of overall and strategic significance in reform , opening up and socialist modernization and will be reviewing important policies and arrangements for work in the coming year .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's remarks have , from a high plane of historical materialism , revealed the fundamental nature of our party ; pointed out the party 's basic tasks ; and are of an important theoretical and practical significance to our efforts to further maintain the advancement of the party , retain the vigor and vitality of the party , lead the whole party and the people of the entire country to carry out struggles in unity , and build our country into a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized modern socialist power .  
The historical experiences gained by our party in leading the socialist cause have proved , from both the positive and negative aspects , that whenever the party represents the development demands of advanced productive forces , our cause will flourish and grow ;  
Without concentrating our energy , we can neither accelerate development nor bring true its advancedment and since the productive forces of our country never experienced a full development under capitalist conditions , we must complete , under socialist conditions , the task of industrialization and economic socialization , marketization , and modernization which advanced countries will complete under capitalist conditions .  
In furthering socialist democratic political construction , the current NPC and its standing committee revised the Village Committee Organization Law , and formulated and adopted the Law on Administrative Appeals . With these and the Administrative Litigation Law , Administrative Punishment Law , Administrative Supervision Law , and State Compensation Law formulated in earlier years , our country has basically established a complete legal system on administrative punishment and relief .  
He said : The important speech delivered by Comrade Jiang Zemin recently on educational issues was not directed at any specific chance occurrences .  It was an exposition of great foresight made in consideration of the destiny of our country , national rejuvenation , the implementation of the strategy for rejuvenating the nation by applying scientific and technological advances and promoting education , and the development of socialist modernization .  
Under the condition of developing a socialist market economy , there is an important question for reality and a theoretical question on strengthening the construction of the Party under the new historical conditions : How can our Party from beginning to end maintain its quality of being the vanguard of the working class , how can our Party better represent the necessities for the development of China advanced productive forces , how can our Party represent the development direction of China advanced cultures and how can our Party represent the broad masses interest  
Only by continuously developing socialist culture and continuously satisfying the masses growing need for spiritual and cultural life can we provide a powerful spiritual drive and guarantee the development of productive forces .  
From now until the first 10 years of the next century , in order to establish a relatively perfect socialist market economic system and maintain the continuous , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy , we must solve major strategic problems that have comprehensive and long-term significance to economic development .  
So , the " accession to the WTO " will not only be conducive to rejuvenating and benefiting the labor-intensive industries with strong international competitiveness but it will also be conducive to quickening the readjustment of the capital - and technology-intensive industries and enabling them to grow up at an early date .  Besides , the WTO entry will also be able to help normalize convoluted pricing signals and quicken the setup and improvement of the socialist market economic system .  
In his report Li Peng also discussed the main tasks for this year and next in better relying on the people 's deputies to do a good job in Standing Committee work , unfolding thorough and protracted education in socialist democracy and legal system , further developing a new situation in exchanges and cooperation with foreign and international parliaments and assemblies , and continuing to step up the building of the Standing Committee itself .  
Some delegates indicated : During the current building of a spiritual civilization , the trend of promoting material progress to the neglect of cultural and ideological progress has yet to be checked permanently , and a major factor leading to such a situation is that the related legislation work remains relatively weak ; in view of such a problem , we ought to vigorously strengthen the legislation concerning the building of a socialist spiritual civilization .  
the building of socialist spiritual civilization and of democracy and legal system was further intensified ; and social stability was maintained .  These achievements are the results of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core taking charge of the overall situation and providing correct leadership , and the results of all levels throughout the country implementing the central policy decision on expanding domestic demand and the series of guidelines and policies , and working hard with concerted efforts .  
Departments of spiritual promotion and cultural education must organize and guide a large batch of artistic workers and scientific promotion workers to go deep into the frontline of the socialist reform and modernization construction .  They should absorb nourishment and find materials there , create high-quality spiritual products and meet people 's demand for improving their quality of spiritual civilization .  
From instituting the household contract responsibility system to the establishment of coastal special economic zones , from planned economy to socialist market economy , and from the initial stage of socialism to the idea of " benefiting three things " - - every one of this series of reforms drawing forward the overall situation is attributable to guidance by the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts .  
Many deputies and committee members said that in the course of reform , opening up , and establishing a socialist market economy system , pluralistic trends have emerged in economic components and interests , ways of social life , and social organizational forms ; high technology has developed rapidly , new changes have occurred in people 's ideological concepts and value orientation , there are more social hot spots and difficult points , all kinds of ideas and cultures stir each other , and certain new situations and problems have arisen in social life .  
The members generally held that the report has provided fewer figures but more experiences and fewer stereotyped or empty remarks but more professional terminology and not only looks much more like a government work report under the socialist market economic conditions but has also forcefully borne out that ours is a pragmatic , competent , and vigorous government .  
Practice over the past 21 years has proved that the policy of " the whole society engaging in afforestation and the whole nation committed to turning the country green " has brought into play the superiority of the socialist system and suits the actual condition of our country , which is faced with an arduous task of ecological building but lacks capital .  It has also significantly increased people 's awareness of the need to keep the country green .  
In socialist construction , areas inhabited by minority nationalities in our country have scored achievements attracting worldwide attention .  Owing to the limitations of natural conditions and for historical reasons , however , there is still a certain gap between the minority-nationality regions and the more developed inland and eastern coastal areas in the levels of economic and cultural development .  
2 .  Article Three of General Work Principles shall be amended as " The national committee and local committees of CPPCC shall implement the strategy of running the country in accordance with the law ; publicize and enforce ( carry out ) the constitution , laws , and various principles and policies of the state ; and mobilize social forces to actively take part in the cause of building material civilization and socialist spiritual civilization ( assist the state organs in cracking down on criminal activities aimed at sabotaging socialism in economic field and other fields ) . "  
This has been a democratic , pragmatic , united , and inspiring meeting , which made due contribution to the comprehensive fulfillment of the goals set by the party and by the state for this year and to the promotion of the magnificent cause of socialist modernization construction .  
The purpose of formulating a relatively complete civil code on the basis of the existing single-item laws being relatively perfect is to better meet the needs for the development of a socialist market economy and further protect the legitimate rights and interests of citizens and legal persons .  
The most crucial issue in socialist modern commercial construction is to proceed from the ideology of serving the people whole-heartedly , use modern means to meet consumer demand to the greatest extent , sell genuine goods at reasonable prices , and practice fair transactions , thereby giving enterprises the greatest economic returns .  
In the deliberation held by the Yunnan delegation , Deputy Pang Xijun maintains that this year is the final year for China to achieve the second stage of strategic objectives for socialist modernization in a comprehensive way , and the large-scale development of West China also provides the entire country with an opportunity for new economic development , which is unprecedented in history .  
Particularly in light of the characteristics in Guangxi where multi-ethnic groups live in compact communities , he pointed out that Guangxi will firmly seize the opportunity of the western development , further solidify the new-type socialist national relationship of equality , solidarity , and mutual assistance , open up a new era of national unity and progress , and create prerequisites for the economic takeoff in the entire autonomous region .  
And it is being unfolded at a time when various contradictions in reforms and construction are interwoven ; a structure , mechanism , legal system , and management system that meet the demands of the development of socialist market economy await gradual establishment and perfection ; and numerous negative corruption phenomena are prone to occur .  
the vanguard zones of the socialist market economic structure ; and the demonstration zones of sustainable development , which will take the lead in achieving modernization characterized by basically prosperous economy , optimum structure , perfect facilities , beautiful environment , integrated urban and rural areas , sound legal system , and civilized society .  
to ensure the implementation of the party 's basic line and basic policies systematically and legally ; to ensure the party will always give play to the leading and central role of controlling overall situation and of coordinating all interests .  To develop socialist democratic politics , there is a need to persist in the four cardinal principles , in the national policy of the people 's democratic dictatorship , and in the political body of the national people 's congress system .  
Both domestic and foreign hostile forces do not want to see the development of a strong , prosperous , and stable socialist China . They hope for chaos in China . They are constantly trying to " westernize " and " divide " China so as to achieve change amid chaos and to fish in troubled waters .  
At the same time when we uphold economic construction as the central task , we must also make earnest efforts to step up the building of a socialist spiritual civilization ; and must bring about a comprehensive progress to both the material productive forces of our society and the ideology , ethics , and culture of our society .  The position of economic construction as a central task should remain unshaken at all times ;  
At a time when we are about to finish the first two steps , the party 's leading collective of the third generation has made the third-step strategic goals more specific , drawn up a new program , and clearly defined the goals of the new " three-step " strategy .  This will help people throughout the country to maintain their fighting spirit and to firmly , steadily , and in a down-to-earth manner , stride toward the grand goal of building China into a modern socialist country .  
By the middle of the next century , when the Chinese nation reaches the level of an intermediately developed nation with its own hard work , a wealthy , strong , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist China will stand tall in the East !  
ensure sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development ; truly step up building of socialist spiritual civilization and of democracy and a legal system ; and endeavor to accomplish all tasks set forth by the current NPC session .  
The important speech given by President Jiang at the Plenary Session of the PLA Representative Troops fully affirms the achievements made by the military and armed police troops and raises clear requirements for comprehensively promoting the construction of military modernization .  The speech emphasizes that the military must further clearly understand the historical mission it shoulders and provide firm and strong assurance of security for protecting the country 's sovereignty , unity and security , for protecting the people 's labor under peaceful conditions and for reform , opening up and the construction of socialist modernization .  
Only when we continuously develop socialist culture and improve socialist spiritual civilization continuously can we provide a powerful spiritual dynamic force and intellectual support to economic development and overall social progress and can we continuously meet the increasingly growing spiritual and cultural needs of the people .  
The main reason why the United States produces an annual country report on human rights practices , heedless of the strong opposition of other countries , assumes the air of a " judge of human rights , " and insists on interfering in affairs under the jurisdiction of other countries is mainly to use this as a pretext for putting political pressure on other countries , especially developing and socialist countries , in a bid to change their political and social systems .  
Zeng Peiyan said : In the 21st century , China 's targets are to double the 2000 GNP by 2010 to make the people 's comparatively well-off lives even more prosperous and form a relatively complete socialist market economic system and to bring the per capita GDP to the level of an average developing country and basically achieve modernization by the middle of the century to successfully build a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist country . 
The strategic shift of the Party 's work focuses , the eventual affirmation of the basic line for the primary stage of socialism , the steady advancement of reform and opening up , and the gradual establishment of a system of socialist market economy have laid a firm but fully energetic and vigorous systematic basis for pushing forward the development of social productive forces and increasing the levels of the overall national strength and the material and cultural life of the masses of people .  
After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the second-generation collective leadership with Deng Xiaoping as the core carried forward and developed the thought of Mao Zedong on cultural building .  In order to meet the new needs of reform and opening up and socialist modernization building , they put forth and constantly developed our party 's thinking about the building of socialist spiritual civilization .  
Only by truly fulfilling the " three represents " can the party lead the people in developing social productive forces , flourishing socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , and constantly improving the material and cultural life of the masses of people .  
Only by developing productive forces and flourishing socialist culture can we provide powerful material and spiritual bases for realizing the fundamental interests of the masses of people .  
To carry out personal quality education is to rectify such one-sided understandings and practices , so as to train " idealistic , moral , educated , and disciplined " socialist builders and successors who are comprehensively developed ethically , intellectually , physically , and aesthetically .  
The ideal and belief education should be taken as a key point of in-depth education in Deng Xiaoping Theory . Through such education , people should profoundly understand that communism and socialism is a just , inevitable , and arduous cause , understand that the cause of communism and socialism is noble and beautiful .  The people should be guided to integrate their personal values with socialist values and integrate the lofty ideal with the objectives of the struggle in the current stage , and dedicate themselves to the common ideal of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
After this five-year plan is fulfilled , with the efforts of five more years , that is , by the year 2010 , we will establish a sound and perfect socialist market economic structure , and will further double the value of the gross national output on the basis of the 2000 figure , thus further enhancing the people 's living standards .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , especially since the Democratic Reform , the people of all ethnic groups on this snow plateau have been living in harmony and sharing weal and woe with one another .  They have gradually formed a socialist ethnic relationship marked by equality , unity , and mutual assistance .  Reform and opening-up have increased economic and technological exchanges between the Tibetans and the people of other ethnic groups , thereby enhancing their solidarity .  
and a fundamental change to the outlook of the western region entails the persevering and indomitable efforts of several generations .  They should persistently proceed their work from the reality , draw up an overall plan for the work , suit their measures to local conditions , give a better play to local advantages , strive for practical results , and work hard to open up a new road for the region 's large-scale exploration and development that suits both the special features of the western region and the needs of a socialist market economic system .  
In our country , now tourism has been moving onto the path of comprehensive development with three major market sectors , namely , tourism for people entering the Chinese mainland , domestic tourism , and tourism for domestic people traveling abroad , and now tourism is a large-scale industry with a huge market and great output value .  Tourism is playing a more and more important role in the national economy , and is producing positive influence for the enhancement of national quality and the development of the socialist spiritual civilization .  
The conferences conscientiously reviewed and summed up the work practice and main experience of the people of our country in prevailing over difficulties and overcoming risks under a complicated domestic and international environment and in continuing to advance the cause of reform , opening , and socialist modernization construction , and the two conferences also planned and assigned important work tasks for the country for the last year of this century .  
To implement the spirit of the two conferences , it is necessary to work hard to successfully carry out the construction of socialist politics and culture and to advance coordinated economic and social development , under the precondition of being dictated by and serving the center , that is , economic construction .  
The " Honest Government Standards " formulated and implemented by the Party during the past few years have not only regulated political behavior for leading Party and government cadres under the socialist market economy , they also have advanced construction and development of the market economic system .  
It is hoped that leading cadres at all levels and comrades in the scientific and technological circles would further unify understanding , clearly identify their target , make joint efforts to promote the innovation of knowledge , and raise our basic research work to a new level in order to add brilliance to the world treasure-house of science and make greater contributions to China 's socialist modernization .  
Fourth , it is necessary to further improve the body of public security laws and regulations and comprehensively push forward the codification of public security work into the legal system and the building of the police force .  The 15th national party congress put forward the objectives and requirements for establishing and improving the socialist legal system .  It is necessary to go by these objectives and requirements and cater to the practical needs of public security work , making timely adjustments to the plans for , and pace of , public security legislative work ;  
The above-mentioned " Opinion " points out : Over the past five decades following the founding of New China , especially since the start of reform and opening-up , the social welfare work in this country has made considerable progress and played a positive role in building the socialist material and spiritual civilizations .  As far as our old-age population is concerned , however , we have a large base figure , and the number of old people is still increasing at a rapid pace .  
They should establish as soon as possible a new dynamic social welfare administrative system and a lively operating mechanism in line with the requirements of the socialist market economy .  In addition , they should deeply reform the present social welfare organizations formed by the state and collectives , explore new ways to socialize the administration of social welfare , and see to it that all social welfare organizations are operating on their own , responsible for their own profits and losses , and marching on the road of self-development .  
On the basis of its comprehensive analysis of the current international and domestic situation , the party central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core requires that the party 's ideological and political work be done intensively and effectively , and takes this as an urgent strategic task related to the general situation of socialist reform and construction in our country for the whole party and the entire people of the whole nation .  
The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee decided to shift the focus of the party 's work onto economic development .  This correctly grasped the main contradiction in the initial stage of socialism , and was a significant political decision on fulfilling the party 's historical mission and building ours into a powerful socialist country .  
Only by correctly understanding and handling the relationship between the economy and politics can we make comprehensive development in the economic , political , ideological and cultural fields , and build ours into a wealthy , strong socialist modern country with democracy and a high degree of civilization .  
Deng Xiaoping also called for fostering new people with " a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good educational background , and a strong sense of discipline " and took this as the fundamental objective of developing socialist spiritual civilization .  He also stressed that ideals and the sense of discipline are the most important among all the four criteria .  
In order to actively promote the reform of the budget management system , establish a budget management system that fits the system of the socialist market economy , and bring about a scientific , institutionalized , and standardized system of budget management , as well as enhance the efficiency of using financial fund , the Ministry of Finance has decided to launch the work of reappraising fixed assets and circulating funds in 2000 for the administrative institutions and organizations under the jurisdiction of the central budget .  
Jiang Zemin indicated : Both China and Vietnam are socialist countries under the leadership of the communist party .  In the face of the present complicated and changeable international situation , we two countries should seize the current favorable opportunity , meet the challenges head-on , step up cooperation , and strive for common development .  
The tremendous achievements in economic and social development , which have been attained in the past 20 years by Shenzhen , the special economic zone personally founded by Deng Xiaoping and formed with the painstaking efforts of the second and third generations of the leading collectives of the party 's central committee , are the powerful evidence of our party 's endeavor to act as the " Three Represents " in the new period , and have laid the solid foundation for Shenzhen to take the lead in basically realizing socialist modernization .  
To properly act as the representative of the direction of the advanced culture in China , the key is to adhere to the principle of " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to both , " further advance the socialist cultural and ethic progress , and work hard to build and create the national , scientific , and popular socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , which is geared to the needs of modernization , the world , and the future .  
The tremendous achievements in economic and social development , which have been attained in the past 20 years by Shenzhen , the special economic zone personally founded by Deng Xiaoping and formed with the painstaking efforts of the second and third generations of the leading collectives of the party 's central committee , are the powerful evidence of our party 's endeavor to act as the " Three Represents " in the new period , and have laid the solid foundation for Shenzhen to take the lead in basically realizing socialist modernization .  
We will certainly live up to the earnest expectations of the party 's central committee .  In accordance with the requirements of the " Three Represents , " we will strengthen the party building in a comprehensive way , lead the people of the entire city to summon up all their courage and energy , forge ahead in a pioneering spirit , and work hard to build Shenzhen into a socialist demonstration city bearing Chinese characteristics and taking the lead in basically realizing modernization .  
to insure that all could , on a basis of their own initiative , learn revolutionary theories , guard and fight against the corrosion of corrupt ideology and culture , persistently struggle against schools of reactionary ideological trends , against idealistic and pseudoscientific ideologies ; that all should take in fact the Marxist world outlook , outlook on life , values , and take the initiative in socialist cultural civilization construction ;  
In particular , the eastern coastal areas should make efforts to establish the socialist market economy before other areas , realize the goal for the reform and development of the state-owned enterprises before other areas , complete the readjustment of the economic structure , and optimize and upgrade the industry before other areas , and realize basic agricultural modernization before other areas .  In short , they should work hard to realize modernization before other areas and make greater contribution to building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Our experience for more than 20 years has proved that these measures and actions in afforestation and improving the environment conform to the reality that our country faces arduous tasks in environmental construction and lacks funds .  Through these measures and actions , the socialist system 's advantages are given full play , and at the same time , people from around the whole country have a heightened awareness of the need for afforestation .  These measures and actions are a lively implementation of patriotism and are worthy of our careful summing up and further perfecting and developing .  
He pointed out : To promote socialization of social welfare is an inevitable requirement of the socialist market economy system ; a measure to meet the challenge of aging of the population , to meet the urgent need of speeding up the establishment and improvement of a senior citizens ' welfare service system , and to meet the objective demand of the progress of modernization and particularly urbanization ; and an effective way to rapidly alleviate the current contradictions between supply and demand in social welfare .  
] China will turn itself into a strong , prosperous , democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country and bring about rejuvenation of the great Chinese nation .  The Chinese people are ready to join all other peace-loving people in the rest of the world in contributing their wisdom and energy to world peace and development and an even brighter future for mankind .  
To turn China into a rich and strong , democratic , civilized modern socialist country through self-reliance and arduous struggles is the ideal shared by all Chinese nationalities in the primary stage of socialism .  
In short , as a result of 20 years of efforts , we have initially established the basic framework of a fiscal and taxation system suited to the demand of developing socialist market economy , and have achieved notable success in fiscal reforms and development .  
China is a socialist country ; it must strive to build strong state finance in order to press forward the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , continually enhance the material and cultural living standards of the people of all nationalities throughout the country , and preserve social stability and state economic and national defense security .  
In order to achieve fundamental changes in the economic setup and the method of economic growth , and embark on a path of coordinated economic and social development with higher speed , better economic returns , and continual improvement of overall quality , it is essential to meet the demands of developing socialist market economy , further deepen the fiscal and taxation reforms , and do a good job in fiscal and taxation work .  
Li Peng said : Since the standing committee was established in each of the local people 's congresses at and above the county level , local people 's congresses , holding legislative powers , and their standing committees have formulated a batch of local laws and regulations .  They have made a positive , catalytic contribution to the consummation of the socialist legal system and to promoting the development of various local causes .  
He said : Following the drastic changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe , the United States and some other Western countries have proceeded from the political need of promoting the Western social system and hegemonism , and therefore are extremely reluctant to see China adhering to the socialist path and extremely reluctant to see China adhere to the independent foreign policy of peace , continuing to develop and becoming big and powerful .  
As a result of over 20 years of reform and development , there has been great improvement of our comprehensive national strength , social productive forces , and people 's living standards ; we have progressed by leaps and bounds in building socialist spiritual civilization , democracy , and legal system ; and the whole world has seen the great vitality and vigor demonstrated by socialism in China .  
In the wake of the deepening of reforms and the development of socialist market economy , economic components and interests , social organizational forms and social ways of life , and jobs and employment methods are becoming more varied by the day , and this inevitably affects people 's ideological concepts and human relations in various ways , and some of these influences are negative ;  
All types of educational institutions at all levels and all educators in the country are shouldering a solemn mission .  They should have a fundamental aim of improving the quality of our nationals , give priority to cultivating the students ' innovativeness and practical abilities , and try hard to bring up developers of and successors to the socialist cause who achieve all-round moral , academic , physical , and artistic development .  
During a recent inspection of work in Liaoning , CPC Political Bureau Standing member and State Council Premier Zhu Rongji stressed that a social security system that is independent from enterprises and institutions is an important cornerstone of a socialist market economy system , and that accelerating the development of such a system is a matter of fundamental importance for deepening reforms , stabilizing society , and running the state well and ensuring national security , so we must do a good job of this important matter which has a bearing on the overall situation . 
Zhu Rongji stated that , only if the entire country makes a concerted effort from top to bottom to establish a better social security system will this difficult but grand undertaking definitely be able to succeed , making it possible for us to promote great advances in the reform of China 's socialist market economy system and lay an even firmer foundation for achieving the great goal of national modernization .  
Therefore , acting in unison of a high degree with the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core is where the fundamental interests of our party and our people lie , and also where the future and the fate of our country and socialism lie .  Everyone who is concerned for the socialist cause and who has a firm ideal and conviction should have such a political consciousness .  
Following Jiang Zemin 's speech , Zhu Rongji said : In his important speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin fully endorsed the important contributions rendered by the national labor models and advanced workers to reform , opening up , and the socialist modernization drive .  He spoke highly of the lofty spirit of the selfless dedication displayed by the national labor model and advanced workers .  He called on all the people to emulate these advanced models and work hard to build China into an affluent , strong , democratic , and civil socialist modern country .  
In short , the economic globalization trend and China 's reform and opening up have provided guarantee that the capital adequacy ratio reaches its standard , which is not only the rule of game for the international banking industry , but also the internal demand for the development of a socialist market economy and the promotion of the healthy growth of the banking industry in China .  
" On the premises that the public ownership persistently holds a dominant position , the national economic lifelines are under the state 's control , and the controlling and competitive power of the state-owned economy is growing strong , a certain reduction in the proportion of the state-owned economy will not affect the socialist nature of China . "  
Party committees and local government at all levels in Guangdong should make efforts to profoundly understand General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important conception of " three represents " in connection with Guangdong 's specific conditions , continue to advance reforms and opening-up , strive to move in the forefront of developing the advanced productive force , and push ahead socialist modernization .  
In the economic field , we are faced with two major topics that should be solved properly .  One is to establish a relatively perfect socialist market economic structure and the other is to maintain the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
Especially since its Third Plenary Meeting of the 11th National People 's Congress , our Party has re-established its ideological lines and has made significant decisions and taken strategic measures like reforms and opening-up policies to meet the development needs of the times.has greatly emancipated and developed the productive forces , accelerated the construction of the socialist material civilization and of the socialist spiritual civilization and has paved a way toward building up socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
To keep to the orientation of the progress of advanced culture , it is necessary to adapt ourselves to the requirements of reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization , to concentrate on improving the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the people across the country , and to unite and mobilize the people of all nationalities throughout the country to build our country into a prosperous , powerful , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist state .  
Since our army is an important force for building the socialist spiritual civilization and an advanced group composed of outstanding young people from all walks of life , it must conscientiously uphold the requirement for the advanced quality in ideological , moral , and cultural construction .  
ensure social stability at the grassroots level , ensure the security of grassroots political power , and ensure normal local economic and social development .  By achieving these we will make new and greater contributions to the acceleration of the development of democracy and the legal system at the grassroots level , to the implementation of the basic strategy of ruling the country by law , and to the accelerated construction of a socialist state ruled by law .  
Given the new condition of opening to the outside world and vigorously developing socialist market economy , leading cadres should , just like a lotus , stick to the revolutionary integrity , keep honest and clean , and always be a loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people so that they can make due contribution to further improving party style , strengthening administrative honesty , and opposing corruption .  
In the new situation of reform and opening-up and developing a socialist market economy , when the historic topic of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " lies ahead , it is both the earnest expectation of the Party and the masses and the objective requirement for implementing our military 's sacred mission to strengthen the military 's ideological and morality construction and to cultivate revolutionary military professions with the " Four Haves " .  
We should sing aloud the " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " to enable these songs that are revolutionary , advanced , healthy and progressive to echo in military camps , to enrich our lives , to inspire our spirit , to serve our strengthening and accelerating our military 's fighting strength , to serve our strengthening and improving ideological and political work , and to serve our constructing a socialist spiritual civilization .  
The Party 's basic lines have embodied in a centralized manner the Party 's nature of being advanced , of reflecting the fundamental interests and wishes of the broad number of the masses , of meeting the requirements for developing the social productive forces in contemporary China , and of powerfully pushing forward the development and the progress of socialist material and spiritual civilization 's construction .  
( VI ) The party 's basic theory , basic line , and basic program , and the brilliant achievements of reform , opening-up , and socialist modernization have enriched the connotation of patriotism , and raised the patriotic feelings of our nation , and aroused the entire people 's patriotic enthusiasm .  Over more than 20 years , our nation enjoyed political stability , economic growth , national unity ;  
The establishment of the socialist system furthers the development of socialized production and also eliminates the root cause of the fundamental antagonism between collective interests and individual interests .  It lays a solid material foundation and provides a fundamental institutional guarantee for the rise of collectivism .  
The Guangzhou Military Region , which is located on the forefront of reform and opening up , has always been carrying out ideological and political work with emphasis on studying and solving new situation and problems under the conditions of reform , opening up and the development of a socialist market economy , on studying and solving main , difficult , hot and doubtful problems faced by various units at present , and on summing up and promoting effective experiences in army building in the new period with good results .  
At present , our country 's socialist modernization construction is right in a critical period .  Restructuring state-owned enterprises , helping the poor and storming heavily fortified positions , completing the " Ninth Five-Year " plan , realizing the objective of comfortably well-off , and a series of important issues in the reform and development all need to be studied and resolved .  
Focusing on and serving this center of economic construction , constantly strengthening and improving the ideological and political work and the building of spiritual civilization to fully display its role of clearing up doubts , remove apprehensions , and inspire spirit can vigorously safeguard and promote the building and development of the socialist material civilization .  
The protracted nature of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that it will take a process of considerably long historical struggle to achieve the grand objective of socialist modernization and it is not plain sailing because many difficulties and problems will crop up in the course of our advance .  
The protracted nature of socialist modernization determines that ideological and political work is a measure of fundamental and lasting importance rather than an expedient measure and it is an indispensable task that should be carried out perseveringly and unremittingly .  
The complexity of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that we are improving and developing the self-reform of the socialist system and the world is undergoing a profound change .  Against this background , people 's thinking has become lively ;  
Only if the Party becomes the requirement for the development of China 's advanced socialist productive force , the forward direction for China 's advanced culture , and the true representative for the basic interests of China 's masses can the Party forever remain in an invincible position , forever have the heartfelt support of each of the country 's nationalities , and continually move forward .  
At present , the world socialist movement has fallen to a low point in its development while profitable relationships are adjusted by deepening the reform .  Furthermore , with the infiltration and the influence of decadent ideas and culture , corruption and other ugly phenomena grow and creep within the Party .  
The most fundamental point is to , in accordance with the requirements of Comrade Jiang Zemin , consistently promote education on patriotism , the collective and socialism and to mobilize all people in the entire country to struggle for the cause of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics and to struggle for building China into a modernized socialist country that is rich , powerful , democratic and civilized .  
Along with the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy and the development of the socialist market economy , and along with the increase in economic and social contradictions and the increase in different ideological and conceptual problems , corruptive ideas and culture can take advantage and build up .  In addition , the remains of feudal ideas , including feudal superstition and ignorant ideas and concepts that have long been in our society , can arise - - as the popular Chinese saying goes , " dregs float to the surface " .  
The ossified " Soviet model " took the experience and development course of socialist construction under a special historical condition as something absolute and sacred without regard to the need to make continuous innovations inside socialism across different stages of development .  As a result , this seriously hindered the development of productivity , made it impossible to improve the people 's living conditions over a long time , and went against the requirements determined by the nature of socialism .  
Our comprehensive national strength has been moved much ahead in the ranking among all countries .  In international affairs , we resolutely oppose hegemonism and power politics , and join hands with all peace-loving nations and peoples .  Our international prestige has been continuously raised , and we are showing a good image as a socialist big country to the whole world .  
Socialist spiritual civilization is being developed more and more effectively , and comprehensive social progress is being made .  The progressive socialist culture with Chinese characteristics is turning into a great mental force rallying the Chinese nation as a whole .  
The surging trend of new technological revolution and the knowledge economy in the world will not only provide a more advanced scientific and technological foundation for the development of socialism , but will also bring about a hidden risk of further widening the gap between the socialist countries with comparatively backward economic and cultural conditions and the developed capitalists countries .  
Thus , we must continue to enhance our national defense strength , and tempered a sharp and powerful " sword " of justice for safeguarding the sovereign and territorial integrity of socialist China and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation .  
[ Zeng ] Following the progress of the economic and political structural reforms , the cadres and personnel system reform has gradually proceeded , developed in an in-depth manner , and yielded great results , during which we have gained rich experience and probed some rules .  These can be summed up in six aspects : We must hold firm to the correct direction that the organization line must serve the political line and correspond with the establishment of the socialist market economic structure and the development of socialist democratic politics ;  
He said : The party 's ideological and political work is the lifeblood of economic and all other work , is the central link for uniting the whole party and the entire people of all ethnical groups throughout the country to fulfill all tasks of the party and the state , and is the major political superiority of our party and socialist state .  
As an organic whole , the concept of the " three represents " has put forward the need for the " elimination of exploitation and polarization " as the basic social problem to be solved during the development of socialist society , which is required by the Marxist ruling party in its strategy for social development .  
cherish the current gratifying reform , opening-up , and modernization situation ; and initiate what is useful to the Internet and do away with the harmful while performing their duties .  Only by so doing will we be able to actually make contributions to the construction of the socialist material and spiritual civilizations and to pioneer a vast , unlimited path for the development of China 's Internet .  
What the hostile western forces want to preserve is the capitalist private ownership system and the political and economic systems , values , and way of life that the bourgeoisie highly esteem , and all this runs counter to the essence of the socialist system under communist party leadership .  
Seeing the situation clearly , mastering the overall situation , correctly distinguishing between the essentials and the nonessentials , and safeguarding and developing the excellent situation in the ideological and political realm is an important guarantee for continuously pushing forward the reform and opening up and the socialist modernization drive as well as a fundamental requirement for shaping and nurturing a national spirit in the new century .  
The conviction of the people in socialism has been transformed into concrete practice for developing economy , improving livelihood , and building a prosperous , powerful , democratic , and civilized socialist country .  
The progress of the socialist materialist civilization and spiritual civilization has been constantly cleansing the outdated ideas and concepts and the advanced ideological and cultural mentalities like independent mentality , innovative mentality , competitive mentality , open-up mentality , and so on as well as those civilized and progressive social concepts like efficiency concept , effectiveness concepts , and so on which can promote the development of social productive forces have gradually gone deeply into the hearts of the people .  
The civilization and progress of the society , the vivid and lively political environment , and especially the socialist democratic and political life created and developed by the people under the leadership of the party have made people 's minds greatly tempered and increasingly mature .  
The most important and most profound experience in Shenzhen 's ultra-high-speed development was its conforming to the requirements for establishing a socialist market economic system , timely reform of the system of government , reform of the administrative system , change in the function of government , and strides towards the establishment of a clean and highly efficient government .  
Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core and through the joint efforts of the people of all nationalities of the whole country , the main tasks put forth in the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan will be accomplished on time , national economic and social developments have attained great achievements , the second-step strategic objective for the socialist modernization construction has been comprehensively realized , and the social productive forces have entered a new stage .  
This system played a positive role at one time , but because people were subject to dogmatism and their minds were ossified and because no prompt reform was carried out to suit the changed situation , the system gradually lost its vitality and became a fetter for socialist enthusiasm as well as an obstacle to the development of socialism .  
At a time when we are deepening the rule of law and vigorously advancing the building of a socialist market economy , the party Central Committee has put forward the magnificent strategic goal of developing the western region on a large scale .  The establishment of this strategic goal has epoch-making significance to economic prosperity and development in China 's western region .  
Ma : Since reform and opening up , while civil air defense work has achieved marked results , as our socialist market economy has intensified , reformed , and developed , civil air defense has grown increasingly unsuited to the needs of the " market " and the " battlefield " , and remains unsuited to the needs of future wars in areas such as rapid response , project construction quality , and recycling and re-supply capacity .  
They felt : In the new century , changes will continue to take place in the international environment and the international political struggle , the practice of socialist reform will develop in depth in our country , and an unprecedentedly complicated situation will appear in the social ideological field .  The diversification of socioeconomic elements , organizational forms , material benefits , and ways of employment will influence officers and men deeply , on all sides , and in a long-term way .  
The Chinese people made arduous exploration for half a century to go through this process .  They achieved major successes , and they had also experienced many twists and turns or even paid high prices before they could basically accomplish at last an organic integration of the universality and particularity of socialism under new historical conditions , and begin to figure out the right path of socialist development that suits China 's national conditions .  
Regarding the major question of how to treat the productive forces and production relations in socialist society , we committed two mistakes : 1 ) we believed that , for the socialist ownership system , the larger the size and the higher the degree of public ownership the better ; and 2 ) over a long time , we did not attach first priority to developing the productive forces .  
On the one hand , we firmly retained many practices that were not socialist ones but restraints to development of the productive forces , or those which were only applicable to certain special historical conditions .  We claimed such practices to be " socialist principles " , but actually they were not .  On the other hand , we mistook for " capitalist practices " many things that were conducive to the development of productive forces under socialist conditions , and so we repudiated them .  
our socialist system is not perfect , the socialist market economic system and socialist legal system are still immature and unsound , while decadent feudal and capitalist ideologies and small-scale production as a force of habit still have widespread influence on society .  To be sure , there are many tasks for us to undertake during the initial stage of socialism .  
The socialist market economic structure is the designated model for the economic structural reform in China , it marks the forsaking of the highly centralized conventional planned economic structure of the past , and it is substantially different from the capitalist market economy .  
In the wake of the development of the economic structural reform and socialist modernization in China , and in view of objective needs , General Secretary Jiang Zemin expressly pointed out during the 15th CPC National Congress : on the premise that the four cardinal principles are upheld , we must continue to forward the reform of the political structure , further expand socialist democracy , develop a sound socialist legal system , rule the country by law , and build a socialist legal state .  
At present and in a longer period to come , the old capitalist system will continue to surround the new socialist system .  The socialist system , which is young and pretty much immature , can only struggle to survive and seek development under the pressure of capitalist countries which are dominating over and enjoying a favorable position of strength within the framework of the old international political and economic order .  
So long as countries like China and Vietnam keep holding high the socialist banner , persist in running their own countries well , constantly increase their national strength , enable their people to get rich , and keep their countries prosperous , they will surely be able to greatly reinforce socialism 's strong image and increase its appeal , thus push the international communist movement toward a new high tide .  
As theoretical workers of socialist countries , we should conscientiously sum up the experience left over by the practice and exploration of socialism in the 20th century .  We should take the summarization of this rich theoretical heritage as our solemn historical mission , make our unique contributions to upholding and developing Marxism , and thus provide a better guidance to practice and exploration of socialism in the 21st century .  
Since the implementation of the " Ninth Five-Year " Plan , we have scored glorious achievements in promoting spiritual civilization , while attaining tremendous successes in developing material civilization .  All this has provided a gigantic spiritual motive force and a strong ideological guarantee for the development of the reform and opening-up program and the socialist modernization drive .  
They have brought into full play the exemplary role of the advanced models well in all fields of social life and among various mass groups .  They have vigorously given full scope to healthy tendencies in society and created a fine general mood to respect the advanced and vie with each other to become the advanced .  They have also given a powerful ideological guarantee and intellectual support to creating a fine atmosphere in society for the development of the reform and opening-up program and the socialist modernization drive .  
It is worth mentioning that the Fifth " Five-Year Plan " period was timed with the Third " Five-Year " campaign launched in China to spread legal knowledge among the citizens , which was held in the course of China 's building a socialist market economic system and under the great backdrop of the party putting forward , at the 15th CPC national congress , the proposal of administering the country according to laws and of building China into a socialist country that is ruled by laws .  
In the long years of revolutionary war and socialist construction , especially at important historical junctures , he firmly supported the party 's correct leadership and steadfastly implemented the party 's line , principles , and policies , demonstrating a Communist 's steadfast faith in communism and noble revolutionary quality .  
The victory in the Qamdo Battle smashed the vain hopes of the imperialists and pro-imperialist forces in Tibet to split the motherland , smoothly opened the door of negotiations , promoted the process of peaceful liberation of Tibet , and laid a foundation for the Tibetan people to shake off the trammels of the feudal serf system and build a new-type socialist national relationship based on equality , unity , and mutual help .  
unswervingly implemented the party 's policy concerning nationalities and religion and the regional national autonomy system ; increasingly consolidated and developed the new-type socialist national relationship based on equality , unity , and mutual help ; and made the dream come true in real terms for the people of all nationalities to exercise their rights according to the law in the political , economic , cultural , and social life .  
our domestic market has huge potential ; the socialist market economic system has taken shape ; the pattern of opening up in all directions is basically established , and all these factors have laid the sound foundation for accelerating development .  
In short , the opportunities globalization provides are objective opportunities , and we must seize these opportunities by participating in the globalization process , especially by joining the WTO , to fully utilize the international and domestic markets and resources , further perfect the socialist market economic system , accelerate the change in the pattern of economic growth and the adjustment of the economic structure , and continuously increase our international competitiveness .  
In conclusion , Yang Chuantang said : The people of various nationalities in Tibet are confident in seizing the historic opportunity brought along by the large-scale development of the western region to speed up development , to narrow the gap between Tibet and fraternal provinces and municipalities , and to fulfill the grand objective of entering the front ranks of China 's drive for socialist modernization , an objective set by Comrade Deng Xiaoping .  
China has preliminarily established the socialist market economic system .  The " Proposal " has not put forward more specific targets .  It only sets a single target of a predictive nature to " double the GDP " by 2010 .  
Now , the initial form of socialist market economy has been established , but the historical mission of social system transition remains to be completed .  For example , some enterprises are still unable to meet the development demands of market economy , the operating mechanism is not active , the capability for technical innovation is not strong ;  
In additional to the meeting between leaders of the highest level of China and the DPRK , our party has continued to maintain high-level contacts with the Vietnamese and the Laos parties .  We also organized two important theoretical discussion activities with the Vietnamese parties , which contributed to improving friendly relations between the ruling parties of the socialist countries .  
Nonetheless , under the conditions of the socialist market economy and along with the gradual deepening of our country 's political or economic structural reform as well as the in-depth development of our army building , our present enlistment system governing officers in active service has turned incompatible with the needs of a new situation or a new task in certain aspects , and it is thereby imperative to replenish or amend the " Regulations " in an appropriate way .  
The times we live in and the prevailing social and historic conditions determine that the Chinese people must take the socialist road if they are to make the country strong and prosperous and make everybody rich .  
However , because his understanding of the laws of socialist construction was insufficient , because of theoretical errors , because of incorrect response to dramatic changes in the international situation , he also committed subjectivist errors , which resulted in the failure of the " great leap forward " and the people 's communes , and , particularly , this finally led to the great political chaos of the " cultural revolution " that was immensely harmful to the cause of socialism in China .  
Our undertaking of reform , opening up and socialist modernization has been pushed forward into a new stage .  In China today , it is a scene of political stability , economic development , national unity , social progress , constantly improving living standard , and prosperity .  
The 20th century saw a series of major events that affected the course of the world history , but what had the greatest impact on the changes in human society and induced the most profound speculations is the transformation of the socialist ideal into practice , from practice into system , from the practice of a single country into the practice of numerous countries , and again from a triumphant march into a tortuous journey .  
Even though the socialist movement experienced grave setbacks , its banner was still flying high above the Earth . These are not random historical phenomena but a vivid embodiment of an objective regularity of social development .  
It has been only 80 years since the time the first socialist state was founded , so most socialist states have a history of 40 or 50 years , which places them at the initial development stage .  Their economic , political , and social working mechanisms have not been completely developed and established , they still strive hard exploring how to fully develop the advantages of socialism .  
Socialism has opened up the way to the solution of the contradiction between the productive forces and relations of production inherent in capitalism , and , while liberating the productive forces of socialist countries to the utmost extent , at the same time objectively promoted the improvement of capitalist system .  Capitalism 's internal contradictions got somewhat smoothed out , and capitalism was given a new opportunity for development ; this , in its turn advanced socialist production and the development and progress of human civilization as a whole .  
This put forward a new topic : on the one hand we need to staunchly adhere to the fundamental principles of socialism put forth by Marx and Engels , on the other hand we need to adopt a scientific attitude to Marx and Engels ' tentative ideas of socialism and , proceeding from the reality of relative economic and cultural backwardness map out a course and policy for socialist construction .  
" Special privilege " mentality , patriarchal style , obsession of hierarchy and other feudal things , in conjunction with the corrosion by decadent capitalist ideas and culture , have inflicted damage on the party building with regard to ideology , organization , and style of work , such that some leading cadres have obscured the nature and purpose of the party , even to the deterioration of the socialist democratic legal system .  
Since the realization of socialism mostly started based on a relatively low level of economic development , in order to satisfy the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the people , we must rapidly transform the backward condition of social productive forces : in a situation where the two systems , socialist and capitalist , coexist , we also need to energetically develop productive forces to give expression to socialism 's superiority .  
In the past five years , this country that is in the midst of advancing socialist modernization not only reined in the unbridled horse of inflation , but also curbed the trend of deflation .  China accomplished the unusual feat of yearly economic growth of eight percent accompanied by improvement of quality and efficiency of economic growth .  
However , China 's current legal system is yet to be refined .  According to the guideline set by the 15th CPC National Congress , by 2010 , China should establish a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics .  As such , legislation is still an arduous task lying ahead for people 's congresses at all levels and their standing committees .  
Holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping theory , continuing to step up the building of democracy and the legal system , and building China into a country ruled by law having a high degree of socialist democracy and a sound socialist legal system , are an important assurance for the Chinese nation to realize the grand goal of rejuvenation , as well as an important contribution of the Chinese nation to mankind 's historical progress .  
While failing to achieve their purpose , they began to change their strategies .  While maintaining their economic , political , and military pressure , they shifted the focus onto making ideological infiltration against the socialist countries and took this as an important means of pursuing their " peaceful evolution " strategy .  
Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , precisely because of the adoption of the principle of persistently carrying out reforms and opening up , we can score today 's brilliant achievements in the development of socialist material and spiritual civilization , and our party can withstand the tests of various difficulties and risks .  The socialist system in our country can also gain strong vigor and dynamism under the eventful and changing international situation .  
Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " cult constantly spread rumors to confuse the people and make trouble in violation of the law .  Their evil intention is to create chaos in China and to undermine social stability , making it impossible for the masses of the people to work , study , and live normally , disrupting economic construction , which is a central task , and then proceeding to realize their political scheme of overthrowing the CPC leadership and changing the socialist system in China .  
In order to welcome a new revolution in agro-technology , the National Agro-Technology Conference set a well-founded and effective management system for agro-technology , a system of research and development of an advanced international standard , a visionary promotion and service system for agro-technology , and a strong and stable guarantee system for agro-technology , created a new system for agro-technology which is congruent with the socialist market economy system , and established new mechanisms for development , distribution , competitiveness , and cooperation .  
We must carefully formulate and seriously carry out a guiding plan for ethical building , blend the basic moral concept demands into the relevant laws and regulations and the various specific policies , and into the various items of social management , and continually promote the formation and perfection of the system of socialist ideology and ethics .  
As students of military academies , we shoulder the historic mission of relying on science and technology to build a strong army and accelerate the modernization of our army 's armament and equipment .  We must more consciously strengthen our cultivation of Marxist theories and scientific spirit , arm ourselves with modern scientific knowledge , and exert to spread the fruits of socialist spiritual and cultural progress .  We must never allow fallacies of " Falungong " to contaminate our sacred school campuses .  
However , we should clearly understand that we are still in the early stages of a socialist society .  We are still facing a basic national climate characterized by vast space , a large population , a weak economic base and slow economic and cultural development .  We are still facing a basic national climate characterized by a dominating social contradiction expressed as a gap between social productivity and the increasing material and cultural demands of the populace , as well as a huge economic , scientific and technological gap with developed countries .  
The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission was rich in substance .  Take the question of honesty and self-discipline for example .  While upholding the existing regulations , the session put forward , in line with the basic rules of the socialist market economy , six moral requirements on leading cadres to ensure that they are honest in performing official duties .  
Vigorously disseminating and promoting the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career is very important for us to live through the rigid test of reform , opening up and developing the socialist market economy and continuously advancing the current great project .  
Countless Party members and revolutionary military professionals would dedicate everything in them to liberating the Chinese nation , bringing happiness to the people and revitalizing the country .  The reform , opening up and the development of the socialist market economy have added enormous vitality and historical progress to our construction of material and spiritual civilizations .  
In light of this principle , vigorously promoting the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career is not harmful to the socialist economic situation and the development of the socialist market economy - - it is beneficial to the development of the socialist market economy and the consolidation of the socialist economic base .  
Without the lofty ideal of being unselfish , afraid of nothing and ethical in fulfilling one 's official duties , could we maintain the political quality of the people 's army and walk at the cutting edge of society as a whole in the socialist spiritual civilization construction despite the infiltration of money worship , hedonism and extreme individualism ?  
Since the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy , we have been paying full attention to regulating people 's conduct with legal means in order to meet the requirements of developing the socialist market economy .  Meanwhile , rule by law has been defined as a basic strategy for ruling the country .  
With good moral qualities , people will be able to consciously uphold justice and eliminate evil and carry forward the good and punish the bad .  All this is conducive to establishing a good social practice of pursuing the lofty and encouraging the advanced , ensuring a sound progress of socialist market economy , and giving a push to the improvement of the overall national quality .  
These leaders should pay attention to study characteristics of these units , meticulously review positive experiences drawn from practice , and enthusiastically explore new issues and new problems that arise in the condition of reforming , opening up and developing a socialist market economy .  These leaders should closely associate the essence of the five-sentence general requirement and the " Program " with the reality of these " small , remote , scattered and directly administered " units , work in a creative manner and continuously improve the quality and efficiency of our work .  
Comrades throughout the party have also come to realize profoundly that in the face of the changing international situation and the formidable and arduous tasks at home , our party will remain firm as a rock and indestructible , our socialist country will stay as steady as Mount Tai and stand erect and unshakable , and our cause will be full of vitality and will produce brilliant results only if we always uphold " three represents " and conscientiously implement " three represents " .  
In the face of the ever-changing international situation and intense international competition , without a lofty idea , firm conviction and powerful spiritual mainstay , it is impossible for comrades of the entire party and people throughout the country to make our country powerful , invigorate our nation and basically realize our socialist modernization in the middle of this century .  Without a strong rallying power and brilliant creativity , it is impossible for them to do so .  Without an indomitable will and concerted efforts , it is also impossible for them to do so .  
In Chinese society today when we are carrying out socialist modernization , the greatest benevolence is whatever is beneficial for developing the social productive forces , increasing all-round national strength , and improving living standards ; otherwise , a thing is non-benevolent or is evil .  
In the document of the 15th national party congress , the principal contradiction in the socialist society are summarized as the " contradiction between the people 's increasing material and cultural demands and the backward social production . "  
Given the circumstances of the socialist market economy , the Party Central Committee has also adapted to the transition in the Party 's approach toward leadership and managing state affairs , has realistically improved Party leadership , displayed Party leadership of the united front on democratic consultation , made the Party 's correct stand become the common ground of the vast majority of members of the united front , and united and led them to work for the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
In recent years , relevant mass organizations such as various democratic parties and associations of industry and commerce have gradually experienced political transitions where new leading members have replaced old ones , united and mutually beneficial national relations have been further consolidated , and major progress has been made in relations between religion and socialist society ; the most fundamental reason for all of this is that a high-quality contingent of non-party leaders has been cultivated .  
The Interim Procedures are more all-compassing , standardized and reasonable than the previous procedures , but since each national and military reform must advance step by step , the establishment and completion of the socialist market economy takes time and the Interim Procedures should be implemented in an enthusiastic , reliable and gradual manner .  It is impossible to thoroughly resolve all contradictions and problems at once that have arise since the implementation of reform and opening up .  
Deputies Shi Yuxiao and Zhang Guochu held that today , facing the new task of regarding economic construction as the central task , the important thinking of Comrade Jiang Zemin on " three represents " has given a highly refined interpretation in fundamentally answering the questions of how to build the party , what kind of party to build , and how to act well as the " force at the core " in leading the cause of socialist modernization in the new historical conditions .  
Faced with the extremely sharp and complicated international struggle , in the past 10-plus years , the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core judged the hour and sized up the situation , took the initiative , maneuvered among various states , and defeated western hostile forces ' attempts to disturb us .  Under the leadership of the CPC , a socialist China , with a strong posture , is standing in the east of the world .  
Our current tasks are extremely arduous , such as deepening the reform of state-owned enterprises , realigning industrial structures , increasing peasant income , re-arranging laid-off workers , expanding social employment , balancing the distribution of incomes , and setting up and improving the socialist security system .  
During these five years China has enjoyed political stability , economic development , social progress , and ethnic solidarity ; all-round national strength has risen to a new level , living standards have on the whole reached a comfortably well-off level , and we have victoriously achieved the second strategic goal in socialist modernization .  
The facts have fully proven that Deng Xiaoping Theory is forever the great banner guiding us in continually advancing from victory to victory , and that the party 's third-generation leadership collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has superlative skill and ability in mastering complex situations and leading socialist modernization , and is profoundly trusted and revered by the whole party , the whole army , and the people of all nationalities throughout the country .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin has scientifically summed up the historical experiences of the world socialist movement and of our party in leading the Chinese revolution and construction , and creatively put forward the important thinking on " three represents , " thus answering in scientific fashion a series of major issues that we face in stepping up party building in the new situation .  
Only when development is accelerated can the living standards of the people of all nationalities in our region be improved and the increasingly growing needs of material and cultural life be met , and only when development is accelerated can the new-type socialist nationality relationship characterized by equality , unity , and mutual help be consolidated and developed and national solidarity be consolidated and enhanced .  
making major progress in establishing the modern corporate system for state-owned enterprises , making our social security system more perfect , making substantive strides in perfecting the socialist market economic system , and participating in international economic cooperation and competition in a larger scope and to a deeper degree ;  
not only will it deprive them of an affluent life , but it may restore the history written in blood and tears .  The people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have deep-seated hatred for the feudal serf system of the old Tibet , entertain an infinite love for the socialist new Tibet , and cherish intense hatred for the Dalai 's separatist and sabotage activities .  
During the Tenth Five-Year Plan , we must persevere in orienting ourselves to the market without wavering at all and ceaselessly eliminate the institutional impediments to the development of productive forces and improve the socialist market economy so as to provide a mighty driving force and institutional guarantee for national economic and social development .  
To implement the Tenth Five-Year Plan , we must work hard to improve the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the entire population in the forward direction of an advanced culture , adhere to the idea of " tackling with both hands , both hands hard , " combine the rule of law with the rule of morality , and vigorously push ahead with the building of a socialist spiritual civilization .

However , the problem of the current administrative and management structures being unable to completely meet the demands of the socialist market economy still exists .  
Political restructuring and the development of the socialist democracy and political system must be conducive to maintaining and giving play to the features and advantages of our political system , and conducive to maintaining the unity of the country , ethnic unity and social stability .  In addition , the historical conditions and the level of economic , cultural and educational development must also be taken into full consideration .

Our armed forces are a great wall of steel that defends the motherland and are also an important force for socialist modernization .  Participation in and support for the development of the west is the inevitable demand on the armed forces in their process of putting the " three represents [ representing the demands for the development of advanced social productive forces , advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people ] " thinking into practice .

The " three advantages " criterion constitutes the standard for us to judge all our work in carrying out China 's reform and opening-up program and developing the socialist modernization drive .  In this way , the thinking on " three represents " helps set the goals for party building in the new period , and expand the historical mission of the Communist Party of China in the new period .  It also provides a theoretical guidance to the ruling party for further strengthening its cultural , social , and economic foundations .  
The conference explicitly demanded that the entire party and the whole nation work together and make vigorous efforts to solve the current pronounced problems in public order , firmly achieve the objective of realizing a marked improvement in public order in two years ' time , and provide a powerful guarantee for the socialist reform , opening up , and modernization drive .

This sheer nonsense created by Li Hongzhi has belittled the remarkable achievements China has attained in its building of a socialist material civilization and a socialist spiritual civilization at the present stage , and has fully exposed the anti-human essence of the " Falungong . "  
Over the past half a century , the broad masses of the officers and men of the Tibet Military District have joined hands with the Tibetan people in setting numerous records , and Tibet " has witnessed changes year in and year out and day by day . "  Having taken a giant step into the new socialist era from a feudal serf society , Tibet has renewed its cities , built new factories , extended its pastures , fertilized its farm fields , and improved its people 's livelihood . .  
Under the correct leadership of the party Central Committee and thanks to the vigorous support and selfless assistance of all brother provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities , people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have forged ahead in unity in a pioneering spirit , speeded up the region 's development , defended the unification of the motherland and fought against national splittism , and have attained world-acclaimed achievements in the region 's socialist revolutionary and construction undertakings .  
Today , Tibet is enjoying fast economic growth , great social progress , a stable situation , a sound national unity , and a strong and consolidated border defense ; and its people are leading a happy and contended life .  A scene of prosperity in the socialist new Tibet has spread out before the people of the whole world .  
Conducting propaganda and education on the socialist legal system in a thoroughgoing way and enhancing the legal sense and quality of the all the citizens , leading cadres at all levels in the first place , is an important aspect of the implementation of the basic general plan for managing the country according to the law and building a socialist country ruled by law and also an important task set by the 10th Five-Year Plan and an important legal guarantee for the implementation of the 10th Five-Year Plan .  
All comrades of the party , leading cadres at all levels in particular , must unceasingly enhance their legal sense and ability to act according to the law and strive to promote the improvement of the entire people 's legal sense and quality and lay a solid foundation for building a socialist country ruled by law .  
General knowledge of the law has been widespread , and education in the legal system has been combined closely with the practice of law .  As a result , citizens ' awareness of the law has noticeably increased , and various social undertakings are vigorously managed according to law .  All this has played an important role in implementing the basic plan for governing the country according to law and building a country under the rule of the socialist legal system and played a guaranteeing role in maintaining the overall situation in reform , development , and stability .  
By implementing the Fourth Five-Year Plan for Disseminating the General Knowledge of Law , we should strive to shift from enhancing all the people 's awareness of law to improving the quality of all the people 's knowledge of law and from management by relying on administrative means to management by using legal means ; we should promote the management of all undertaking according to law in an all-round way in order to lay a solid foundation for governing the country according to law and building a country under the rule of the socialist legal system .  
Attention should be paid to raising the theoretical level of the socialist legal system among large numbers of cadres , especially among the leading cadres , and increasing their ability to make decisions , perform their official duties , and exercise management according to law .  
Only when we adapt ourselves to the transformation from a planned economic structure to a market economic structure and only when we materialize the change from a structure ruled by man which is based on a highly developed centralization of individual power to a democratic structure ruled by law can we open up a new prospect in " the building of a socialist country ruled by law , " indicated Wang Guixiu .  
The citizens ' awareness of law and quality of law should be enhanced so as to lay a solid foundation for building a socialist country ruled by law ; this is where the vital importance of the education on law popularization among the entire people lies .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , under the leadership of the CPC , people of different ethnic backgrounds in Tibet created a socialist miracle on the ruins of a feudal serfdom and successfully achieved the historical leap forward to socialism .  At the time of the peaceful liberation , the central authorities decided to temporarily retain Tibet 's old social system .  
People 's democratic dictatorship is the fundamental road to Tibet 's development and stability .  To uphold people 's democratic dictatorship in Tibet , we must make constant efforts to foster socialist democracy , perfect the system of regional autonomy in areas inhabited by minority nationalities , firmly crack down on sabotages committed by the Dalai clique and on all kinds of criminal activities harmful to national security , safeguard the motherland 's unification and ethnic unity , and seriously protect the fundamental interests of the masses .  
We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the central authorities , with the vigorous and selfless support of the people in the rest of the country , and with the unremitting efforts and hard work of people of different ethnic backgrounds in Tibet , the magnificent goal of building a united , prosperous , and civilized socialist new Tibet can definitely be achieved .  
They have taken advantage of the channels of international economic and cultural exchanges and dissemination to energetically advertise the political concepts of bourgeois democracy , freedom , and human rights , pursue egoistic values , advocate the reactionary views of divesting armed forces of party leadership and depoliticizing them , vilify CPC leadership , and wage an all-out attack against China 's socialist system with the aim of bringing about a credibility crisis or confidence crisis among the people , who will eventually abandon party leadership and the socialist system .  
The majority of demobilized military cadres carry forward and promote the excellent traditions and working styles of the people 's army - - struggling with painstaking efforts , striving forward and dedicating themselves to their careers and enthusiastically forging ahead .  The majority made new contributions to the great cause of constructing socialist modernization , have won praise from the party and the people and have added more glories to the people 's army .  
Hu Jintao pointed out : Since the beginning of this year , the whole party and the whole nation have been conscientiously implementing the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee and the party Central Committee 's major policy decisions and vigorously advancing the drive for socialist modernization by persistently taking development as the theme , structural readjustment as the principal line , reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress as a driving force , and improving the people 's living standards as the basic goal .  
To guarantee and promote the development of the socialist market economy , and especially to straighten out and regularize the order of the market economy and crack down on various illegal and criminal activities in the economic field , we need to enhance the legal quality of the entire citizens .  
Profoundly conducting legal system propaganda and education and enhancing the law-abiding quality of the entire citizens and first of all , leading cadres at all levels , is an important requirement and prerequisite for the implementation of the basic principle of governing the country on the basis of laws and building a socialist rule-by-law country , and is also an important task in the Tenth Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development . This also provides a legal guarantee for the implementation of the Tenth Five-Year Plan .  
The objective of the Fourth 5-Year Plan on Law Popularization is to realize " two points of improvement " and " two transformations . "  The two points of improvement refers to , in light of the principle of our constitution and the development progress of socialist democratic legal construction in the new development stage , profoundly promoting educational activities to disseminate the law and comprehensively improve the legal quality of all citizens as a whole , particularly leading cadres at all levels .  
In short , " the armed forces to be with no party affiliation " , " nonpoliticization of the armed forces " , and " nationalization of the armed forces " preached by the Western hostile forces are three poisonous swords , and their sinister intentions are to make our party " lose " its absolute leadership over the armed forces and " lose " its ruling position , to make our state " lose " its socialist nature , and to make our people 's army " lose " its political nature .  
Fei Xiaotong , honorary chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Democratic League and a famous socialist , made a speech at the meeting .  He recalled the brilliant achievements made by the CPC in leading the Chinese people to seek the truth and strive for happiness in connection with his personal experience .  He said : A Chinese intellectual should contribute his or her knowledge to the state , contribute ideas and proposals for national construction , and do down-to-earth work benefiting the country and the people .  
From the very beginning , the party openly and explicitly regarded the most beautiful ideal of human beings - socialist society and communist society - as its objective for struggle , employed Marxism as an ideological weapon to sharply observe and analyze issues regarding China , united a large number of advanced people that excel at dedicating themselves to , and deeply went among the workers and the farmers to do the masses ' work .  
Thus it is very natural for the Chinese people bullied and humiliated by superpowers from Western countries and domestic reactionary forces over the past 100-plus years ? to look forward to the socialist ideal - expect their country to be prosperous , rich and strong , but without the phenomena of a huge gap between the rich and the poor and the weak being bullied by the strong .  
It is true that the party , before long after its establishment , realized that , in light of the Chinese real situation of a semicolonial and semi-feudalistic society , the party should give priority to toppling imperialist and feudalistic forces over the immediate establishment of a socialist society not to mention a communist society , a task for far ahead in the future .  
Under the condition of developing a socialist market economy , a qualified leading cadre must not only have a relatively high political quality and a relatively strong professional ability but must also have relatively high legal quality .  
Answer : A host of facts has proved that Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " cult organization have completely transformed into an out-and-out reactionary political organization and a political force and have become the tool of international anti-China forces and the splittist forces in Taiwan for subverting the political power of our people 's democratic dictatorship and the socialist system and for undermining national unification .  
They should associate strategies and policies issued by the central government with realities in their own region and department , combine needs with possibilities , unite the spirit of forging ahead with that of seeking the truth and being realistic .  They should align working enthusiasm with being scientific .  All comrades in the Party , particularly leading cadres , should work in a creative manner and use innovations in their leadership styles and skills to look toward a new horizon in building the Party and socialist modernization construction .  
To properly organize various commemorative activities , we should follow the guidance of Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " , closely surround the main theme determined by the party central leadership , and sing aloud the eulogy for praising the Communist Party , socialism , and reform and opening up with full enthusiasm and strong assurance , thus encouraging the entire party membership and the people to continue to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , and march forward to create a bright future for the cause of socialist modernization .  
It is particularly necessary to enhance moral education , and conduct patriotic , collectivist , and socialist education for secondary and elementary school students , conduct education in the fine tradition of the Chinese nation , revolutionary tradition , and national defense , and enhance ideological and moral education .  
With the beginning of the new century , our country 's drive for socialist modernization has entered a new stage of development .  The world scientific and technological revolution is developing rapidly , the tendency toward economic globalization is getting stronger , the pace of industrial restructuring is quickening , and international competition is becoming increasingly keen ; all these pose new challenges to us .  
In carrying out ideological and political education in the military , it is necessary to focus on the reality of the primate phase of socialism and the objective existence of the socialist market economy , to be responsive to society 's diversified development , to grasp the mainstream and essence , and to work hard to utilize , incorporate , exploit , and develop positive factors .  
The statement read : " This newspaper will learn a profound lesson from this incident and take effective measures to adopt correct guiding principles for newspaper management , thoroughly implement the principle of ' newspaper management based on political considerations , ' and improve newspaper management by adhering to the policy of fostering unity and stability , serving as an inspirational force , and stressing positive propaganda and by correctly shaping public opinion .  We will do our best to give wide publicity to reform , opening up , and socialist modernization . "  
On this basis , our party seized the opportune moment to creatively realize the socialist transformation of individual farming , handicraft industry , as well as capitalist industrial and commercial industries , destroyed the exploiting system and the exploiting class , and established the socialist system .  
The third generation of central leadership collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has shown great foresight , managed the overall situation , held high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , continued to deepen reform and expanded opening up , vigorously advanced the building of the socialist market economy system , surmounted difficulties , overcome all kinds of risks from political and economic fields as well as from nature , and succeeded in realizing a sustained , rapid and sound economic development , and safeguarding social and political stability .  
Examining ourselves , after over 50 years of development , especially since the 20 years of reform and opening up , we have the important ideological and political basis for basically realizing modernization , material and technical bases , as well as mass basis by the middle of this century , and the vigorous and rapidly developing socialist cause with Chinese characteristics .  
Particular efforts should be devoted to meticulously studying Chairman Jiang 's expositions on how we should understand the historical progress of development of socialist society , how we should understand historical progress of the development of capitalist society , how we should understand the influence on people 's thinking exerted by our practice of socialist reform and how we should understand the impact of the current international environment and international political struggles .  These expositions should be regarded as the guiding principle and fundamental basis for observing and understanding the international and domestic situation .  
and it played an important role in consolidating people 's democratic dictatorship , and in pushing forward the historical process of socialist revolution and construction in China .  With the arrival of the new historical period , the China Democratic League has showed its firm support for the line , principles , and policies that the CPC has adopted ever since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee ; conscientiously performed its role as a party participating in government and political affairs ;  
Full development of the socialist economy will lay a solid foundation for resolving the contradiction between the backward social productivity and the growing material and cultural needs .  
The guiding principle for Tibet 's work in the new period has further aroused our consciousness in opposing separatism and safeguarding stability .  In exposing and criticizing Dalai in recent years , we have been waging a tit-for-tat struggle against him in the spiritual sphere , which is the main battleground , to fight confusion and correct foolishness .  We have done a great deal of highly effective work in strengthening the buildup of socialist spiritual civilization .  
Use Marxist materialist conception of history to gradually weaken idealist theism , replace feudalism and superstition and ignorance and backwardness with modern knowledge in science and technology , divert the attention of religion believers toward developing the economy and improving living standard materially and culturally , and guide religion into categories compatible with the socialist society for the temples , monks and nuns to play a positive and useful role in social life .  
In the period of socialist revolution and construction , to strive for national prosperity and strengthening , our party continued to consolidate and expand the people 's democratic united front in the efforts for restoring the economy , developing production , carrying out socialist transformation , establishing the socialist system , and starting the comprehensive explorations of socialist construction .  
The united front should firmly adoptthe guiding principle of serving economic construction , should pool the wisdom and strength of all social strata , all political parties , all ethnic groups , all social organizations , and the people in all social circles for advancing our country 's socialist modernization .  
We must rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and , in line with the requirement of the three represents , carry forward the glorious revolutionary traditions , closely follow the advancing pace of the times , emancipate our minds , seek truth from facts , carry out hard struggle , forge ahead , and strive to turn our country into a rich , powerful , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist country .  
In particular , in the 20 years since reform and opening up , the level of productive forces in China has ascended one stage after another , the socialist market economic system was initially established , the omnidirectional format for opening up to the outside world was basically formed , the economy and social areas developed , and China had already realized the first two strategic objectives in modernization construction .  China had also begun to enter full establishment of a well-off society , accelerating and pushing forward socialist modernization construction onto a new level .  
Keeping in mind the historical lesson learned from being overanxious to move toward communism , as well as the historical setback in the last decade of the previous century in the form of the disintegration of the Soviet Union , which was the first socialist country , CPC members are prepared to struggle in a down-to-earth manner for at least another 50 years for socialism in the initial stage and to struggle for 100 years or several hundred years for a relatively advanced or a more advanced stage of socialism .  
Scientific and technical workers are part of China 's working class , they carry out courageous exploration and make constant progress , so they are the main inheritors and disseminators of scientific and cultural knowledge of humankind and play an irreplaceable role in the building of socialist material and spiritual civilization . 
I hope the masses of science and technology workers will stay on the cutting edge of the new era , closely integrating personal ambitions with the nation 's future and fate ; undertake the historical responsibility of promoting science and technology advancements and innovations ; and continuously contribute to developing China into a prosperous , democratic , and civilized modern socialist country .  
In front of the both arduous task and bright future for accomplishing socialist modernization , science and technology workers in China must unite closely and continue creating and exploring to make renewed and magnificent contributions to the grand national rejuvenation .  
To fulfill the tasks in the transitional period and realize the change into socialism , the key lay in the proper accomplishment of the socialist transformation .  That was an ownership revolution of guiding individual and private economies into socialism .  
Through a special form of redemption , that is , the paying of fixed interest to original owners of the private businesses , the most complicated task in our country 's socialist transformation was smoothly and stably accomplished .  
Was n't that an unnecessary move ?  Admittedly , some shortcomings existed in the course of socialist transformation .  They were mainly " hasty requirements , imprudent work , too fast changes , too simple and uniform forms , and some problems left down over a long time . "  
Thus , we should be concentrated in developing productivity with the driving force of the new relations of production , and step up our socialist construction to make our country rich and powerful and enable our people to lead a better-off life .  This would be favorable to the development of the country and in keeping with the fundamental interests and ardent hopes of the general public .  
Large numbers of publishing workers have persisted in serving the people , socialism , and the overall situation in the work of the party and state ; they have made remarkable achievements in publicizing Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , in disseminating and accumulating scientific and cultural knowledge , in satisfying the spiritual and cultural needs of the people , and in promoting the building of the material and spiritual civilizations ; and they have played an important role in reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization .  
The vast working masses should be guided to more clearly understand their own historical responsibility .  Such a sense of mission should be turned into a strong driving force to play a role as the main force to continuously enhance their own quality and make contributions to the building of a rich and powerful socialist modern country with a high degree of democracy and civilization as Comrade Jiang Zemin hoped .  
Under the leadership of the CPC , the vast mass of scientific and technological workers are united and mobilized to work hard for the development of science and technology in our country and for the realization of the grand objective of socialist modernization in our country .  This is the historical mission of the China Association of Science and Technology .  
They said that the achievements which we have attained are not only reflected on the various indexes of the national economy and social development , the profound changes taken place in the economic structure , the sustained improvement of the overall national strength , and the constant elevation of the international standing of our country but also embodied in the fact that under the leadership of the Party the masses of people are of one mind in carrying out the socialist modernization drive .  
In order to score even greater victories , we must uphold the basic line of the Party , further unify the thinking of the comrades of the whole Party on the major policy decision made by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , consciously maintain a high degree of ideological and political consistency with the Party Central Committee , and coagulate the strength of the people of all nationalities of the whole country around the magnificent objective of realizing the socialist modernization construction .  
Since the Third Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party , our Party has made our strategy and countermeasures against this peaceful evolution clear , adhering to the Party 's basic line for the current stage of development , which is composed of " one center and two basic points , " adhering to the guiding strategy that " development is the absolute principle , " practicing a socialist market economy and striving to develop ourselves .  
The overall standard of living has already reached a well-off level and China now has a considerable group of wealthy people .  The objective for the second strategic step of socialist modernization has been realized in a general fashion .  
The important thinking of the " three represents " is beneficial for China in the 21st century , in strengthening the ideological education of cadres , consistently moving the advanced nature of Party members forward , and in enabling reform , opening up and modernization construction , particularly in operating a market economic mechanism so that we can develop healthily along the socialist road .  
As long as our Party regards Marxism , Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guiding principle , uses the important thinking of the " three represents " to strengthen its ideological armament and effectively carry out correct lines , strategies and policies issued by the Party since the Third Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party , our Party will forever stand in an invincible position and our socialist system will be stable and safe in the long run .  
The fine tradition of the Chinese nation and our revolutionary tradition have been carried forward under the new historical conditions .  Patriotism , collectivism , socialist concepts and socialist moral practice have become the essential aspect of our people 's mental world .  This conforms to the moral standardization of the development of our socialist economy and the common pursuit of all members of our society .  
It also adopted the guiding principle and policy of " letting literature and art service socialism and the people " and " letting a-hundred flowers blossom and a-hundred schools of thought contend . "  Furthermore , it emphasized the necessity of developing a socialist culture with Chinese characteristics .  All this has shown that the CPC has always represented the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , and that it has been making unremitting efforts to bring about and develop our prosperous and outstanding national culture .  
We should persist in sticking to the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , vigorously bring about our prosperous socialist culture and make efforts to provide our reform , opening up and modernization with a powerful spiritual motive power and ideological guarantee .  
He pointed out that after the founding of new China , the CPC led the people of the whole country to destroy the imperialist privileges in China and seize bureaucrat-capital and resumed for the people the decision-making rights to independently engage in foreign trade and economic cooperation .  On the basis that liberated areas had already developed foreign trade , a series of major measures were taken to comprehensively set up a socialist system governing foreign trade and economic cooperation .  
The 14th Party Congress called for developing the socialist market economy .  The foreign trade system has been reformed in an in-depth manner according to the orientation set forth at the 14th Party Congress - - " unified policies , relaxed management , equal competition , self-responsibility for profits or losses , integration of industry with trade , and implementation of a commission-based system . "  
second , it is even more difficult to do this because we are confronted with the new situation characterized by the new scientific and technological revolution in the 21st century and the fierce competition worldwide , with a serious challenge from our double mission to achieve China 's modernization , and with the magnificent task of building a socialist material civilization and a socialist spiritual civilization .  
Jia Qinglin said : Over 80 years , especially over more than 50 years since the founding of new China , under the leadership of the CPC , Beijing , as a time-honored ancient capital city well-known to the world , underwent earthshaking changes .  It changed from a capital of a declining feudal empire into a great capital of the socialist motherland , and is now marching toward a modern international metropolis .  
Heroic models and advanced typical examples are valuable wealth of our party and the country .  Their lofty thinking is playing an increasingly greater role to influence and lead the people .  Their actions are of great significance to fostering healthy tendencies in the society , developing the spirit of our times and promoting reform , opening up and the socialist modernization drive .  
Particularly since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party , our Party has reviewed positive and negative experiences in socialist construction , successfully created a way of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics and enabled scientific socialism to be energetic , vigorous and creative in this vast land .  
At this moment commemorating the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China , we should meticulously study these important expositions , in light of the Party 's glorious history , solve problems by uniting reality with history and combining perspectives with reasoning , genuinely base socialist conviction on a solid ideological and theoretical foundation and transform praises of socialism to a self-mobilized advancement of the great cause of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the 21st century .  
National unity has been further strengthened , socialist national relations marked by equality , unity and mutual aid have been consolidated and developed , and the bonding forces of the people of every nationality in the region toward the motherland have been further enhanced .  
third , persist in comprehensively carrying out the party 's national and religious policies , making constant efforts to consolidate and develop socialist national relations marked by equality , unity , and mutual aid among the masses of every nationality in Tibet , and persist in developing a strong and patriotic united front ;  
At this transcentury moment , our Party has correctly analyzed the situations at home and abroad , comprehensively summed up the successful experiences of the reform and opening up the outside world over 20 years , formulated the economic , political , and cultural programs of the Party in the primary stage of socialism , striven to realize the combination of public ownership with market economy , developed the socialist market economy , let the social productive forces constantly be liberated and developed , and meanwhile upheld the political direction of socialism .  
Over the past 80 years , the CPC has organized and led arduous revolutionary struggles against aggressors from the outside and reactionaries at home , won a victory in the people 's revolution , founded socialist new China on the vast land of China , and achieved tremendous progress and changes on the road of invigorating China and realizing national reunification .  
Over the past 80 years , under the leadership of the glorious CPC , the Chinese people have struggled hard and won great victories in revolution for national liberation , founded the People 's Republic of China , scored tremendous achievements in socialist construction , especially in the cause of reform , opening up and the socialist modernization drive , constantly improved people 's living condition , and continuously raised international its position .  
We have established a socialist system and realized the most extensive and most profound social transformation in Chinese history .  We have creatively materialized the transformation from new democracy to socialism and established the basic system of socialism in an all-round way , enabling this big country in the Orient whose population accounts for a quarter of the world total to enter socialist society .  
Basing ourselves on the long period of socialist construction , we have practiced new policies of reform and opening to the outside world and formulated the basic theory , line and program of our party in the initial stage of socialism after summing up both the internal and external historical experience and through hard exploration .  
To make our party represent the direction of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must make its theory , line , programs , principles , policies , and all its work reflect the requirements of the national , scientific , and popular socialist culture that develops toward modernization , the world , and the future , and enable them to upgrade the ideological and ethical quality and scientific and cultural quality of the whole nation and to provide spiritual impetus and intellectual support for China 's economic development and social progress .  
focus our attention on the front line of world scientific and cultural development ; develop a healthy , progressive , rich , and colorful socialist culture with Chinese style and characteristics to meet the increasing demands of the people ; and direct the people to get mentally equipped and upgraded with correct ideas .  
The fundamental task for developing the socialist culture lies in cultivating citizens from generation to generation who have lofty ideals , moral integrity , a better education and a good sense of discipline .  We should persevere in arming the people with scientific theories , guiding the people with correct public opinions , molding the people with noble minds , and inspiring the people with superior works .  
Strengthening socialist ideological and ethical building constitutes the essential content of and a key link in developing China 's advanced culture .  
In order to forever represent the orientation of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must make the party 's theory , line , program , principles , policies and all its work reflect the requirements of the national , scientific and popular socialist culture that develops toward modernization , the world and the future ; enable them to upgrade the ideological and ethical qualities and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation and to provide the motive power and support culturally and intellectually .  
Under no circumstances should comrades of the whole party stand still and refuse to move forward , nor should they fear hardship and difficulties .  We must closely unite with people of all ethnic groups in China and strive to build the great motherland into a strong , prosperous , democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country so as to make new and even greater contributions to humanity .  
Now , we have adopted the basic economic system under which public ownership plays a dominant role in the national economy while other forms of ownership develop side by side .  We are shaping a socialist market economy and introducing strategic adjustments to the economic structure .  Consequently some workers have changed their jobs .  
All comrades of the party must unswervingly implement the party 's basic line for the initial stage of socialism , consistently concentrate on economic development , stick to the Four Cardinal Principles [ keeping to the socialist road and upholding the people 's democratic dictatorship , leadership by the Communist Party , and Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought ] , press ahead with reform and opening up , strive for the realization of the basic program of the party for the present stage and constantly advance the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics into the future .  
Under no circumstances should comrades of the party stand still and refuse to move forward , nor should they fear hardship and difficulties .  All comrades must closely unite with the people of all ethnic groups in China and strive to build our great motherland into a strong , prosperous , democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country and make new and even greater contributions to mankind .  
Under the leadership of the party 's leading collective of the second generation with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at the core , our party emancipated its mind and sought truth from facts ; shifted the work focus of both the party and the state towards the building of modernizations that centered around the country 's economic construction ; gradually gave form to a basic line that guided the country 's work at the initial stage of socialism upon its in-depth summarization of both positive and negative experiences gained from socialist construction ;  
At the end of the 20th century , which witnessed drastic changes in the world setup , the People 's Republic was at a crucial moment in its reform , opening up , and the development of a socialist market economy .  Under the leadership of the party 's leading collective of the third generation with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , our party has held high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory ; adhered to its basic theory , basic line , and basic program ;  
Over the 80 years under the correct leadership of the three generations of leading collectives headed by Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin , the CPC has grown from small to large and from weak to strong .  It led the Chinese people to advance wave upon wave , wage tenacious struggles , found the new China , establish the socialist system , explore ways to building socialism with Chinese characteristics , and write a magnificent chapter in the historical development of the Chinese nation .  
toppled the three big mountains [ imperialism , feudalism , and bureaucrat-capitalism ] , built new China , and ended the tragic fate where our country was like a sheet of loose sand [ in a state of disunity ] , was rent by disunity , and allowed itself to be trampled upon .  We underwent socialist construction , broke blockades , consolidated our political power , achieved self-reliance , fought hard , and fought against heaven and earth in the Daqing oilfield .  
Third , Deng Xiaoping Theory adheres to the broad vision of Marxism in observing the world , and makes correct analysis and reaches new and scientific conclusions on the features of the current times and the overall international situation , on the successes and failures of other socialist countries in the world , on the gains and losses of other developing countries in seeking development , on the development postures and contradictions in developed countries , and on the profound impact of the scientific and technological progress on the economic and social life .  
Cao Gangchuan stressed that implementing the spirit of General Secretary Jiang 's important speech requires fully undertaking the armament mission and duty , while linking this closely with steadfast implementation of policies of the Party 's route , while linking this closely with implementation of the Party 's basic guiding principles in the current phase , while linking this closely with the fundamental achievement of the magnificent objective of socialist modernization by the middle of this century , and making the demands of the " three represents " a part of our armed combat preparations .  
In his speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin mentioned that it is necessary to uphold and perfect the system of people 's congress , the multiparty cooperation system under the leadership of the communist party , and the system of political consultation and regional national autonomy , actively , safely , and steadily push forward the reform of political structure , further expand the democracy of socialism , govern the country according to law , and build a socialist country ruled by law .  
When facing the complicated international situation marked by the confrontation between the Eastern and the Western camps , the leaders of new China represented by Mao Zedong , proceeding from the fundamental interests of our country , adopted the foreign policy of " totally leaning to " the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union .  
It is like water pouring off a steep roof , has tremendous momentum , has full and abundant connotation and profound thinking , and is a creative utilization and development of Marxism , Mao Zedong thought , and Deng Xiaoping theory .  It symbolizes the fact that our party has reached new heights , new levels , and new boundaries in its understanding of the rules of governance and construction ; in its understanding of the rules for socialist construction ;  
To practice the requirement of representing the orientation of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must enhance the building of socialist spiritual civilization , persistently educate the people with Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , effectively implement the strategy of relying on science and education for national regeneration , promote the enhancement of the ideological and moral integrity and scientific and cultural attainments of the whole nation .  
It is necessary to inherit and carry forward all good cultures , including the fine cultural tradition of the Chinese nation , the revolutionary cultural tradition formed by the party and the people over a long time , and all advanced civilization achievements created by human society , and strive to develop our national and scientific socialist culture oriented to modernization , to the world , and to the future .  
We must base ourselves on the new practice of social life today and on the new development of the times , strengthen theoretical study , conscientiously sum up the experience , tackle problems in real earnest , make explorations in the midst of practice , make innovations in the midst of explorations , and move forward in the midst of innovations .  While doing a better job in the building of material civilization , we must keep pushing ahead with the building of socialist spiritual civilization .  
We must study their approach of building a Party to serve the people , being upright and honest , and vigorously promoting socialist morality , consciously guarding against unhealthy tendencies , resolutely struggling with all negative and corrupt phenomena , and always maintaining the true revolutionary character of CPC personnel .  
General Secretary of the Communist Party of Argentina Patricio Echegaray , and the Party 's Secretary for International Relations Athos Fava , said in a congratulatory telegram to Jiang Zemin , " The Chinese Communist Party , established 80 years ago by a small number of revolutionaries in the historically famous city of Shanghai , proposed the objective of seizing political power and establishing socialist society .  It seized power within the relatively short span of 28 years .  
base ourselves on the realities in China , with attention focused on the front line of world scientific and cultural development ; and unceasingly develop a healthy , progressive , rich , and colorful socialist culture with Chinese style and characteristics .  That is also the fundamental expression and requirement for our party to remain in the forefront of the times and maintain its advanced nature .  
To study the " speech , " we should hold high the advance banner of China 's advanced culture , strive to create and carry forward a new culture that embodies the requirements of revolution , construction , and reform , satisfy the growing needs of the masses of the people for spiritual culture , and push forward the development and progress of socialist society in a comprehensive way .  
In the course of leading the whole party and the people of the entire country to continuously advance the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the party Central Committee , with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , has persistently integrated the basic tenets of Marxism with the practice of the modernization drive in the contemporary China and has constantly deepened the understanding of party building of the ruling party and the law governing the socialist modernization drive .  
In his " 1 July " speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin gave a penetrating exposition on the important concept of " three represents " and put forward new ideas and views on a number of major theoretical and practical issues concerning party building and the socialist modernization drive , thereby pointing out the direction for advancing the cause of the party and the country in the coming century .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's exposition on continuously building up the party 's class foundation , expanding the party 's mass foundation , and raising the party 's influence on society in the light of the reality in economic development and social advancement has provided the scientific theoretical basis for consolidating and strengthening the party 's leadership and increasing the party 's creativity , cohesive power , and combat capability under the conditions of the socialist market economy .  
He always persisted in taking basic Marxist theory on the state and law as guidance , carefully took into account the actual situation in our country 's legal construction , and strove to explore and build a sound juridical system of the people , thus making exceptional contributions toward our country 's socialist democratic construction and legal construction and being regarded by all as a key founder of the legal system of the New China .  
publicized knowledge on relevant policies , laws , and regulations ; built up a socialist population culture and childbearing culture ; devoted great efforts to changing the backward childbearing concepts among the masses ; and have successfully enhanced the ideological and moral qualities , as well as the scientific and technological qualities , of the masses .  
After the socialist transformation was complete , and the basic socialist system was established , the advanced nature of our Party was reflected in the endeavors of leading the people of all ethnic groups across the nation in vigorously developing the social productive forces and bringing to fruition national industrialization .  
Second , we must further reinforce socialist ideological and cultural progress and promote the steady improvement of the ideological , moral , scientific and cultural qualities of our people in order to turn Guangzhou into a city that is truly " suitable for starting one 's business and suitable to live in . "  
Making full use of the powerful position of junior military academies and strengthening ideological and political education among the children and youth so that they will foster from childhood the fine quality of loving the party , the motherland , the people , and the army and give them training in acquiring a patriotic spirit of a high degree , a strong sense of national defense , a strong will , and strong physique is a major issue that has a bearing on the future of China 's socialist modernization .  
In his speech at the forum , Wu Bangguo said : We should conscientiously study the new situations and new problems arising from the conditions of the socialist market economy , effectively strengthen the supervision and control of the market , particularly crack down on fake and shoddy products bearing on the vital interests of the people and endangering their lives and health , and do a good job in solving problems , such as being slack in crackdown , replacing imprisonment for criminal offenses with lighter punishment , and weak links .  
To improve the party 's leadership and party building , we must first proceed from these two major transformations to earnestly study theoretical and practical issues facing party building under the new historical conditions and study the laws governing the rule of the country by the Communist Party , socialist construction , and the development of human society that underlie these issues so as to better advance party building .  
The historical mission for the current period put forth by our Party is , through reform and opening-up , to further liberate and develop the productive forces , promote national economic , political and cultural development in an all-around way , continuously improve people 's material and cultural standards of living , strive to build China into a prosperous , strong , democratic , civilized , modernized socialist country , and strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people .  
Our objective is : By the middle of this century , we will basically achieve modernization , build a prosperous , strong , democratic , civilized , and socialist modern country , and realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .  
The party Central Committee comprehensively analyzed the exceptional difficulties and favorable conditions for Tibet 's economic and social development in the socialist market economic situation ; defined feasible objectives for development ; and formulated preferential policy and supportive measures in eight aspects - - tax revenues , finance , investment capitalization , price subsidies , foreign trade , social security , reform of enterprises , and the sectors of agriculture and animal husbandry .  
With the party Central Committee 's firm leadership , and with the selfless support of all fraternal nationalities of the big family in the motherland , a united , prosperous , and civilized socialist new Tibet will advance with giant strides on its journey in the new century .  
Therefore , to satisfactorily carry out the educational campaign on ideals and convictions , we must get rid of outdated educational strategies such as using detailed imaginative descriptions of the far future and using unrealistic fantasies and slogans to educate people .  We must consistently focus on the basic national situation in the initial period of socialist development and educate Party members firmly in accordance with their ideological realities .  
This is evidenced by , among other things , its increasingly rapid economic growth , significant improvement of its people 's living standards , remarkable achievements in its building of advanced socialist culture and ethics , and vigorous development of all its social undertakings .  
Diligent and wise , Tibet 's people of all nationalities have , in the course of long historical development , made outstanding contributions in creating a splendid culture of the Chinese nation and founding our unified , multinational country .  In the past half century in particular , they have written a magnificent chapter of Tibet 's development and progress , adding a new splendor to the community of the socialist motherland .  
We definitely will follow the guidance of the spirit of Comrade Jiang Zemin 's speech at the grand gathering marking the CPC 's 80th founding anniversary and the spirit of the fourth forum held by the Central Authorities on the work in Tibet , fully mobilize and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativeness of all circles to constantly push forward the great cause of building a socialist new Tibet that is united , prosperous and civilized .  
As result of the democratic reform and socialist transformation as well as the ongoing reforms and opening up , Tibet has liberated and developed its social productivity in an unprecedented scale .  Last year , the region 's gross domestic product was more than 50 times that of the period before the democratic reform in 1959 .  
The PLA , armed police , and law enforcement units stationed in Tibet are strong pillars and loyal guards who safeguard the motherland 's frontier areas and Tibet 's stability .  They are important forces for building the socialist material and spiritual civilizations in Tibet . They must continue to carry forward their fine traditions and work styles , ensure their own construction , strengthen their unity with the local governments , civilian authorities , and the people , and make new contributions to Tibet 's stability and development .  
In the long historical development , the hardworking and intelligent people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have made remarkable contributions to creating the shinning cultures of the Chinese nation and to building our unified multinational country .  The brilliant chapter of Tibet 's development and progress in the past 50 years that you have written has added new glory to the big family of our socialist motherland .  
Under the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , let us hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , follow the guidance of the important thinking of the " three represents , " work with one heart and one mind , press forward continuously , and work hard to build a united , affluent , and civilized socialist new Tibet and achieve the great revitalization of the Chinese nation !  
Enhancing socialist ideological and ethics building is a major content of developing an advanced culture , and one of the important things is to do well in ideological and ethics building among leading cadres , particularly among senior level cadres .  
Not only behavior criteria and ethical standards for leading cadres need to be adapted to socialist market economic rules and in line with the requirements of the times and with innovative spirit , they must also adhere to socialist value concept , avoid the negative impact of the market economy , and resist against such decadent thinking as mammonism , hedonism , and extreme individualism .  
The celebrations have fully reflected the tremendous progress achieved by Tibet over the past 50 years , given wide publicity to the principles and policies of the central authorities toward Tibet , considerably aroused the enthusiasm of the Tibetan people of all ethnic groups in building up a new socialist Tibet , and will surely bring about a vigorous development to all undertakings in Tibet in the new century .  
put an end to the rampant manufacturing and sales of counterfeit currencies in a number of areas ; successfully checked the sudden growth in the amount of counterfeit currencies ; and has played an important part in maintaining a stable economic , financial , and social order , and in promoting the healthy growth of the socialist market economy .  
In March this year , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council decided to rename the State Administration for Industry and Commerce as State General Administration for Industry and Commerce , upgrading it from the vice ministerial level to the ministerial level .  The purpose was to further strengthen its authority and status as a market regulation and law enforcement department , so that the government 's institutional setup could better meet the requirements of the socialist market economic system .  
They should adapt to the new situation in the context of developing a socialist market economy and free themselves , once and for all , from the ideas , concepts , and approaches of work formed under the system of planned economy .  They should take a step further and change their function from predominantly regulating country markets to regulating the unified national market and from managing the market by mainly relying on administrative means to managing the market by law .  
We must willingly combine subjective efforts and objective world , theory and practice , and inheritance and development of legacies , deepen our understanding of the laws governing the running of the government by the Communist Party , socialist construction , and human society so that we think and act more in line with the national condition at the initial stage of socialism and the requirements of the development of the times and think and act more in line with the actual conditions in Jiangsu Province and the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people .  
Practice has fully proved that the party 's third-generation central leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core is the loyal and reliable successor to China 's socialist cause initiated by Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping and an energetic and promising pioneer .  
The provision for a department to be in charge of a Sino-foreign joint venture was a result of the planned economic system of those days .  After the economic structural reform , government administration have been separated from enterprise management , and administrative organs separated from enterprises .  Under the socialist market economic conditions , in particular , enterprises enjoyed full authority to make their own managerial decisions , and the government mainly carried out macro-direction and is not supposed to intervene in enterprises ' specific production and operational activities .  
Reform is being carried out under the complicated environment at home and abroad .  It is faced with the interference and sabotage of the hostile forces .  This demands that we further enhance our political awareness , adopt a firm and clear-cut stand in our major political struggles , and resolutely safeguard the Party 's leadership and the socialist system .  
China is now in a period of economic structural transformation , during which the rules governing the planned economy are being smashed while the rules governing the socialist market economy remain imperfect .  Under such circumstances , financial loopholes , violations of the financial law and discipline , and government corruption are inevitable .  
Had we been conservative , restrained by the routine , and not brave enough to do anything , we would still be suffering from the restraints of " two any-and-alls " and caught in endless discussions on whether this or that is " socialist " or " capitalist . "  We would be unable to blaze this new trail of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Tibet learned firsthand that the Chinese Communist Party is the faithful representative of the interests of all the peoples of Tibet . The socialist road is the road which Tibet must take for economic development , national progress , long-lasting social order , and the well-being of the people .  Resolutely protecting the unity of the motherland , opposing ethnic division , and strengthening ethnic unity is a basic premise by which the cause of revolution and construction in Tibet will be a success .  
At present , whether or not the public security organs at various levels can protect advanced social productive forces according to law , protect and develop the advanced socialist culture , or protect , develop , and realize the fundamental interests of the broadest public depends crucially on whether or not we can carry through to the end the campaign of rectifying and improving public order , i.e . , " stern crackdown , " spearheaded by " crackdown on underworld forces and eradication of vicious forces . "  
In carrying out political structure reforms , we want to further carry forward socialist democracy and legal system , perfect the specific systems of socialist democracy , ensure that the people can fully exercise their rights of democratic election , democratic decisionmaking , democratic management , and democratic supervision , boost the vitality of the party and state , fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the grass roots and the masses , promote the effort to make decisionmaking a scientific and democratic affair , and bring into further play the superiority and characteristics of the socialist system .  
In carrying out political structure reforms , we want to further carry forward socialist democracy and legal system , perfect the specific systems of socialist democracy , ensure that the people can fully exercise their rights of democratic election , democratic decisionmaking , democratic management , and democratic supervision , boost the vitality of the party and state , fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the grass roots and the masses , promote the effort to make decisionmaking a scientific and democratic affair , and bring into further play the superiority and characteristics of the socialist system .  
After 20 years of economic reform and development , a mechanism of steady growth in fiscal revenue compatible with socialist market economy has been basically established .  It has demonstrated tremendous vitality .  
Meanwhile , we must acutely seize the fundamental impetus that the rapid growth of science and technology has given to the world 's productive forces and to the economic and social development of mankind , and must seize the objective trend that new and major leaps will surely emerge during the future development of science and technology ; and we must always pay great attention to closely integrating the need to give play to the advantages of China 's socialist system with the need to master , apply , and develop advanced science and technology .  
Rectifying and standardizing the cultural market order is the inherent demand for putting the important idea of " three represents " into practice and for vigorously developing China 's advanced culture .  Rectifying and standardizing the cultural market order is necessary in order to build and perfect the socialist market economy system and to meet the challenges brought about by China 's accession to the World Trade Organization . Rectifying and standardizing the cultural market order is also necessary in order to purify the social environment and to guarantee that the masses of young people grow up healthily .  
Thanks to the establishment and improvement in the socialist market economy , the strategic readjustment of the economic structure , and the diversification of the forms of public ownership and the rapid development of other non-public sectors since the implementation of the revised Trade Union Law , profound changes have been effected in economic and labor exchanges .  
At the present stage , the advanced nature of communist party members should naturally find expression in their conscientious study of Deng Xiaoping Theory and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents , " and find expression in their conscious efforts to plunge themselves into socialist economic , political , and cultural buildings with Chinese characteristics .  
However , with the continuous development of the socialist market economy in our country , the task of ensuring the clear definition of property rights , smooth transactions in property rights , and the safety of such transactions has become increasingly important , and the provisions of the general rules of civil law on real right now do not quite meet the requirements of the developing socialist market economy .  So it is urgently needed to enact a complete law on real right .  
We must perceive the major political , economic , cultural , and science and technology changes that have taken place in the world since the publication of the " Communist Manifesto " 150 years ago ; we must perceive the major changes that have occurred in China 's socialist construction ; and we must perceive the major changes that have taken place in the working and living conditions and social environment of the party members , cadres , and masses .  
Zeng Peiyan says : Looking ahead , China will , by the middle of the next century , have attained its third-step strategic objective and become an affluent , powerful , democratic , and civil socialist modern country and the Chinese nation will have achieved its great revitalization !  
It is necessary to pay close attention to the realization of strategic adjustment of the economic structure in our country through technological progress and innovations , and to the implementation of the strategy of " making China known to the outside world , " as well as to the establishment and improvement of a complete set of systems and mechanisms needed for developing the socialist market economy .  
With General Secretary Jiang 's caring and support , Shenzhen will work hard to catch up with advanced currents of scientific and technological development of the world by vigorously relying on scientific and technological innovation and system innovation ; Shenzhen will , according to the spirit of the instruction of " creating new strong points and moving to a higher level , " seek to be the first to achieve socialist modernization , so as to make greater contributions to the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
In addition , the State Council has drawn up more than 800 sets of administrative laws , and regulations and local people 's congresses and their standing committees have drawn up more than 7,000 local laws and regulations .  A preliminary framework of the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics has thus been formed .  
It is of major practical significance and far-reaching historical significance .  Through two decades of reforms and opening up , China 's comprehensive national strength has notably increased and a socialist market economic system has been preliminarily established .  Thus , conditions are ripe for accelerating the development of China 's western regions .  
The basic meaning of " one country , two systems " is that within the PRC , the main body of the state persists in practicing the socialist system , while post - reversion Hong Kong and Macao , and Taiwan - - after this problem has been finally resolved - - are established as SARs and continue to maintain their existing capitalist system .  This is a basic long-term national policy .  
But we also have to realize that over the past 20 years , the world has witnessed great changes in economic and scientific domains and China also has undergone great changes in economic and social aspects .  China has formed a mechanism for socialist market economy .  Our current efforts to develop the country 's vast western region means a great development project under the condition of new science and technology .  
Therefore , it is imperative to enact a legislative law in accordance with the Constitution to institute unified regulations on the enactment of laws , ordinances and rules and regulations so that they will be more standardized and systematic in order to safeguard uniformity of the state 's legal system and establish and improve a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics .  This will be of great significance in advancing the rule of country in accordance with law and build a socialist country governed by law .  
As the coming decade is the critical period for China in marching toward the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive , the establishment of a relatively perfect socialist market economic structure and the maintenance of the sustained , rapid , and healthy growth of the national economy are two major issues that must be properly solved .  
The nation provides effective assurance , on a system , legal , and material level , for the enjoyment and realization of human rights , initially forming a socialist human rights safeguard system with special Chinese characteristics , and thus enabling Chinese human rights to truly possess a widespread , equal , and authentic nature .

As the coming decade is the critical period for China in marching toward the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive , the establishment of a relatively perfect socialist market economic structure and the maintenance of the sustained , rapid , and healthy growth of the national economy are two major issues that must be properly solved .  
The nation provides effective assurance , on a system , legal , and material level , for the enjoyment and realization of human rights , initially forming a socialist human rights safeguard system with special Chinese characteristics , and thus enabling Chinese human rights to truly possess a widespread , equal , and authentic nature .  
We must , in the patriotic spirit of Comrades Li Fuchun and Cai Chang , encourage the entire party and the people of the whole country to support from beginning to end taking economic construction as the center , industriously establishing China as a powerful , democratic , and civilized modernized socialist country , realizing the grand reemergence of the People 's Republic in the 21st Century .  
Third , in the face of the mutual impacts of the various different ideologies and cultures in the world , it is not enough for us to depend only on the method of controlling the information flow ; and we must also improve the quality of socialist cultural products and give shape to a common ideal and a spiritual pillar of the Chinese nation in the whole society .  
Long Yongtu , China 's chief representative at the talks regarding China 's accession to the WTO ( World Trade Organization ) , stated today that , during the process of participating in the future globalization of the world 's economy , China will continue to be resolute and unswerving in constructing a socialist market economy , insisting on opening up to the outside and conducting its affairs strictly in keeping with international norms and practices .  
The CPC as the ruling party and our country as a socialist state under the leadership of the Communist Party must never allow the continued existence and development of such barbarous , decadent , backward , and ugly social evils .  
We have mentioned earlier in this article that the Taiwan authorities , who are holding high the " democracy and human rights " banner , have always vilified the motherland and the Chinese Communists to seek benefits for themselves .  As a result of extensive publicity and slander over a long period , a simple psychological pattern has been created in the Taiwan people that the mainland 's socialist system and the Chinese Communists ' leadership is no good and not free and democratic , whereas Taiwan 's capitalist system is good , free , and democratic .  
With regard to the work contents , priority should be given to grasping the ideological and moral education and the training to foster their ability in practice and , through launching healthy , useful , lively , and specific activities , strive to let the patriotic , collective , and socialist ideas be deeply rooted in their young hearts so as to gradually form fine morality and lofty sentiments in their daily conduct , and to constantly enhance their ability in mental and physical work and skills in adapting themselves to society .  
Deng Xiaoping advanced the theory on the implementation of the open policy in socialist states and took the open policy as a basic national policy on China 's socialist construction .  To gain advantages comparable with that of capitalism , Deng noted , socialism should boldly absorb and use all civilized achievements created by human society , including developed capitalist states ' advanced operational and managerial approaches that reflect the law of modern socialized production .  
Fourth , colleges , universities , scientific and technological research institutes , and hi-tech enterprises in the vicinity of the S &amp; T park should also make contributions to local development , converting scientific and technological achievements , fostering professional personnel , promoting education , paying taxes according to law , building a civilized community , and promoting socialist spiritual civilization .  
Li Lanqing said at the end : To popularize scientific knowledge across the whole society , to establish scientific thinking , to promote scientific spirit , and to publicize scientific methods suit the need for implementing the strategy of developing China through science and education , for upgrading the masses ' qualities , and for facilitating a healthy development in our socialist material and spiritual civilization construction .  The tasks also suit the need for eliminating the poison inflicted by ignorance , superstition , various pseudosciences , and antisciences ; for safeguarding social stability ;  
We have accumulated an important experience in these past years .  That is , the more complex the situation is , the more arduous the tasks , and the more acute the struggle is , the more we should firmly adhere to Deng Xiaoping Theory and the party 's basic line , basic principle , and basic program and unswervingly concentrate our efforts in effecting an upswing in our economic construction , and make unremitting efforts to fulfill the party 's general goal and task during the socialist primary stage .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that to build our party well , we must , in the first place , help our party 's leading cadres at all levels improve their ideological and political quality .  Particularly we must strive to help the middle-aged and young leading cadres improve their ideological and political quality so that they will become a new generation of statesmen who remain loyal to Marxism and unswervingly adhere to the socialist road with Chinese characteristics , and are capable of running the party and the country .  
To this end we need to make unremitting exploration and constantly sum up experience .  As far as legislation is concerned , we will continue to uphold the principle of proceeding from China 's national conditions , safeguard consistency in the legal system based on the constitution , persist in the integration of legislation with major decisions concerning reform and development , ensure by the means of system and legislation the implementation of the state 's major political line , expedite socialist modernization , thus ensure the country 's prosperity and perpetual political stability .  
Thoroughly and correctly implementing the legislation law , further strengthening government legislative work , improving the quality of government legislative work , and safeguarding the unity of the socialist legal system is an important responsibility of the local people 's governments concerned and the State Council departments , and is also a major task in the building of the government legal system .  
since our party represents the orientation for the progress of China 's advanced culture , it must persistently take Marxism as the guide , inherit and develop all fine cultural traditions of the Chinese nation , study and absorb all the fruits of human civilization , and continually build and create socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , so that material and spiritual civilization will develop in coordinated fashion and promote the all-round progress of society ;  
Luo Gan pointed out : In independently exercising judicial authority according to law , people 's courts should endeavor to ensure judicial fairness and provide expeditious and effective judicial guarantee and legal service for helping develop the advanced productive forces , protecting the advanced culture , and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people .  Judicial fairness is related to the building of a socialist country ruled by the law and to the overall situation of reform , development , and stability .  
Having made achievements of world interest during the five decades since it came into power in leading the people in carrying out socialist revolution and construction as well as the reform and opening to the outside world and in unremittingly struggling to build a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist modern country , our party is worthy of being the choice of history and the people .  
under the guidance of Marxism , to constantly build and develop a national , scientific , and popular socialist culture with Chinese characteristics that is oriented to modernization , the world , and the future so as to bring about coordinated development of the socialist material and spiritual civilizations and promote comprehensive social progress ;  
Viewed as a whole , all of our party 's efforts in leading the revolution , construction , and reform have been for emancipating and developing the productive forces and for advancing the development of China 's socialist democratic politics and culture and thus have complied with the objective law of social development , conformed to the advanced trends of development of the times , safeguarded the overall interests of the Chinese nation , and accorded with the fundamental demands of the masses of the people .  
He stressed that since reform and opening up which started more than 20 years ago , relatively great achievements have been scored by China in various economic and social undertakings .  At present , China 's economic structural reform and political structural reform are being simultaneously carried out and continuously deepened .  Governing the country according to laws and building China into a country with socialist legal system have been written in the constitution as the general plan for the administration of the country .  
He emphasized that in the more than 20 years of reform and opening up , China 's economic and social undertakings have made good progress .  China 's restructuring of the economic system and political reform are being implemented at the same time and are continuously being deepened .  China has made governing the country according to law and constructing a socialist lawful country its general plan of government and has written that into its Constitution .  
He stressed : Over the 20-plus years of reform and opening up , the Chinese economy and various social undertakings have made great strides .  At present , the reforms of China 's economic and political structures are going synchronously and getting deeper and deeper .  We take the rule of law and the building of a socialist legal system as the blueprint for governing our country and have written it into the Constitution .  
Thirdly , the ultimate goal of our efforts to liberate and develop our productive forces and to build a socialist spiritual civilization is to satisfy the people 's growing material demands in their everyday life , that is , to better represent the fundamental interests of the broad masses and serve them wholeheartedly .  
In the final analysis , all struggles carried out by our party were aimed at liberating and developing productive forces ; and all guiding principles and policies adopted by our party are aimed at eventually ensuring continuous development of productive forces , boosting national economic development , raising the overall national strength , building socialist material and spiritual civilizations , satisfying the people 's increasing material and cultural needs , and becoming more representative of the people 's fundamental interests .  
Endeavoring to represent demand of development of advanced productive forces is a solemn mission and sacred responsibility of our party .  Party committees at all levels , every grass-roots party organization , and every party member should work hand in hand to serve as a good " representative " of demand of development of advanced productive forces .  They should consistently maintain the party 's progressiveness and provide a strong political and organizational assurance for our socialist modernization drive .  
In his speech , Jiang Zemin put forward and expounded on how to understand the historical process of the development of socialism and capitalism , the impact of the practice of China 's socialist reform on people 's thinking , the influence of the contemporary international environment and international political struggle , and other major issues that have a direct bearing on the mental state of cadres and the masses .  He urged all party comrades to jointly conduct in-depth study in an effort to acquire scientific knowledge in the ideological and political sphere .  
The criteria for judging all party tasks should be whether they are conducive to liberating and developing the productive forces ; to reinforcing the comprehensive national strength of a socialist state ; and to raising the living standard .  
integrated reform efforts , development speed , and social capacity for acceptance ; and formulated a series of principles and policies on developing the productive forces .  We should seize opportunities and advance in an enterprising spirit so as to secure a new great victory in reform , opening up , and socialist modernization .  
The questions of how we should approach the current international and domestic situations , how we should approach the various problems cropping up in China 's reform and opening up especially in the course of building a socialist market economy , and how we should face the difficulties and challenges facing our economic and social lives all have to do with the political conviction of party-member cadres and all the more with the confidence and morale of the broad masses of the people .  It will not do not to face and not to look at them squarely .  
The successful practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the liveliest and most convincing teaching material , and the various advanced individuals who emerged from among us and their advanced and typical deeds are the liveliest and most current and brilliant teaching materials .  We must carry out education in ideals and conviction with perfect assurance and push ahead socialist civilization building unwaveringly .  
it should persist in " grasping two links at the same time and giving equal importance to both of them , " vigorously step up the building of the socialist spiritual civilization , strive to improve the ideological and moral standards and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation , bring up a new generation of people who have lofty ideals and moral integrity and who are well-educated and self-disciplined , and create a political atmosphere of respecting knowledge and talented people in the party ;  
When the Five-Starred flag rose up slowly on both banks of the Victoria Harbor three years ago , people were filled with great joy , yet there was still a faint trace of worry on their mind : After Hong Kong returns to socialist China , will this " free port " be able to retain its original vigor and appeal , and will it continue to enjoy prosperity and stability ?  
We must understand , think over , and resolve , in accordance with the intrinsic relations among society , economics , politics , and culture , the question of how our party can better represent the advance orientation of China 's advanced culture , always uphold Marxism as the guide , and strive to understand and master the characteristics and laws of cultural construction so as to continuously create and push ahead the culture with Chinese characteristics , develop socialist materialist and spiritual civilizations in a coordinated way , and achieve overall social progress .  
The leadership collective of the third generation of the party with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has all the more attached importance to and strengthened the building of socialist spiritual civilization , made continuous new advances in this aspect while persisting in taking economic construction as the center and paying close attention to the building of material civilization , and clearly and definitely set and gradually and systematically expounded the task of building a culture with Chinese characteristics .  
Adequately understanding the importance and urgency of cultural construction in line with the requirements of its 15th National Congress and from the height of the prosperity of the socialist cause and national rejuvenation is an important prerequisite for the entire party to better represent the advance orientation of China 's advanced culture .  
To put it another way , we must develop a national , scientific , and popular socialist culture that is geared to the needs of modernization , the world , and the future , with Marxism as the guide and the training of citizens who have lofty ideals , moral integrity , education , and a sense of discipline as the objective .  
Of the two , advanced ideas and ethics as socialist ideology determine the nature of the entire culture , dominate its orientation of development , and impact and even lead the social , economic , and political progress as a whole .  They are the major representative and indicator of the entire culture .  
It is fair to say that the " three represents " is essential if our party is going to adapt to the new situation , meet the new challenges , and push forward socialist modernization in an all-round way , and that it is a great strategy that has bearing on the growth , flourishing , and lasting order and stability of the party and state .  
In advancing the course of urbanization , we must , bearing in mind China 's characteristics as a country with a large population , a high percentage of rural inhabitants and a relative shortage of resources , meet the objective requirements of the process of industrialization and modernization while developing the socialist market economy , rationally plan the pattern , scale and speed of urban development as well as the functions , standards and quality of cities and towns , and take the road of urbanization that suits China 's national conditions .  
We must conscientiously sum up the experience and lessons of our work of urban and rural planning , study and learn from the successful methods of other countries , adhere to the objective laws of urban and rural development , base ourselves on the present situation while bearing in mind future needs , take the interests of all parties concerned into account in making comprehensive plans , and promote the coordinated development of the economy , the society and the environment in accordance with the overall requirements of socialist modernization .  
The amendments to the customs law adopted at the meeting are conducive to safeguarding the sovereignty and interests of the country , cracking down on smuggling and criminal activities , strengthening supervision over the customs , expediting the establishment of a modern customs system , promoting economic cooperation as well as trade , scientific , technological , and cultural exchanges with other countries , and ensuring the smooth development of the drive for socialist modernization .  
Hu Kangsheng said : To amend the Marriage Law , we should proceed from China 's actual conditions , uphold the socialist marriage and family system , adhere to practicing the marriage system in terms of freedom of marriage , monogamy , and equality of men and women , maintain the equal , harmonious , and civilized matrimonial family relationship , safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of women , children , and the aged , and give an impetus to the building of socialist material and spiritual civilizations .  
The promulgation and implementation of this law have played a positive role in establishing and safeguarding the equal , harmonious , and civilized matrimonial family relationship , promoting the building of the socialist spiritual civilization and social progress , and maintaining social stability .  
Li Peng pointed out that along with the continuous deepening of reform , opening up , and modernization and the gradual establishment of the socialist market economic structure , relatively great changes have taken place in people 's ideological concepts and lifestyles , and some new conditions and problems have emerged in respect of the marriage and family relations .  Hence , it is extremely necessary to make relevant amendments to the existing Marriage Law .  
The Chinese Communist Party believes that the guiding role of the state-owned economy is mainly embodied in its ability to control .  The state-owned economy should have a dominant role in key areas and major industries which are the lifeline of the national economy .  Other areas can have adjustments such as " advance and retreat " and " let some things go undone , " with the proportion which is the state-owned economy reduced somewhat with no effect on the socialist nature of China .  
The fundamental switch from planned to socialist market economy has brought about tremendous changes in China 's social life and has also set new challenges and demands on ideological and political work .  
During the visit , Jiang Zemin urged all departments participating in the cooperation of war industries to implement the principle of " the integration of military and civilian use , and the integration of wartime and peacetime needs , " meet the needs of the new situation of the development of the socialist market economy , adhere to the principle of turning civilians into a part of the armed forces , and establish a vigorous structure for the development science and technology for national defense ;  
The extremely vicious language he employed in attacking the CPC leadership and our country 's socialist system totally exposed his ugly features of being a running dog of the hostile forces in the West .  
The circular points out : Since the establishment of the national class-A soccer tournament system in 1994 , China has accelerated the socialization and industrialization of soccer matches .  The number of persons who have cared for and watched the soccer matches has unceasingly increased .  Soccer matches has become the component of the cultural life of the broad masses of people and the window of building socialist spiritual civilization in the urban areas .  
In view of this situation , the central authorities resolutely worked out major policy decisions to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control , and started with consolidating the financial and economic order .  To meet the demand of the new situation of building a socialist market economy system and of reform and opening up , they mainly adopted economic and legal means supplemented by essential administrative measures and adopted the " soft landing " method to deal with the overheated economy and inflation .  
2 .  Making administrative affairs transparent is a key link to promoting legal administration , realizing the basic plan for ruling the country according to law , and building a socialist country ruled by law .  
With the development of the socialist market economy and the deepening reform of the grain circulation system in our country , however , the traditional central grain reserves management system and operating mechanism obviously lagged behind , its functions were not separated from those of the government , its responsibilities were not clearly defined , and its other problems such as low efficiency and rigid management were conspicuous .  These problems adversely affected the security of grain reserves .  
The course set for advanced Chinese culture today is to build a socialist culture with Chinese characteristics .  The target is , under the guidance of Marxism , to nurture the people so that they will become educated citizens with lofty ideals , a high sense of ethics and discipline ; and to promote a national , and scientific popular socialist culture oriented toward modernization , the world , and the future .  
To represent the course of China 's advanced culture , the core requirement is to push forward the construction of the socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , which the 15th National Party Congress proposed to build .  This is an important responsibility for the party and the government , a glorious assignment that the vast number of cultural workers should not shirk , and the fundamental measure for ensuring a thriving development of culture and arts during the new century .  
Carrying out comprehensive institutional reform is a strategic task set by the 15th CPC Congress , is urgently required by the establishment of a socialist market economic system , and is an important part of political system reform .  
The General Armament Department of the People 's Liberation Army recently held a forum of military representative bureau heads of the armed forces , which stressed that the building of the army 's weapons and equipment must match the overall situation of economic construction and national defense construction ; it is necessary to seriously study the new situation and characteristics of the work of military representatives under socialist market economy conditions , and further speed up the reforms in the building of the army 's weapons and equipment .  
The General Armament Department of the People 's Liberation Army recently held in Beijing an all-military forum of military representative bureau chiefs .  It stressed that military weaponry should meet the needs of the overall situation of national economic and defense construction .  It also pointed out the need to conscientiously study the new state and characteristics of military representatives ' work under the socialist market economic conditions in order to further speed up the reform of weaponry building .  
For more than 20 years of reform and opening up , especially since the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee , the reform of the personnel system relating to cadres , under the leadership of the party Central Committee , has developed and deepened step by step with the progress of the reform of the economic and political systems , scoring tremendous achievements .  This has provided a systematic guarantee for training a contingent of cadres who can fit in with the needs of reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization .  
We must treat thorough strengthening of Party building and ideological and political work , upholding Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guide , upholding implementation of consciousness of the Party 's basic line and educational policy , upholding the socialist direction for running a school , strengthening the ideological front , and providing reliable political guarantees and organizational assurances in order to promote reform and development of schools and nurturing of successors for building socialism as the outstanding substance and requirements of " three stresses " education for higher educational institutions .  
Old-age work is an important part of the socialist modernization undertaking , and we must make centralized plans , set up a reasonable pattern , plant our foothold in the present but set our sight in the future , and start out from this country 's basic situation to uphold the guiding principle that includes the government 's leadership , society 's initiative , the people 's participation , and orderly development .  
Jiang Zemin emphasized : We should persistently carry out reform to innovate relevant systems , perfect the socialist market economy system , and make the production relations and the superstructure meet the needs of the constantly developing productive forces and economic base .  
His views on winning a peaceful international environment for socialist construction , having diplomatic missions abroad consider foreign governments as their main object of work , doing what China is capable of in providing foreign aid and carrying out foreign affairs industriously and thriftily still have immediate significance until now .  
In his final days , he wrote " Politics and Economics Under the Dictatorship of the Proletariat " and other articles , despite his illness , to explain the basic theory of Marxism and put forward a series of important ideas and viewpoints on strengthening relations between the party and the people , developing the social productive force and exploring the correct ways for China 's socialist construction .  
Our party can certainly shoulder the historical heavy task of leading China 's socialist cause so long as we keenly grasp the demand for the development of China 's advanced social productive forces and the direction of China 's advanced culture and the fundamental interests and benefits of the overwhelming majority of people in China , do a good job in various work according the requirements of the " three represents , " and further improve the building of out party .  
China will consider its own needs , the WTO rules , as well as its pertinent foreign obligations to fully amplify , revise , and perfect the current foreign-related laws and rules and regulations and set up a preliminary system of unified , complete , and transparent foreign economic and trade laws and rules and regulations to meet the needs of its socialist market economy , to comply with the WTO regulations , and to suit China 's national situation .  
Wei Jianxing pointed out : State enterprises are the mainstay of China 's national economy , and our success in running state enterprises will be of a vital importance to promoting sustained , rapid , and healthy economic growth , and to consolidating the socialist system , of our country .  
Thus , doing a good job of the building of legal system for the western region and using the legal system to lead , standardize , promote , and ensure the large-scale western development is the internal requirement of the socialist market economic development , the concrete practice of the general principle of administering the country in accordance with the law , and the inevitable choice that conforms to the trend of economic globalization as well .  
We should adapt ourselves to the new situation of developing socialist market economy and to the development of international and domestic markets under the new conditions of deepening reform and opening up wider , consider the reality of the western region , strive to explore new concepts , new mechanisms and new methods , base ourselves on the present , aim at the future , do what we are capable of step by step , and ensure an orderly , rapid and highly efficient proceeding of the large-scale development of the western region .  
Zhang Wannian pointed out in a speech that Kang Da was personally founded by Chairman Mao and the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries ; in an extremely arduous wartime environment , it trained over 100,00 outstanding cadres , thus laying the organizational foundation and making a tremendous contribution to winning great victory in the war of resistance against Japan , the liberation war , and the cause of socialist revolution and construction .  
the professional quality and work style of law enforcement do not meet the requirements of the socialist market economy and the principle of governing the country according to law .  This remains a major factor that constrains the development of the procuratorial work .  We must make persistent and unremitting efforts to further improve the work of the procuratorates at the grass-roots level .  
We may say that the past five years had no match in history in terms of the arduous tasks of reform and construction , the complicated situation and the huge successes scored .  We have achieved the second step of the strategic objective of modernization , namely , quadrupling the per-capita gross national product by the year 2000 , basically eliminating poverty and achieving a relatively comfortable standard of living , and accelerating the establishment of the modern enterprise system and bringing about the beginning a socialist market economy .

"  
Over the past 20-odd years since reform and opening up , China 's economic legislation work has scored tremendous achievements , but it is still a considerable distance from the institution of a comparatively perfect socialist market economic and legal system .  Hence , the economic legislation work is still an arduous task placed before the people 's congresses and their standing committees at all levels .  
He pointed out that the fact that Comrade Jiang Zemin had repeatedly emphasized the utmost importance of strengthening party building and the development of personnel of high caliber fully shows that whether in ensuring that socialist cause started by proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation can continue from generation to generation , in ensuring the long-term peace and stability of the party and the country , or in fulfilling the " three-step " strategic objective of socialist modernization , the key lies in the party and in qualified people .  
This book series has condensed the changes of the Chinese nation in a century .  It has especially displayed in a concentrated manner the historical facts about the earth-shaking struggle waged by numerous revolutionary martyrs under the leadership of the CPC for national independence , the liberation of the people , and the cause of socialist construction , and has vividly recorded the lofty revolutionary spirit of the Chinese communists of heroically fighting for the interests of the motherland and the people , fearing no sacrifice .  
A large number of facts can prove that this organization of " Falungong " is totally a cult organization opposing the government and the people .  They organized and incited a series of illegal activities , thus openly provoking the socialist country , democracy , and legal system , and endangering national security and social stability .  If they are allowed to wantonly wreak havoc , there will never be days of peace .  
With the coming of the new century , China will enter a new development stage of comprehensive construction of a comfortable society and accelerated progress toward socialist modernization , and urban development is also certain to enter a new period , moving in a direction in line with China 's national conditions .  
For many years , the NPC and its standing committee have formulated a large number of laws to standardize the main body of the markets , maintain the market order , and practice macroeconomic regulation and control , thereby safeguarding the healthy and orderly development of the socialist market economy .  
While intensifying economic legislation , we should have a good grasp of the legislative work in terms of education , science and technology , culture , and so on with a view to creating a favorable legal environment and providing complete legal protection for developing China 's advanced culture , promoting the building of socialist spiritual civilization , and carrying out the strategy of rejuvenating the country on the strength of science and culture .  
We must effect two fundamental shifts .  [ One is the shift of the economic system from the traditional planned economy to a socialist market economy , and the other is the shift of economic growth mode from being extensive to intensive ] We should do a good job in handling a series of important relations between economic development and social development .  
Wang Zhongyu pointed out that this time , the Chinese Olympic delegation has made historical breakthroughs , displayed fully to the whole world the spiritual style and features of being united and forging ahead of the Chinese people , greatly encouraged the patriotic fervor of the people of all ethnic groups across the country , increased the national cohesive force of Chinese at home and abroad , and further enhanced the high prestige of the socialist motherland .  
to make import progress in establishing a modern enterprise system in state-owned enterprises , to establish a relatively sound social security system , to take a substantive step forward in perfecting the socialist market economy structure , and to take part in international economic cooperation and competition on a wider scope and at a deeper level ;  
continue to accumulate new practical experience ; and continue to create new theoretical achievements so that our party will forever retain its vitality and our socialist modernization will be carried out more smoothly .  We believe that with the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory , the correct leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , and the unity and struggle of more than 60 million communist party members of vigor and vitality and 1.2 billion industrious and bright people , we can definitely achieve our objectives .  
major progress is to be made in establishing a modern enterprise system in the state-owned enterprises , the social security system is to be put on a relatively sound basis , substantive progress is to be made in perfecting the socialist market economy structure , and China is to take part in international economic cooperation and competition in greater breadth and depth ;  
make major progress in setting up the modern enterprise system in state-owned enterprises and establishing a relatively sound social security system , make substantial progress in improving the socialist market economic system , and participate in international economic cooperation and competition on a larger scope and to a deeper extent ;  
Now we are beginning to carry out the third-step strategy , that is , by the middle of the 21st century , China 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita will reach the level of moderately developed countries , and we will basically realize modernization and build a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist country .  
summed up the great practice in more than 20 years of reform and opening up ; and from the high plane of history and breadth of the world 's scope , profoundly analyzed the opportunities and challenges China faces at the turn of the century and put forward the strategic tasks and guiding principles for China 's economic and social development in the next 5 to 10 years .  It is a programmatic document that will guide us in advancing socialist modernization .  
The " Proposals " reflects the demands of the third-step strategic objective in socialist modernization , the demands of socialist market economic development , the demands of new situations in the new century , and the interests and aspirations of the broad masses .  The entire document is filled with the spirit of emancipating minds , seeking truth from facts , exploring and innovating , and seeking pragmatism .  It has vivid characteristics of the times and is an important document on Marxism .  
During the Tenth Five-Year Plan period , China 's society and politics will continue to remain stable , and the socialist market economic system will be further perfected .  The economy of the people of China will continue to develop at a rapid pace , and clear successes will be evident in the strategic restructuring of economic structures .  Increases in economic quality and efficiency will be evident , and state owned enterprises will establish modern management systems and will progress greatly .  
Second , in light of changes in the situation after China 's entry into the World Trade Organization , it will continue to deepen the reform of the fiscal revenue system , further improve the revenue-sharing system between the central and local governments , positively promote the reform of the fiscal budget system , improve the system of the transfer of payments by the Treasury , actively and steadily promote the transformation of administrative fees into taxes , and gradually establish a public financial framework that meets the needs of the socialist market economy .  
We should fully unfold education on fighting corruption and building a clean government , wage the struggle against corruption in great depth , establish a sound supervisory and administrative system , and use correct thinking , system and mechanism to curb corrupt practices in the light of the new situation , the new characteristics and the new rules of the anti-corruption struggle under the socialist market economy .  
In his speech , Wen Jiabao stressed that the fifth plenary session of the 15th party central committee , which has just ended , examined and adopted the " Proposal of the CPC Central Committee on the Formulation of the Tenth Five-Year Plan for the National Economic and Social Development " and put forth the strategic mission and guiding principle for China 's economic and social development to march toward the new century , which is a programmatic document guiding our endeavor in the socialist modernization .  
While concentrating our energies on achieving agricultural and rural economic development , we must really have a good grasp of the building of rural grassroots organizations , democratic legal system , and socialist spiritual civilization , maintain social stability in the rural areas , and give impetus to the rural economic and social development in a comprehensive way .  
In light of the new rural situation in the new stage , we should carry out education on the party 's basic line and rural policies , the socialist and collective spirit , the transformation of established traditions and practices , the democratic legal system , as well as science and culture .  
The development of rural scientific , technological , and educational undertakings and the enhancement of peasants ' ideological and moral level as well as their scientific and cultural standard are the crucial links of implementing the strategy of invigorating agriculture on the strength of science and education and bringing about the change from traditional agriculture to modern agriculture , and also the important contents and guarantee for building the new socialist rural areas , which are the eager aspirations of the vast number of peasants too .  
The coming five to 10 years are a vital period for China to attain economic and social development , an important period to perfect its socialist market economic structure and further open to the outside world , and also a crucial period for catching up with the developed countries in science and technology as well as international competition .  
Therefore , we should make reform run through various aspects with a view to precipitating economic development , promoting structural adjustment , propelling market development , and opening wider to the outside world ; constantly perfect various structures that are suited to the requirements for developing the socialist market economic structure ; and break through the obstacles restricting the development of productive forces , which still exist in the current production relationship , in order to provide endless motive power to the economic development .  
Only by so doing , can they better implement their sacred mission entrusted by the party and the people .  They said : In accordance with the guiding spirit of the " proposal , " we will focus on the overall construction of the armed forces , strive to push forward socialist spiritual civilization construction as well as democratic and legal construction .  
We should take a lead in socialist spiritual civilization construction .  We should further foster close ties between the military and the government as well as between the military and the people .  We should continuously make new contributions in promoting coordinated economic and social development , in consolidating and developing China 's political stability , and in creating a good situation of social stability .  
To achieve economic development and across-the-board social progress , we must launch intensive education regarding the socialist legal system , raising the concept of the legal system on the part of all the people , but first of all the leading cadres at each level .  
As long as we steadfastly carry out the spirit of the 5th Plenary Session of the 15th Central Committee of the CPC , sticking to economic development and coordinated social development and launching our various tasks in a comprehensive and down-to-earth manner , our drive to socialist modernization is bound to take the step up to the next level .  
He stressed that the purpose of amending the marriage law is to better safeguard equal , harmonious , and civilized marriages and family relations ; protect the legitimate rights and interests of women , children , and old people ; and promote socialist spiritual civilization and material civilization .  
We should unswervingly arm the minds of young cadres with Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought and , in particular , Deng Xiaoping Theory , foster their fine style with the party 's fine traditions and strict management , enhance their professional level with modern scientific and technological knowledge and the fine achievements of civilization created by human society , and heighten the quality of young cadres in all respects , so as to guarantee that the cause of socialist modernization will be carried forward and forged ahead in a pioneering spirit .  
We should give full consideration to the characteristics of the ideological work , which should be adapted to the requirements of the socialist market economic system and which should be conducive to strengthening party leadership , to giving full play to the initiative of propaganda and cultural workers , and to promoting the development and prosperity of various undertakings .  We should publish more works of excellence to satisfy the increasing spiritual and cultural needs of the people .  
Especially , since the start of reform and opening , nationalities of our country have made tremendous achievements in producing common prosperity and progress in the process of economic development , and have worked continually to consolidate socialist nationality relationships based on equality , unity , and mutual help ; the Chinese nation has shown strong cohesion amid changes in the international situation .  
The Law on the National Common Language adopted at this meeting will provide a correct guide for the normalization , standardization , and healthy growth of our national common spoken and written languages ; and it is therefore conducive to the country 's reunification and national unity , and to our building of socialist material and spiritual civilizations .  The passing of the revised Law on Fisheries is of great significance to stepping up our protection , multiplication , development , and rational utilization of fishery resources ;  
We should persistently rectify and eliminate chaos and ignorance .  We should establish constructive models while eliminating negative ones in accordance with the policy of promoting positive examples while discarding bad elements .  We should correctly handle the ties between the inheritance and creation of nationalities ' traditional culture , increase cultural exchanges among fraternal nationalities , absorb the accomplishments of all the civilizations of mankind , and upgrade the educational level of Tibet 's various nationalities so as to provide powerful spiritual driving force and intellectual support for developing Tibet into a new socialist region .  
Li Peng pointed out : Over the past 20-odd years since reform and opening up , guided by the basic principle of developing the socialist democracy and amplifying the socialist legal system proposed by the party 's central committee and Comrade Deng Xiaoping , China 's legislative work has scored spectacular achievements .  
He said : Generally speaking , China basically has had laws to abide by in its major spheres of political life , economic life , and social life .  The framework of a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics taking the constitution as the core has taken shape , which has laid down a solid foundation for the institution of a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics .  
In the meantime , the legislative work should reflect the direction of the advanced culture and , through properly grasping the legislative work in the spheres of education , science and technology , culture , and so on , create a fine legal environment for carrying forward China 's advanced culture , facilitating the building of socialist spiritual civilization , implementing the strategy of rejuvenating the country on the strength of science and education , and promoting social progress in a comprehensive way .  
We should continue to persist in placing the economic legislation in the primary position , speed up formulating some laws and regulations urgently needed for the development of the socialist market economic structure , and perfect the legal system that is suited to the socialist market economic structure in line with the requirements put forth by the fifth plenary session of the 15th party central committee . 
It is also necessary to speed up formulating and perfecting the laws and regulations in the areas of developing socialist democratic politics , standardizing the administrative and judicial systems , tightening the supervision over power operation , promoting the building of a clean and honest government , and so on , in a bid to push forward the political structural reform and deepen the administrative and judicial structural reforms .  
Facing such an intricate and complex international political , economic , and military struggle , in order to safeguard China 's national security and the unification of our motherland , ensure a smooth progress for our great socialist cause , and protect the fundamental interests of the people of the entire country , we must enhance our awareness of guarding against possible future mishaps and must reinforce our national defense building .  
Since the founding of new China 50 years ago , particularly 20 years since China implemented the policy of reform and opening up , the broad mass of journalist workers have enthusiastically plunged into the great practice of socialist building and reform ; ardently spread Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory and the party 's line , principles , and policies ; truthfully reflected the Chinese people 's spiritual outlook of engaging in pioneering work ;  
Jiang Chunyun stressed : Further efforts should be made to strengthen the building of legal systems and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of economic and technological entities and legal persons with laws and regulations , strive to create a good investment environment , establish good social order , and build the demonstration zone into a new community with socialist material and spiritual civilizations .  
Comrade Deng Xiaoping , chief architect of our country 's socialist reform and opening up , led all party comrades in emancipating their minds , seeking truth from facts , observing the characteristics of the times and the current international situation in an all-round way , summing up foreign and domestic socialist construction as well as historical and immediate experiences , and conducting difficult explorations , thus making important achievements in the theory and practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
On condition that the basic socialist system is upheld , the special economic zones have taken the lead in carrying out reform , gaining fresh experiences in exploring ways to undertake socialist modernization with Chinese characteristics .  In the historic process of shifting from the planned economy to a socialist market economy , the special economic zones have played an important role as a testing ground ;  
The development of the Shenzhen and other special economic zones and the New Pudong District is a splendid miniature and a vivid reflection of the historic changes and great achievements made in our country since the beginning of its reform and opening up as well as an effective confirmation of correct party leadership and the superiority of the socialist system .  
The important purpose of systemic innovation is to overcome the factors in the relations of production and the superstructure that hinder the development of the productive forces and to keep liberating and developing the productive forces .  We should uphold the basic economic system under which the socialist public ownership is dominant while economic sectors of diverse forms of ownership develop side by side ;  
They should be good at learning from and drawing on all the outstanding achievements of human civilizations and at inheriting and carrying forward all the outstanding ideas , morals , and cultural traditions of the Chinese nation ; they should effectively resist the corroding influence of all negative , decadent ideologies and cultures and always maintain the socialist mental outlook .  
At present , we should conscientiously study the knowledge relating to the socialist market economy , transform our concepts on financial and economic work , quicken the pace of building the public finance suited to China 's national conditions , further adjust and optimize the financial revenue-expenditure structure , incrementally reduce investment in the profit-making and operational spheres , vigorously cut down the administrative and institutional spending , push the operational institutions into the market , and concentrate the use of financial resources mainly on the areas of social and public necessities and social security .  
Since the founding of the New China , the Chinese Government has constantly been working hard to protect and develop human rights , and has made unremitting efforts to eliminate poverty and backwardness , to build a wealthy and powerful socialist modern country with a high degree of democracy and civilization , and to realize the ideal of human rights .  Great achievements have also been made in this regard .  
4 ) Publicizing patriotism and socialist spiritual civilization : The wealth of themes vividly expressed on the colorful commemorative gold and silver coins , together with the appreciation of thousands upon thousands of collectors , makes it possible for patriotism and the aim of socialist spiritual civilization building to merge imperceptibly into the masses ' spiritual and cultural lives . 
Minister of Finance Xiang Huaicheng stressed at the closing ceremony : As our country 's fiscal work will be faced with great opportunities and challenges in the new century , we must adapt to changes in the environment both at home and abroad , firmly grasp the initiative in fiscal work , and concentrate efforts on structuring a framework of public finance suited to the requirements of the socialist market economy and on building stable , balanced , and strong state finances to better serve the overall interests of economic and social development .  
Xiang Huaicheng demanded : With the gradual establishment of the socialist market economic system , comrades engaged in fiscal work must conscientiously change their mentality by changing their thinking from that of the planned finance in the past to that of public finance . 
At present , women 's federations should particularly do a good job in conducting education in current situation and policies , education in socialist ethics , and education in Marxist materialism , atheism and scientific approach in light of the progress of reform and development and the actual thinking of women ; and guide the broad masses of women to further firm their belief in Marxism , their faith in building socialism with Chinese characteristics , their confidence in reform , opening up and modernization , and their trust in the party and the government .  
On the work of training and selecting woman cadres , Hu Jintao said : It is necessary to train a large number of qualified women leaders who always adhere to the requirements of the " three represents , " who are really up to the mark in political quality , professional knowledge and working ability , and who are capable of performing important tasks in the new century ; and this training task is an indispensable requirement of our party during the course of leading the people to comprehensively advance socialist modernization .  
Especially during the past 20 and more years since the introduction of reform and opening up , the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association and the Chinese Catholic Bishops College have cooperated with each other closely , forged ahead in unity , assisted the party and government in implementing the policy of religious freedom , pushed forward the development of patriotic organizations , vigorously nurtured middle-aged and young patriotic clerics , actively promoted democratic management of churches , striven to adapt to socialist society , and brought about progress and development in various church undertakings by leaps and bounds .  
Wang Zhaoguo pointed out : The past 50 years of history fully proved that the anti-imperialist patriotic movement is a successful practice of the Catholic circle 's patriotic spirit .  Independent and self-reliant management of churches is a correct choice of Chinese Catholic clerics and believers in line with China 's history and actual situation , and it is the necessary path for Chinese Catholicism to be consistent with socialist society .  
We must vigorously step up cultural construction , grasp the spirit of the age , stick to the correct orientation , and make full use of a variety of modern media means , especially broadcasting , television , and the Internet , in making efforts to consolidate and expand the socialist cultural position and form a healthy and uplifting environment of public opinion , a civilized and harmonious social atmosphere , and a rich and varied cultural life .  
The Communist Party of China , which is now leading the Chinese people to carry out reform , opening up , and socialist modernization construction , is willing to continue developing friendly and cooperative relations with the Communist Party of the Russian Federation on the basis of the principle of " independence , autonomy , complete equality , mutual respect , and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs . "  
The leadership collective persists in pooling the united front 's strength and wisdom from all sides for the central task of economic construction , thereby forging a united , stable , invigorating , and active political situation , and spurring the constant advancement of China 's reform , opening up , and modernization drive .  The leadership collective upholds and perfects the system of multi-party cooperation led by the CPC and the system of political consultation , thereby promoting socialist democratic political construction and further strengthening the people 's democratic dictatorship and state power .  
In his speech at the meeting , Li Peng , chairman of the National People 's Congress ( NPC ) Standing Committee , pointed out that the convening of this grand meeting in China indicates that China 's tremendous achievements in the building of legal system have attracted worldwide attention , that law education and research in China have an increasingly extensive impact on the global affairs , and that the world is extremely concerned about the building of a socialist country ruled by law in China .  
Over the past 20-odd years since reform and opening up , considerable headway has been made in developing socialist democracy and perfecting the socialist legal system in China , and the framework of a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics that takes the constitution as the core has shaped up , which has laid a solid foundation for the practice of governing the country according to law and the building of a socialist country ruled by law .  
With reference to these issues , the city party committee organized people concerned to earnestly study relevant documents and analyze the case example of former city mayor Mo Miaorong who took up the road of crime , and let the people concerned understand that under the new situation of carrying out reform and opening up and developing socialist market economy , in order to keep cool-headedness and withstand rigorous tests , leading cadres must stress study , politics , and healthy tendencies . 
With reference to the disastrous consequences brought about by the drastic changes in the former Soviet Union and East Europe to the countries and peoples there as well as the development of the socialist undertakings since the founding of PRC 50 years ago , especially the brilliant achievements attained since reform and opening up over the last 20 years in China , they more deeply understand that the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the only correct road for consolidating and developing socialism in China , realizing national rejuvenation , and making China powerful and prosperous .  
In the new century , the party 's basic requirements for the united front are to hold high the banner of patriotism and socialism , unite with all forces that can be united , bring all positive factors into play , and turn native factors into positive ones to serve the purposes of developing socialist economics , politics , and culture with Chinese characteristics , maintaining the political situation characterized by unity and stability , realizing the complete reunification of the motherland , and safeguarding world peace and promoting common development .  
These associations have not only become new forces , but have also played a more important role in supporting and developing poor areas , serving the community , carrying out ideological and political work in the grass roots , and building democracy , the legal system , and socialist spiritual civilization .  
On the one hand , as a socialist country , China upholds the principal role of public ownership in the economic field , adheres to the leading position of the CPC in the political field , and persists in the guiding role of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory in the ideological and cultural fields .  The people 's uniformity has tremendously increased in terms of fundamental interests , common ideals , and target of endeavor .  
[ Wang ] Upon entering the new century , the party 's basic requirements on united front work are : Holding high the banner of patriotism and socialism ; uniting with all the forces that can be united ; mobilizing all positive factors ; turning negative factors into positive ones ; catering to the establishment of socialist economy , politics , and culture with Chinese characteristics ; catering to the political situation of stability and unity ; catering to the realization of the motherland 's complete reunification ; catering to world peace ; and catering to common development .  
In conclusion , Zhu Rongji emphatically pointed out : Cracking down on fraudulent practice in tax reimbursement for export not only can strengthen and improve macro-control , prevent economic losses of the state and promote a healthy development of the economy but also are of great significance in implementing the policy of running the country according to the law , improving and normalizing the order of socialist market economy and severely punishing corrupt elements .  
For one reason or another , however , underworld evil forces are still developing and spreading in some localities in these years , and they are swollen with arrogance .  Where such forces are rampant , people dare not report to the authorities the crimes committed by these forces and make complaints about their sufferings .  Now , underworld evil forces of one kind or another have gravely jeopardized the safety of our people 's life and property and seriously disrupted our socialist market economy and social order .  
The crimes of criminal and evil forces of all kinds have already done serious damage to the stability of social order , seriously threatened the safety of the masses ' lives and property , seriously damaged order in socialist market economy and in social management , corrupted the party , government , and judicial cadre force , eroded grassroots political power , and ruined the party style and social mood .  
We should do well the double-support work under the new situation , unite with and mobilize the broad masses of servicemen and people to strive for the fulfillment of our party 's historical tasks .  It is of important and profound significance to boosting our economic strength , to increasing our defense capabilities , to carrying forward our socialist ideology , ethics and culture , and to practicing our party 's fundamental aim of serving the people wholeheartedly .  
Our double-support work should meet the demand of the important thinking on the " three represents , " take the development of our social productive forces and the enhancement of our troops ' combat effectiveness as our fundamental starting point and standpoint .  We should follow the important principle of treating well the relations involving our army , government and civilians from the high plane of stressing politics , so that their unity will constantly consolidate and develop and make a still greater contribution to our reform , opening up and socialist modernization .  
Hu Jintao noted : Youths are the most active and dynamic force in the entire society .  In the face of a rapid scientific and technological development in today 's world and under China 's current conditions of reform , opening up , and socialist market economic development , in particular , young people are playing an increasingly important role in our economic and social lives .  
The Beijing Municipal CPC Committee , which is putting into practice the guidelines laid down by the 15th CPC National Congress and the fifth plenary session of the 15th Central Committee , has defined the capital 's development strategy for the new century , taking Beijing 's actual conditions into account .  For the first step , namely in the period from now until 2010 , Beijing will basically achieve socialist modernization before other cities throughout the country , building up the basic framework of a modern international metropolis .  
Huang Ju said that in the Tenth Five-Year Plan period , Shanghai will , while aiming for the goal and sticking to the mainline of raising the city 's comprehensive competitiveness , constantly raise the information technology , marketization , and rule-of-law levels that are worthy of the name of a metropolis that embarks on socialist modernization and that strives to become a big international city .  It will also make great efforts developing industrial sectors that produce high value-added products , that create business opportunities for other sectors , and that generate more employment .  
The Vietnamese Government and people are sincerely grateful to and will never forget the Chinese Government and people for their valuable support and selfless assistance rendered when Vietnam carried out its struggles for national liberation and socialist construction .  The two countries have ceremoniously celebrated the 50th anniversary of the establishment of Vietnamese-Chinese diplomatic ties and bilateral ties are now in a very sound stage of development .  
During the July-September period , public security organs across the country , with close coordination of other departments , launched a campaign to tighten the management of places of entertainment and service .  They carried out a severe crackdown on prostitution , gambling , drug trafficking , and other social evils .  They also tightened the management of places where electronic games were available .  They have made contributions to improving the social environment and promoting a socialist spiritual civilization .  
is a central link that unites the whole party and people of all ethnic groups of the entire country in their fulfillment of all the tasks set by the party and the state ; and is also a major political advantage enjoyed by our party and our socialist country .  Only when we give full play to the ideological-political work , which is our political advantage , can we ensure that our economic work as well as work in other fields can develop towards a correct direction ;  
Over the past few years , our country has made much headway in furthering a social security structural reform in light of such needs as developing a socialist market economy ; has preliminarily established a basic old-age security system , a basic medical security system , an unemployment security system for staff and workers of urban enterprises , and a minimum livelihood security system for urban residents ; and has laid down a basic framework for a social security system .  
Zeng : In putting the large-scale western development into effect , we should take reform and opening up as a powerful dynamic , make positive exploration , be bold to bring forth new ideas , deepen economic structural reform , and quicken the pace of establishing and perfecting the socialist market economic structure ;  
They highly praised the brilliant achievements scored in China under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , and felt elated and inspired by the sustained development of social productive forces , the continuously elevated standards of the people 's material and cultural lives , the gradual advance of the socialist democratic politics , and the excellent situation of national unity , national unification , and social stability .  
Based on the need to attain the strategic objectives for the third stage of China 's socialist modernization drive and the need to win the competition in comprehensive national strength in the present-day world , we must seize the opportunity , bravely press ahead , always take institutional innovation and scientific and technological innovation as the driving force , and step up the development of high-tech industry in our country .  
We must not be faint-hearted and hesitant in dealing with the handful of criminals who , with ulterior political motives , held fast to their anti-government , anti-social and anti-people stand , and organized and instigated deceived Falungong maniacs to openly stir up trouble , disrupt public order , and undermine social stability in their attempt to undermine the cause of socialist modernization .  We must deal a resolute blow to them and punish them severely in accordance with law , and must not leave any openings for future trouble .  
The tourism areas and tourism service units should vigorously carry out healthy and beneficial tourism activities , exploit potential humanity values of sight-seeing spots for tourism , combine tourism development with efforts to enhance socialist spiritual civilization construction , advocate the national culture through the tourism window , enhance patriotism education , and promote international cultural exchanges .  
Third , we need to reform the agricultural scientific and technological management structure , set up an open , mobile , competitive , and coordinated agricultural scientific and technological operational mechanism , and gradually form a new-type management structure suited to the socialist market economic development .  
It is necessary to vigorously carry forward the lofty ideology and spirit of selfless dedication of the labor models , cultivate a worker rank with ideals , ethics , culture , and discipline , guide and stimulate the workers to actively plunge into the building of socialist material and spiritual civilization , and persistently influence and lead forward the whole of society with the advanced ideology of the working class .  
The first - generation party leadership launched the land revolution , which stimulated the initiative and creativity of the millions of peasants to a tremendous extent , smoothly completed the socialist transformation of agriculture and traditional industry , and laid the firm foundation for the initial stage of socialism .  
The ulterior motive of Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " cult in spreading rumors to confuse the public , breaking the law and creating trouble is to create chaos and social disorder in China , disrupt people 's normal work , study and daily life , and interfere with the central task of economic development , so that they can realize their political aim of overthrowing the leadership of the Chinese communist party and changing China 's socialist system .  
The " Epilogue - - China 's New Century " gave full expression to the firm determination of the entire military troops and civilian people throughout the country to closely rally around the party central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core and build our country into a rich and powerful modern socialist nation with a high degree of civilization and democracy in the new century .  
They held that the year 2000 which just passed was a year of landmark significance in the process of development in our country , as the national economy maintained a rather rapid development speed , the building of democratic politics made steady progress , the multi-party cooperation and political consultation system was further improved , and favorable conditions were created for us to comprehensively build our country into comparatively well-off society and speed up the process of socialist modernization in the new century .  
In their speeches , they also put forward opinions and proposals on how to better maintain and improve the CPC-led multi-party cooperation and political consultation system , further deepen reforms , promote sustained economic development , safeguard the political situation of stability and unity , enhance socialist democracy and the building of the legal system , and advance the building of socialist spiritual civilization in the new year .  
Jiang Zemin said : Practice has proved again and again that giving full play to the positive role of the democratic parties , the federation of industrialists and businessmen , and public figures without party affiliations in the state 's economic , political , and social lives is conducive to strengthening and improving the leadership of the Communist Party , conductive to advancing socialist democratic politics , and conducive to our economic and social development and to our social stability and unity .  
He said : During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , the sports front persisted in carrying out the party 's principles and policies in the physical culture work , persistently took the improvement of the people 's physique as its principal task , and adhered to the principle of combining popularization with enhancement and promoting the coordinated development of mass sports and athletic competition , so that it has scored tremendous achievements and made significant contributions to the building of the socialist material and spiritual civilizations .  
Along with the development of the socialist market economy , the law governing the exchange of commodities will easily produce corrosive influences in social political life and people 's spiritual realm , give rise to the disregard of moral principles in pursuit of profits and the exchange of power for money , and lead to the weakening of the state and collective awareness and the spirit of mutual assistance and dedication .  
Closely integrated with the new , historical conditions , the entire party must conscientiously put into practice the basic strategy of governing the country according to law and governing the country by ethics , always adhere to the principle of " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to both , " further attach importance to and step up the building of socialist ethics while continuing to step up the building of democratic legal system .  
The broad masses of transferred military cadres , on the other hand , should preserve and carry forward the fine tradition of the people 's army , serve the interests of the whole , support the reform program , and show understanding and sympathy for the difficulties experienced by the state and local authorities in trying to settle them .  They should take the initiative to obey the arrangements made by the organization and work hard at their new posts to make fresh contributions to the cause of socialist modernization .  
However , the realization of socialist modernization in rural areas can not rely on empty talk or idle waiting , but can only rely on our painstaking and unswerving efforts with innovations and efficiency .  Only by making such efforts can we usher in a bright future .  
This round of institutional reform and reorganization in the State Economic and Trade Commission and its subordinate state bureaus is another major step for forming a streamlined , unified , and highly efficient administrative structure .  This step is of great significance for achieving the goal of completely separating government institutions from enterprise management , transforming government functions , establishing and improving the socialist market economic system , enhancing the work efficiency of the government institutions , and enhancing macroeconomic control .  
We must be sincerely patient , painstaking , and fair and reasonable in our education and guidance of the majority of " Falungong " practitioners , helping them to further understand the essence of and grave threat represented by Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " organization and walk away from the preposterous world he has fabricated so they have concern for the development of the international and domestic situation , the future fate of the Party and the country , and the great enterprise of reforms and opening up and the drive to socialist modernization .  
In a written speech , Luo Guojie , professor at the Chinese People 's University , said : This thinking is an important theoretical development of socialist politics , ethics , and law , and it is bound to practically produce a positive influence on social stability and moral practice in our country and to greatly accelerate our drive for socialist modernization .  
He said : " Running the country with virtue " and instituting an ideological and moral system adapting to the developing socialist market economy are a long-term strategic task and a huge project of systems engineering , and this calls for joint efforts by people in various circles , continuously studying new situations in practice , and summing up fresh experiences .  
At the same time , it encourages grassroots authorities in the countryside to alter their functions as development of the socialist market economy demands .  It has downsized township institutions and staff , promoted village self-administration , improved the rural administrative system , and made the rural superstructure better fit the changed economic foundation .  
At his work posts , he made great contributions to the party 's ethnic work , united front work , and socialist cause .  In 1978 , he was elected as vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee . Though being at an advanced age , he still paid close attention to the unity of the people of all ethnic groups and the development of the areas inhabited by ethnic minorities , and still cared about the development and use of water resources in the motherland .  
So long as we keep the overall situation in mind , advance with the current of the times , keep in step with the development trend of the world , emancipate the mind , seek truth from facts , make concerted efforts , be keen in keeping forging ahead , then will we certainly be able to tide over all difficulties and obstacles on our way forward and make countless successes in socialist modernization .  
We must actively meet the new demands of the contemporary economic , science , technology , and social development , and speed up the establishment and perfection of a complete set of systems and mechanisms that are indispensable to developing the socialist market economy .  
Correct ideological theories and high-technology knowledge were used to arm the minds of the troops .  Great efforts were made to promote the spirit of making unswerving efforts for the realization of socialist modernization as advocated by Chairman Jiang Zemin , and prompt the vast number of officers and servicemen to become revolutionary soldiers with a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good education , and a sense of discipline , and make this their noble pursuit and action .  
Delivering a work report at the opening ceremony of the Fourth Session of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee , Ye Xuanping said : With continued deepening reform and opening up , and the tremendous changes in all China 's economic sectors , economic interests , social lifestyle , and social structure , the task is even more vital in carrying forward socialist democracy , safeguarding social unity and stability , strengthening development of socialist democracy and legal system , and correctly handling internal contradictions of the people in the new period .  
in the context of public ownership as the main body , we must steadfastly develop economic sectors under varied ownerships , which is conducive to fully mobilizing and using social resources and boosting the vitality of the national economy as a whole , as they make up an integral party of the socialist market economy .  
During the past year , the NPC and its standing committee , in line with the requirements of the important thinking of the " three represents , " earnestly performed the lofty responsibility entrusted to it by the Constitution and laws and made new progress in conducting legislative and supervisory work , and it carried out highly effective work and produced outstanding results in the endeavor to establish a rudimentary socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics and implement the basic plan of running the country according to law and building a socialist country ruled by law .  
Let us rally more closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , meet the requirements of the important thinking of the " three represents " in an all-round way , enhance our vigor and vitality , forge ahead in a pioneering and enterprising spirit , work in a down-to-earth manner , and exert ourselves in the struggle to achieve the goal of the 10th Five-year Plan and build an affluent , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist modern country !  
Of these figures , the NPC and its standing committee have , since the ninth congress , formulated a total of nearly 60 laws and law-related decisions and most of the basic and principal laws of the seven branches of law that make up the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics have been enacted .  
formulate and perfect laws that cater to the effort to push forward the reform of the political system and intensify the reform of the administrative system and judicial system , in a bid to preliminarily form a socialist legal system with Chinese system within the term of the current NPC .  
Li Lanqing said : During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , as China 's building of socialist spiritual civilization was further strengthened , the literary and artistic undertaking was flourishing in all fields , and the good athletes obtained excellent achievements in some major international games .  
Li Lanqing called for the governments at all levels to highly value the literary , artistic , and sports undertaking , regard it as a major component of the building of socialist spiritual civilization , increase the intensity of financial input , and give correct guidance to further advance the literary , artistic , and sports undertaking .  
This afternoon , members of the National Committee of the Chinese People 's Political Consultation Conference [ CPPCC ] from the educational circle and the medical and public health circle held a joint group meeting .  Several committee members expressed their opinions on the current situation of public health in China , pointing out that China 's current public health conditions are extremely incompatible with the country 's status and socialist system , and should be effectively and rapidly improved .  
Through the formulation and implementation of the 10th Five-Year Plan , China will be able to better adjust its own pace of development , release the initiative of the people of all ethnic groups across the country , concentrate all efforts on the theme of " development , " and advance toward the strategic objective of building a moderately developed socialist country and enhancing the people 's living standards so that they are able to lead a fairly comfortable life .  
Ismail Amat said : China is a country with multiple nationalities and religions .  The party and government always take the nationality and religious work seriously and have practiced a series of correct policies to handle the nationality and religious issues , so that all kinds of interests of the minority nationalities and religious followers have been safeguarded , the socialist national relationship of equality , unity , and mutual assistance has been consolidated and developed with each passing day , and various nationalities have made unceasing development and progress in the big family of the motherland .  
Today , when the 10th Five-Year Plan is formulated , the framework of a socialist market economy has been initially set up , the concept of building a market economy has struck deep roots in the hearts of people , the living standards of our people have basically reached a moderately high level , the supply of most commodities has exceeded their demand , economic globalization has become a major trend , China 's accession to the WTO is just round corner , and international competition is becoming increasingly acute .  
This is because we have initially established the socialist market economy structure , and accumulated more experience in macroeconomic management and in regulation and control ; and we have overcome difficulties caused by insufficient effective domestic demand through implementing the guideline of expanding domestic demand and practicing an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy .  
Grasping development as the main theme , Tianjin has three great historic tasks to fulfill at the start of the new century : to build a modern international port city and a major economic center of north China ; to establish a relatively perfect socialist market economy structure ; and to become one of the regions in the lead in basically achieving modernization .  
After earnestly listening to several delegates ' statements , Hu Jintao said that Prime Minister Zhu Rongji 's report and draft outline have completely set forth a magnificent blue print for the construction of our socialist modernization for the next five years , and have fully realized the spirit of the Fifteenth Party Congress and the Fifth Plenary Session of the Fifteenth Central Committee . He said that the report has an important function in guiding our economic and social development forward in the new century .  
Although we have established a basic and preliminary framework for the socialist market economic structure , it has yet to be gradually improved .  In particular , the tasks for readjusting and improving the ownership structure and establishing and perfecting the market system will be rather arduous .  
Under the conditions of a socialist market economy , carrying forward and developing the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation , giving rise to a sound common practice of respecting , providing for , assisting the elderly in society , and building up a harmonious relationship between different generations is a major content for our current socialist spiritual civilization building .  
During the 10th Five-Year Plan period , Guangdong must continue to act on Comrade Jiang Zemin 's instructions , namely " creating new strengths and reaching a higher level . "  First of all , Guangdong must give play to its political , institutional , and geographical advantages and speed up changing the government functions and improving the market economic order so as to become the forerunner in establishing and improving the socialist market economic system .  
In view of our country , following the reform and opening up and economic construction for more than 20 years , the productive forces in our country have climbed onto a new stage , the system of socialist market economy has been initially established , the scale and level of opening up to the outside world have been greatly increased , the talented people of science and technology , management , and other specialized professions are growing rapidly , and a number of center cities with relatively stronger competitiveness have emerged in the coastal areas .  
Faced with the new situation and tasks during the 10th FYP , in order to achieve the development goals for the new century , it is essential to continue to persist in emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , speed up the pace of system reforms and innovation , continually remove system-style obstacles constraining the development of the social productive forces , and further perfect the socialist market economy system , so as to create a still more favorable system environment and conditions for economic development .  
and great achievements have been made in the construction of socialist material civilization and spiritual civilization .  This is a result of the efforts that Sichuan and Yunnan provincial party committees and provincial governments have made in leading the broad ranks of cadres and masses all over the two provinces to work hard , but live plainly , and forge ahead in a pioneering and enterprising spirit .  
To prefect the basic economic system with public ownership as the mainstay and with the common development of all economies in different ownership forms , to perfect the distribution system with the income earned from work as the main form and with the coexistence of diverse income forms , to perfect the structure of the socialist market system , and to carry out political institutional reform , we must all rely on institutional innovations .  " Without institutional innovations , there will be no solution for many issues . "  
President Jiang Pointed out : Through more than two decades of development , our country has initially built a socialist market economic system , formed the pattern of opening to the outside world in all directions , gained valuable experiences in controlling complicated situations and coping with various risks , and made a marked advance in increasing the productive forces and the comprehensive national strength ; the self-confidence and cohesion of the people of various nationalities across the country have been continuously strengthened .  All this has laid a solid foundation for our continuing advance .  
Buhe , vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee , joined deputies of the Fujian delegation in discussing Chairman Li Peng 's work report .  He pointed out : In the next few years , we will be facing arduous legislative tasks , and the difficult points in the legislative work will be rather prominent .  We must further quicken the pace of legislation , establish and perfect the socialist legal system .  This is a fundamental measure concerning our country 's long-lasting order and stability and long-term development .  
It has been reported that as of today , the NPC and its standing committee have enacted more than 390 laws and decisions related to relevant laws , and local people 's congresses have enacted more than 8,000 local statutes .  With these laws and statutes and the administrative laws and regulations formulated by the State Council , " a framework of socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics has basically come into shape . "  
In the meantime , he suggested that while revising some laws , China should speed up the study and formulation of pertinent laws that are conducive to safeguarding the interests and economic security of the country and protecting national industries , including the laws on antidumping , antimonopoly , and so on with measures to guarantee their enforcement , improve and perfect the legal system of the socialist market economic structure , and create conditions for enterprises to make overseas investment and found undertakings in foreign countries .  
NPC Deputy Wu Xiyuan said : The system of the people 's congress , the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultations under the leadership of the CPC , and the system of regional autonomy of minority nationalities are great political achievements that our party has attained and developed during the course of leading the people to carry out a long-term struggle , are the core contents of our socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics , and are a historical choice made by all the Chinese people . 
In its great practice of leading the masses to build up socialist modernizations , from reinforcing and perfecting the system of people 's congress and the system of people 's political consultative conference to introducing democracy of a most extensive scope to the basic level , the party is making constant efforts to strengthen and perfect the country 's socialist democratic system .  
This is a major and effective move which is adopted on the basis of both China 's national conditions and its practical situation , and which aims to speed up the process of socialist democracy .  From the agrarian reform to the introduction of a household-based contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output and from the election of people 's deputies to the introduction of villagers ' self-rule , all have given an expression to the democratic practice that is being carried out by millions upon millions of people under the leadership of the party .  
Zhang Deguang said : Over more than 20 years since the beginning of reform and opening up , the building of a democratic legal system has been strengthened constantly in our country , which has promoted the establishment of a socialist market economic system .  The thinking of governing the country by law has won support from the people .  
The idea that " the Han nationality is inseparable from the minority nationalities and vice versa " is deeply etched in the public psychology .  A new type of socialist inter-nationality relations that is based on equality , unity , and mutual aid has been developed .  We have begun to take bold strides toward common prosperity .  
In the new year , the Supreme People 's Court and the Supreme People 's Procuratorate should orient their work to the general tasks of the party and the state , aim at maintaining social stability and promoting economic construction , persistently uphold judicial fairness , harshly punish criminal offenders and corrupt elements , and provide effective judicial guarantees and legal services for reform , opening up , and the development of the socialist market economy .  
Luo Gan said : The Chinese party and government have always attached great importance to developing good neighborliness , friendship , and all-round cooperation with Vietnam , regarding the development of friendly and cooperative relations between the two parties and two countries as not only the demand for invigorating the Chinese national economy and promoting reform and the socialist modernization drive , but also the demand for maintaining regional peace and the peace of the world at large and advancing the cause of human progress .  
China 's current economic foundation has been transformed from a traditional planned economy into a socialist market economy .  Should its upper level not change ?  
In accordance with the requirement of developing the socialist market economy and the principle of making financial authority correspond to administrative authority , it is necessary to rationally divide the financial authority and administrative authority of governments at all levels , enhance their functions of financial redistribution , improve the method of using central revenue to subsidize local expenditures , and gradually establish a standardized system of fiscal transfers of payments and improve the fiscal system .  
Economic restructuring was further deepened , phased results were attained in the state enterprise reform , the basic role played by the market mechanism in the allocation of resources was notably strengthened , the government 's economic control and regulation system was further reinforced , and a socialist market economic structure took its initial shape .  
Promoting comprehensive economic and social development , properly building the material and spiritual civilizations , making efforts to promote the coordinated development of the urban and rural areas and of different regions , keeping economic development , population , resources , and the environment in line , and bringing about sustainable economic and social development are the essential requirements of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , are important expression of our party 's " three represents " thinking , and are also the direction for the process of socialist modernization which we must firmly grasp .  
We should pay attention to properly doing ideological and political work aiming at achieving specific purposes , step up publicizing relevant policies , and strengthen education in the rule of law .  Based on the principle of making prevention the primary means , persuasion through education , handling problems according to law , and preventing intensification of contradictions , we should use economic , educational , and legal means to properly deal with all kinds of contradictions in order to ensure that reform and opening up and socialist modernization are carried out smoothly .  
This session held aloft the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , upheld the party 's basic line , comprehensively implemented the spirit of the 15th Party Congress and the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee , and discussed the major strategic , macro , and policy issues facing China in entering a new stage of development in comprehensively building a comfortably well-off society and speeding up socialist modernization .  
In addition , it is imperative to keep to and make perfect the regional autonomous system for ethnic minorities so as to develop the socialist relations among different ethnic groups marked by equality , unity , and mutual assistance and enable them to achieve common prosperity and progress .  
The session called on the people of all ethnic groups in the country to rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , uphold the party 's basic line , use the important " three represents " thinking as a guidance , explore ways to advance , do solid work , and strive with one mind to implement the 10th Five-Year Plan and build China into a prosperous , democratic , and civilized socialist modern country !  
The session maintains that , in the new year , the Supreme People 's Court should , in light of the requirements set for managing the country by the law and building a socialist country ruled by the law , comprehensively strengthen all its adjudicative and executive efforts , censure all forms of crime by the law , and intensify its efforts in examining civil , commercial and administrative cases with the purpose to resolve various social problems .  
make major progress in the introduction of modern enterprise system among state enterprises , develop the social security system into a relatively sound shape , gradually perfect the socialist market economic system , and roll out the opening up process and international cooperation ;  
Looking ahead , we have now finished drawing our blueprint : to double the 2000 GDP by 2010 , make more affluent the people living in moderate prosperity , and form a relatively complete and sound socialist market economic system ;  
In the arrangement of contents , every effort has been made to reflect the requirements of the socialist market economy , and highlight its strategic , macroeconomic , and policy-related character , the spheres where the government should play a principal role , the major issues that have a bearing on the overall situation of the immediate and long-term development , the new domains and new tasks of economic and social development , as well as its operability .  
As reform deepens , although government departments which have many years of planned economic traditions have improved the way the government operates in many aspects and unceasingly moved forward to a market economy , their behaviors still have the color of " examination and approval economy . "  The existing examination and approval system has increasingly not fitted in with the needs of socialist market economy .  
Legal circles have different methods for demarcating the legal departments , and the Standing Committee will initially divide the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics into seven legal departments in line with the actual requirements of legislative work ; these departments are the constitution and related laws , civil and commercial law , administrative law , economic law , social law , criminal law , and procedural and non-procedural law .  
The 10th Five-Year Plan period will be an important period for improving the socialist market economic system , and one of the important tasks will be to further open the market and develop a national integrated market system that is standardized , encourages fair competition , and operates in an orderly way and to continuously increase the marketization of the national economy .  
Under the principle of " One Country , Two Systems " , the socialist system and policies are not practiced in Hong Kong , and the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged .  The HKSAR enjoys executive , legislative and independent judicial power , including that of final adjudication .  
The Basic Law particularly provides that the socialist system and policies shall not be practised in Hong Kong and the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged ; the social and economic systems , the system for safeguarding the fundamental rights and freedoms of its residents , the executive , legislative and judicial systems and the relevant policies shall be based on the provisions of the Basic Law .  
" One Country , Two Systems " is an innovative concept , originated in China , designed by men of vision , courage and consummate wisdom .  It has made possible the peaceful resolution of problem left over from history concerning sovereignty , life style and constitutional institutions .  It has enabled two different systems , one capitalist and the other socialist , to co-exist within one country .  
Although the political gulf between family members was perhaps not as wide as it had been in previous decades , he was worried that a scholar like himself might not have what it took to do a good job as principal after a lifetime of operating within a socialist system and enjoying powerful political backing .  
The combined population of countries running socialist economies either now or in the past comes to over 3 billion , or 44% of the world 's total population . The major socialist economies include mainland China ( 1.2 billion ) , India ( 1 billion ) , and the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe ( 0.3 billion ) . Since the collapse of socialism , the massive labor pool of these nations has gradually been incorporated into the global capitalist economy .  
once the draft amendments are adopted , wang said , the state should strengthen legislation , especially enacting and improving laws governing reform and opening up , macro economic control and micro economic behavior , with a view to promoting establishment of the legal system suited to socialist market economy  
" the goal of this revolution is to further liberate and develop the productive forces , and to turn our underdeveloped socialist country into a prosperous , strong , democratic , culturally advanced and modern socialist country , and that will demonstrate the superiority of socialism in china , " jiang said  
chen minzhang , minister of public health , said that in the process of shifting the traditional planned economy to the socialist market economy , it is of major and realistic significance to discuss policies on health protection during the economic restructuring  
rong said that in tandem with the development of the enterprises ' joint stock transformation , a major part of china 's efforts to establish the socialist market economic system , more and more chinese enterprises will be listed on overseas bourses  
Zambia adopted market liberalization and private sector development as an integral part of its economic reform programme , in moving away from its past socialist development strategy , which had been dominated by a rigid , inefficient centralized state sector .  
In accordance with the fundamental principle that the least developed countries are primarily responsible for formulating and implementing growth and development policies , the Government of Myanmar had introduced far-reaching economic reforms , replacing the centrally planned socialist system with a market-oriented economic system , and a series of follow-up economic measures including reversal of price controls and subsidies , liberalization of domestic and foreign trade , reduction in the general level of taxation and opening up of border trade with neighbouring countries . 
Following the demise of the Soviet Union and the socialist bloc , which laid the foundations for undisputed hegemony , the United States , with the constant support of its western allies , began an unrestrained race to transform the Security Council into a kind of supreme universal tribunal for passing judgement on any country that disobeyed its designs and for using troops assembled under the flag of the United Nations as a planet-wide police force . 
Maintenance of " old habits " is reinforced , in addition to spiritual and cultural traditions , through a low level of social and geographical mobility , strong social control exerted by communities and - paradoxically - the socialist system enforcing uniformity in society .  
The central collective leadership , with President Jiang Zemin at its core , will lead the Chinese people in carrying forward the behest of Mr . Deng Xiaoping , advancing the great cause pioneered by him : building China into a prosperous , democratic and civilized socialist country , and developing friendly relations of cooperation with all countries in the world , thus making more , and greater , contributions to peace , development and the progress of mankind .  
This is both a theoretical and political challenge as these rights were formulated in a context that was totally different economically and above all politically : the post-war period , the cold war , the existence of a socialist bloc and of competitive capitalism based on strong nation states .  
The same year , the annual party congress of FRELIMO decided to adopt the classical Soviet model for the organization and development of the country , and the Government developed close links with communist and socialist countries .  
Then , at the most critical and difficult time in our history , when the Soviet Union and the socialist bloc collapsed and the country was deprived of the fundamental markets and sources of supplies it could count on to withstand the ferocious economic warfare waged against an island located only 90 miles from the United States coast , that country decided to act more ruthlessly still against Cuba : the blockade was intensified to the maximum , in a case of truly vulgar and repugnant opportunism .  
Although difficulties and serious challenges still lie ahead , we are confident and capable of overcoming the difficulties , rising to the challenges and forging ahead with every aspect of the socialist cause of building a strong , prosperous , democratic and culturally advanced country .  
This new development , and the co-evolution that resulted between the two families of historical national economies the capitalist and the socialist deeply influenced and modified the three other dimensions ( intellectual , political and normative ) of socialism inherited from the previous century .  
Most tenets of the classical socialist system were gradually qualified for practical and theoretical reasons ( Kornai , 1992 ) , and advanced economic reforms reduced the contrast with the capitalist system .  
The creation of socialist systems appeared as a gigantic experiment in organizational and institutional innovation that met with significant initial success in achieving some important development targets set by communist regimes ( other objectives , like consumption increases or popular participation having early been deliberately sacrificed or postponed ) .  
Among general lessons is the importance of historical and contemporary diversity of national economic systems and trajectories within each great systemic family , and in the process of shifting from the socialist to the capitalist family ( Chavance and Magnin , 1998 ) .  
At the most critical and difficult time in our history , when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the socialist bloc collapsed , and with them the basic markets and sources of supply that the country could count on to withstand the ferocious economic warfare waged against an island only 90 miles from the United States coast , they decided to be yet more unyielding in their approach to Cuba : with truly vulgar and repugnant opportunism , the blockade was intensified to the maximum .  
Given this situation , which was strange to say the least , the Front Populaire Ivoirien ( FPI , socialist opposition ) candidate , Mr . Laurent Gbagbo , who , like many of his fellow citizens , interpreted this unexplained silence as a manoeuvre on the part of the chief of the ruling junta , appealed to him and , in an effort to spare the Ivorian people a fate similar to that of Yugoslavia , urged him not to thwart the democratic process .  
He said that next year 's main tasks of economic system reform will be : maintaining the direction of socialist market economy reform , further adjusting and perfecting ownership structures ; accelerating the pace of creating a modern enterprise system for state-owned enterprises , vigorously promoting strategic reform of the state owned economy ; accelerating restructuring , to appropriately arrange placement for extraneous personnel leaving posts , implementing re-employment projects ; deepening financial system reforms , continuing to strengthen and improve macroscopic control ;  
He said China was in a critical period of building up a socialist market economy system and increasing the pace of its modernization build-up , but a huge , overwhelming growth in population was still restraining the social and economic development , affecting the further improvement of the living standard of the people , and has also brought about heavy pressure on the natural resources and the natural environment .  
We are firmly convinced that under the leadership of the CPC , with the support of the people across the country , and giving full play to the superiority of the socialist system , the cadres and people in the western region will certainly be able to use their wisdom and exert themselves to build a prosperous homeland with social progress , a stable life , national unity , and beautiful rivers and mountains .  
On a foundation of extensive development of S &amp; T training for troops , the Military Region in an organized way guided units to be active in probing for , researching , and discussing the demands of local war under high-tech conditions , the effect of the development of the socialist market economy on the driving force of training of officers and soldiers , what difficulties remained in training itself , and other issues , and to find corresponding countermeasures and methods .  
establish an education structure that is compatible with the socialist market economic structure and the inherent law of education and that integrates different types of education .  This will create an unprecedentedly relaxed macroenvironment and effective condition for the implementation of policies and measures designed to provide opportunities for those leaving schools to pursue advanced studies and for " burden reduction . "  
They are in the prime of life , have received a relatively high level of education , are relatively active in thinking , dare to forge ahead in a pioneering spirit , and have done much hard work to implement the party 's line and central policy-decisions , and to promote socialist modernization .  However , it is also necessary to be aware that some clear weak points and shortcomings also exist among some cadres at this level .  
The CPC Central Commission for Guiding the Spiritual Civilization Building held its seventh plenary session today to study the gist of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important directive on strengthening and improving the ideological and political work , and to make work arrangements for further reinforcing the building of socialist spiritual civilization and for earnestly grasping the party 's ideological and political work under the present new situation .  
It is necessary to enable the broad masses of cadres and people to fully understand the superiority of the party 's correct leadership and the socialist system , which can concentrate efforts on doing big things , and to fully understand that the correct line , principles and policies for reform , opening up and modernization formulated by our party under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping are the fundamental guarantee to bringing about rapid economic and social development in our country .  
Since our party represents the direction of the development of the advanced culture , all comrades of the party must always take Marxism as the guidance , strive to inherit and develop all fine cultural traditions of the Chinese nation , and strive to learn from and absorb all outstanding cultural achievements of foreign countries in order to continuously create and promote the socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , enable the coordinated development of the socialist material and spiritual civilization , and enable comprehensive progress of the society .  
The Ninth National People 's Congress [ NPC ] and its Standing Committee have continuously strengthened the legislative work over the past year , with a total of 33 draft laws examined and 24 of them approved .  The annual target of legislative work was thus achieved , and the endeavor of initially forming a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics during this term was moved forward .  
Just as an article published recently by " Renmin Ribao " stated , quickening China 's " entry into WTO " negotiations and enabling China to accede to WTO on an earlier date is at once a natural choice for China in developing a socialist market economy and a need for China in furthering her reform and opening up .  
Since the founding of new China , the party and government have attached great importance to developing the people 's education and devoted great efforts to it ; there have been tremendous developments in China 's education and large numbers of outstanding talented people have been trained for socialist construction .  
constitutes a fundamental guiding ideology for China 's educational reform and development under the historical conditions of socialist market economic development , reform , and opening up ; serves as a guide to action for deepening educational reform and promoting quality education in an all-around manner ; and has great , practical significance as a guide as well as far-reaching historical significance .  
General Secretary Jiang Zemin sent a letter to the National Conference on Popularizing Science , pointing out : We must strengthen in real earnest the work of popularizing science by taking it as an important task aimed at implementing the strategy of " national rejuvenation through science and education " and as an important content of socialist spiritual civilization building ; should energetically popularize scientific knowledge in the whole society ; and should advocate the spirit of science ; publicize scientific thinking ; and disseminate scientific measures ;  
The CPPCC is an organization of the Chinese people 's patriotic united front , with the most extensive representation organizationally and the greatest accommodation politically .  It is an important organization for realizing the political system of multi-party cooperation and political consultations under the leadership of the CPC , as well as an important form of socialist democratic politics which conforms with the Chinese national conditions and serves the fundamental interests of the people .  
Fourth , all localities in Guangdong must constantly enhance the ideological and ethical qualities , as well as the scientific and cultural qualities , of the people ; strengthen the building of a socialist spiritual civilization ; and bring about a well-coordinated economic and social development .  
Faced with an international and domestic situation that is undergoing profound changes and a glorious and arduous mission , the deputies will be thoroughly studying major issues of overall and strategic significance in reform , opening up and socialist modernization and will be reviewing important policies and arrangements for work in the coming year .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's remarks have , from a high plane of historical materialism , revealed the fundamental nature of our party ; pointed out the party 's basic tasks ; and are of an important theoretical and practical significance to our efforts to further maintain the advancement of the party , retain the vigor and vitality of the party , lead the whole party and the people of the entire country to carry out struggles in unity , and build our country into a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized modern socialist power .  
The historical experiences gained by our party in leading the socialist cause have proved , from both the positive and negative aspects , that whenever the party represents the development demands of advanced productive forces , our cause will flourish and grow ;  
Without concentrating our energy , we can neither accelerate development nor bring true its advancedment and since the productive forces of our country never experienced a full development under capitalist conditions , we must complete , under socialist conditions , the task of industrialization and economic socialization , marketization , and modernization which advanced countries will complete under capitalist conditions .  
In furthering socialist democratic political construction , the current NPC and its standing committee revised the Village Committee Organization Law , and formulated and adopted the Law on Administrative Appeals . With these and the Administrative Litigation Law , Administrative Punishment Law , Administrative Supervision Law , and State Compensation Law formulated in earlier years , our country has basically established a complete legal system on administrative punishment and relief .  
He said : The important speech delivered by Comrade Jiang Zemin recently on educational issues was not directed at any specific chance occurrences .  It was an exposition of great foresight made in consideration of the destiny of our country , national rejuvenation , the implementation of the strategy for rejuvenating the nation by applying scientific and technological advances and promoting education , and the development of socialist modernization .  
Under the condition of developing a socialist market economy , there is an important question for reality and a theoretical question on strengthening the construction of the Party under the new historical conditions : How can our Party from beginning to end maintain its quality of being the vanguard of the working class , how can our Party better represent the necessities for the development of China advanced productive forces , how can our Party represent the development direction of China advanced cultures and how can our Party represent the broad masses interest  
Only by continuously developing socialist culture and continuously satisfying the masses growing need for spiritual and cultural life can we provide a powerful spiritual drive and guarantee the development of productive forces .  
From now until the first 10 years of the next century , in order to establish a relatively perfect socialist market economic system and maintain the continuous , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy , we must solve major strategic problems that have comprehensive and long-term significance to economic development .  
So , the " accession to the WTO " will not only be conducive to rejuvenating and benefiting the labor-intensive industries with strong international competitiveness but it will also be conducive to quickening the readjustment of the capital - and technology-intensive industries and enabling them to grow up at an early date .  Besides , the WTO entry will also be able to help normalize convoluted pricing signals and quicken the setup and improvement of the socialist market economic system .  
In his report Li Peng also discussed the main tasks for this year and next in better relying on the people 's deputies to do a good job in Standing Committee work , unfolding thorough and protracted education in socialist democracy and legal system , further developing a new situation in exchanges and cooperation with foreign and international parliaments and assemblies , and continuing to step up the building of the Standing Committee itself .  
Some delegates indicated : During the current building of a spiritual civilization , the trend of promoting material progress to the neglect of cultural and ideological progress has yet to be checked permanently , and a major factor leading to such a situation is that the related legislation work remains relatively weak ; in view of such a problem , we ought to vigorously strengthen the legislation concerning the building of a socialist spiritual civilization .  
the building of socialist spiritual civilization and of democracy and legal system was further intensified ; and social stability was maintained .  These achievements are the results of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core taking charge of the overall situation and providing correct leadership , and the results of all levels throughout the country implementing the central policy decision on expanding domestic demand and the series of guidelines and policies , and working hard with concerted efforts .  
Departments of spiritual promotion and cultural education must organize and guide a large batch of artistic workers and scientific promotion workers to go deep into the frontline of the socialist reform and modernization construction .  They should absorb nourishment and find materials there , create high-quality spiritual products and meet people 's demand for improving their quality of spiritual civilization .  
From instituting the household contract responsibility system to the establishment of coastal special economic zones , from planned economy to socialist market economy , and from the initial stage of socialism to the idea of " benefiting three things " - - every one of this series of reforms drawing forward the overall situation is attributable to guidance by the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts .  
Many deputies and committee members said that in the course of reform , opening up , and establishing a socialist market economy system , pluralistic trends have emerged in economic components and interests , ways of social life , and social organizational forms ; high technology has developed rapidly , new changes have occurred in people 's ideological concepts and value orientation , there are more social hot spots and difficult points , all kinds of ideas and cultures stir each other , and certain new situations and problems have arisen in social life .  
The members generally held that the report has provided fewer figures but more experiences and fewer stereotyped or empty remarks but more professional terminology and not only looks much more like a government work report under the socialist market economic conditions but has also forcefully borne out that ours is a pragmatic , competent , and vigorous government .  
Practice over the past 21 years has proved that the policy of " the whole society engaging in afforestation and the whole nation committed to turning the country green " has brought into play the superiority of the socialist system and suits the actual condition of our country , which is faced with an arduous task of ecological building but lacks capital .  It has also significantly increased people 's awareness of the need to keep the country green .  
In socialist construction , areas inhabited by minority nationalities in our country have scored achievements attracting worldwide attention .  Owing to the limitations of natural conditions and for historical reasons , however , there is still a certain gap between the minority-nationality regions and the more developed inland and eastern coastal areas in the levels of economic and cultural development .  
2 .  Article Three of General Work Principles shall be amended as " The national committee and local committees of CPPCC shall implement the strategy of running the country in accordance with the law ; publicize and enforce ( carry out ) the constitution , laws , and various principles and policies of the state ; and mobilize social forces to actively take part in the cause of building material civilization and socialist spiritual civilization ( assist the state organs in cracking down on criminal activities aimed at sabotaging socialism in economic field and other fields ) . "  
This has been a democratic , pragmatic , united , and inspiring meeting , which made due contribution to the comprehensive fulfillment of the goals set by the party and by the state for this year and to the promotion of the magnificent cause of socialist modernization construction .  
The purpose of formulating a relatively complete civil code on the basis of the existing single-item laws being relatively perfect is to better meet the needs for the development of a socialist market economy and further protect the legitimate rights and interests of citizens and legal persons .  
The most crucial issue in socialist modern commercial construction is to proceed from the ideology of serving the people whole-heartedly , use modern means to meet consumer demand to the greatest extent , sell genuine goods at reasonable prices , and practice fair transactions , thereby giving enterprises the greatest economic returns .  
In the deliberation held by the Yunnan delegation , Deputy Pang Xijun maintains that this year is the final year for China to achieve the second stage of strategic objectives for socialist modernization in a comprehensive way , and the large-scale development of West China also provides the entire country with an opportunity for new economic development , which is unprecedented in history .  
Particularly in light of the characteristics in Guangxi where multi-ethnic groups live in compact communities , he pointed out that Guangxi will firmly seize the opportunity of the western development , further solidify the new-type socialist national relationship of equality , solidarity , and mutual assistance , open up a new era of national unity and progress , and create prerequisites for the economic takeoff in the entire autonomous region .  
And it is being unfolded at a time when various contradictions in reforms and construction are interwoven ; a structure , mechanism , legal system , and management system that meet the demands of the development of socialist market economy await gradual establishment and perfection ; and numerous negative corruption phenomena are prone to occur .  
the vanguard zones of the socialist market economic structure ; and the demonstration zones of sustainable development , which will take the lead in achieving modernization characterized by basically prosperous economy , optimum structure , perfect facilities , beautiful environment , integrated urban and rural areas , sound legal system , and civilized society .  
to ensure the implementation of the party 's basic line and basic policies systematically and legally ; to ensure the party will always give play to the leading and central role of controlling overall situation and of coordinating all interests .  To develop socialist democratic politics , there is a need to persist in the four cardinal principles , in the national policy of the people 's democratic dictatorship , and in the political body of the national people 's congress system .  
Both domestic and foreign hostile forces do not want to see the development of a strong , prosperous , and stable socialist China . They hope for chaos in China . They are constantly trying to " westernize " and " divide " China so as to achieve change amid chaos and to fish in troubled waters .  
At the same time when we uphold economic construction as the central task , we must also make earnest efforts to step up the building of a socialist spiritual civilization ; and must bring about a comprehensive progress to both the material productive forces of our society and the ideology , ethics , and culture of our society .  The position of economic construction as a central task should remain unshaken at all times ;  
At a time when we are about to finish the first two steps , the party 's leading collective of the third generation has made the third-step strategic goals more specific , drawn up a new program , and clearly defined the goals of the new " three-step " strategy .  This will help people throughout the country to maintain their fighting spirit and to firmly , steadily , and in a down-to-earth manner , stride toward the grand goal of building China into a modern socialist country .  
By the middle of the next century , when the Chinese nation reaches the level of an intermediately developed nation with its own hard work , a wealthy , strong , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist China will stand tall in the East !  
ensure sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development ; truly step up building of socialist spiritual civilization and of democracy and a legal system ; and endeavor to accomplish all tasks set forth by the current NPC session .  
The important speech given by President Jiang at the Plenary Session of the PLA Representative Troops fully affirms the achievements made by the military and armed police troops and raises clear requirements for comprehensively promoting the construction of military modernization .  The speech emphasizes that the military must further clearly understand the historical mission it shoulders and provide firm and strong assurance of security for protecting the country 's sovereignty , unity and security , for protecting the people 's labor under peaceful conditions and for reform , opening up and the construction of socialist modernization .  
Only when we continuously develop socialist culture and improve socialist spiritual civilization continuously can we provide a powerful spiritual dynamic force and intellectual support to economic development and overall social progress and can we continuously meet the increasingly growing spiritual and cultural needs of the people .  
The main reason why the United States produces an annual country report on human rights practices , heedless of the strong opposition of other countries , assumes the air of a " judge of human rights , " and insists on interfering in affairs under the jurisdiction of other countries is mainly to use this as a pretext for putting political pressure on other countries , especially developing and socialist countries , in a bid to change their political and social systems .  
Zeng Peiyan said : In the 21st century , China 's targets are to double the 2000 GNP by 2010 to make the people 's comparatively well-off lives even more prosperous and form a relatively complete socialist market economic system and to bring the per capita GDP to the level of an average developing country and basically achieve modernization by the middle of the century to successfully build a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist country . 
The strategic shift of the Party 's work focuses , the eventual affirmation of the basic line for the primary stage of socialism , the steady advancement of reform and opening up , and the gradual establishment of a system of socialist market economy have laid a firm but fully energetic and vigorous systematic basis for pushing forward the development of social productive forces and increasing the levels of the overall national strength and the material and cultural life of the masses of people .  
After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the second-generation collective leadership with Deng Xiaoping as the core carried forward and developed the thought of Mao Zedong on cultural building .  In order to meet the new needs of reform and opening up and socialist modernization building , they put forth and constantly developed our party 's thinking about the building of socialist spiritual civilization .  
Only by truly fulfilling the " three represents " can the party lead the people in developing social productive forces , flourishing socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , and constantly improving the material and cultural life of the masses of people .  
Only by developing productive forces and flourishing socialist culture can we provide powerful material and spiritual bases for realizing the fundamental interests of the masses of people .  
To carry out personal quality education is to rectify such one-sided understandings and practices , so as to train " idealistic , moral , educated , and disciplined " socialist builders and successors who are comprehensively developed ethically , intellectually , physically , and aesthetically .  
The ideal and belief education should be taken as a key point of in-depth education in Deng Xiaoping Theory . Through such education , people should profoundly understand that communism and socialism is a just , inevitable , and arduous cause , understand that the cause of communism and socialism is noble and beautiful .  The people should be guided to integrate their personal values with socialist values and integrate the lofty ideal with the objectives of the struggle in the current stage , and dedicate themselves to the common ideal of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
After this five-year plan is fulfilled , with the efforts of five more years , that is , by the year 2010 , we will establish a sound and perfect socialist market economic structure , and will further double the value of the gross national output on the basis of the 2000 figure , thus further enhancing the people 's living standards .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , especially since the Democratic Reform , the people of all ethnic groups on this snow plateau have been living in harmony and sharing weal and woe with one another .  They have gradually formed a socialist ethnic relationship marked by equality , unity , and mutual assistance .  Reform and opening-up have increased economic and technological exchanges between the Tibetans and the people of other ethnic groups , thereby enhancing their solidarity .  
and a fundamental change to the outlook of the western region entails the persevering and indomitable efforts of several generations .  They should persistently proceed their work from the reality , draw up an overall plan for the work , suit their measures to local conditions , give a better play to local advantages , strive for practical results , and work hard to open up a new road for the region 's large-scale exploration and development that suits both the special features of the western region and the needs of a socialist market economic system .  
In our country , now tourism has been moving onto the path of comprehensive development with three major market sectors , namely , tourism for people entering the Chinese mainland , domestic tourism , and tourism for domestic people traveling abroad , and now tourism is a large-scale industry with a huge market and great output value .  Tourism is playing a more and more important role in the national economy , and is producing positive influence for the enhancement of national quality and the development of the socialist spiritual civilization .  
The conferences conscientiously reviewed and summed up the work practice and main experience of the people of our country in prevailing over difficulties and overcoming risks under a complicated domestic and international environment and in continuing to advance the cause of reform , opening , and socialist modernization construction , and the two conferences also planned and assigned important work tasks for the country for the last year of this century .  
To implement the spirit of the two conferences , it is necessary to work hard to successfully carry out the construction of socialist politics and culture and to advance coordinated economic and social development , under the precondition of being dictated by and serving the center , that is , economic construction .  
The " Honest Government Standards " formulated and implemented by the Party during the past few years have not only regulated political behavior for leading Party and government cadres under the socialist market economy , they also have advanced construction and development of the market economic system .  
It is hoped that leading cadres at all levels and comrades in the scientific and technological circles would further unify understanding , clearly identify their target , make joint efforts to promote the innovation of knowledge , and raise our basic research work to a new level in order to add brilliance to the world treasure-house of science and make greater contributions to China 's socialist modernization .  
Fourth , it is necessary to further improve the body of public security laws and regulations and comprehensively push forward the codification of public security work into the legal system and the building of the police force .  The 15th national party congress put forward the objectives and requirements for establishing and improving the socialist legal system .  It is necessary to go by these objectives and requirements and cater to the practical needs of public security work , making timely adjustments to the plans for , and pace of , public security legislative work ;  
The above-mentioned " Opinion " points out : Over the past five decades following the founding of New China , especially since the start of reform and opening-up , the social welfare work in this country has made considerable progress and played a positive role in building the socialist material and spiritual civilizations .  As far as our old-age population is concerned , however , we have a large base figure , and the number of old people is still increasing at a rapid pace .  
They should establish as soon as possible a new dynamic social welfare administrative system and a lively operating mechanism in line with the requirements of the socialist market economy .  In addition , they should deeply reform the present social welfare organizations formed by the state and collectives , explore new ways to socialize the administration of social welfare , and see to it that all social welfare organizations are operating on their own , responsible for their own profits and losses , and marching on the road of self-development .  
On the basis of its comprehensive analysis of the current international and domestic situation , the party central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core requires that the party 's ideological and political work be done intensively and effectively , and takes this as an urgent strategic task related to the general situation of socialist reform and construction in our country for the whole party and the entire people of the whole nation .  
The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee decided to shift the focus of the party 's work onto economic development .  This correctly grasped the main contradiction in the initial stage of socialism , and was a significant political decision on fulfilling the party 's historical mission and building ours into a powerful socialist country .  
Only by correctly understanding and handling the relationship between the economy and politics can we make comprehensive development in the economic , political , ideological and cultural fields , and build ours into a wealthy , strong socialist modern country with democracy and a high degree of civilization .  
Deng Xiaoping also called for fostering new people with " a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good educational background , and a strong sense of discipline " and took this as the fundamental objective of developing socialist spiritual civilization .  He also stressed that ideals and the sense of discipline are the most important among all the four criteria .  
In order to actively promote the reform of the budget management system , establish a budget management system that fits the system of the socialist market economy , and bring about a scientific , institutionalized , and standardized system of budget management , as well as enhance the efficiency of using financial fund , the Ministry of Finance has decided to launch the work of reappraising fixed assets and circulating funds in 2000 for the administrative institutions and organizations under the jurisdiction of the central budget .  
Jiang Zemin indicated : Both China and Vietnam are socialist countries under the leadership of the communist party .  In the face of the present complicated and changeable international situation , we two countries should seize the current favorable opportunity , meet the challenges head-on , step up cooperation , and strive for common development .  
The tremendous achievements in economic and social development , which have been attained in the past 20 years by Shenzhen , the special economic zone personally founded by Deng Xiaoping and formed with the painstaking efforts of the second and third generations of the leading collectives of the party 's central committee , are the powerful evidence of our party 's endeavor to act as the " Three Represents " in the new period , and have laid the solid foundation for Shenzhen to take the lead in basically realizing socialist modernization .  
To properly act as the representative of the direction of the advanced culture in China , the key is to adhere to the principle of " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to both , " further advance the socialist cultural and ethic progress , and work hard to build and create the national , scientific , and popular socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , which is geared to the needs of modernization , the world , and the future .  
The tremendous achievements in economic and social development , which have been attained in the past 20 years by Shenzhen , the special economic zone personally founded by Deng Xiaoping and formed with the painstaking efforts of the second and third generations of the leading collectives of the party 's central committee , are the powerful evidence of our party 's endeavor to act as the " Three Represents " in the new period , and have laid the solid foundation for Shenzhen to take the lead in basically realizing socialist modernization .  
We will certainly live up to the earnest expectations of the party 's central committee .  In accordance with the requirements of the " Three Represents , " we will strengthen the party building in a comprehensive way , lead the people of the entire city to summon up all their courage and energy , forge ahead in a pioneering spirit , and work hard to build Shenzhen into a socialist demonstration city bearing Chinese characteristics and taking the lead in basically realizing modernization .  
to insure that all could , on a basis of their own initiative , learn revolutionary theories , guard and fight against the corrosion of corrupt ideology and culture , persistently struggle against schools of reactionary ideological trends , against idealistic and pseudoscientific ideologies ; that all should take in fact the Marxist world outlook , outlook on life , values , and take the initiative in socialist cultural civilization construction ;  
In particular , the eastern coastal areas should make efforts to establish the socialist market economy before other areas , realize the goal for the reform and development of the state-owned enterprises before other areas , complete the readjustment of the economic structure , and optimize and upgrade the industry before other areas , and realize basic agricultural modernization before other areas .  In short , they should work hard to realize modernization before other areas and make greater contribution to building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Our experience for more than 20 years has proved that these measures and actions in afforestation and improving the environment conform to the reality that our country faces arduous tasks in environmental construction and lacks funds .  Through these measures and actions , the socialist system 's advantages are given full play , and at the same time , people from around the whole country have a heightened awareness of the need for afforestation .  These measures and actions are a lively implementation of patriotism and are worthy of our careful summing up and further perfecting and developing .  
He pointed out : To promote socialization of social welfare is an inevitable requirement of the socialist market economy system ; a measure to meet the challenge of aging of the population , to meet the urgent need of speeding up the establishment and improvement of a senior citizens ' welfare service system , and to meet the objective demand of the progress of modernization and particularly urbanization ; and an effective way to rapidly alleviate the current contradictions between supply and demand in social welfare .  
] China will turn itself into a strong , prosperous , democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country and bring about rejuvenation of the great Chinese nation .  The Chinese people are ready to join all other peace-loving people in the rest of the world in contributing their wisdom and energy to world peace and development and an even brighter future for mankind .  
To turn China into a rich and strong , democratic , civilized modern socialist country through self-reliance and arduous struggles is the ideal shared by all Chinese nationalities in the primary stage of socialism .  
In short , as a result of 20 years of efforts , we have initially established the basic framework of a fiscal and taxation system suited to the demand of developing socialist market economy , and have achieved notable success in fiscal reforms and development .  
China is a socialist country ; it must strive to build strong state finance in order to press forward the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , continually enhance the material and cultural living standards of the people of all nationalities throughout the country , and preserve social stability and state economic and national defense security .  
In order to achieve fundamental changes in the economic setup and the method of economic growth , and embark on a path of coordinated economic and social development with higher speed , better economic returns , and continual improvement of overall quality , it is essential to meet the demands of developing socialist market economy , further deepen the fiscal and taxation reforms , and do a good job in fiscal and taxation work .  
Li Peng said : Since the standing committee was established in each of the local people 's congresses at and above the county level , local people 's congresses , holding legislative powers , and their standing committees have formulated a batch of local laws and regulations .  They have made a positive , catalytic contribution to the consummation of the socialist legal system and to promoting the development of various local causes .  
He said : Following the drastic changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe , the United States and some other Western countries have proceeded from the political need of promoting the Western social system and hegemonism , and therefore are extremely reluctant to see China adhering to the socialist path and extremely reluctant to see China adhere to the independent foreign policy of peace , continuing to develop and becoming big and powerful .  
As a result of over 20 years of reform and development , there has been great improvement of our comprehensive national strength , social productive forces , and people 's living standards ; we have progressed by leaps and bounds in building socialist spiritual civilization , democracy , and legal system ; and the whole world has seen the great vitality and vigor demonstrated by socialism in China .  
In the wake of the deepening of reforms and the development of socialist market economy , economic components and interests , social organizational forms and social ways of life , and jobs and employment methods are becoming more varied by the day , and this inevitably affects people 's ideological concepts and human relations in various ways , and some of these influences are negative ;  
All types of educational institutions at all levels and all educators in the country are shouldering a solemn mission .  They should have a fundamental aim of improving the quality of our nationals , give priority to cultivating the students ' innovativeness and practical abilities , and try hard to bring up developers of and successors to the socialist cause who achieve all-round moral , academic , physical , and artistic development .  
During a recent inspection of work in Liaoning , CPC Political Bureau Standing member and State Council Premier Zhu Rongji stressed that a social security system that is independent from enterprises and institutions is an important cornerstone of a socialist market economy system , and that accelerating the development of such a system is a matter of fundamental importance for deepening reforms , stabilizing society , and running the state well and ensuring national security , so we must do a good job of this important matter which has a bearing on the overall situation . 
Zhu Rongji stated that , only if the entire country makes a concerted effort from top to bottom to establish a better social security system will this difficult but grand undertaking definitely be able to succeed , making it possible for us to promote great advances in the reform of China 's socialist market economy system and lay an even firmer foundation for achieving the great goal of national modernization .  
Therefore , acting in unison of a high degree with the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core is where the fundamental interests of our party and our people lie , and also where the future and the fate of our country and socialism lie .  Everyone who is concerned for the socialist cause and who has a firm ideal and conviction should have such a political consciousness .  
Following Jiang Zemin 's speech , Zhu Rongji said : In his important speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin fully endorsed the important contributions rendered by the national labor models and advanced workers to reform , opening up , and the socialist modernization drive .  He spoke highly of the lofty spirit of the selfless dedication displayed by the national labor model and advanced workers .  He called on all the people to emulate these advanced models and work hard to build China into an affluent , strong , democratic , and civil socialist modern country .  
In short , the economic globalization trend and China 's reform and opening up have provided guarantee that the capital adequacy ratio reaches its standard , which is not only the rule of game for the international banking industry , but also the internal demand for the development of a socialist market economy and the promotion of the healthy growth of the banking industry in China .  
" On the premises that the public ownership persistently holds a dominant position , the national economic lifelines are under the state 's control , and the controlling and competitive power of the state-owned economy is growing strong , a certain reduction in the proportion of the state-owned economy will not affect the socialist nature of China . "  
Party committees and local government at all levels in Guangdong should make efforts to profoundly understand General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important conception of " three represents " in connection with Guangdong 's specific conditions , continue to advance reforms and opening-up , strive to move in the forefront of developing the advanced productive force , and push ahead socialist modernization .  
In the economic field , we are faced with two major topics that should be solved properly .  One is to establish a relatively perfect socialist market economic structure and the other is to maintain the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
Especially since its Third Plenary Meeting of the 11th National People 's Congress , our Party has re-established its ideological lines and has made significant decisions and taken strategic measures like reforms and opening-up policies to meet the development needs of the times.has greatly emancipated and developed the productive forces , accelerated the construction of the socialist material civilization and of the socialist spiritual civilization and has paved a way toward building up socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
To keep to the orientation of the progress of advanced culture , it is necessary to adapt ourselves to the requirements of reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization , to concentrate on improving the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the people across the country , and to unite and mobilize the people of all nationalities throughout the country to build our country into a prosperous , powerful , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist state .  
Since our army is an important force for building the socialist spiritual civilization and an advanced group composed of outstanding young people from all walks of life , it must conscientiously uphold the requirement for the advanced quality in ideological , moral , and cultural construction .  
ensure social stability at the grassroots level , ensure the security of grassroots political power , and ensure normal local economic and social development .  By achieving these we will make new and greater contributions to the acceleration of the development of democracy and the legal system at the grassroots level , to the implementation of the basic strategy of ruling the country by law , and to the accelerated construction of a socialist state ruled by law .  
Given the new condition of opening to the outside world and vigorously developing socialist market economy , leading cadres should , just like a lotus , stick to the revolutionary integrity , keep honest and clean , and always be a loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people so that they can make due contribution to further improving party style , strengthening administrative honesty , and opposing corruption .  
In the new situation of reform and opening-up and developing a socialist market economy , when the historic topic of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " lies ahead , it is both the earnest expectation of the Party and the masses and the objective requirement for implementing our military 's sacred mission to strengthen the military 's ideological and morality construction and to cultivate revolutionary military professions with the " Four Haves " .  
We should sing aloud the " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " to enable these songs that are revolutionary , advanced , healthy and progressive to echo in military camps , to enrich our lives , to inspire our spirit , to serve our strengthening and accelerating our military 's fighting strength , to serve our strengthening and improving ideological and political work , and to serve our constructing a socialist spiritual civilization .  
The Party 's basic lines have embodied in a centralized manner the Party 's nature of being advanced , of reflecting the fundamental interests and wishes of the broad number of the masses , of meeting the requirements for developing the social productive forces in contemporary China , and of powerfully pushing forward the development and the progress of socialist material and spiritual civilization 's construction .  
( VI ) The party 's basic theory , basic line , and basic program , and the brilliant achievements of reform , opening-up , and socialist modernization have enriched the connotation of patriotism , and raised the patriotic feelings of our nation , and aroused the entire people 's patriotic enthusiasm .  Over more than 20 years , our nation enjoyed political stability , economic growth , national unity ;  
The establishment of the socialist system furthers the development of socialized production and also eliminates the root cause of the fundamental antagonism between collective interests and individual interests .  It lays a solid material foundation and provides a fundamental institutional guarantee for the rise of collectivism .  
The Guangzhou Military Region , which is located on the forefront of reform and opening up , has always been carrying out ideological and political work with emphasis on studying and solving new situation and problems under the conditions of reform , opening up and the development of a socialist market economy , on studying and solving main , difficult , hot and doubtful problems faced by various units at present , and on summing up and promoting effective experiences in army building in the new period with good results .  
At present , our country 's socialist modernization construction is right in a critical period .  Restructuring state-owned enterprises , helping the poor and storming heavily fortified positions , completing the " Ninth Five-Year " plan , realizing the objective of comfortably well-off , and a series of important issues in the reform and development all need to be studied and resolved .  
Focusing on and serving this center of economic construction , constantly strengthening and improving the ideological and political work and the building of spiritual civilization to fully display its role of clearing up doubts , remove apprehensions , and inspire spirit can vigorously safeguard and promote the building and development of the socialist material civilization .  
The protracted nature of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that it will take a process of considerably long historical struggle to achieve the grand objective of socialist modernization and it is not plain sailing because many difficulties and problems will crop up in the course of our advance .  
The protracted nature of socialist modernization determines that ideological and political work is a measure of fundamental and lasting importance rather than an expedient measure and it is an indispensable task that should be carried out perseveringly and unremittingly .  
The complexity of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that we are improving and developing the self-reform of the socialist system and the world is undergoing a profound change .  Against this background , people 's thinking has become lively ;  
Only if the Party becomes the requirement for the development of China 's advanced socialist productive force , the forward direction for China 's advanced culture , and the true representative for the basic interests of China 's masses can the Party forever remain in an invincible position , forever have the heartfelt support of each of the country 's nationalities , and continually move forward .  
At present , the world socialist movement has fallen to a low point in its development while profitable relationships are adjusted by deepening the reform .  Furthermore , with the infiltration and the influence of decadent ideas and culture , corruption and other ugly phenomena grow and creep within the Party .  
The most fundamental point is to , in accordance with the requirements of Comrade Jiang Zemin , consistently promote education on patriotism , the collective and socialism and to mobilize all people in the entire country to struggle for the cause of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics and to struggle for building China into a modernized socialist country that is rich , powerful , democratic and civilized .  
Along with the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy and the development of the socialist market economy , and along with the increase in economic and social contradictions and the increase in different ideological and conceptual problems , corruptive ideas and culture can take advantage and build up .  In addition , the remains of feudal ideas , including feudal superstition and ignorant ideas and concepts that have long been in our society , can arise - - as the popular Chinese saying goes , " dregs float to the surface " .  
The ossified " Soviet model " took the experience and development course of socialist construction under a special historical condition as something absolute and sacred without regard to the need to make continuous innovations inside socialism across different stages of development .  As a result , this seriously hindered the development of productivity , made it impossible to improve the people 's living conditions over a long time , and went against the requirements determined by the nature of socialism .  
Our comprehensive national strength has been moved much ahead in the ranking among all countries .  In international affairs , we resolutely oppose hegemonism and power politics , and join hands with all peace-loving nations and peoples .  Our international prestige has been continuously raised , and we are showing a good image as a socialist big country to the whole world .  
Socialist spiritual civilization is being developed more and more effectively , and comprehensive social progress is being made .  The progressive socialist culture with Chinese characteristics is turning into a great mental force rallying the Chinese nation as a whole .  
The surging trend of new technological revolution and the knowledge economy in the world will not only provide a more advanced scientific and technological foundation for the development of socialism , but will also bring about a hidden risk of further widening the gap between the socialist countries with comparatively backward economic and cultural conditions and the developed capitalists countries .  
Thus , we must continue to enhance our national defense strength , and tempered a sharp and powerful " sword " of justice for safeguarding the sovereign and territorial integrity of socialist China and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation .  
[ Zeng ] Following the progress of the economic and political structural reforms , the cadres and personnel system reform has gradually proceeded , developed in an in-depth manner , and yielded great results , during which we have gained rich experience and probed some rules .  These can be summed up in six aspects : We must hold firm to the correct direction that the organization line must serve the political line and correspond with the establishment of the socialist market economic structure and the development of socialist democratic politics ;  
He said : The party 's ideological and political work is the lifeblood of economic and all other work , is the central link for uniting the whole party and the entire people of all ethnical groups throughout the country to fulfill all tasks of the party and the state , and is the major political superiority of our party and socialist state .  
As an organic whole , the concept of the " three represents " has put forward the need for the " elimination of exploitation and polarization " as the basic social problem to be solved during the development of socialist society , which is required by the Marxist ruling party in its strategy for social development .  
cherish the current gratifying reform , opening-up , and modernization situation ; and initiate what is useful to the Internet and do away with the harmful while performing their duties .  Only by so doing will we be able to actually make contributions to the construction of the socialist material and spiritual civilizations and to pioneer a vast , unlimited path for the development of China 's Internet .  
What the hostile western forces want to preserve is the capitalist private ownership system and the political and economic systems , values , and way of life that the bourgeoisie highly esteem , and all this runs counter to the essence of the socialist system under communist party leadership .  
Seeing the situation clearly , mastering the overall situation , correctly distinguishing between the essentials and the nonessentials , and safeguarding and developing the excellent situation in the ideological and political realm is an important guarantee for continuously pushing forward the reform and opening up and the socialist modernization drive as well as a fundamental requirement for shaping and nurturing a national spirit in the new century .  
The conviction of the people in socialism has been transformed into concrete practice for developing economy , improving livelihood , and building a prosperous , powerful , democratic , and civilized socialist country .  
The progress of the socialist materialist civilization and spiritual civilization has been constantly cleansing the outdated ideas and concepts and the advanced ideological and cultural mentalities like independent mentality , innovative mentality , competitive mentality , open-up mentality , and so on as well as those civilized and progressive social concepts like efficiency concept , effectiveness concepts , and so on which can promote the development of social productive forces have gradually gone deeply into the hearts of the people .  
The civilization and progress of the society , the vivid and lively political environment , and especially the socialist democratic and political life created and developed by the people under the leadership of the party have made people 's minds greatly tempered and increasingly mature .  
The most important and most profound experience in Shenzhen 's ultra-high-speed development was its conforming to the requirements for establishing a socialist market economic system , timely reform of the system of government , reform of the administrative system , change in the function of government , and strides towards the establishment of a clean and highly efficient government .  
Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core and through the joint efforts of the people of all nationalities of the whole country , the main tasks put forth in the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan will be accomplished on time , national economic and social developments have attained great achievements , the second-step strategic objective for the socialist modernization construction has been comprehensively realized , and the social productive forces have entered a new stage .  
This system played a positive role at one time , but because people were subject to dogmatism and their minds were ossified and because no prompt reform was carried out to suit the changed situation , the system gradually lost its vitality and became a fetter for socialist enthusiasm as well as an obstacle to the development of socialism .  
At a time when we are deepening the rule of law and vigorously advancing the building of a socialist market economy , the party Central Committee has put forward the magnificent strategic goal of developing the western region on a large scale .  The establishment of this strategic goal has epoch-making significance to economic prosperity and development in China 's western region .  
Ma : Since reform and opening up , while civil air defense work has achieved marked results , as our socialist market economy has intensified , reformed , and developed , civil air defense has grown increasingly unsuited to the needs of the " market " and the " battlefield " , and remains unsuited to the needs of future wars in areas such as rapid response , project construction quality , and recycling and re-supply capacity .  
They felt : In the new century , changes will continue to take place in the international environment and the international political struggle , the practice of socialist reform will develop in depth in our country , and an unprecedentedly complicated situation will appear in the social ideological field .  The diversification of socioeconomic elements , organizational forms , material benefits , and ways of employment will influence officers and men deeply , on all sides , and in a long-term way .  
The Chinese people made arduous exploration for half a century to go through this process .  They achieved major successes , and they had also experienced many twists and turns or even paid high prices before they could basically accomplish at last an organic integration of the universality and particularity of socialism under new historical conditions , and begin to figure out the right path of socialist development that suits China 's national conditions .  
Regarding the major question of how to treat the productive forces and production relations in socialist society , we committed two mistakes : 1 ) we believed that , for the socialist ownership system , the larger the size and the higher the degree of public ownership the better ; and 2 ) over a long time , we did not attach first priority to developing the productive forces .  
On the one hand , we firmly retained many practices that were not socialist ones but restraints to development of the productive forces , or those which were only applicable to certain special historical conditions .  We claimed such practices to be " socialist principles " , but actually they were not .  On the other hand , we mistook for " capitalist practices " many things that were conducive to the development of productive forces under socialist conditions , and so we repudiated them .  
our socialist system is not perfect , the socialist market economic system and socialist legal system are still immature and unsound , while decadent feudal and capitalist ideologies and small-scale production as a force of habit still have widespread influence on society .  To be sure , there are many tasks for us to undertake during the initial stage of socialism .  
The socialist market economic structure is the designated model for the economic structural reform in China , it marks the forsaking of the highly centralized conventional planned economic structure of the past , and it is substantially different from the capitalist market economy .  
In the wake of the development of the economic structural reform and socialist modernization in China , and in view of objective needs , General Secretary Jiang Zemin expressly pointed out during the 15th CPC National Congress : on the premise that the four cardinal principles are upheld , we must continue to forward the reform of the political structure , further expand socialist democracy , develop a sound socialist legal system , rule the country by law , and build a socialist legal state .  
At present and in a longer period to come , the old capitalist system will continue to surround the new socialist system .  The socialist system , which is young and pretty much immature , can only struggle to survive and seek development under the pressure of capitalist countries which are dominating over and enjoying a favorable position of strength within the framework of the old international political and economic order .  
So long as countries like China and Vietnam keep holding high the socialist banner , persist in running their own countries well , constantly increase their national strength , enable their people to get rich , and keep their countries prosperous , they will surely be able to greatly reinforce socialism 's strong image and increase its appeal , thus push the international communist movement toward a new high tide .  
As theoretical workers of socialist countries , we should conscientiously sum up the experience left over by the practice and exploration of socialism in the 20th century .  We should take the summarization of this rich theoretical heritage as our solemn historical mission , make our unique contributions to upholding and developing Marxism , and thus provide a better guidance to practice and exploration of socialism in the 21st century .  
Since the implementation of the " Ninth Five-Year " Plan , we have scored glorious achievements in promoting spiritual civilization , while attaining tremendous successes in developing material civilization .  All this has provided a gigantic spiritual motive force and a strong ideological guarantee for the development of the reform and opening-up program and the socialist modernization drive .  
They have brought into full play the exemplary role of the advanced models well in all fields of social life and among various mass groups .  They have vigorously given full scope to healthy tendencies in society and created a fine general mood to respect the advanced and vie with each other to become the advanced .  They have also given a powerful ideological guarantee and intellectual support to creating a fine atmosphere in society for the development of the reform and opening-up program and the socialist modernization drive .  
It is worth mentioning that the Fifth " Five-Year Plan " period was timed with the Third " Five-Year " campaign launched in China to spread legal knowledge among the citizens , which was held in the course of China 's building a socialist market economic system and under the great backdrop of the party putting forward , at the 15th CPC national congress , the proposal of administering the country according to laws and of building China into a socialist country that is ruled by laws .  
In the long years of revolutionary war and socialist construction , especially at important historical junctures , he firmly supported the party 's correct leadership and steadfastly implemented the party 's line , principles , and policies , demonstrating a Communist 's steadfast faith in communism and noble revolutionary quality .  
The victory in the Qamdo Battle smashed the vain hopes of the imperialists and pro-imperialist forces in Tibet to split the motherland , smoothly opened the door of negotiations , promoted the process of peaceful liberation of Tibet , and laid a foundation for the Tibetan people to shake off the trammels of the feudal serf system and build a new-type socialist national relationship based on equality , unity , and mutual help .  
unswervingly implemented the party 's policy concerning nationalities and religion and the regional national autonomy system ; increasingly consolidated and developed the new-type socialist national relationship based on equality , unity , and mutual help ; and made the dream come true in real terms for the people of all nationalities to exercise their rights according to the law in the political , economic , cultural , and social life .  
our domestic market has huge potential ; the socialist market economic system has taken shape ; the pattern of opening up in all directions is basically established , and all these factors have laid the sound foundation for accelerating development .  
In short , the opportunities globalization provides are objective opportunities , and we must seize these opportunities by participating in the globalization process , especially by joining the WTO , to fully utilize the international and domestic markets and resources , further perfect the socialist market economic system , accelerate the change in the pattern of economic growth and the adjustment of the economic structure , and continuously increase our international competitiveness .  
In conclusion , Yang Chuantang said : The people of various nationalities in Tibet are confident in seizing the historic opportunity brought along by the large-scale development of the western region to speed up development , to narrow the gap between Tibet and fraternal provinces and municipalities , and to fulfill the grand objective of entering the front ranks of China 's drive for socialist modernization , an objective set by Comrade Deng Xiaoping .  
China has preliminarily established the socialist market economic system .  The " Proposal " has not put forward more specific targets .  It only sets a single target of a predictive nature to " double the GDP " by 2010 .  
Now , the initial form of socialist market economy has been established , but the historical mission of social system transition remains to be completed .  For example , some enterprises are still unable to meet the development demands of market economy , the operating mechanism is not active , the capability for technical innovation is not strong ;  
In additional to the meeting between leaders of the highest level of China and the DPRK , our party has continued to maintain high-level contacts with the Vietnamese and the Laos parties .  We also organized two important theoretical discussion activities with the Vietnamese parties , which contributed to improving friendly relations between the ruling parties of the socialist countries .  
Nonetheless , under the conditions of the socialist market economy and along with the gradual deepening of our country 's political or economic structural reform as well as the in-depth development of our army building , our present enlistment system governing officers in active service has turned incompatible with the needs of a new situation or a new task in certain aspects , and it is thereby imperative to replenish or amend the " Regulations " in an appropriate way .  
The times we live in and the prevailing social and historic conditions determine that the Chinese people must take the socialist road if they are to make the country strong and prosperous and make everybody rich .  
However , because his understanding of the laws of socialist construction was insufficient , because of theoretical errors , because of incorrect response to dramatic changes in the international situation , he also committed subjectivist errors , which resulted in the failure of the " great leap forward " and the people 's communes , and , particularly , this finally led to the great political chaos of the " cultural revolution " that was immensely harmful to the cause of socialism in China .  
Our undertaking of reform , opening up and socialist modernization has been pushed forward into a new stage .  In China today , it is a scene of political stability , economic development , national unity , social progress , constantly improving living standard , and prosperity .  
The 20th century saw a series of major events that affected the course of the world history , but what had the greatest impact on the changes in human society and induced the most profound speculations is the transformation of the socialist ideal into practice , from practice into system , from the practice of a single country into the practice of numerous countries , and again from a triumphant march into a tortuous journey .  
Even though the socialist movement experienced grave setbacks , its banner was still flying high above the Earth . These are not random historical phenomena but a vivid embodiment of an objective regularity of social development .  
It has been only 80 years since the time the first socialist state was founded , so most socialist states have a history of 40 or 50 years , which places them at the initial development stage .  Their economic , political , and social working mechanisms have not been completely developed and established , they still strive hard exploring how to fully develop the advantages of socialism .  
Socialism has opened up the way to the solution of the contradiction between the productive forces and relations of production inherent in capitalism , and , while liberating the productive forces of socialist countries to the utmost extent , at the same time objectively promoted the improvement of capitalist system .  Capitalism 's internal contradictions got somewhat smoothed out , and capitalism was given a new opportunity for development ; this , in its turn advanced socialist production and the development and progress of human civilization as a whole .  
This put forward a new topic : on the one hand we need to staunchly adhere to the fundamental principles of socialism put forth by Marx and Engels , on the other hand we need to adopt a scientific attitude to Marx and Engels ' tentative ideas of socialism and , proceeding from the reality of relative economic and cultural backwardness map out a course and policy for socialist construction .  
" Special privilege " mentality , patriarchal style , obsession of hierarchy and other feudal things , in conjunction with the corrosion by decadent capitalist ideas and culture , have inflicted damage on the party building with regard to ideology , organization , and style of work , such that some leading cadres have obscured the nature and purpose of the party , even to the deterioration of the socialist democratic legal system .  
Since the realization of socialism mostly started based on a relatively low level of economic development , in order to satisfy the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the people , we must rapidly transform the backward condition of social productive forces : in a situation where the two systems , socialist and capitalist , coexist , we also need to energetically develop productive forces to give expression to socialism 's superiority .  
In the past five years , this country that is in the midst of advancing socialist modernization not only reined in the unbridled horse of inflation , but also curbed the trend of deflation .  China accomplished the unusual feat of yearly economic growth of eight percent accompanied by improvement of quality and efficiency of economic growth .  
However , China 's current legal system is yet to be refined .  According to the guideline set by the 15th CPC National Congress , by 2010 , China should establish a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics .  As such , legislation is still an arduous task lying ahead for people 's congresses at all levels and their standing committees .  
Holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping theory , continuing to step up the building of democracy and the legal system , and building China into a country ruled by law having a high degree of socialist democracy and a sound socialist legal system , are an important assurance for the Chinese nation to realize the grand goal of rejuvenation , as well as an important contribution of the Chinese nation to mankind 's historical progress .  
While failing to achieve their purpose , they began to change their strategies .  While maintaining their economic , political , and military pressure , they shifted the focus onto making ideological infiltration against the socialist countries and took this as an important means of pursuing their " peaceful evolution " strategy .  
Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , precisely because of the adoption of the principle of persistently carrying out reforms and opening up , we can score today 's brilliant achievements in the development of socialist material and spiritual civilization , and our party can withstand the tests of various difficulties and risks .  The socialist system in our country can also gain strong vigor and dynamism under the eventful and changing international situation .  
Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " cult constantly spread rumors to confuse the people and make trouble in violation of the law .  Their evil intention is to create chaos in China and to undermine social stability , making it impossible for the masses of the people to work , study , and live normally , disrupting economic construction , which is a central task , and then proceeding to realize their political scheme of overthrowing the CPC leadership and changing the socialist system in China .  
In order to welcome a new revolution in agro-technology , the National Agro-Technology Conference set a well-founded and effective management system for agro-technology , a system of research and development of an advanced international standard , a visionary promotion and service system for agro-technology , and a strong and stable guarantee system for agro-technology , created a new system for agro-technology which is congruent with the socialist market economy system , and established new mechanisms for development , distribution , competitiveness , and cooperation .  
We must carefully formulate and seriously carry out a guiding plan for ethical building , blend the basic moral concept demands into the relevant laws and regulations and the various specific policies , and into the various items of social management , and continually promote the formation and perfection of the system of socialist ideology and ethics .  
As students of military academies , we shoulder the historic mission of relying on science and technology to build a strong army and accelerate the modernization of our army 's armament and equipment .  We must more consciously strengthen our cultivation of Marxist theories and scientific spirit , arm ourselves with modern scientific knowledge , and exert to spread the fruits of socialist spiritual and cultural progress .  We must never allow fallacies of " Falungong " to contaminate our sacred school campuses .  
However , we should clearly understand that we are still in the early stages of a socialist society .  We are still facing a basic national climate characterized by vast space , a large population , a weak economic base and slow economic and cultural development .  We are still facing a basic national climate characterized by a dominating social contradiction expressed as a gap between social productivity and the increasing material and cultural demands of the populace , as well as a huge economic , scientific and technological gap with developed countries .  
The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission was rich in substance .  Take the question of honesty and self-discipline for example .  While upholding the existing regulations , the session put forward , in line with the basic rules of the socialist market economy , six moral requirements on leading cadres to ensure that they are honest in performing official duties .  
Vigorously disseminating and promoting the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career is very important for us to live through the rigid test of reform , opening up and developing the socialist market economy and continuously advancing the current great project .  
Countless Party members and revolutionary military professionals would dedicate everything in them to liberating the Chinese nation , bringing happiness to the people and revitalizing the country .  The reform , opening up and the development of the socialist market economy have added enormous vitality and historical progress to our construction of material and spiritual civilizations .  
In light of this principle , vigorously promoting the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career is not harmful to the socialist economic situation and the development of the socialist market economy - - it is beneficial to the development of the socialist market economy and the consolidation of the socialist economic base .  
Without the lofty ideal of being unselfish , afraid of nothing and ethical in fulfilling one 's official duties , could we maintain the political quality of the people 's army and walk at the cutting edge of society as a whole in the socialist spiritual civilization construction despite the infiltration of money worship , hedonism and extreme individualism ?  
Since the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy , we have been paying full attention to regulating people 's conduct with legal means in order to meet the requirements of developing the socialist market economy .  Meanwhile , rule by law has been defined as a basic strategy for ruling the country .  
With good moral qualities , people will be able to consciously uphold justice and eliminate evil and carry forward the good and punish the bad .  All this is conducive to establishing a good social practice of pursuing the lofty and encouraging the advanced , ensuring a sound progress of socialist market economy , and giving a push to the improvement of the overall national quality .  
These leaders should pay attention to study characteristics of these units , meticulously review positive experiences drawn from practice , and enthusiastically explore new issues and new problems that arise in the condition of reforming , opening up and developing a socialist market economy .  These leaders should closely associate the essence of the five-sentence general requirement and the " Program " with the reality of these " small , remote , scattered and directly administered " units , work in a creative manner and continuously improve the quality and efficiency of our work .  
Comrades throughout the party have also come to realize profoundly that in the face of the changing international situation and the formidable and arduous tasks at home , our party will remain firm as a rock and indestructible , our socialist country will stay as steady as Mount Tai and stand erect and unshakable , and our cause will be full of vitality and will produce brilliant results only if we always uphold " three represents " and conscientiously implement " three represents " .  
In the face of the ever-changing international situation and intense international competition , without a lofty idea , firm conviction and powerful spiritual mainstay , it is impossible for comrades of the entire party and people throughout the country to make our country powerful , invigorate our nation and basically realize our socialist modernization in the middle of this century .  Without a strong rallying power and brilliant creativity , it is impossible for them to do so .  Without an indomitable will and concerted efforts , it is also impossible for them to do so .  
In Chinese society today when we are carrying out socialist modernization , the greatest benevolence is whatever is beneficial for developing the social productive forces , increasing all-round national strength , and improving living standards ; otherwise , a thing is non-benevolent or is evil .  
In the document of the 15th national party congress , the principal contradiction in the socialist society are summarized as the " contradiction between the people 's increasing material and cultural demands and the backward social production . "  
Given the circumstances of the socialist market economy , the Party Central Committee has also adapted to the transition in the Party 's approach toward leadership and managing state affairs , has realistically improved Party leadership , displayed Party leadership of the united front on democratic consultation , made the Party 's correct stand become the common ground of the vast majority of members of the united front , and united and led them to work for the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
In recent years , relevant mass organizations such as various democratic parties and associations of industry and commerce have gradually experienced political transitions where new leading members have replaced old ones , united and mutually beneficial national relations have been further consolidated , and major progress has been made in relations between religion and socialist society ; the most fundamental reason for all of this is that a high-quality contingent of non-party leaders has been cultivated .  
The Interim Procedures are more all-compassing , standardized and reasonable than the previous procedures , but since each national and military reform must advance step by step , the establishment and completion of the socialist market economy takes time and the Interim Procedures should be implemented in an enthusiastic , reliable and gradual manner .  It is impossible to thoroughly resolve all contradictions and problems at once that have arise since the implementation of reform and opening up .  
Deputies Shi Yuxiao and Zhang Guochu held that today , facing the new task of regarding economic construction as the central task , the important thinking of Comrade Jiang Zemin on " three represents " has given a highly refined interpretation in fundamentally answering the questions of how to build the party , what kind of party to build , and how to act well as the " force at the core " in leading the cause of socialist modernization in the new historical conditions .  
Faced with the extremely sharp and complicated international struggle , in the past 10-plus years , the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core judged the hour and sized up the situation , took the initiative , maneuvered among various states , and defeated western hostile forces ' attempts to disturb us .  Under the leadership of the CPC , a socialist China , with a strong posture , is standing in the east of the world .  
Our current tasks are extremely arduous , such as deepening the reform of state-owned enterprises , realigning industrial structures , increasing peasant income , re-arranging laid-off workers , expanding social employment , balancing the distribution of incomes , and setting up and improving the socialist security system .  
During these five years China has enjoyed political stability , economic development , social progress , and ethnic solidarity ; all-round national strength has risen to a new level , living standards have on the whole reached a comfortably well-off level , and we have victoriously achieved the second strategic goal in socialist modernization .  
The facts have fully proven that Deng Xiaoping Theory is forever the great banner guiding us in continually advancing from victory to victory , and that the party 's third-generation leadership collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has superlative skill and ability in mastering complex situations and leading socialist modernization , and is profoundly trusted and revered by the whole party , the whole army , and the people of all nationalities throughout the country .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin has scientifically summed up the historical experiences of the world socialist movement and of our party in leading the Chinese revolution and construction , and creatively put forward the important thinking on " three represents , " thus answering in scientific fashion a series of major issues that we face in stepping up party building in the new situation .  
Only when development is accelerated can the living standards of the people of all nationalities in our region be improved and the increasingly growing needs of material and cultural life be met , and only when development is accelerated can the new-type socialist nationality relationship characterized by equality , unity , and mutual help be consolidated and developed and national solidarity be consolidated and enhanced .  
making major progress in establishing the modern corporate system for state-owned enterprises , making our social security system more perfect , making substantive strides in perfecting the socialist market economic system , and participating in international economic cooperation and competition in a larger scope and to a deeper degree ;  
not only will it deprive them of an affluent life , but it may restore the history written in blood and tears .  The people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have deep-seated hatred for the feudal serf system of the old Tibet , entertain an infinite love for the socialist new Tibet , and cherish intense hatred for the Dalai 's separatist and sabotage activities .  
During the Tenth Five-Year Plan , we must persevere in orienting ourselves to the market without wavering at all and ceaselessly eliminate the institutional impediments to the development of productive forces and improve the socialist market economy so as to provide a mighty driving force and institutional guarantee for national economic and social development .  
To implement the Tenth Five-Year Plan , we must work hard to improve the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the entire population in the forward direction of an advanced culture , adhere to the idea of " tackling with both hands , both hands hard , " combine the rule of law with the rule of morality , and vigorously push ahead with the building of a socialist spiritual civilization . 
All Tthese reform all conform to the objective rules of the military 's economic administration under the socialist market economy , and meet the requirements of the national financial reform .  The implementation of these measures will substantially improve the scientific nature of the military spending budget administration and more fullyer allow the military spending budget-making to work as a macro-adjustment and control in our military modernization construction .  
It is necessary make cracking down on tax theft and fraudulent taxation , smuggling and other criminal activities that seriously damage the socialist market economic order an important task that is firmly grasped and coordinated with the relevant departments so that the market economic order can be corrected and codified .  
Yang pointed out : With the deepening of the reform , the expansion of the opening up , and the establishment and development of a socialist market economic structure , China 's administrative and management structures have been reformed accordingly and marked results have been scored .  However , the problem of the current administrative and management structures being unable to completely meet the demands of the socialist market economy still exists .  
Political restructuring and the development of the socialist democracy and political system must be conducive to maintaining and giving play to the features and advantages of our political system , and conducive to maintaining the unity of the country , ethnic unity and social stability .  In addition , the historical conditions and the level of economic , cultural and educational development must also be taken into full consideration .  
It is necessary to act according to the requirements of the " three represents " to earnestly study and resolve the new situations and new issues encountered in the building of party organizations under the new historical condition of reform and opening up and developing the socialist market economy and conduct education for maintaining the advanced nature of the party with targets in mind , so as to let party branches at grass-roots level possess very strong capability in directing the overall building of companies and resolving their own problems and party member truly display an exemplary role .  
Our armed forces are a great wall of steel that defends the motherland and are also an important force for socialist modernization .  Participation in and support for the development of the west is the inevitable demand on the armed forces in their process of putting the " three represents [ representing the demands for the development of advanced social productive forces , advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people ] " thinking into practice .  
The conference demanded that the whole party and all levels throughout the country make common efforts and devote great energy to resolve the current conspicuous problems in public order , resolutely achieve the objective of bringing about a marked turn for the better in public order within two years , properly ensure that the masses can live and work in peace and contentment , properly preserve the overall situation of reform , development , and stability , and provide an effective guarantee for socialist reforms and opening up and modernization .  
Developing socialist democracy must be combined with making socialist democracy a systematic and legalized affair ; we must follow the law , strictly enforce the law , pursue violations of law , and also integrate ruling the country according to law with ruling the country with ethics , so as to ensure that all work in the state proceeds in smooth fashion , ensure good economic and social order , and ensure the civil rights and legitimate interests of the masses .  
In upholding the people 's democratic dictatorship , we must properly preserve national sovereignty , security , unity , and stability on the basis of people 's democracy , crack down hard according to law on lawbreaking and criminal activities that jeopardize the socialist system , reform , opening up , and socialist modernization , and people 's lives and property , and give full play to its role in protecting the people and cracking down on the enemy .  
The meeting pointed out : Rectifying and regulating the market economic order is an important measure to strengthen the work of social order , a pressing need to consolidate and develop the fine momentum of the national economy , an inevitable choice for improving the quality and competitiveness of the national economy , an essential condition for opening up yet wider to the outside world , a key move to establish and perfect the socialist market economic system , and an intrinsic demand for making full progress in social civilization .  
In recent years , with the gradual establishment of the socialist market economic system , the party central leadership and the State Council adopted more concrete measures for dealing with the prominent problems that were affecting the order of the market economy and for effecting a fundamental turn for the better in this regard .  The measures included the banning of party and government institutions , military units , armed police force , judicial and law enforcement organs from running enterprises ;  
The criminal syndicates and evil forces often use unscrupulous tactics to collect illegitimate wealth and frantically seek profits .  They use the syndicate to protect businesses , while letting the businesses " feed " the " syndicate . "  They have seriously disrupted the economic order of the state and hampered the reform and opening-up program and the smooth development of the socialist modernization drive .  
The " three advantages " criterion constitutes the standard for us to judge all our work in carrying out China 's reform and opening-up program and developing the socialist modernization drive .  In this way , the thinking on " three represents " helps set the goals for party building in the new period , and expand the historical mission of the Communist Party of China in the new period .  It also provides a theoretical guidance to the ruling party for further strengthening its cultural , social , and economic foundations .  
The conference explicitly demanded that the entire party and the whole nation work together and make vigorous efforts to solve the current pronounced problems in public order , firmly achieve the objective of realizing a marked improvement in public order in two years ' time , and provide a powerful guarantee for the socialist reform , opening up , and modernization drive .  
Reporters of this news agency stationed in Xinjiang Province report that Jing Haiyan of the Women 's Federation of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region said that we must combine ideology and action into a centralized spirit , embody a strong patriotic enthusiasm to promote the work of reform and opening up and socialist modernization construction and work hard at our own jobs in order to strengthen the country 's economic power and national cohesive force .  
While instituting and developing a socialist legal system suited to the socialist market economy , we need to institute a moral system commensurate with it , and be good at merging the basic , important moral requirements into relevant laws and regulations and into various kinds of management in society , so as to ceaselessly promote the formation and perfection of the socialist ideological and ethical system .  
Contents in the preface of the revised law include the guiding position of Deng Xiaoping Theory and call for adhering to reform , opening up , taking the socialist road with Chinese characteristics , developing a socialist market economy and strengthening the building of socialist democracy and legal system .  The revised law has clearly defined the system of regional national autonomy as a basic political system of our country .  
Implementing the revised Regional National Autonomy Law will play a greater role in further keeping to and improving the system of regional national autonomy in our country , accelerating economic and social development in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities , protecting unification of the country , strengthening unity of people of various nationalities , ensuring social stability , and building a rich , powerful , democratic , civilized and modernized socialist country .  
Wang Zhaoguo emphatically pointed out : Facing the very complicated current international situation and formidable domestic construction tasks , comrades of the united front must have a clear understanding of the situation , firm up their confidence , keep their heads cool , and adhere to the socialist road with Chinese characteristics .  
The ideology of which we often speak should refer to the socialist and capitalist systems ; but now , advocating " coexistence of two systems " actually means abandoning the original idea of putting politics in command and instead regarding the two different systems on the two sides of the strait as a contradiction among the people within " one country , " to be handled as such ; what is wrong with changing an antagonistic contradiction between the enemy and ourselves into a non-antagonistic contradiction among the people ?  
Wu Bangguo pointed out : Strengthening the work of public security and rectifying and standardizing the market economic order are a major policy decision made by the party Central Committee and State Council to correct the present public-security problems and market disorder .  These two tasks are important measures to perfect our socialist market economic system , promote the healthy development of the national economy , and ensure social stability .  
The circular also urges courts at all levels to hold open trials on typical cases and explain the law in the light of criminal cases , thereby enabling the broad masses of people to continuously enhance the awareness and ability to use laws to protect and safeguard their own legitimate rights and interests , as well as fostering a prevail atmosphere of socialist business ethics of honesty and trust in the whole society through meting out severe punishments on crimes in disrupting the market economic order .

Doing a good job in selecting and promoting female cadres and recruiting more female party members is a need in our efforts to fulfill the new tasks under the new situation , to meet the " three represents " requirement , and to build a strong high-quality cadre contingent and to reinforce the party rank and file , and is also an important component part of our work in developing socialist democratic politics and promoting social progress .  
China is a socialist country of the people 's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance , and our party is the sole political party of the Chinese proletariat , the core of leadership of the socialist cause , and the creator of our armed forces .  This determines the scientific and correct nature of the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces .  
Zhu Rongji emphasized that in the entire process of the modernization of Shanghai , it is necessary to adhere to the principle of laying equal emphasis on both material and spiritual civilizations , and be strong in both , further strengthen the building of the socialist spiritual civilization , democracy and legal system , and promote comprehensive social progress .  
The people of all ethnic groups in China are united as one , and are working hard together with one heart to build our country into a strong , prosperous , democratic , civilized and modern socialist country .  
Since the Eighth CPV National Congress , the CPV has continued to uphold Marxism-Leninism , Ho Chi-minh thought , and the CPV 's leadership , adhered to the socialist road , and carried out sweeping reform with determination , thus maintaining stability of the country ; and , as a result , Vietnam 's economy has been growing relatively rapidly , its people 's living standards have been continuing to improve , and its international status has been further rising , demonstrating the great vitality and vigor of the socialist system .  
More gratifyingly and admiringly , since the proposal on innovations initiated by the Sixth CPV National Congress in 1986 , Vietnam has made new and tremendous achievements in socialist construction , its politics and society have remained stable , its economy has developed rapidly , the feature of the country has changed remarkably , the people 's lives have gradually improved , and its international position has enhanced , thus entering a new historic period of building an industrialized and modernized country .  
The Ninth CPV National Congress , held at an important historic moment in the new century , is a very important congress bearing major and far-reaching significance on the healthy and smooth development of Vietnam 's socialist cause in the future and on the country 's stability and prosperity .  
Under the leadership of the CPV Central Committee , all CPV members and the Vietnamese people will work with one heart and move forward in unity according to the principles laid down by the Ninth CPV National Congress ; will successfully fulfill the strategic targets proposed by the congress ; and will build Vietnam into a powerful , democratic , civilized , socialist , and industrialized country where the people live in prosperity .

Wang Zhaoguo said : Guangxi is an area inhabited by minority ethnic groups .  Because the regional party committee and the regional government attach great importance to the ethnic and religious work and exercise correct leadership , good results have been achieved in the building of new-type socialist ethnic relations of being equal , united , and mutually assistant .  
Wei Jianxing expressed the hope that the broad masses of staff members and workers would take model workers as models , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , heighten their fighting spirit and work in a down-to-earth manner in line with the requirements of the " three represents , " and strenuously struggle to build our country into a prosperous , powerful , democratic , civilized socialist modern country .  
Zeng Qinghong pointed out : In commanding various rural work with the important thinking of " three represents , " we must devote major efforts to advancing the building of socialist spiritual civilization , democracy , and the legal system and safeguarding social stability in the countryside to provide an ideological guarantee and good sociopolitical environment for rural economic and social development .  
Since then , the activities have been held once a year to discuss a wide range of issues of common concern of entrepreneurs ; and have played a positive and facilitating role in raising China 's entrepreneurs ' social status , in adding to the entrepreneurs ' sense of honor in daring to make reform , their sense of having a mission to accomplish , and their pioneering and leadership spirit , and in bringing up an entrepreneurs ' corps that has forcefully boosted the development of the socialist market economy .  
We are convinced that , under the leadership of the CPV Central Committee headed by Nong Duc Manh , the Vietnamese people will surely follow the policies set at the congress , work hard in unity to victoriously fulfill the set strategic objectives , and built Vietnam into a rich , strong , fair , democratic , civilized yet industrialized socialist country .  
In the past 71 years since its founding , persisting in integrating the basic tenet of Marxism with Vietnam 's concrete practice , upholding Marxism and Ho Chi Minh 's thought , persisting in party leadership , persisting in the socialist road , the CPV has led the Vietnamese people to victoriously accomplish national liberation and unification of the country after undergoing a most arduous and bitter revolutionary struggle .  The CPV has scored remarkable achievements in the cause of socialist construction and has founded a road for development compatible with Vietnam 's national conditions .  
We profoundly believe that under the leadership of the CPV Central Committee headed by General Secretary Nong Duc Manh , by following the guidelines and policies set by the Ninth CPV Congress , and working with concerted and united efforts , the Vietnamese people will victoriously achieve the strategic goals set down , and build Vietnam into a rich and strong , socially fair , democratic , and civilized socialist industrialized country .

Proceeding from their hegemonist aims , they desperately cling to their cold war mentality , always wanting to set up some " enemy " or " opponent , " and proceed to regard socialist China as " the main threat " ; they continually use the Taiwan , Tibet , and human rights issues as pretexts for interfering in China 's internal affairs , persist in developing Theater Missile Defense , which jeopardizes China 's security , plot to step up arms sales to Taiwan , and regard China as the assumed enemy in military exercises .  
Especially at a time when the country is engaged in launching the important reform projects of building a socialist market economic system and restructuring the financial and tax policies , the ministry has taken the initiative in supporting and guiding Tibet 's financial reforms in accordance with Tibet 's actual situation .  
Leading comrades from the State Council pointed out that basic education is the cornerstone of the strategy of vitalizing the country through science and education .  Its significance for improving the quality of the Chinese nation , nurturing qualified personnel of all types at all levels , and promoting socialist modernization is as broad as it is fundamental .  
The formulation of the Corporation Law , in particular , has played a positive role in promoting the establishment of the modern enterprise system , standardizing the organization and conduct of corporations , protecting the legitimate rights and interests of corporations , shareholders and creditors , maintaining social and economic order , and promoting the development of the socialist market economy .  
The Chinese working class is indeed the representative of advanced social productive forces and production relations , is indeed the basic driving force that promotes social development and historical advances , is indeed the main force in the building of socialist material and spiritual civilization , and is indeed the leading class of the people 's republic .  
To smoothly accomplish the Tenth Five-Year Plan , achieving the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive , and basically realizing socialist modernization in the middle of this century is the glorious and arduous historic mission for the working class and the broad working masses in our country .  
We must , with a strong sense of historic mission , actively plunge into the great practice of socialist modernization , and fully display our initiative and creativity to fulfill the key tasks in our country 's development in the period of the Tenth Five-Year Plan , and promote the sustained , high-speed , and healthy development of the national economy .  
They must vigorously carry forward the spirit of ceaselessly striving to achieve socialist modernization , emancipate their minds , seek truth from facts , keep abreast of the times , be bold in innovation , and forge ahead irrespective of the difficulties ; they should press forward with indomitable will , work hard , seek practical results , refrain from seeking fame and wealth , dedicate themselves in selfless fashion , take firm footing in their work posts , love their work , whatever it is , and study and become proficient in it .  
The CYL organizations at various levels also held activities of " visiting the home of Zhang Wentian , " " showing respect for those who won merits , " comforting retired veteran cadres , " finding revolutionary sites " and " learning revolutionary spirit " to help the broad masses of young people and children further understand the 80 years of brilliant history of the CPC and enhance their determination to love the party and the socialist motherland .  
In recent years , the nation has launched ad hoc campaigns to crack down on smuggling , tax evasion , tax fraud , foreign exchange fraud , production and sale of counterfeit and shoddy goods , and other illegal criminal activities .  These have achieved remarkable success and have played an important role in promoting the healthy development of the socialist market economy .  
He said : China has successfully completed the Ninth Five-Year Plan . During that period , China built a preliminary socialist market economic system , further improved its macroeconomic regulatory system , and continued to push forward the program of opening up wider to the outside world ; and the country 's foreign trade and investments from abroad continued to grow noticeably .  
The General Principles of the Education Law also explicitly require that " the state conduct patriotic , collectivist , and socialist education for those who receive education , and conduct ideal , moral , discipline , legal , national defense , and ethnic unity education . "  
This is set to have an important , profound , and far-reaching impact on ensuring the delivery of national defense education to the whole people , propelling national defense construction in the new era , reinforcing the whole people 's national defense awareness and national cohesion , raising the quality of the whole people , and even promoting the construction of socialist spiritual civilization .  
and inspire all Communists and the people in their hundreds and millions , to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory ; rally more closely around the central Party Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core ; adhere to the party 's basic line and program ; heighten fighting spirit ; forge ahead while constantly opening up new prospects in work ; and unremittingly struggle for the realization of the magnificent objective of socialist modernization in the new century .  
Huang Ju told the pacesetters : You have embodied the spiritual style of Chinese servicemen in the new era .  Your spirit of studying and working hard at your posts and serving the motherland will particularly play a great encouraging and exemplary role for the broad ranks of Shanghai cadres and young comrades in further arousing their enthusiasm and creativity , and comprehensively pushing forward the socialist modernization program .  
The European Parliament highly values the correct position adopted by China in the Asian financial crisis a few years ago , and is glad to see that China has made great achievements in its socialist modernization and in maintaining social stability , and enabling its people to live and work happily and peacefully .  It is willing to make joint efforts with the Chinese side in strengthening cooperation in the political , economic , trade , and financial fields , and make greater efforts to advance the comprehensive development of European-Chinese relations .  
This sheer nonsense created by Li Hongzhi has belittled the remarkable achievements China has attained in its building of a socialist material civilization and a socialist spiritual civilization at the present stage , and has fully exposed the anti-human essence of the " Falungong . "  
Over the past half a century , the broad masses of the officers and men of the Tibet Military District have joined hands with the Tibetan people in setting numerous records , and Tibet " has witnessed changes year in and year out and day by day . "  Having taken a giant step into the new socialist era from a feudal serf society , Tibet has renewed its cities , built new factories , extended its pastures , fertilized its farm fields , and improved its people 's livelihood . .  
Under the correct leadership of the party Central Committee and thanks to the vigorous support and selfless assistance of all brother provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities , people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have forged ahead in unity in a pioneering spirit , speeded up the region 's development , defended the unification of the motherland and fought against national splittism , and have attained world-acclaimed achievements in the region 's socialist revolutionary and construction undertakings .  
Today , Tibet is enjoying fast economic growth , great social progress , a stable situation , a sound national unity , and a strong and consolidated border defense ; and its people are leading a happy and contended life .  A scene of prosperity in the socialist new Tibet has spread out before the people of the whole world .  
Conducting propaganda and education on the socialist legal system in a thoroughgoing way and enhancing the legal sense and quality of the all the citizens , leading cadres at all levels in the first place , is an important aspect of the implementation of the basic general plan for managing the country according to the law and building a socialist country ruled by law and also an important task set by the 10th Five-Year Plan and an important legal guarantee for the implementation of the 10th Five-Year Plan .  
All comrades of the party , leading cadres at all levels in particular , must unceasingly enhance their legal sense and ability to act according to the law and strive to promote the improvement of the entire people 's legal sense and quality and lay a solid foundation for building a socialist country ruled by law .  
General knowledge of the law has been widespread , and education in the legal system has been combined closely with the practice of law .  As a result , citizens ' awareness of the law has noticeably increased , and various social undertakings are vigorously managed according to law .  All this has played an important role in implementing the basic plan for governing the country according to law and building a country under the rule of the socialist legal system and played a guaranteeing role in maintaining the overall situation in reform , development , and stability .  
By implementing the Fourth Five-Year Plan for Disseminating the General Knowledge of Law , we should strive to shift from enhancing all the people 's awareness of law to improving the quality of all the people 's knowledge of law and from management by relying on administrative means to management by using legal means ; we should promote the management of all undertaking according to law in an all-round way in order to lay a solid foundation for governing the country according to law and building a country under the rule of the socialist legal system .  
Attention should be paid to raising the theoretical level of the socialist legal system among large numbers of cadres , especially among the leading cadres , and increasing their ability to make decisions , perform their official duties , and exercise management according to law .  
Only when we adapt ourselves to the transformation from a planned economic structure to a market economic structure and only when we materialize the change from a structure ruled by man which is based on a highly developed centralization of individual power to a democratic structure ruled by law can we open up a new prospect in " the building of a socialist country ruled by law , " indicated Wang Guixiu .  
The citizens ' awareness of law and quality of law should be enhanced so as to lay a solid foundation for building a socialist country ruled by law ; this is where the vital importance of the education on law popularization among the entire people lies .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , under the leadership of the CPC , people of different ethnic backgrounds in Tibet created a socialist miracle on the ruins of a feudal serfdom and successfully achieved the historical leap forward to socialism .  At the time of the peaceful liberation , the central authorities decided to temporarily retain Tibet 's old social system .  
People 's democratic dictatorship is the fundamental road to Tibet 's development and stability .  To uphold people 's democratic dictatorship in Tibet , we must make constant efforts to foster socialist democracy , perfect the system of regional autonomy in areas inhabited by minority nationalities , firmly crack down on sabotages committed by the Dalai clique and on all kinds of criminal activities harmful to national security , safeguard the motherland 's unification and ethnic unity , and seriously protect the fundamental interests of the masses .  
We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the central authorities , with the vigorous and selfless support of the people in the rest of the country , and with the unremitting efforts and hard work of people of different ethnic backgrounds in Tibet , the magnificent goal of building a united , prosperous , and civilized socialist new Tibet can definitely be achieved .  
They have taken advantage of the channels of international economic and cultural exchanges and dissemination to energetically advertise the political concepts of bourgeois democracy , freedom , and human rights , pursue egoistic values , advocate the reactionary views of divesting armed forces of party leadership and depoliticizing them , vilify CPC leadership , and wage an all-out attack against China 's socialist system with the aim of bringing about a credibility crisis or confidence crisis among the people , who will eventually abandon party leadership and the socialist system .  
The majority of demobilized military cadres carry forward and promote the excellent traditions and working styles of the people 's army - - struggling with painstaking efforts , striving forward and dedicating themselves to their careers and enthusiastically forging ahead .  The majority made new contributions to the great cause of constructing socialist modernization , have won praise from the party and the people and have added more glories to the people 's army .  
Hu Jintao pointed out : Since the beginning of this year , the whole party and the whole nation have been conscientiously implementing the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee and the party Central Committee 's major policy decisions and vigorously advancing the drive for socialist modernization by persistently taking development as the theme , structural readjustment as the principal line , reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress as a driving force , and improving the people 's living standards as the basic goal .  
To guarantee and promote the development of the socialist market economy , and especially to straighten out and regularize the order of the market economy and crack down on various illegal and criminal activities in the economic field , we need to enhance the legal quality of the entire citizens .  
Profoundly conducting legal system propaganda and education and enhancing the law-abiding quality of the entire citizens and first of all , leading cadres at all levels , is an important requirement and prerequisite for the implementation of the basic principle of governing the country on the basis of laws and building a socialist rule-by-law country , and is also an important task in the Tenth Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development . This also provides a legal guarantee for the implementation of the Tenth Five-Year Plan .  
The objective of the Fourth 5-Year Plan on Law Popularization is to realize " two points of improvement " and " two transformations . "  The two points of improvement refers to , in light of the principle of our constitution and the development progress of socialist democratic legal construction in the new development stage , profoundly promoting educational activities to disseminate the law and comprehensively improve the legal quality of all citizens as a whole , particularly leading cadres at all levels .  
In short , " the armed forces to be with no party affiliation " , " nonpoliticization of the armed forces " , and " nationalization of the armed forces " preached by the Western hostile forces are three poisonous swords , and their sinister intentions are to make our party " lose " its absolute leadership over the armed forces and " lose " its ruling position , to make our state " lose " its socialist nature , and to make our people 's army " lose " its political nature .  
Fei Xiaotong , honorary chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Democratic League and a famous socialist , made a speech at the meeting .  He recalled the brilliant achievements made by the CPC in leading the Chinese people to seek the truth and strive for happiness in connection with his personal experience .  He said : A Chinese intellectual should contribute his or her knowledge to the state , contribute ideas and proposals for national construction , and do down-to-earth work benefiting the country and the people .  
From the very beginning , the party openly and explicitly regarded the most beautiful ideal of human beings - socialist society and communist society - as its objective for struggle , employed Marxism as an ideological weapon to sharply observe and analyze issues regarding China , united a large number of advanced people that excel at dedicating themselves to , and deeply went among the workers and the farmers to do the masses ' work .  
Thus it is very natural for the Chinese people bullied and humiliated by superpowers from Western countries and domestic reactionary forces over the past 100-plus years ? to look forward to the socialist ideal - expect their country to be prosperous , rich and strong , but without the phenomena of a huge gap between the rich and the poor and the weak being bullied by the strong .  
It is true that the party , before long after its establishment , realized that , in light of the Chinese real situation of a semicolonial and semi-feudalistic society , the party should give priority to toppling imperialist and feudalistic forces over the immediate establishment of a socialist society not to mention a communist society , a task for far ahead in the future .  
Under the condition of developing a socialist market economy , a qualified leading cadre must not only have a relatively high political quality and a relatively strong professional ability but must also have relatively high legal quality .  
Answer : A host of facts has proved that Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " cult organization have completely transformed into an out-and-out reactionary political organization and a political force and have become the tool of international anti-China forces and the splittist forces in Taiwan for subverting the political power of our people 's democratic dictatorship and the socialist system and for undermining national unification .  
They should associate strategies and policies issued by the central government with realities in their own region and department , combine needs with possibilities , unite the spirit of forging ahead with that of seeking the truth and being realistic .  They should align working enthusiasm with being scientific .  All comrades in the Party , particularly leading cadres , should work in a creative manner and use innovations in their leadership styles and skills to look toward a new horizon in building the Party and socialist modernization construction .  
To properly organize various commemorative activities , we should follow the guidance of Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " , closely surround the main theme determined by the party central leadership , and sing aloud the eulogy for praising the Communist Party , socialism , and reform and opening up with full enthusiasm and strong assurance , thus encouraging the entire party membership and the people to continue to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , and march forward to create a bright future for the cause of socialist modernization .  
It is particularly necessary to enhance moral education , and conduct patriotic , collectivist , and socialist education for secondary and elementary school students , conduct education in the fine tradition of the Chinese nation , revolutionary tradition , and national defense , and enhance ideological and moral education .  
With the beginning of the new century , our country 's drive for socialist modernization has entered a new stage of development .  The world scientific and technological revolution is developing rapidly , the tendency toward economic globalization is getting stronger , the pace of industrial restructuring is quickening , and international competition is becoming increasingly keen ; all these pose new challenges to us .  
In carrying out ideological and political education in the military , it is necessary to focus on the reality of the primate phase of socialism and the objective existence of the socialist market economy , to be responsive to society 's diversified development , to grasp the mainstream and essence , and to work hard to utilize , incorporate , exploit , and develop positive factors .  
The statement read : " This newspaper will learn a profound lesson from this incident and take effective measures to adopt correct guiding principles for newspaper management , thoroughly implement the principle of ' newspaper management based on political considerations , ' and improve newspaper management by adhering to the policy of fostering unity and stability , serving as an inspirational force , and stressing positive propaganda and by correctly shaping public opinion .  We will do our best to give wide publicity to reform , opening up , and socialist modernization . "  
On this basis , our party seized the opportune moment to creatively realize the socialist transformation of individual farming , handicraft industry , as well as capitalist industrial and commercial industries , destroyed the exploiting system and the exploiting class , and established the socialist system .  
The third generation of central leadership collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has shown great foresight , managed the overall situation , held high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , continued to deepen reform and expanded opening up , vigorously advanced the building of the socialist market economy system , surmounted difficulties , overcome all kinds of risks from political and economic fields as well as from nature , and succeeded in realizing a sustained , rapid and sound economic development , and safeguarding social and political stability .  
Examining ourselves , after over 50 years of development , especially since the 20 years of reform and opening up , we have the important ideological and political basis for basically realizing modernization , material and technical bases , as well as mass basis by the middle of this century , and the vigorous and rapidly developing socialist cause with Chinese characteristics .  
Particular efforts should be devoted to meticulously studying Chairman Jiang 's expositions on how we should understand the historical progress of development of socialist society , how we should understand historical progress of the development of capitalist society , how we should understand the influence on people 's thinking exerted by our practice of socialist reform and how we should understand the impact of the current international environment and international political struggles .  These expositions should be regarded as the guiding principle and fundamental basis for observing and understanding the international and domestic situation .  
and it played an important role in consolidating people 's democratic dictatorship , and in pushing forward the historical process of socialist revolution and construction in China .  With the arrival of the new historical period , the China Democratic League has showed its firm support for the line , principles , and policies that the CPC has adopted ever since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee ; conscientiously performed its role as a party participating in government and political affairs ;  
Full development of the socialist economy will lay a solid foundation for resolving the contradiction between the backward social productivity and the growing material and cultural needs .  
The guiding principle for Tibet 's work in the new period has further aroused our consciousness in opposing separatism and safeguarding stability .  In exposing and criticizing Dalai in recent years , we have been waging a tit-for-tat struggle against him in the spiritual sphere , which is the main battleground , to fight confusion and correct foolishness .  We have done a great deal of highly effective work in strengthening the buildup of socialist spiritual civilization .  
Use Marxist materialist conception of history to gradually weaken idealist theism , replace feudalism and superstition and ignorance and backwardness with modern knowledge in science and technology , divert the attention of religion believers toward developing the economy and improving living standard materially and culturally , and guide religion into categories compatible with the socialist society for the temples , monks and nuns to play a positive and useful role in social life .  
In the period of socialist revolution and construction , to strive for national prosperity and strengthening , our party continued to consolidate and expand the people 's democratic united front in the efforts for restoring the economy , developing production , carrying out socialist transformation , establishing the socialist system , and starting the comprehensive explorations of socialist construction .  
The united front should firmly adoptthe guiding principle of serving economic construction , should pool the wisdom and strength of all social strata , all political parties , all ethnic groups , all social organizations , and the people in all social circles for advancing our country 's socialist modernization .  
We must rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and , in line with the requirement of the three represents , carry forward the glorious revolutionary traditions , closely follow the advancing pace of the times , emancipate our minds , seek truth from facts , carry out hard struggle , forge ahead , and strive to turn our country into a rich , powerful , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist country .  
In particular , in the 20 years since reform and opening up , the level of productive forces in China has ascended one stage after another , the socialist market economic system was initially established , the omnidirectional format for opening up to the outside world was basically formed , the economy and social areas developed , and China had already realized the first two strategic objectives in modernization construction .  China had also begun to enter full establishment of a well-off society , accelerating and pushing forward socialist modernization construction onto a new level .  
Keeping in mind the historical lesson learned from being overanxious to move toward communism , as well as the historical setback in the last decade of the previous century in the form of the disintegration of the Soviet Union , which was the first socialist country , CPC members are prepared to struggle in a down-to-earth manner for at least another 50 years for socialism in the initial stage and to struggle for 100 years or several hundred years for a relatively advanced or a more advanced stage of socialism .  
Scientific and technical workers are part of China 's working class , they carry out courageous exploration and make constant progress , so they are the main inheritors and disseminators of scientific and cultural knowledge of humankind and play an irreplaceable role in the building of socialist material and spiritual civilization . 
I hope the masses of science and technology workers will stay on the cutting edge of the new era , closely integrating personal ambitions with the nation 's future and fate ; undertake the historical responsibility of promoting science and technology advancements and innovations ; and continuously contribute to developing China into a prosperous , democratic , and civilized modern socialist country .  
In front of the both arduous task and bright future for accomplishing socialist modernization , science and technology workers in China must unite closely and continue creating and exploring to make renewed and magnificent contributions to the grand national rejuvenation .  
To fulfill the tasks in the transitional period and realize the change into socialism , the key lay in the proper accomplishment of the socialist transformation .  That was an ownership revolution of guiding individual and private economies into socialism .  
Through a special form of redemption , that is , the paying of fixed interest to original owners of the private businesses , the most complicated task in our country 's socialist transformation was smoothly and stably accomplished .  
Was n't that an unnecessary move ?  Admittedly , some shortcomings existed in the course of socialist transformation .  They were mainly " hasty requirements , imprudent work , too fast changes , too simple and uniform forms , and some problems left down over a long time . "  
Thus , we should be concentrated in developing productivity with the driving force of the new relations of production , and step up our socialist construction to make our country rich and powerful and enable our people to lead a better-off life .  This would be favorable to the development of the country and in keeping with the fundamental interests and ardent hopes of the general public .  
Large numbers of publishing workers have persisted in serving the people , socialism , and the overall situation in the work of the party and state ; they have made remarkable achievements in publicizing Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , in disseminating and accumulating scientific and cultural knowledge , in satisfying the spiritual and cultural needs of the people , and in promoting the building of the material and spiritual civilizations ; and they have played an important role in reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization .  
The vast working masses should be guided to more clearly understand their own historical responsibility .  Such a sense of mission should be turned into a strong driving force to play a role as the main force to continuously enhance their own quality and make contributions to the building of a rich and powerful socialist modern country with a high degree of democracy and civilization as Comrade Jiang Zemin hoped .  
Under the leadership of the CPC , the vast mass of scientific and technological workers are united and mobilized to work hard for the development of science and technology in our country and for the realization of the grand objective of socialist modernization in our country .  This is the historical mission of the China Association of Science and Technology .  
They said that the achievements which we have attained are not only reflected on the various indexes of the national economy and social development , the profound changes taken place in the economic structure , the sustained improvement of the overall national strength , and the constant elevation of the international standing of our country but also embodied in the fact that under the leadership of the Party the masses of people are of one mind in carrying out the socialist modernization drive .  
In order to score even greater victories , we must uphold the basic line of the Party , further unify the thinking of the comrades of the whole Party on the major policy decision made by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , consciously maintain a high degree of ideological and political consistency with the Party Central Committee , and coagulate the strength of the people of all nationalities of the whole country around the magnificent objective of realizing the socialist modernization construction .  
Since the Third Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party , our Party has made our strategy and countermeasures against this peaceful evolution clear , adhering to the Party 's basic line for the current stage of development , which is composed of " one center and two basic points , " adhering to the guiding strategy that " development is the absolute principle , " practicing a socialist market economy and striving to develop ourselves .  
The overall standard of living has already reached a well-off level and China now has a considerable group of wealthy people .  The objective for the second strategic step of socialist modernization has been realized in a general fashion .  
The important thinking of the " three represents " is beneficial for China in the 21st century , in strengthening the ideological education of cadres , consistently moving the advanced nature of Party members forward , and in enabling reform , opening up and modernization construction , particularly in operating a market economic mechanism so that we can develop healthily along the socialist road .  
As long as our Party regards Marxism , Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guiding principle , uses the important thinking of the " three represents " to strengthen its ideological armament and effectively carry out correct lines , strategies and policies issued by the Party since the Third Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party , our Party will forever stand in an invincible position and our socialist system will be stable and safe in the long run .  
The fine tradition of the Chinese nation and our revolutionary tradition have been carried forward under the new historical conditions .  Patriotism , collectivism , socialist concepts and socialist moral practice have become the essential aspect of our people 's mental world .  This conforms to the moral standardization of the development of our socialist economy and the common pursuit of all members of our society .  
It also adopted the guiding principle and policy of " letting literature and art service socialism and the people " and " letting a-hundred flowers blossom and a-hundred schools of thought contend . "  Furthermore , it emphasized the necessity of developing a socialist culture with Chinese characteristics .  All this has shown that the CPC has always represented the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , and that it has been making unremitting efforts to bring about and develop our prosperous and outstanding national culture .  
We should persist in sticking to the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , vigorously bring about our prosperous socialist culture and make efforts to provide our reform , opening up and modernization with a powerful spiritual motive power and ideological guarantee .  
He pointed out that after the founding of new China , the CPC led the people of the whole country to destroy the imperialist privileges in China and seize bureaucrat-capital and resumed for the people the decision-making rights to independently engage in foreign trade and economic cooperation .  On the basis that liberated areas had already developed foreign trade , a series of major measures were taken to comprehensively set up a socialist system governing foreign trade and economic cooperation .  
The 14th Party Congress called for developing the socialist market economy .  The foreign trade system has been reformed in an in-depth manner according to the orientation set forth at the 14th Party Congress - - " unified policies , relaxed management , equal competition , self-responsibility for profits or losses , integration of industry with trade , and implementation of a commission-based system . "  
second , it is even more difficult to do this because we are confronted with the new situation characterized by the new scientific and technological revolution in the 21st century and the fierce competition worldwide , with a serious challenge from our double mission to achieve China 's modernization , and with the magnificent task of building a socialist material civilization and a socialist spiritual civilization .  
Jia Qinglin said : Over 80 years , especially over more than 50 years since the founding of new China , under the leadership of the CPC , Beijing , as a time-honored ancient capital city well-known to the world , underwent earthshaking changes .  It changed from a capital of a declining feudal empire into a great capital of the socialist motherland , and is now marching toward a modern international metropolis .  
Heroic models and advanced typical examples are valuable wealth of our party and the country .  Their lofty thinking is playing an increasingly greater role to influence and lead the people .  Their actions are of great significance to fostering healthy tendencies in the society , developing the spirit of our times and promoting reform , opening up and the socialist modernization drive .  
Particularly since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party , our Party has reviewed positive and negative experiences in socialist construction , successfully created a way of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics and enabled scientific socialism to be energetic , vigorous and creative in this vast land .  
At this moment commemorating the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China , we should meticulously study these important expositions , in light of the Party 's glorious history , solve problems by uniting reality with history and combining perspectives with reasoning , genuinely base socialist conviction on a solid ideological and theoretical foundation and transform praises of socialism to a self-mobilized advancement of the great cause of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the 21st century .  
National unity has been further strengthened , socialist national relations marked by equality , unity and mutual aid have been consolidated and developed , and the bonding forces of the people of every nationality in the region toward the motherland have been further enhanced .  
third , persist in comprehensively carrying out the party 's national and religious policies , making constant efforts to consolidate and develop socialist national relations marked by equality , unity , and mutual aid among the masses of every nationality in Tibet , and persist in developing a strong and patriotic united front ;  
At this transcentury moment , our Party has correctly analyzed the situations at home and abroad , comprehensively summed up the successful experiences of the reform and opening up the outside world over 20 years , formulated the economic , political , and cultural programs of the Party in the primary stage of socialism , striven to realize the combination of public ownership with market economy , developed the socialist market economy , let the social productive forces constantly be liberated and developed , and meanwhile upheld the political direction of socialism .  
Over the past 80 years , the CPC has organized and led arduous revolutionary struggles against aggressors from the outside and reactionaries at home , won a victory in the people 's revolution , founded socialist new China on the vast land of China , and achieved tremendous progress and changes on the road of invigorating China and realizing national reunification .  
Over the past 80 years , under the leadership of the glorious CPC , the Chinese people have struggled hard and won great victories in revolution for national liberation , founded the People 's Republic of China , scored tremendous achievements in socialist construction , especially in the cause of reform , opening up and the socialist modernization drive , constantly improved people 's living condition , and continuously raised international its position .  
We have established a socialist system and realized the most extensive and most profound social transformation in Chinese history .  We have creatively materialized the transformation from new democracy to socialism and established the basic system of socialism in an all-round way , enabling this big country in the Orient whose population accounts for a quarter of the world total to enter socialist society .  
Basing ourselves on the long period of socialist construction , we have practiced new policies of reform and opening to the outside world and formulated the basic theory , line and program of our party in the initial stage of socialism after summing up both the internal and external historical experience and through hard exploration .  
To make our party represent the direction of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must make its theory , line , programs , principles , policies , and all its work reflect the requirements of the national , scientific , and popular socialist culture that develops toward modernization , the world , and the future , and enable them to upgrade the ideological and ethical quality and scientific and cultural quality of the whole nation and to provide spiritual impetus and intellectual support for China 's economic development and social progress .  
focus our attention on the front line of world scientific and cultural development ; develop a healthy , progressive , rich , and colorful socialist culture with Chinese style and characteristics to meet the increasing demands of the people ; and direct the people to get mentally equipped and upgraded with correct ideas .  
The fundamental task for developing the socialist culture lies in cultivating citizens from generation to generation who have lofty ideals , moral integrity , a better education and a good sense of discipline .  We should persevere in arming the people with scientific theories , guiding the people with correct public opinions , molding the people with noble minds , and inspiring the people with superior works .  
Strengthening socialist ideological and ethical building constitutes the essential content of and a key link in developing China 's advanced culture .  
In order to forever represent the orientation of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must make the party 's theory , line , program , principles , policies and all its work reflect the requirements of the national , scientific and popular socialist culture that develops toward modernization , the world and the future ; enable them to upgrade the ideological and ethical qualities and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation and to provide the motive power and support culturally and intellectually .  
Under no circumstances should comrades of the whole party stand still and refuse to move forward , nor should they fear hardship and difficulties .  We must closely unite with people of all ethnic groups in China and strive to build the great motherland into a strong , prosperous , democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country so as to make new and even greater contributions to humanity .  
Now , we have adopted the basic economic system under which public ownership plays a dominant role in the national economy while other forms of ownership develop side by side .  We are shaping a socialist market economy and introducing strategic adjustments to the economic structure .  Consequently some workers have changed their jobs .  
All comrades of the party must unswervingly implement the party 's basic line for the initial stage of socialism , consistently concentrate on economic development , stick to the Four Cardinal Principles [ keeping to the socialist road and upholding the people 's democratic dictatorship , leadership by the Communist Party , and Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought ] , press ahead with reform and opening up , strive for the realization of the basic program of the party for the present stage and constantly advance the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics into the future .  
Under no circumstances should comrades of the party stand still and refuse to move forward , nor should they fear hardship and difficulties .  All comrades must closely unite with the people of all ethnic groups in China and strive to build our great motherland into a strong , prosperous , democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country and make new and even greater contributions to mankind .  
Under the leadership of the party 's leading collective of the second generation with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at the core , our party emancipated its mind and sought truth from facts ; shifted the work focus of both the party and the state towards the building of modernizations that centered around the country 's economic construction ; gradually gave form to a basic line that guided the country 's work at the initial stage of socialism upon its in-depth summarization of both positive and negative experiences gained from socialist construction ;  
At the end of the 20th century , which witnessed drastic changes in the world setup , the People 's Republic was at a crucial moment in its reform , opening up , and the development of a socialist market economy .  Under the leadership of the party 's leading collective of the third generation with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , our party has held high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory ; adhered to its basic theory , basic line , and basic program ;  
Over the 80 years under the correct leadership of the three generations of leading collectives headed by Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin , the CPC has grown from small to large and from weak to strong .  It led the Chinese people to advance wave upon wave , wage tenacious struggles , found the new China , establish the socialist system , explore ways to building socialism with Chinese characteristics , and write a magnificent chapter in the historical development of the Chinese nation .  
toppled the three big mountains [ imperialism , feudalism , and bureaucrat-capitalism ] , built new China , and ended the tragic fate where our country was like a sheet of loose sand [ in a state of disunity ] , was rent by disunity , and allowed itself to be trampled upon .  We underwent socialist construction , broke blockades , consolidated our political power , achieved self-reliance , fought hard , and fought against heaven and earth in the Daqing oilfield .  
Third , Deng Xiaoping Theory adheres to the broad vision of Marxism in observing the world , and makes correct analysis and reaches new and scientific conclusions on the features of the current times and the overall international situation , on the successes and failures of other socialist countries in the world , on the gains and losses of other developing countries in seeking development , on the development postures and contradictions in developed countries , and on the profound impact of the scientific and technological progress on the economic and social life .  
Cao Gangchuan stressed that implementing the spirit of General Secretary Jiang 's important speech requires fully undertaking the armament mission and duty , while linking this closely with steadfast implementation of policies of the Party 's route , while linking this closely with implementation of the Party 's basic guiding principles in the current phase , while linking this closely with the fundamental achievement of the magnificent objective of socialist modernization by the middle of this century , and making the demands of the " three represents " a part of our armed combat preparations .  
In his speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin mentioned that it is necessary to uphold and perfect the system of people 's congress , the multiparty cooperation system under the leadership of the communist party , and the system of political consultation and regional national autonomy , actively , safely , and steadily push forward the reform of political structure , further expand the democracy of socialism , govern the country according to law , and build a socialist country ruled by law .  
When facing the complicated international situation marked by the confrontation between the Eastern and the Western camps , the leaders of new China represented by Mao Zedong , proceeding from the fundamental interests of our country , adopted the foreign policy of " totally leaning to " the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union .  
It is like water pouring off a steep roof , has tremendous momentum , has full and abundant connotation and profound thinking , and is a creative utilization and development of Marxism , Mao Zedong thought , and Deng Xiaoping theory .  It symbolizes the fact that our party has reached new heights , new levels , and new boundaries in its understanding of the rules of governance and construction ; in its understanding of the rules for socialist construction ;  
To practice the requirement of representing the orientation of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must enhance the building of socialist spiritual civilization , persistently educate the people with Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , effectively implement the strategy of relying on science and education for national regeneration , promote the enhancement of the ideological and moral integrity and scientific and cultural attainments of the whole nation .  
It is necessary to inherit and carry forward all good cultures , including the fine cultural tradition of the Chinese nation , the revolutionary cultural tradition formed by the party and the people over a long time , and all advanced civilization achievements created by human society , and strive to develop our national and scientific socialist culture oriented to modernization , to the world , and to the future .  
We must base ourselves on the new practice of social life today and on the new development of the times , strengthen theoretical study , conscientiously sum up the experience , tackle problems in real earnest , make explorations in the midst of practice , make innovations in the midst of explorations , and move forward in the midst of innovations .  While doing a better job in the building of material civilization , we must keep pushing ahead with the building of socialist spiritual civilization .  
We must study their approach of building a Party to serve the people , being upright and honest , and vigorously promoting socialist morality , consciously guarding against unhealthy tendencies , resolutely struggling with all negative and corrupt phenomena , and always maintaining the true revolutionary character of CPC personnel .  
General Secretary of the Communist Party of Argentina Patricio Echegaray , and the Party 's Secretary for International Relations Athos Fava , said in a congratulatory telegram to Jiang Zemin , " The Chinese Communist Party , established 80 years ago by a small number of revolutionaries in the historically famous city of Shanghai , proposed the objective of seizing political power and establishing socialist society .  It seized power within the relatively short span of 28 years .  
base ourselves on the realities in China , with attention focused on the front line of world scientific and cultural development ; and unceasingly develop a healthy , progressive , rich , and colorful socialist culture with Chinese style and characteristics .  That is also the fundamental expression and requirement for our party to remain in the forefront of the times and maintain its advanced nature .  
To study the " speech , " we should hold high the advance banner of China 's advanced culture , strive to create and carry forward a new culture that embodies the requirements of revolution , construction , and reform , satisfy the growing needs of the masses of the people for spiritual culture , and push forward the development and progress of socialist society in a comprehensive way .  
In the course of leading the whole party and the people of the entire country to continuously advance the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the party Central Committee , with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , has persistently integrated the basic tenets of Marxism with the practice of the modernization drive in the contemporary China and has constantly deepened the understanding of party building of the ruling party and the law governing the socialist modernization drive .  
In his " 1 July " speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin gave a penetrating exposition on the important concept of " three represents " and put forward new ideas and views on a number of major theoretical and practical issues concerning party building and the socialist modernization drive , thereby pointing out the direction for advancing the cause of the party and the country in the coming century .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's exposition on continuously building up the party 's class foundation , expanding the party 's mass foundation , and raising the party 's influence on society in the light of the reality in economic development and social advancement has provided the scientific theoretical basis for consolidating and strengthening the party 's leadership and increasing the party 's creativity , cohesive power , and combat capability under the conditions of the socialist market economy .  
He always persisted in taking basic Marxist theory on the state and law as guidance , carefully took into account the actual situation in our country 's legal construction , and strove to explore and build a sound juridical system of the people , thus making exceptional contributions toward our country 's socialist democratic construction and legal construction and being regarded by all as a key founder of the legal system of the New China .  
publicized knowledge on relevant policies , laws , and regulations ; built up a socialist population culture and childbearing culture ; devoted great efforts to changing the backward childbearing concepts among the masses ; and have successfully enhanced the ideological and moral qualities , as well as the scientific and technological qualities , of the masses .  
After the socialist transformation was complete , and the basic socialist system was established , the advanced nature of our Party was reflected in the endeavors of leading the people of all ethnic groups across the nation in vigorously developing the social productive forces and bringing to fruition national industrialization .  
Second , we must further reinforce socialist ideological and cultural progress and promote the steady improvement of the ideological , moral , scientific and cultural qualities of our people in order to turn Guangzhou into a city that is truly " suitable for starting one 's business and suitable to live in . "  
Making full use of the powerful position of junior military academies and strengthening ideological and political education among the children and youth so that they will foster from childhood the fine quality of loving the party , the motherland , the people , and the army and give them training in acquiring a patriotic spirit of a high degree , a strong sense of national defense , a strong will , and strong physique is a major issue that has a bearing on the future of China 's socialist modernization .  
In his speech at the forum , Wu Bangguo said : We should conscientiously study the new situations and new problems arising from the conditions of the socialist market economy , effectively strengthen the supervision and control of the market , particularly crack down on fake and shoddy products bearing on the vital interests of the people and endangering their lives and health , and do a good job in solving problems , such as being slack in crackdown , replacing imprisonment for criminal offenses with lighter punishment , and weak links .  
To improve the party 's leadership and party building , we must first proceed from these two major transformations to earnestly study theoretical and practical issues facing party building under the new historical conditions and study the laws governing the rule of the country by the Communist Party , socialist construction , and the development of human society that underlie these issues so as to better advance party building .  
The historical mission for the current period put forth by our Party is , through reform and opening-up , to further liberate and develop the productive forces , promote national economic , political and cultural development in an all-around way , continuously improve people 's material and cultural standards of living , strive to build China into a prosperous , strong , democratic , civilized , modernized socialist country , and strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people .  
Our objective is : By the middle of this century , we will basically achieve modernization , build a prosperous , strong , democratic , civilized , and socialist modern country , and realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .  
The party Central Committee comprehensively analyzed the exceptional difficulties and favorable conditions for Tibet 's economic and social development in the socialist market economic situation ; defined feasible objectives for development ; and formulated preferential policy and supportive measures in eight aspects - - tax revenues , finance , investment capitalization , price subsidies , foreign trade , social security , reform of enterprises , and the sectors of agriculture and animal husbandry .  
With the party Central Committee 's firm leadership , and with the selfless support of all fraternal nationalities of the big family in the motherland , a united , prosperous , and civilized socialist new Tibet will advance with giant strides on its journey in the new century .  
Therefore , to satisfactorily carry out the educational campaign on ideals and convictions , we must get rid of outdated educational strategies such as using detailed imaginative descriptions of the far future and using unrealistic fantasies and slogans to educate people .  We must consistently focus on the basic national situation in the initial period of socialist development and educate Party members firmly in accordance with their ideological realities .  
This is evidenced by , among other things , its increasingly rapid economic growth , significant improvement of its people 's living standards , remarkable achievements in its building of advanced socialist culture and ethics , and vigorous development of all its social undertakings .  
Diligent and wise , Tibet 's people of all nationalities have , in the course of long historical development , made outstanding contributions in creating a splendid culture of the Chinese nation and founding our unified , multinational country .  In the past half century in particular , they have written a magnificent chapter of Tibet 's development and progress , adding a new splendor to the community of the socialist motherland .  
We definitely will follow the guidance of the spirit of Comrade Jiang Zemin 's speech at the grand gathering marking the CPC 's 80th founding anniversary and the spirit of the fourth forum held by the Central Authorities on the work in Tibet , fully mobilize and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativeness of all circles to constantly push forward the great cause of building a socialist new Tibet that is united , prosperous and civilized .  
As result of the democratic reform and socialist transformation as well as the ongoing reforms and opening up , Tibet has liberated and developed its social productivity in an unprecedented scale .  Last year , the region 's gross domestic product was more than 50 times that of the period before the democratic reform in 1959 .  
The PLA , armed police , and law enforcement units stationed in Tibet are strong pillars and loyal guards who safeguard the motherland 's frontier areas and Tibet 's stability .  They are important forces for building the socialist material and spiritual civilizations in Tibet . They must continue to carry forward their fine traditions and work styles , ensure their own construction , strengthen their unity with the local governments , civilian authorities , and the people , and make new contributions to Tibet 's stability and development .  
In the long historical development , the hardworking and intelligent people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have made remarkable contributions to creating the shinning cultures of the Chinese nation and to building our unified multinational country .  The brilliant chapter of Tibet 's development and progress in the past 50 years that you have written has added new glory to the big family of our socialist motherland .  
Under the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , let us hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , follow the guidance of the important thinking of the " three represents , " work with one heart and one mind , press forward continuously , and work hard to build a united , affluent , and civilized socialist new Tibet and achieve the great revitalization of the Chinese nation !  
Enhancing socialist ideological and ethics building is a major content of developing an advanced culture , and one of the important things is to do well in ideological and ethics building among leading cadres , particularly among senior level cadres .  
Not only behavior criteria and ethical standards for leading cadres need to be adapted to socialist market economic rules and in line with the requirements of the times and with innovative spirit , they must also adhere to socialist value concept , avoid the negative impact of the market economy , and resist against such decadent thinking as mammonism , hedonism , and extreme individualism .  
The celebrations have fully reflected the tremendous progress achieved by Tibet over the past 50 years , given wide publicity to the principles and policies of the central authorities toward Tibet , considerably aroused the enthusiasm of the Tibetan people of all ethnic groups in building up a new socialist Tibet , and will surely bring about a vigorous development to all undertakings in Tibet in the new century .  
put an end to the rampant manufacturing and sales of counterfeit currencies in a number of areas ; successfully checked the sudden growth in the amount of counterfeit currencies ; and has played an important part in maintaining a stable economic , financial , and social order , and in promoting the healthy growth of the socialist market economy .  
In March this year , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council decided to rename the State Administration for Industry and Commerce as State General Administration for Industry and Commerce , upgrading it from the vice ministerial level to the ministerial level .  The purpose was to further strengthen its authority and status as a market regulation and law enforcement department , so that the government 's institutional setup could better meet the requirements of the socialist market economic system .  
They should adapt to the new situation in the context of developing a socialist market economy and free themselves , once and for all , from the ideas , concepts , and approaches of work formed under the system of planned economy .  They should take a step further and change their function from predominantly regulating country markets to regulating the unified national market and from managing the market by mainly relying on administrative means to managing the market by law .  
We must willingly combine subjective efforts and objective world , theory and practice , and inheritance and development of legacies , deepen our understanding of the laws governing the running of the government by the Communist Party , socialist construction , and human society so that we think and act more in line with the national condition at the initial stage of socialism and the requirements of the development of the times and think and act more in line with the actual conditions in Jiangsu Province and the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people .  
Practice has fully proved that the party 's third-generation central leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core is the loyal and reliable successor to China 's socialist cause initiated by Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping and an energetic and promising pioneer .  
The provision for a department to be in charge of a Sino-foreign joint venture was a result of the planned economic system of those days .  After the economic structural reform , government administration have been separated from enterprise management , and administrative organs separated from enterprises .  Under the socialist market economic conditions , in particular , enterprises enjoyed full authority to make their own managerial decisions , and the government mainly carried out macro-direction and is not supposed to intervene in enterprises ' specific production and operational activities .  
Reform is being carried out under the complicated environment at home and abroad .  It is faced with the interference and sabotage of the hostile forces .  This demands that we further enhance our political awareness , adopt a firm and clear-cut stand in our major political struggles , and resolutely safeguard the Party 's leadership and the socialist system .  
China is now in a period of economic structural transformation , during which the rules governing the planned economy are being smashed while the rules governing the socialist market economy remain imperfect .  Under such circumstances , financial loopholes , violations of the financial law and discipline , and government corruption are inevitable .  
Had we been conservative , restrained by the routine , and not brave enough to do anything , we would still be suffering from the restraints of " two any-and-alls " and caught in endless discussions on whether this or that is " socialist " or " capitalist . "  We would be unable to blaze this new trail of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Tibet learned firsthand that the Chinese Communist Party is the faithful representative of the interests of all the peoples of Tibet . The socialist road is the road which Tibet must take for economic development , national progress , long-lasting social order , and the well-being of the people .  Resolutely protecting the unity of the motherland , opposing ethnic division , and strengthening ethnic unity is a basic premise by which the cause of revolution and construction in Tibet will be a success .  
At present , whether or not the public security organs at various levels can protect advanced social productive forces according to law , protect and develop the advanced socialist culture , or protect , develop , and realize the fundamental interests of the broadest public depends crucially on whether or not we can carry through to the end the campaign of rectifying and improving public order , i.e . , " stern crackdown , " spearheaded by " crackdown on underworld forces and eradication of vicious forces . "  
In carrying out political structure reforms , we want to further carry forward socialist democracy and legal system , perfect the specific systems of socialist democracy , ensure that the people can fully exercise their rights of democratic election , democratic decisionmaking , democratic management , and democratic supervision , boost the vitality of the party and state , fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the grass roots and the masses , promote the effort to make decisionmaking a scientific and democratic affair , and bring into further play the superiority and characteristics of the socialist system .  
In carrying out political structure reforms , we want to further carry forward socialist democracy and legal system , perfect the specific systems of socialist democracy , ensure that the people can fully exercise their rights of democratic election , democratic decisionmaking , democratic management , and democratic supervision , boost the vitality of the party and state , fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the grass roots and the masses , promote the effort to make decisionmaking a scientific and democratic affair , and bring into further play the superiority and characteristics of the socialist system .  
After 20 years of economic reform and development , a mechanism of steady growth in fiscal revenue compatible with socialist market economy has been basically established .  It has demonstrated tremendous vitality .  
Meanwhile , we must acutely seize the fundamental impetus that the rapid growth of science and technology has given to the world 's productive forces and to the economic and social development of mankind , and must seize the objective trend that new and major leaps will surely emerge during the future development of science and technology ; and we must always pay great attention to closely integrating the need to give play to the advantages of China 's socialist system with the need to master , apply , and develop advanced science and technology .  
Rectifying and standardizing the cultural market order is the inherent demand for putting the important idea of " three represents " into practice and for vigorously developing China 's advanced culture .  Rectifying and standardizing the cultural market order is necessary in order to build and perfect the socialist market economy system and to meet the challenges brought about by China 's accession to the World Trade Organization . Rectifying and standardizing the cultural market order is also necessary in order to purify the social environment and to guarantee that the masses of young people grow up healthily .  
Thanks to the establishment and improvement in the socialist market economy , the strategic readjustment of the economic structure , and the diversification of the forms of public ownership and the rapid development of other non-public sectors since the implementation of the revised Trade Union Law , profound changes have been effected in economic and labor exchanges .  
At the present stage , the advanced nature of communist party members should naturally find expression in their conscientious study of Deng Xiaoping Theory and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents , " and find expression in their conscious efforts to plunge themselves into socialist economic , political , and cultural buildings with Chinese characteristics .  
However , with the continuous development of the socialist market economy in our country , the task of ensuring the clear definition of property rights , smooth transactions in property rights , and the safety of such transactions has become increasingly important , and the provisions of the general rules of civil law on real right now do not quite meet the requirements of the developing socialist market economy .  So it is urgently needed to enact a complete law on real right .  
We must perceive the major political , economic , cultural , and science and technology changes that have taken place in the world since the publication of the " Communist Manifesto " 150 years ago ; we must perceive the major changes that have occurred in China 's socialist construction ; and we must perceive the major changes that have taken place in the working and living conditions and social environment of the party members , cadres , and masses .  
Zeng Peiyan says : Looking ahead , China will , by the middle of the next century , have attained its third-step strategic objective and become an affluent , powerful , democratic , and civil socialist modern country and the Chinese nation will have achieved its great revitalization !  
It is necessary to pay close attention to the realization of strategic adjustment of the economic structure in our country through technological progress and innovations , and to the implementation of the strategy of " making China known to the outside world , " as well as to the establishment and improvement of a complete set of systems and mechanisms needed for developing the socialist market economy .  
With General Secretary Jiang 's caring and support , Shenzhen will work hard to catch up with advanced currents of scientific and technological development of the world by vigorously relying on scientific and technological innovation and system innovation ; Shenzhen will , according to the spirit of the instruction of " creating new strong points and moving to a higher level , " seek to be the first to achieve socialist modernization , so as to make greater contributions to the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
In addition , the State Council has drawn up more than 800 sets of administrative laws , and regulations and local people 's congresses and their standing committees have drawn up more than 7,000 local laws and regulations .  A preliminary framework of the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics has thus been formed .  
It is of major practical significance and far-reaching historical significance .  Through two decades of reforms and opening up , China 's comprehensive national strength has notably increased and a socialist market economic system has been preliminarily established .  Thus , conditions are ripe for accelerating the development of China 's western regions .  
The basic meaning of " one country , two systems " is that within the PRC , the main body of the state persists in practicing the socialist system , while post - reversion Hong Kong and Macao , and Taiwan - - after this problem has been finally resolved - - are established as SARs and continue to maintain their existing capitalist system .  This is a basic long-term national policy .  
But we also have to realize that over the past 20 years , the world has witnessed great changes in economic and scientific domains and China also has undergone great changes in economic and social aspects .  China has formed a mechanism for socialist market economy .  Our current efforts to develop the country 's vast western region means a great development project under the condition of new science and technology .  
Therefore , it is imperative to enact a legislative law in accordance with the Constitution to institute unified regulations on the enactment of laws , ordinances and rules and regulations so that they will be more standardized and systematic in order to safeguard uniformity of the state 's legal system and establish and improve a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics .  This will be of great significance in advancing the rule of country in accordance with law and build a socialist country governed by law .  
As the coming decade is the critical period for China in marching toward the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive , the establishment of a relatively perfect socialist market economic structure and the maintenance of the sustained , rapid , and healthy growth of the national economy are two major issues that must be properly solved .  
The nation provides effective assurance , on a system , legal , and material level , for the enjoyment and realization of human rights , initially forming a socialist human rights safeguard system with special Chinese characteristics , and thus enabling Chinese human rights to truly possess a widespread , equal , and authentic nature .  
Zeng Peiyan says : Looking ahead , China will , by the middle of the next century , have attained its third-step strategic objective and become an affluent , powerful , democratic , and civil socialist modern country and the Chinese nation will have achieved its great revitalization !

With General Secretary Jiang 's caring and support , Shenzhen will work hard to catch up with advanced currents of scientific and technological development of the world by vigorously relying on scientific and technological innovation and system innovation ; Shenzhen will , according to the spirit of the instruction of " creating new strong points and moving to a higher level , " seek to be the first to achieve socialist modernization , so as to make greater contributions to the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics .

This is a basic long-term national policy .  
But we also have to realize that over the past 20 years , the world has witnessed great changes in economic and scientific domains and China also has undergone great changes in economic and social aspects .  China has formed a mechanism for socialist market economy .

Therefore , it is imperative to enact a legislative law in accordance with the Constitution to institute unified regulations on the enactment of laws , ordinances and rules and regulations so that they will be more standardized and systematic in order to safeguard uniformity of the state 's legal system and establish and improve a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics .  This will be of great significance in advancing the rule of country in accordance with law and build a socialist country governed by law .  
As the coming decade is the critical period for China in marching toward the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive , the establishment of a relatively perfect socialist market economic structure and the maintenance of the sustained , rapid , and healthy growth of the national economy are two major issues that must be properly solved .  
The nation provides effective assurance , on a system , legal , and material level , for the enjoyment and realization of human rights , initially forming a socialist human rights safeguard system with special Chinese characteristics , and thus enabling Chinese human rights to truly possess a widespread , equal , and authentic nature .  
We must , in the patriotic spirit of Comrades Li Fuchun and Cai Chang , encourage the entire party and the people of the whole country to support from beginning to end taking economic construction as the center , industriously establishing China as a powerful , democratic , and civilized modernized socialist country , realizing the grand reemergence of the People 's Republic in the 21st Century .  
Third , in the face of the mutual impacts of the various different ideologies and cultures in the world , it is not enough for us to depend only on the method of controlling the information flow ; and we must also improve the quality of socialist cultural products and give shape to a common ideal and a spiritual pillar of the Chinese nation in the whole society .  
Long Yongtu , China 's chief representative at the talks regarding China 's accession to the WTO ( World Trade Organization ) , stated today that , during the process of participating in the future globalization of the world 's economy , China will continue to be resolute and unswerving in constructing a socialist market economy , insisting on opening up to the outside and conducting its affairs strictly in keeping with international norms and practices .  
The CPC as the ruling party and our country as a socialist state under the leadership of the Communist Party must never allow the continued existence and development of such barbarous , decadent , backward , and ugly social evils .  
We have mentioned earlier in this article that the Taiwan authorities , who are holding high the " democracy and human rights " banner , have always vilified the motherland and the Chinese Communists to seek benefits for themselves .  As a result of extensive publicity and slander over a long period , a simple psychological pattern has been created in the Taiwan people that the mainland 's socialist system and the Chinese Communists ' leadership is no good and not free and democratic , whereas Taiwan 's capitalist system is good , free , and democratic .  
With regard to the work contents , priority should be given to grasping the ideological and moral education and the training to foster their ability in practice and , through launching healthy , useful , lively , and specific activities , strive to let the patriotic , collective , and socialist ideas be deeply rooted in their young hearts so as to gradually form fine morality and lofty sentiments in their daily conduct , and to constantly enhance their ability in mental and physical work and skills in adapting themselves to society .  
Deng Xiaoping advanced the theory on the implementation of the open policy in socialist states and took the open policy as a basic national policy on China 's socialist construction .  To gain advantages comparable with that of capitalism , Deng noted , socialism should boldly absorb and use all civilized achievements created by human society , including developed capitalist states ' advanced operational and managerial approaches that reflect the law of modern socialized production .  
Fourth , colleges , universities , scientific and technological research institutes , and hi-tech enterprises in the vicinity of the S &amp; T park should also make contributions to local development , converting scientific and technological achievements , fostering professional personnel , promoting education , paying taxes according to law , building a civilized community , and promoting socialist spiritual civilization .  
Li Lanqing said at the end : To popularize scientific knowledge across the whole society , to establish scientific thinking , to promote scientific spirit , and to publicize scientific methods suit the need for implementing the strategy of developing China through science and education , for upgrading the masses ' qualities , and for facilitating a healthy development in our socialist material and spiritual civilization construction .  The tasks also suit the need for eliminating the poison inflicted by ignorance , superstition , various pseudosciences , and antisciences ; for safeguarding social stability ;  
We have accumulated an important experience in these past years .  That is , the more complex the situation is , the more arduous the tasks , and the more acute the struggle is , the more we should firmly adhere to Deng Xiaoping Theory and the party 's basic line , basic principle , and basic program and unswervingly concentrate our efforts in effecting an upswing in our economic construction , and make unremitting efforts to fulfill the party 's general goal and task during the socialist primary stage .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that to build our party well , we must , in the first place , help our party 's leading cadres at all levels improve their ideological and political quality .  Particularly we must strive to help the middle-aged and young leading cadres improve their ideological and political quality so that they will become a new generation of statesmen who remain loyal to Marxism and unswervingly adhere to the socialist road with Chinese characteristics , and are capable of running the party and the country .  
To this end we need to make unremitting exploration and constantly sum up experience .  As far as legislation is concerned , we will continue to uphold the principle of proceeding from China 's national conditions , safeguard consistency in the legal system based on the constitution , persist in the integration of legislation with major decisions concerning reform and development , ensure by the means of system and legislation the implementation of the state 's major political line , expedite socialist modernization , thus ensure the country 's prosperity and perpetual political stability .  
Thoroughly and correctly implementing the legislation law , further strengthening government legislative work , improving the quality of government legislative work , and safeguarding the unity of the socialist legal system is an important responsibility of the local people 's governments concerned and the State Council departments , and is also a major task in the building of the government legal system .  
since our party represents the orientation for the progress of China 's advanced culture , it must persistently take Marxism as the guide , inherit and develop all fine cultural traditions of the Chinese nation , study and absorb all the fruits of human civilization , and continually build and create socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , so that material and spiritual civilization will develop in coordinated fashion and promote the all-round progress of society ;  
Luo Gan pointed out : In independently exercising judicial authority according to law , people 's courts should endeavor to ensure judicial fairness and provide expeditious and effective judicial guarantee and legal service for helping develop the advanced productive forces , protecting the advanced culture , and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people .  Judicial fairness is related to the building of a socialist country ruled by the law and to the overall situation of reform , development , and stability .  
Having made achievements of world interest during the five decades since it came into power in leading the people in carrying out socialist revolution and construction as well as the reform and opening to the outside world and in unremittingly struggling to build a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist modern country , our party is worthy of being the choice of history and the people .  
under the guidance of Marxism , to constantly build and develop a national , scientific , and popular socialist culture with Chinese characteristics that is oriented to modernization , the world , and the future so as to bring about coordinated development of the socialist material and spiritual civilizations and promote comprehensive social progress ;  
Viewed as a whole , all of our party 's efforts in leading the revolution , construction , and reform have been for emancipating and developing the productive forces and for advancing the development of China 's socialist democratic politics and culture and thus have complied with the objective law of social development , conformed to the advanced trends of development of the times , safeguarded the overall interests of the Chinese nation , and accorded with the fundamental demands of the masses of the people .  
He stressed that since reform and opening up which started more than 20 years ago , relatively great achievements have been scored by China in various economic and social undertakings .  At present , China 's economic structural reform and political structural reform are being simultaneously carried out and continuously deepened .  Governing the country according to laws and building China into a country with socialist legal system have been written in the constitution as the general plan for the administration of the country .  
He emphasized that in the more than 20 years of reform and opening up , China 's economic and social undertakings have made good progress .  China 's restructuring of the economic system and political reform are being implemented at the same time and are continuously being deepened .  China has made governing the country according to law and constructing a socialist lawful country its general plan of government and has written that into its Constitution .  
He stressed : Over the 20-plus years of reform and opening up , the Chinese economy and various social undertakings have made great strides .  At present , the reforms of China 's economic and political structures are going synchronously and getting deeper and deeper .  We take the rule of law and the building of a socialist legal system as the blueprint for governing our country and have written it into the Constitution .  
Thirdly , the ultimate goal of our efforts to liberate and develop our productive forces and to build a socialist spiritual civilization is to satisfy the people 's growing material demands in their everyday life , that is , to better represent the fundamental interests of the broad masses and serve them wholeheartedly .  
In the final analysis , all struggles carried out by our party were aimed at liberating and developing productive forces ; and all guiding principles and policies adopted by our party are aimed at eventually ensuring continuous development of productive forces , boosting national economic development , raising the overall national strength , building socialist material and spiritual civilizations , satisfying the people 's increasing material and cultural needs , and becoming more representative of the people 's fundamental interests .  
Endeavoring to represent demand of development of advanced productive forces is a solemn mission and sacred responsibility of our party .  Party committees at all levels , every grass-roots party organization , and every party member should work hand in hand to serve as a good " representative " of demand of development of advanced productive forces .  They should consistently maintain the party 's progressiveness and provide a strong political and organizational assurance for our socialist modernization drive .  
In his speech , Jiang Zemin put forward and expounded on how to understand the historical process of the development of socialism and capitalism , the impact of the practice of China 's socialist reform on people 's thinking , the influence of the contemporary international environment and international political struggle , and other major issues that have a direct bearing on the mental state of cadres and the masses .  He urged all party comrades to jointly conduct in-depth study in an effort to acquire scientific knowledge in the ideological and political sphere .  
The criteria for judging all party tasks should be whether they are conducive to liberating and developing the productive forces ; to reinforcing the comprehensive national strength of a socialist state ; and to raising the living standard .  
integrated reform efforts , development speed , and social capacity for acceptance ; and formulated a series of principles and policies on developing the productive forces .  We should seize opportunities and advance in an enterprising spirit so as to secure a new great victory in reform , opening up , and socialist modernization .  
The questions of how we should approach the current international and domestic situations , how we should approach the various problems cropping up in China 's reform and opening up especially in the course of building a socialist market economy , and how we should face the difficulties and challenges facing our economic and social lives all have to do with the political conviction of party-member cadres and all the more with the confidence and morale of the broad masses of the people .  It will not do not to face and not to look at them squarely .  
The successful practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the liveliest and most convincing teaching material , and the various advanced individuals who emerged from among us and their advanced and typical deeds are the liveliest and most current and brilliant teaching materials .  We must carry out education in ideals and conviction with perfect assurance and push ahead socialist civilization building unwaveringly .  
it should persist in " grasping two links at the same time and giving equal importance to both of them , " vigorously step up the building of the socialist spiritual civilization , strive to improve the ideological and moral standards and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation , bring up a new generation of people who have lofty ideals and moral integrity and who are well-educated and self-disciplined , and create a political atmosphere of respecting knowledge and talented people in the party ;  
When the Five-Starred flag rose up slowly on both banks of the Victoria Harbor three years ago , people were filled with great joy , yet there was still a faint trace of worry on their mind : After Hong Kong returns to socialist China , will this " free port " be able to retain its original vigor and appeal , and will it continue to enjoy prosperity and stability ?  
We must understand , think over , and resolve , in accordance with the intrinsic relations among society , economics , politics , and culture , the question of how our party can better represent the advance orientation of China 's advanced culture , always uphold Marxism as the guide , and strive to understand and master the characteristics and laws of cultural construction so as to continuously create and push ahead the culture with Chinese characteristics , develop socialist materialist and spiritual civilizations in a coordinated way , and achieve overall social progress .  
The leadership collective of the third generation of the party with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has all the more attached importance to and strengthened the building of socialist spiritual civilization , made continuous new advances in this aspect while persisting in taking economic construction as the center and paying close attention to the building of material civilization , and clearly and definitely set and gradually and systematically expounded the task of building a culture with Chinese characteristics .  
Adequately understanding the importance and urgency of cultural construction in line with the requirements of its 15th National Congress and from the height of the prosperity of the socialist cause and national rejuvenation is an important prerequisite for the entire party to better represent the advance orientation of China 's advanced culture .  
To put it another way , we must develop a national , scientific , and popular socialist culture that is geared to the needs of modernization , the world , and the future , with Marxism as the guide and the training of citizens who have lofty ideals , moral integrity , education , and a sense of discipline as the objective .  
Of the two , advanced ideas and ethics as socialist ideology determine the nature of the entire culture , dominate its orientation of development , and impact and even lead the social , economic , and political progress as a whole .  They are the major representative and indicator of the entire culture .  
It is fair to say that the " three represents " is essential if our party is going to adapt to the new situation , meet the new challenges , and push forward socialist modernization in an all-round way , and that it is a great strategy that has bearing on the growth , flourishing , and lasting order and stability of the party and state .  
In advancing the course of urbanization , we must , bearing in mind China 's characteristics as a country with a large population , a high percentage of rural inhabitants and a relative shortage of resources , meet the objective requirements of the process of industrialization and modernization while developing the socialist market economy , rationally plan the pattern , scale and speed of urban development as well as the functions , standards and quality of cities and towns , and take the road of urbanization that suits China 's national conditions .  
We must conscientiously sum up the experience and lessons of our work of urban and rural planning , study and learn from the successful methods of other countries , adhere to the objective laws of urban and rural development , base ourselves on the present situation while bearing in mind future needs , take the interests of all parties concerned into account in making comprehensive plans , and promote the coordinated development of the economy , the society and the environment in accordance with the overall requirements of socialist modernization .

The promulgation and implementation of this law have played a positive role in establishing and safeguarding the equal , harmonious , and civilized matrimonial family relationship , promoting the building of the socialist spiritual civilization and social progress , and maintaining social stability .  
Li Peng pointed out that along with the continuous deepening of reform , opening up , and modernization and the gradual establishment of the socialist market economic structure , relatively great changes have taken place in people 's ideological concepts and lifestyles , and some new conditions and problems have emerged in respect of the marriage and family relations .  Hence , it is extremely necessary to make relevant amendments to the existing Marriage Law .  
The Chinese Communist Party believes that the guiding role of the state-owned economy is mainly embodied in its ability to control .  The state-owned economy should have a dominant role in key areas and major industries which are the lifeline of the national economy .  Other areas can have adjustments such as " advance and retreat " and " let some things go undone , " with the proportion which is the state-owned economy reduced somewhat with no effect on the socialist nature of China .  
The fundamental switch from planned to socialist market economy has brought about tremendous changes in China 's social life and has also set new challenges and demands on ideological and political work .  
During the visit , Jiang Zemin urged all departments participating in the cooperation of war industries to implement the principle of " the integration of military and civilian use , and the integration of wartime and peacetime needs , " meet the needs of the new situation of the development of the socialist market economy , adhere to the principle of turning civilians into a part of the armed forces , and establish a vigorous structure for the development science and technology for national defense ;

The circular points out : Since the establishment of the national class-A soccer tournament system in 1994 , China has accelerated the socialization and industrialization of soccer matches .  The number of persons who have cared for and watched the soccer matches has unceasingly increased .  Soccer matches has become the component of the cultural life of the broad masses of people and the window of building socialist spiritual civilization in the urban areas .  
In view of this situation , the central authorities resolutely worked out major policy decisions to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control , and started with consolidating the financial and economic order .  To meet the demand of the new situation of building a socialist market economy system and of reform and opening up , they mainly adopted economic and legal means supplemented by essential administrative measures and adopted the " soft landing " method to deal with the overheated economy and inflation .  
2 .  Making administrative affairs transparent is a key link to promoting legal administration , realizing the basic plan for ruling the country according to law , and building a socialist country ruled by law .  
With the development of the socialist market economy and the deepening reform of the grain circulation system in our country , however , the traditional central grain reserves management system and operating mechanism obviously lagged behind , its functions were not separated from those of the government , its responsibilities were not clearly defined , and its other problems such as low efficiency and rigid management were conspicuous .  These problems adversely affected the security of grain reserves .  
The course set for advanced Chinese culture today is to build a socialist culture with Chinese characteristics .  The target is , under the guidance of Marxism , to nurture the people so that they will become educated citizens with lofty ideals , a high sense of ethics and discipline ; and to promote a national , and scientific popular socialist culture oriented toward modernization , the world , and the future .  
To represent the course of China 's advanced culture , the core requirement is to push forward the construction of the socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , which the 15th National Party Congress proposed to build .

This has provided a systematic guarantee for training a contingent of cadres who can fit in with the needs of reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization .

Old-age work is an important part of the socialist modernization undertaking , and we must make centralized plans , set up a reasonable pattern , plant our foothold in the present but set our sight in the future , and start out from this country 's basic situation to uphold the guiding principle that includes the government 's leadership , society 's initiative , the people 's participation , and orderly development .

the professional quality and work style of law enforcement do not meet the requirements of the socialist market economy and the principle of governing the country according to law .

We must make persistent and unremitting efforts to further improve the work of the procuratorates at the grass-roots level .  
We may say that the past five years had no match in history in terms of the arduous tasks of reform and construction , the complicated situation and the huge successes scored .  We have achieved the second step of the strategic objective of modernization , namely , quadrupling the per-capita gross national product by the year 2000 , basically eliminating poverty and achieving a relatively comfortable standard of living , and accelerating the establishment of the modern enterprise system and bringing about the beginning a socialist market economy .

Over the past 20-odd years since reform and opening up , China 's economic legislation work has scored tremendous achievements , but it is still a considerable distance from the institution of a comparatively perfect socialist market economic and legal system .

Therefore , we should make reform run through various aspects with a view to precipitating economic development , promoting structural adjustment , propelling market development , and opening wider to the outside world ; constantly perfect various structures that are suited to the requirements for developing the socialist market economic structure ; and break through the obstacles restricting the development of productive forces , which still exist in the current production relationship , in order to provide endless motive power to the economic development .  
Only by so doing , can they better implement their sacred mission entrusted by the party and the people .  They said : In accordance with the guiding spirit of the " proposal , " we will focus on the overall construction of the armed forces , strive to push forward socialist spiritual civilization construction as well as democratic and legal construction .  
We should take a lead in socialist spiritual civilization construction .  We should further foster close ties between the military and the government as well as between the military and the people .  We should continuously make new contributions in promoting coordinated economic and social development , in consolidating and developing China 's political stability , and in creating a good situation of social stability .  
To achieve economic development and across-the-board social progress , we must launch intensive education regarding the socialist legal system , raising the concept of the legal system on the part of all the people , but first of all the leading cadres at each level .  
As long as we steadfastly carry out the spirit of the 5th Plenary Session of the 15th Central Committee of the CPC , sticking to economic development and coordinated social development and launching our various tasks in a comprehensive and down-to-earth manner , our drive to socialist modernization is bound to take the step up to the next level .  
He stressed that the purpose of amending the marriage law is to better safeguard equal , harmonious , and civilized marriages and family relations ; protect the legitimate rights and interests of women , children , and old people ; and promote socialist spiritual civilization and material civilization .  
We should unswervingly arm the minds of young cadres with Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought and , in particular , Deng Xiaoping Theory , foster their fine style with the party 's fine traditions and strict management , enhance their professional level with modern scientific and technological knowledge and the fine achievements of civilization created by human society , and heighten the quality of young cadres in all respects , so as to guarantee that the cause of socialist modernization will be carried forward and forged ahead in a pioneering spirit .  
We should give full consideration to the characteristics of the ideological work , which should be adapted to the requirements of the socialist market economic system and which should be conducive to strengthening party leadership , to giving full play to the initiative of propaganda and cultural workers , and to promoting the development and prosperity of various undertakings .  We should publish more works of excellence to satisfy the increasing spiritual and cultural needs of the people .  
Especially , since the start of reform and opening , nationalities of our country have made tremendous achievements in producing common prosperity and progress in the process of economic development , and have worked continually to consolidate socialist nationality relationships based on equality , unity , and mutual help ; the Chinese nation has shown strong cohesion amid changes in the international situation .  
The Law on the National Common Language adopted at this meeting will provide a correct guide for the normalization , standardization , and healthy growth of our national common spoken and written languages ; and it is therefore conducive to the country 's reunification and national unity , and to our building of socialist material and spiritual civilizations .  The passing of the revised Law on Fisheries is of great significance to stepping up our protection , multiplication , development , and rational utilization of fishery resources ;  
We should persistently rectify and eliminate chaos and ignorance .  We should establish constructive models while eliminating negative ones in accordance with the policy of promoting positive examples while discarding bad elements .  We should correctly handle the ties between the inheritance and creation of nationalities ' traditional culture , increase cultural exchanges among fraternal nationalities , absorb the accomplishments of all the civilizations of mankind , and upgrade the educational level of Tibet 's various nationalities so as to provide powerful spiritual driving force and intellectual support for developing Tibet into a new socialist region .  
Li Peng pointed out : Over the past 20-odd years since reform and opening up , guided by the basic principle of developing the socialist democracy and amplifying the socialist legal system proposed by the party 's central committee and Comrade Deng Xiaoping , China 's legislative work has scored spectacular achievements .  
He said : Generally speaking , China basically has had laws to abide by in its major spheres of political life , economic life , and social life .  The framework of a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics taking the constitution as the core has taken shape , which has laid down a solid foundation for the institution of a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics .  
In the meantime , the legislative work should reflect the direction of the advanced culture and , through properly grasping the legislative work in the spheres of education , science and technology , culture , and so on , create a fine legal environment for carrying forward China 's advanced culture , facilitating the building of socialist spiritual civilization , implementing the strategy of rejuvenating the country on the strength of science and education , and promoting social progress in a comprehensive way .  
We should continue to persist in placing the economic legislation in the primary position , speed up formulating some laws and regulations urgently needed for the development of the socialist market economic structure , and perfect the legal system that is suited to the socialist market economic structure in line with the requirements put forth by the fifth plenary session of the 15th party central committee . 
It is also necessary to speed up formulating and perfecting the laws and regulations in the areas of developing socialist democratic politics , standardizing the administrative and judicial systems , tightening the supervision over power operation , promoting the building of a clean and honest government , and so on , in a bid to push forward the political structural reform and deepen the administrative and judicial structural reforms .  
Facing such an intricate and complex international political , economic , and military struggle , in order to safeguard China 's national security and the unification of our motherland , ensure a smooth progress for our great socialist cause , and protect the fundamental interests of the people of the entire country , we must enhance our awareness of guarding against possible future mishaps and must reinforce our national defense building .  
Since the founding of new China 50 years ago , particularly 20 years since China implemented the policy of reform and opening up , the broad mass of journalist workers have enthusiastically plunged into the great practice of socialist building and reform ; ardently spread Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory and the party 's line , principles , and policies ; truthfully reflected the Chinese people 's spiritual outlook of engaging in pioneering work ;  
Jiang Chunyun stressed : Further efforts should be made to strengthen the building of legal systems and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of economic and technological entities and legal persons with laws and regulations , strive to create a good investment environment , establish good social order , and build the demonstration zone into a new community with socialist material and spiritual civilizations .  
Comrade Deng Xiaoping , chief architect of our country 's socialist reform and opening up , led all party comrades in emancipating their minds , seeking truth from facts , observing the characteristics of the times and the current international situation in an all-round way , summing up foreign and domestic socialist construction as well as historical and immediate experiences , and conducting difficult explorations , thus making important achievements in the theory and practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
On condition that the basic socialist system is upheld , the special economic zones have taken the lead in carrying out reform , gaining fresh experiences in exploring ways to undertake socialist modernization with Chinese characteristics .  In the historic process of shifting from the planned economy to a socialist market economy , the special economic zones have played an important role as a testing ground ;  
The development of the Shenzhen and other special economic zones and the New Pudong District is a splendid miniature and a vivid reflection of the historic changes and great achievements made in our country since the beginning of its reform and opening up as well as an effective confirmation of correct party leadership and the superiority of the socialist system .  
The important purpose of systemic innovation is to overcome the factors in the relations of production and the superstructure that hinder the development of the productive forces and to keep liberating and developing the productive forces .  We should uphold the basic economic system under which the socialist public ownership is dominant while economic sectors of diverse forms of ownership develop side by side ;  
They should be good at learning from and drawing on all the outstanding achievements of human civilizations and at inheriting and carrying forward all the outstanding ideas , morals , and cultural traditions of the Chinese nation ; they should effectively resist the corroding influence of all negative , decadent ideologies and cultures and always maintain the socialist mental outlook .  
At present , we should conscientiously study the knowledge relating to the socialist market economy , transform our concepts on financial and economic work , quicken the pace of building the public finance suited to China 's national conditions , further adjust and optimize the financial revenue-expenditure structure , incrementally reduce investment in the profit-making and operational spheres , vigorously cut down the administrative and institutional spending , push the operational institutions into the market , and concentrate the use of financial resources mainly on the areas of social and public necessities and social security .  
Since the founding of the New China , the Chinese Government has constantly been working hard to protect and develop human rights , and has made unremitting efforts to eliminate poverty and backwardness , to build a wealthy and powerful socialist modern country with a high degree of democracy and civilization , and to realize the ideal of human rights .  Great achievements have also been made in this regard .  
4 ) Publicizing patriotism and socialist spiritual civilization : The wealth of themes vividly expressed on the colorful commemorative gold and silver coins , together with the appreciation of thousands upon thousands of collectors , makes it possible for patriotism and the aim of socialist spiritual civilization building to merge imperceptibly into the masses ' spiritual and cultural lives . 
Minister of Finance Xiang Huaicheng stressed at the closing ceremony : As our country 's fiscal work will be faced with great opportunities and challenges in the new century , we must adapt to changes in the environment both at home and abroad , firmly grasp the initiative in fiscal work , and concentrate efforts on structuring a framework of public finance suited to the requirements of the socialist market economy and on building stable , balanced , and strong state finances to better serve the overall interests of economic and social development .  
Xiang Huaicheng demanded : With the gradual establishment of the socialist market economic system , comrades engaged in fiscal work must conscientiously change their mentality by changing their thinking from that of the planned finance in the past to that of public finance . 
At present , women 's federations should particularly do a good job in conducting education in current situation and policies , education in socialist ethics , and education in Marxist materialism , atheism and scientific approach in light of the progress of reform and development and the actual thinking of women ; and guide the broad masses of women to further firm their belief in Marxism , their faith in building socialism with Chinese characteristics , their confidence in reform , opening up and modernization , and their trust in the party and the government .  
On the work of training and selecting woman cadres , Hu Jintao said : It is necessary to train a large number of qualified women leaders who always adhere to the requirements of the " three represents , " who are really up to the mark in political quality , professional knowledge and working ability , and who are capable of performing important tasks in the new century ; and this training task is an indispensable requirement of our party during the course of leading the people to comprehensively advance socialist modernization .  
Especially during the past 20 and more years since the introduction of reform and opening up , the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association and the Chinese Catholic Bishops College have cooperated with each other closely , forged ahead in unity , assisted the party and government in implementing the policy of religious freedom , pushed forward the development of patriotic organizations , vigorously nurtured middle-aged and young patriotic clerics , actively promoted democratic management of churches , striven to adapt to socialist society , and brought about progress and development in various church undertakings by leaps and bounds .  
Wang Zhaoguo pointed out : The past 50 years of history fully proved that the anti-imperialist patriotic movement is a successful practice of the Catholic circle 's patriotic spirit .  Independent and self-reliant management of churches is a correct choice of Chinese Catholic clerics and believers in line with China 's history and actual situation , and it is the necessary path for Chinese Catholicism to be consistent with socialist society .  
We must vigorously step up cultural construction , grasp the spirit of the age , stick to the correct orientation , and make full use of a variety of modern media means , especially broadcasting , television , and the Internet , in making efforts to consolidate and expand the socialist cultural position and form a healthy and uplifting environment of public opinion , a civilized and harmonious social atmosphere , and a rich and varied cultural life .  
The Communist Party of China , which is now leading the Chinese people to carry out reform , opening up , and socialist modernization construction , is willing to continue developing friendly and cooperative relations with the Communist Party of the Russian Federation on the basis of the principle of " independence , autonomy , complete equality , mutual respect , and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs . "  
The leadership collective persists in pooling the united front 's strength and wisdom from all sides for the central task of economic construction , thereby forging a united , stable , invigorating , and active political situation , and spurring the constant advancement of China 's reform , opening up , and modernization drive .  The leadership collective upholds and perfects the system of multi-party cooperation led by the CPC and the system of political consultation , thereby promoting socialist democratic political construction and further strengthening the people 's democratic dictatorship and state power .  
In his speech at the meeting , Li Peng , chairman of the National People 's Congress ( NPC ) Standing Committee , pointed out that the convening of this grand meeting in China indicates that China 's tremendous achievements in the building of legal system have attracted worldwide attention , that law education and research in China have an increasingly extensive impact on the global affairs , and that the world is extremely concerned about the building of a socialist country ruled by law in China .  
Over the past 20-odd years since reform and opening up , considerable headway has been made in developing socialist democracy and perfecting the socialist legal system in China , and the framework of a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics that takes the constitution as the core has shaped up , which has laid a solid foundation for the practice of governing the country according to law and the building of a socialist country ruled by law .  
With reference to these issues , the city party committee organized people concerned to earnestly study relevant documents and analyze the case example of former city mayor Mo Miaorong who took up the road of crime , and let the people concerned understand that under the new situation of carrying out reform and opening up and developing socialist market economy , in order to keep cool-headedness and withstand rigorous tests , leading cadres must stress study , politics , and healthy tendencies . 
With reference to the disastrous consequences brought about by the drastic changes in the former Soviet Union and East Europe to the countries and peoples there as well as the development of the socialist undertakings since the founding of PRC 50 years ago , especially the brilliant achievements attained since reform and opening up over the last 20 years in China , they more deeply understand that the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the only correct road for consolidating and developing socialism in China , realizing national rejuvenation , and making China powerful and prosperous .  
In the new century , the party 's basic requirements for the united front are to hold high the banner of patriotism and socialism , unite with all forces that can be united , bring all positive factors into play , and turn native factors into positive ones to serve the purposes of developing socialist economics , politics , and culture with Chinese characteristics , maintaining the political situation characterized by unity and stability , realizing the complete reunification of the motherland , and safeguarding world peace and promoting common development .  
These associations have not only become new forces , but have also played a more important role in supporting and developing poor areas , serving the community , carrying out ideological and political work in the grass roots , and building democracy , the legal system , and socialist spiritual civilization .  
On the one hand , as a socialist country , China upholds the principal role of public ownership in the economic field , adheres to the leading position of the CPC in the political field , and persists in the guiding role of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory in the ideological and cultural fields .  The people 's uniformity has tremendously increased in terms of fundamental interests , common ideals , and target of endeavor .  
[ Wang ] Upon entering the new century , the party 's basic requirements on united front work are : Holding high the banner of patriotism and socialism ; uniting with all the forces that can be united ; mobilizing all positive factors ; turning negative factors into positive ones ; catering to the establishment of socialist economy , politics , and culture with Chinese characteristics ; catering to the political situation of stability and unity ; catering to the realization of the motherland 's complete reunification ; catering to world peace ; and catering to common development .  
In conclusion , Zhu Rongji emphatically pointed out : Cracking down on fraudulent practice in tax reimbursement for export not only can strengthen and improve macro-control , prevent economic losses of the state and promote a healthy development of the economy but also are of great significance in implementing the policy of running the country according to the law , improving and normalizing the order of socialist market economy and severely punishing corrupt elements .  
For one reason or another , however , underworld evil forces are still developing and spreading in some localities in these years , and they are swollen with arrogance .  Where such forces are rampant , people dare not report to the authorities the crimes committed by these forces and make complaints about their sufferings .  Now , underworld evil forces of one kind or another have gravely jeopardized the safety of our people 's life and property and seriously disrupted our socialist market economy and social order .  
The crimes of criminal and evil forces of all kinds have already done serious damage to the stability of social order , seriously threatened the safety of the masses ' lives and property , seriously damaged order in socialist market economy and in social management , corrupted the party , government , and judicial cadre force , eroded grassroots political power , and ruined the party style and social mood .  
We should do well the double-support work under the new situation , unite with and mobilize the broad masses of servicemen and people to strive for the fulfillment of our party 's historical tasks .  It is of important and profound significance to boosting our economic strength , to increasing our defense capabilities , to carrying forward our socialist ideology , ethics and culture , and to practicing our party 's fundamental aim of serving the people wholeheartedly .  
Our double-support work should meet the demand of the important thinking on the " three represents , " take the development of our social productive forces and the enhancement of our troops ' combat effectiveness as our fundamental starting point and standpoint .  We should follow the important principle of treating well the relations involving our army , government and civilians from the high plane of stressing politics , so that their unity will constantly consolidate and develop and make a still greater contribution to our reform , opening up and socialist modernization .  
Hu Jintao noted : Youths are the most active and dynamic force in the entire society .  In the face of a rapid scientific and technological development in today 's world and under China 's current conditions of reform , opening up , and socialist market economic development , in particular , young people are playing an increasingly important role in our economic and social lives .  
The Beijing Municipal CPC Committee , which is putting into practice the guidelines laid down by the 15th CPC National Congress and the fifth plenary session of the 15th Central Committee , has defined the capital 's development strategy for the new century , taking Beijing 's actual conditions into account .  For the first step , namely in the period from now until 2010 , Beijing will basically achieve socialist modernization before other cities throughout the country , building up the basic framework of a modern international metropolis .  
Huang Ju said that in the Tenth Five-Year Plan period , Shanghai will , while aiming for the goal and sticking to the mainline of raising the city 's comprehensive competitiveness , constantly raise the information technology , marketization , and rule-of-law levels that are worthy of the name of a metropolis that embarks on socialist modernization and that strives to become a big international city .  It will also make great efforts developing industrial sectors that produce high value-added products , that create business opportunities for other sectors , and that generate more employment .  
The Vietnamese Government and people are sincerely grateful to and will never forget the Chinese Government and people for their valuable support and selfless assistance rendered when Vietnam carried out its struggles for national liberation and socialist construction .  The two countries have ceremoniously celebrated the 50th anniversary of the establishment of Vietnamese-Chinese diplomatic ties and bilateral ties are now in a very sound stage of development .  
During the July-September period , public security organs across the country , with close coordination of other departments , launched a campaign to tighten the management of places of entertainment and service .  They carried out a severe crackdown on prostitution , gambling , drug trafficking , and other social evils .  They also tightened the management of places where electronic games were available .  They have made contributions to improving the social environment and promoting a socialist spiritual civilization .  
is a central link that unites the whole party and people of all ethnic groups of the entire country in their fulfillment of all the tasks set by the party and the state ; and is also a major political advantage enjoyed by our party and our socialist country .  Only when we give full play to the ideological-political work , which is our political advantage , can we ensure that our economic work as well as work in other fields can develop towards a correct direction ;  
Over the past few years , our country has made much headway in furthering a social security structural reform in light of such needs as developing a socialist market economy ; has preliminarily established a basic old-age security system , a basic medical security system , an unemployment security system for staff and workers of urban enterprises , and a minimum livelihood security system for urban residents ; and has laid down a basic framework for a social security system .  
Zeng : In putting the large-scale western development into effect , we should take reform and opening up as a powerful dynamic , make positive exploration , be bold to bring forth new ideas , deepen economic structural reform , and quicken the pace of establishing and perfecting the socialist market economic structure ;  
They highly praised the brilliant achievements scored in China under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , and felt elated and inspired by the sustained development of social productive forces , the continuously elevated standards of the people 's material and cultural lives , the gradual advance of the socialist democratic politics , and the excellent situation of national unity , national unification , and social stability .  
Based on the need to attain the strategic objectives for the third stage of China 's socialist modernization drive and the need to win the competition in comprehensive national strength in the present-day world , we must seize the opportunity , bravely press ahead , always take institutional innovation and scientific and technological innovation as the driving force , and step up the development of high-tech industry in our country .  
We must not be faint-hearted and hesitant in dealing with the handful of criminals who , with ulterior political motives , held fast to their anti-government , anti-social and anti-people stand , and organized and instigated deceived Falungong maniacs to openly stir up trouble , disrupt public order , and undermine social stability in their attempt to undermine the cause of socialist modernization .  We must deal a resolute blow to them and punish them severely in accordance with law , and must not leave any openings for future trouble .  
The tourism areas and tourism service units should vigorously carry out healthy and beneficial tourism activities , exploit potential humanity values of sight-seeing spots for tourism , combine tourism development with efforts to enhance socialist spiritual civilization construction , advocate the national culture through the tourism window , enhance patriotism education , and promote international cultural exchanges .  
Third , we need to reform the agricultural scientific and technological management structure , set up an open , mobile , competitive , and coordinated agricultural scientific and technological operational mechanism , and gradually form a new-type management structure suited to the socialist market economic development .  
It is necessary to vigorously carry forward the lofty ideology and spirit of selfless dedication of the labor models , cultivate a worker rank with ideals , ethics , culture , and discipline , guide and stimulate the workers to actively plunge into the building of socialist material and spiritual civilization , and persistently influence and lead forward the whole of society with the advanced ideology of the working class .  
The first - generation party leadership launched the land revolution , which stimulated the initiative and creativity of the millions of peasants to a tremendous extent , smoothly completed the socialist transformation of agriculture and traditional industry , and laid the firm foundation for the initial stage of socialism .  
The ulterior motive of Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " cult in spreading rumors to confuse the public , breaking the law and creating trouble is to create chaos and social disorder in China , disrupt people 's normal work , study and daily life , and interfere with the central task of economic development , so that they can realize their political aim of overthrowing the leadership of the Chinese communist party and changing China 's socialist system .  
The " Epilogue - - China 's New Century " gave full expression to the firm determination of the entire military troops and civilian people throughout the country to closely rally around the party central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core and build our country into a rich and powerful modern socialist nation with a high degree of civilization and democracy in the new century .  
They held that the year 2000 which just passed was a year of landmark significance in the process of development in our country , as the national economy maintained a rather rapid development speed , the building of democratic politics made steady progress , the multi-party cooperation and political consultation system was further improved , and favorable conditions were created for us to comprehensively build our country into comparatively well-off society and speed up the process of socialist modernization in the new century .  
In their speeches , they also put forward opinions and proposals on how to better maintain and improve the CPC-led multi-party cooperation and political consultation system , further deepen reforms , promote sustained economic development , safeguard the political situation of stability and unity , enhance socialist democracy and the building of the legal system , and advance the building of socialist spiritual civilization in the new year .  
Jiang Zemin said : Practice has proved again and again that giving full play to the positive role of the democratic parties , the federation of industrialists and businessmen , and public figures without party affiliations in the state 's economic , political , and social lives is conducive to strengthening and improving the leadership of the Communist Party , conductive to advancing socialist democratic politics , and conducive to our economic and social development and to our social stability and unity .  
He said : During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , the sports front persisted in carrying out the party 's principles and policies in the physical culture work , persistently took the improvement of the people 's physique as its principal task , and adhered to the principle of combining popularization with enhancement and promoting the coordinated development of mass sports and athletic competition , so that it has scored tremendous achievements and made significant contributions to the building of the socialist material and spiritual civilizations .  
Along with the development of the socialist market economy , the law governing the exchange of commodities will easily produce corrosive influences in social political life and people 's spiritual realm , give rise to the disregard of moral principles in pursuit of profits and the exchange of power for money , and lead to the weakening of the state and collective awareness and the spirit of mutual assistance and dedication .  
Closely integrated with the new , historical conditions , the entire party must conscientiously put into practice the basic strategy of governing the country according to law and governing the country by ethics , always adhere to the principle of " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to both , " further attach importance to and step up the building of socialist ethics while continuing to step up the building of democratic legal system .  
The broad masses of transferred military cadres , on the other hand , should preserve and carry forward the fine tradition of the people 's army , serve the interests of the whole , support the reform program , and show understanding and sympathy for the difficulties experienced by the state and local authorities in trying to settle them .  They should take the initiative to obey the arrangements made by the organization and work hard at their new posts to make fresh contributions to the cause of socialist modernization .  
However , the realization of socialist modernization in rural areas can not rely on empty talk or idle waiting , but can only rely on our painstaking and unswerving efforts with innovations and efficiency .  Only by making such efforts can we usher in a bright future .  
This round of institutional reform and reorganization in the State Economic and Trade Commission and its subordinate state bureaus is another major step for forming a streamlined , unified , and highly efficient administrative structure .  This step is of great significance for achieving the goal of completely separating government institutions from enterprise management , transforming government functions , establishing and improving the socialist market economic system , enhancing the work efficiency of the government institutions , and enhancing macroeconomic control .  
We must be sincerely patient , painstaking , and fair and reasonable in our education and guidance of the majority of " Falungong " practitioners , helping them to further understand the essence of and grave threat represented by Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " organization and walk away from the preposterous world he has fabricated so they have concern for the development of the international and domestic situation , the future fate of the Party and the country , and the great enterprise of reforms and opening up and the drive to socialist modernization .  
In a written speech , Luo Guojie , professor at the Chinese People 's University , said : This thinking is an important theoretical development of socialist politics , ethics , and law , and it is bound to practically produce a positive influence on social stability and moral practice in our country and to greatly accelerate our drive for socialist modernization .  
He said : " Running the country with virtue " and instituting an ideological and moral system adapting to the developing socialist market economy are a long-term strategic task and a huge project of systems engineering , and this calls for joint efforts by people in various circles , continuously studying new situations in practice , and summing up fresh experiences .  
At the same time , it encourages grassroots authorities in the countryside to alter their functions as development of the socialist market economy demands .  It has downsized township institutions and staff , promoted village self-administration , improved the rural administrative system , and made the rural superstructure better fit the changed economic foundation .  
At his work posts , he made great contributions to the party 's ethnic work , united front work , and socialist cause .  In 1978 , he was elected as vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee . Though being at an advanced age , he still paid close attention to the unity of the people of all ethnic groups and the development of the areas inhabited by ethnic minorities , and still cared about the development and use of water resources in the motherland .  
So long as we keep the overall situation in mind , advance with the current of the times , keep in step with the development trend of the world , emancipate the mind , seek truth from facts , make concerted efforts , be keen in keeping forging ahead , then will we certainly be able to tide over all difficulties and obstacles on our way forward and make countless successes in socialist modernization .  
We must actively meet the new demands of the contemporary economic , science , technology , and social development , and speed up the establishment and perfection of a complete set of systems and mechanisms that are indispensable to developing the socialist market economy .  
Correct ideological theories and high-technology knowledge were used to arm the minds of the troops .  Great efforts were made to promote the spirit of making unswerving efforts for the realization of socialist modernization as advocated by Chairman Jiang Zemin , and prompt the vast number of officers and servicemen to become revolutionary soldiers with a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good education , and a sense of discipline , and make this their noble pursuit and action .  
Delivering a work report at the opening ceremony of the Fourth Session of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee , Ye Xuanping said : With continued deepening reform and opening up , and the tremendous changes in all China 's economic sectors , economic interests , social lifestyle , and social structure , the task is even more vital in carrying forward socialist democracy , safeguarding social unity and stability , strengthening development of socialist democracy and legal system , and correctly handling internal contradictions of the people in the new period .  
in the context of public ownership as the main body , we must steadfastly develop economic sectors under varied ownerships , which is conducive to fully mobilizing and using social resources and boosting the vitality of the national economy as a whole , as they make up an integral party of the socialist market economy .  
During the past year , the NPC and its standing committee , in line with the requirements of the important thinking of the " three represents , " earnestly performed the lofty responsibility entrusted to it by the Constitution and laws and made new progress in conducting legislative and supervisory work , and it carried out highly effective work and produced outstanding results in the endeavor to establish a rudimentary socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics and implement the basic plan of running the country according to law and building a socialist country ruled by law .  
Let us rally more closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , meet the requirements of the important thinking of the " three represents " in an all-round way , enhance our vigor and vitality , forge ahead in a pioneering and enterprising spirit , work in a down-to-earth manner , and exert ourselves in the struggle to achieve the goal of the 10th Five-year Plan and build an affluent , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist modern country !  
Of these figures , the NPC and its standing committee have , since the ninth congress , formulated a total of nearly 60 laws and law-related decisions and most of the basic and principal laws of the seven branches of law that make up the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics have been enacted .  
formulate and perfect laws that cater to the effort to push forward the reform of the political system and intensify the reform of the administrative system and judicial system , in a bid to preliminarily form a socialist legal system with Chinese system within the term of the current NPC .  
Li Lanqing said : During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , as China 's building of socialist spiritual civilization was further strengthened , the literary and artistic undertaking was flourishing in all fields , and the good athletes obtained excellent achievements in some major international games .  
Li Lanqing called for the governments at all levels to highly value the literary , artistic , and sports undertaking , regard it as a major component of the building of socialist spiritual civilization , increase the intensity of financial input , and give correct guidance to further advance the literary , artistic , and sports undertaking .  
This afternoon , members of the National Committee of the Chinese People 's Political Consultation Conference [ CPPCC ] from the educational circle and the medical and public health circle held a joint group meeting .  Several committee members expressed their opinions on the current situation of public health in China , pointing out that China 's current public health conditions are extremely incompatible with the country 's status and socialist system , and should be effectively and rapidly improved .  
Through the formulation and implementation of the 10th Five-Year Plan , China will be able to better adjust its own pace of development , release the initiative of the people of all ethnic groups across the country , concentrate all efforts on the theme of " development , " and advance toward the strategic objective of building a moderately developed socialist country and enhancing the people 's living standards so that they are able to lead a fairly comfortable life .  
Ismail Amat said : China is a country with multiple nationalities and religions .  The party and government always take the nationality and religious work seriously and have practiced a series of correct policies to handle the nationality and religious issues , so that all kinds of interests of the minority nationalities and religious followers have been safeguarded , the socialist national relationship of equality , unity , and mutual assistance has been consolidated and developed with each passing day , and various nationalities have made unceasing development and progress in the big family of the motherland .  
Today , when the 10th Five-Year Plan is formulated , the framework of a socialist market economy has been initially set up , the concept of building a market economy has struck deep roots in the hearts of people , the living standards of our people have basically reached a moderately high level , the supply of most commodities has exceeded their demand , economic globalization has become a major trend , China 's accession to the WTO is just round corner , and international competition is becoming increasingly acute .  
This is because we have initially established the socialist market economy structure , and accumulated more experience in macroeconomic management and in regulation and control ; and we have overcome difficulties caused by insufficient effective domestic demand through implementing the guideline of expanding domestic demand and practicing an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy .  
Grasping development as the main theme , Tianjin has three great historic tasks to fulfill at the start of the new century : to build a modern international port city and a major economic center of north China ; to establish a relatively perfect socialist market economy structure ; and to become one of the regions in the lead in basically achieving modernization .

He said that the report has an important function in guiding our economic and social development forward in the new century .  
Although we have established a basic and preliminary framework for the socialist market economic structure , it has yet to be gradually improved .  In particular , the tasks for readjusting and improving the ownership structure and establishing and perfecting the market system will be rather arduous .

In view of our country , following the reform and opening up and economic construction for more than 20 years , the productive forces in our country have climbed onto a new stage , the system of socialist market economy has been initially established , the scale and level of opening up to the outside world have been greatly increased , the talented people of science and technology , management , and other specialized professions are growing rapidly , and a number of center cities with relatively stronger competitiveness have emerged in the coastal areas .  
Faced with the new situation and tasks during the 10th FYP , in order to achieve the development goals for the new century , it is essential to continue to persist in emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , speed up the pace of system reforms and innovation , continually remove system-style obstacles constraining the development of the social productive forces , and further perfect the socialist market economy system , so as to create a still more favorable system environment and conditions for economic development .  
and great achievements have been made in the construction of socialist material civilization and spiritual civilization .  This is a result of the efforts that Sichuan and Yunnan provincial party committees and provincial governments have made in leading the broad ranks of cadres and masses all over the two provinces to work hard , but live plainly , and forge ahead in a pioneering and enterprising spirit .  
To prefect the basic economic system with public ownership as the mainstay and with the common development of all economies in different ownership forms , to perfect the distribution system with the income earned from work as the main form and with the coexistence of diverse income forms , to perfect the structure of the socialist market system , and to carry out political institutional reform , we must all rely on institutional innovations .  " Without institutional innovations , there will be no solution for many issues . "  
President Jiang Pointed out : Through more than two decades of development , our country has initially built a socialist market economic system , formed the pattern of opening to the outside world in all directions , gained valuable experiences in controlling complicated situations and coping with various risks , and made a marked advance in increasing the productive forces and the comprehensive national strength ; the self-confidence and cohesion of the people of various nationalities across the country have been continuously strengthened .  All this has laid a solid foundation for our continuing advance .  
Buhe , vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee , joined deputies of the Fujian delegation in discussing Chairman Li Peng 's work report .  He pointed out : In the next few years , we will be facing arduous legislative tasks , and the difficult points in the legislative work will be rather prominent .  We must further quicken the pace of legislation , establish and perfect the socialist legal system .  This is a fundamental measure concerning our country 's long-lasting order and stability and long-term development .  
It has been reported that as of today , the NPC and its standing committee have enacted more than 390 laws and decisions related to relevant laws , and local people 's congresses have enacted more than 8,000 local statutes .  With these laws and statutes and the administrative laws and regulations formulated by the State Council , " a framework of socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics has basically come into shape . "  
In the meantime , he suggested that while revising some laws , China should speed up the study and formulation of pertinent laws that are conducive to safeguarding the interests and economic security of the country and protecting national industries , including the laws on antidumping , antimonopoly , and so on with measures to guarantee their enforcement , improve and perfect the legal system of the socialist market economic structure , and create conditions for enterprises to make overseas investment and found undertakings in foreign countries .  
NPC Deputy Wu Xiyuan said : The system of the people 's congress , the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultations under the leadership of the CPC , and the system of regional autonomy of minority nationalities are great political achievements that our party has attained and developed during the course of leading the people to carry out a long-term struggle , are the core contents of our socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics , and are a historical choice made by all the Chinese people . 
In its great practice of leading the masses to build up socialist modernizations , from reinforcing and perfecting the system of people 's congress and the system of people 's political consultative conference to introducing democracy of a most extensive scope to the basic level , the party is making constant efforts to strengthen and perfect the country 's socialist democratic system .  
This is a major and effective move which is adopted on the basis of both China 's national conditions and its practical situation , and which aims to speed up the process of socialist democracy .  From the agrarian reform to the introduction of a household-based contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output and from the election of people 's deputies to the introduction of villagers ' self-rule , all have given an expression to the democratic practice that is being carried out by millions upon millions of people under the leadership of the party .  
Zhang Deguang said : Over more than 20 years since the beginning of reform and opening up , the building of a democratic legal system has been strengthened constantly in our country , which has promoted the establishment of a socialist market economic system .  The thinking of governing the country by law has won support from the people .

Economic restructuring was further deepened , phased results were attained in the state enterprise reform , the basic role played by the market mechanism in the allocation of resources was notably strengthened , the government 's economic control and regulation system was further reinforced , and a socialist market economic structure took its initial shape .

As reform deepens , although government departments which have many years of planned economic traditions have improved the way the government operates in many aspects and unceasingly moved forward to a market economy , their behaviors still have the color of " examination and approval economy . "  The existing examination and approval system has increasingly not fitted in with the needs of socialist market economy .  
Legal circles have different methods for demarcating the legal departments , and the Standing Committee will initially divide the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics into seven legal departments in line with the actual requirements of legislative work ; these departments are the constitution and related laws , civil and commercial law , administrative law , economic law , social law , criminal law , and procedural and non-procedural law .  
The 10th Five-Year Plan period will be an important period for improving the socialist market economic system , and one of the important tasks will be to further open the market and develop a national integrated market system that is standardized , encourages fair competition , and operates in an orderly way and to continuously increase the marketization of the national economy .

The major socialist economies include mainland China ( 1.2 billion ) , India ( 1 billion ) , and the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe ( 0.3 billion ) . Since the collapse of socialism , the massive labor pool of these nations has gradually been incorporated into the global capitalist economy .

Following the demise of the Soviet Union and the socialist bloc , which laid the foundations for undisputed hegemony , the United States , with the constant support of its western allies , began an unrestrained race to transform the Security Council into a kind of supreme universal tribunal for passing judgement on any country that disobeyed its designs and for using troops assembled under the flag of the United Nations as a planet-wide police force .

Most tenets of the classical socialist system were gradually qualified for practical and theoretical reasons ( Kornai , 1992 ) , and advanced economic reforms reduced the contrast with the capitalist system .  
The creation of socialist systems appeared as a gigantic experiment in organizational and institutional innovation that met with significant initial success in achieving some important development targets set by communist regimes ( other objectives , like consumption increases or popular participation having early been deliberately sacrificed or postponed ) .  
Among general lessons is the importance of historical and contemporary diversity of national economic systems and trajectories within each great systemic family , and in the process of shifting from the socialist to the capitalist family ( Chavance and Magnin , 1998 ) .  
At the most critical and difficult time in our history , when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the socialist bloc collapsed , and with them the basic markets and sources of supply that the country could count on to withstand the ferocious economic warfare waged against an island only 90 miles from the United States coast , they decided to be yet more unyielding in their approach to Cuba : with truly vulgar and repugnant opportunism , the blockade was intensified to the maximum .
