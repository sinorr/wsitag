I have had quite a long experience of arguing with members of the Chinese Communist Party and I have found that , if one concentrates on the points where Communist doctrine or practice is inconsistent or clearly contrary to well-established evidence , one can almost always produce a situation in which the Communist either persists in some assertion that everyone except a fully committed Communist would judge to be ridiculous , or takes refuge in complete philosophical relativism ( proletarian truth is different from bourgeois truth ) , or else refuses to continue the discussion .  
A novel and effective system was introduced to correct the boys ' faulty sense of values . Their actions were scaled on a gradient . ' Red light ' actions such as lying , fighting and stealing were strictly prohibited and if committed , firmly punished . ' Yellow light ' actions such as playing , if indulged in without permission , were punished only mildly .  
But getting a date with this quick-witted and sensitive top-notch Radcliffe student was no easy matter . She had received a strict Western-style gentlewoman 's education : she studied at Hong Kong University , and was a graduate of McTyeire Elementary School in Shanghai and St . Mary 's Hall . Dates had to be arranged a week in advance . She would not accept gifts from any man other than a committed " boyfriend . "  
These two legends , which are almost identical in content , tell of a pious woman ( actually Ksitigharbha in a previous existence ) whose earthly mother often killed living things and committed sinful deeds .  
When , in 1989 , the Chinese Communists committed the horrendous atrocity of the Tienanmen massacre in full view of the world 's media , Western governments were finally roused from their dreaming . The last threads of the illusion they had built up concerning the movement of China 's communist authorities towards democracy were broken . In stark contrast , the liberalization and process of political normalization on this side of the Taiwan Strait led the West to begin to accept the ROC as a member of the democratic camp . "  
To keep the will of heaven secret , the imperial astronomers of ancient China were forbidden to leave the capital . Although treated leniently if they committed crimes , even in old age they could never retire or return to their native places . They can surely never have guessed that the lonely months and years they spent staring through sighting tubes to record whatever changes they saw in the vastness of the heavens would make such a great contribution to the astronomy of later ages .  
The simultaneous transfer of two high officials sparked a chain reaction of changes at the upper levels of the MOJ . The original cause was a political controversy sparked by an investigative report on allegations that Cheng had committed a sex crime . But the incident calls for broader thinking about issues that are becoming public as a result of democratization in Taiwan .  
Taiwan is blessed with a number of lavishly gifted film-makers who are committed to their ideals , but the solemnity of whose creations perhaps deters a movie-going public raised on Hollywood and Disney . Their films , however , help serious cinema-goers in Taiwan and around the world to better confront life , and at the same time win international exposure for Taiwan , enabling the island 's more cultured aspect to break through in the face of international political taboos and wrangling .  
His father was a traditional intellectual deeply committed to the time-honored ideal of contributing to the welfare of the nation . All his life , he has maintained an austere devotion to the straight and narrow . What he values is loyalty , continuation of the family line , parental benevolence toward children , and respect and devotion in return . All of these values naturally show through in his films , and perhaps limit his freedom as a film maker .  
But as Hsueh Cheng-tai points out , when you consider the daily routine of most foreign workers and how little free time it leaves them for breaking the law , and bear in mind that the crime rate among illegal foreign workers is far higher than for the legal ones , the problem does indeed merit attention . Especially given that in 1997 rape accounted for the largest share of serious crime committed by overseas workers , causing widespread anxiety among the public .  
Quoting Bo Yang , Chen said , " For all the mistakes and abuses committed in the past , we can be understanding , tolerant and forgiving , but we can never forget-because those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it . " In response to human rights problems , Chen said that every nation must work to raise awareness and education , uphold international standards , and create legal mechanisms for promoting and protecting human rights .  
But Hsin Tao , normally mild mannered and down-to-earth by nature , proved stubborn in this case . He tirelessly explained to the faithful that their contributions would be connected to the fate of mankind itself , and would be a manifestation of the great inclusive nature of Buddhism . People were moved by his sincerity , and gradually came to see what he envisioned , and thus committed themselves to carrying out their duties without looking back .  
" She successfully captured the mysteriousness of weird folk tales , and threw in a lot of stuff about ghosts-Ghost Festival ceremonies , the wandering of lonely ghosts without living descendants , and the mischief committed by evil spirits , " writes the critic Wen Tien-hsiang . " She showed how a small boy would identify with his grandmother and all the traditions and tolerance that she symbolizes , and from there went on to develop an atmosphere of equality and mutual respect between the natural and the supernatural , and between the living and ghosts .  
Instead she committed herself to the struggle for freedom , human rights and democracy . After the 1979 Kaohsiung Incident , she supported her husband Chen Shui-bian in embarking on a political career ; a decade later , when Chen was arrested , she won election to the legislature . She later helped her husband to victory in the 2000 presidential elections . Wu had shown an abiding commitment to democratic reform , and had earned a special place in the history of Taiwan 's democratization .  
In the space of a few short months , a university student , a high ranking police officer , and a famous university professor chose to jump off high buildings , while an unemployed man committed suicide by igniting a gas canister and a soldier killed himself with charcoal fumes .

Professor Lin Wan-I of the Department of Social Work , National Taiwan University , recalls that four years ago , when he was vice-mayor of Taipei City , he was astonished to discover that junior high schools had rules that stipulated that female students who got pregnant would be considered to have committed the equivalent of three major violations of the school code and would therefore be expelled .  
Scholars of architecture can not bring themselves to write books that appeal to popular taste , while publishers soldier on despite losses , remaining committed to selling what is available . Yet in the uneven balance between the beautiful and the marketplace , some people do produce books that are big sellers . Architectural writer Chen Shih-liang , from his Architecture in Postcard I and Architecture in Postcard II to Hooked on Architectural Travel has produced an excellent model for the marketability of architectural books-and has pioneered a new direction for the genre .

This exceptional diplomatic and political event constitutes an example of the peaceful and just settlement of disputes between a world Power and a small country , which today have excellent relations of friendship and cooperation based on trust and mutual respect , as is appropriate for two States committed to efforts to consolidate prosperity , peace , security and democracy on the continent .  
After more than three years of crimes of murder , destruction and ethnic cleansing that have continued to be committed by the Serbian forces against the people of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , a new turning-point has emerged in the form of the recent peace negotiations that have led to a preliminary agreement on the fundamental principles for a comprehensive settlement based on the decisions of international legality .

In its interim report ( S / 1994 / 1125 ) , the Commission submitted its preliminary conclusions on serious breaches of international humanitarian law and acts of genocide committed in Rwanda , and recommended that the individuals responsible for those acts be brought to justice before an independent and impartial international criminal tribunal .  
By the same resolution , the Security Council decided that the Mission be established for a period up to six months , subject to the proviso that it would continue beyond 6 February 1995 only if the Secretary-General reported to the Council by that date that the parties had agreed to extend the agreement of 17 September 1994 , and that they remained committed to an effective cease-fire , national reconciliation and the promotion of democracy . 
These unconstitutional and illegal acts , which in essence , constituted political and legal aggression against a sovereign State , namely the Azerbaijani Republic , have never been repudiated by the Republic of Armenia , thus proving that Armenia should bear sole responsibility as the organizer and principal agent of the aggression against Azerbaijan . During this seven-year war , the armed forces of the Republic of Armenia have committed thousands of crimes in Azerbaijani territory .  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur and the Commission of Experts that genocide and systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law and crimes against humanity have been committed in Rwanda , resulting in massive loss of life ,  
It is requested that an international judicial fact-finding mission be formed within 30 days ; it shall be composed of competent and impartial persons to investigate the coup d ' \ x { 5f4b } at of 21 October 1993 and what the political partners have agreed to call genocide without prejudice to the outcome of the independent national and international investigations , as well as the various political crimes that have been committed since October 1993 .

Gravely concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , and in particular at those committed in the context of the continuing , odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which is the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims are the Muslim population , threatened with virtual extermination , as well as the Croats and non-Serbs ,  
Condemns also the specific violations identified by the Special Rapporteur , most of which are committed in connection with ethnic cleansing by Bosnian Serbs , and which include killings , torture , beatings , arbitrary searches , rape , disappearances , destruction of houses , forced and illegal evictions , detentions and other acts or threats of violence aimed at forcing individuals to leave their homes ;  
Also expresses grave concern about the outrages committed by the outlawed Khmer Rouge , including the massacre of approximately fifty villagers in Battambang Province in October 1994 , the numerous recent incidents of kidnapping of villagers , the taking and killing of foreign hostages and other deplorable incidents detailed in the report of the Special Representative ;

The first use of armed force by a State in contravention of the Charter shall constitute prima facie evidence of an act of aggression , although the Security Council may , in conformity with the Charter , conclude that a determination that an act of aggression has been committed would not be justified in the light of other relevant circumstances , including the fact that the acts concerned or their consequences are not of sufficient gravity .  
Without the active support of the Somali people , it is unlikely that future humanitarian programmes will meet with much success , and more than likely that the gains , made through the combined efforts of international agencies and committed Somali partners , will be undone .  
international humanitarian and international human rights instruments to prevent all forms of violence against women in situations of armed and other types of conflict and undertake full investigations of all acts of violence against women committed during war , in particular [ systematic rape ] and sexual slavery , prosecute all criminals responsible for war crimes against women and provide full redress to women victims ;  
Today is the ninth anniversary of the barbaric slaughter perpetrated by the treacherous and aggressive forces of the United States of America and NATO , the anniversary of the loathsome crime committed by the enemies of humanity , who ruthlessly deprived many of life , making women widows , children orphans , and terrorizing peaceful citizens .  
The Mission believes that URNG has committed human rights violations and has failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population , by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting the " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines or explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals . 
Having been instigated by Belgrade to serve as an instrument in a genocidal campaign against their neighbours and having been influenced by an incessant anti-Croatian propaganda campaign from Belgrade , many of these ethnic Serbs - even though most are not personally responsible for the crimes committed - have decided to leave rather than face their surviving neighbours who are returning to live in the region .  
The agreement put forward by Israel , that the so-called South Lebanese Army ( SLA ) militia is responsible for the detention camp of Al-Khyam is totally refuted and unacceptable and does not exonerate it from responsibility since Israel is the occupying Power in south Lebanon and is , in the final analysis , responsible in international law for acts committed on the territories it occupies and the SLA militia is but a tool of the Israeli occupying force and would not exist without its support . 
An international judicial commission of inquiry , however , could be viable and useful if its mandate gave it powers that would guarantee that its conclusions and recommendations would be put into effect and achieve the objective of prosecuting and punishing those responsible for the assassination of the President of Burundi on 21 October 1993 , for the massacres that followed and for other serious acts of violence and political crimes committed since October 1993 ;  
Furthermore , all the reports prepared in connection with acts of violence that have swept through the country since then indicate that serious , systematic and widespread violations of human rights have been committed and that international law has been violated .  
During the Conference , deep concern was voiced over the recent brutal attacks carried out by Bosnian Serbs against United Nations-declared safe areas , special emphasis being given to the massacre of civilians and the continued policy of ethnic cleansing and atrocities committed against the civilian population . 
Despite the repeated appeals by the President of the Republic , Dr . Franjo Tudjman and the Croatian Government to the local Serbian population to lay down their arms and stay in their homes , as well as promises and guarantees of amnesty and abolition to all those who have not committed war crimes , and renewed guarantees for the safety and constitutional rights of the Serb ethnic community in Croatia , a large number of Serb civilians in the liberated areas have left their homes .  
Should evidence surface that unlawful acts were committed , we are determined to bring to justice all those responsible for violations of international humanitarian law , as would anyway be the case with any individual who would be responsible for crimes committed , in particular , against civilian population .  
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is very disappointed that the Security Council did not most resolutely condemn the Croatian aggression and the crimes committed , particularly ethnic cleansing and other gross violations of fundamental norms of international humanitarian law , human rights and the principles of international law in times of war , in the light of the horrible crimes that the Croatian army committed against Serbian civilians and prisoners of war .  
Thus , while we fully share the pain and suffering experienced by the peoples of both Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia because of the wars raging in their countries , we have at the same time maintained a balanced position vis - - vis the conflicts in those countries .  We have joined in the condemnation of all violations of international humanitarian law committed in these conflicts irrespective of who may have committed them .  
The report also noted that URNG had committed human rights violations and had failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines and explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals .

Following the massive crimes in western Slavonia in May 1995 committed by the Croatian forces , which resulted in territory cleansed of Serbs , Croatia is now resorting to the same method in the Krajina , namely , the media and international humanitarian organizations and the United Nations representative are denied access to the area before all incriminating traces are removed .  
Following unscrupulous and criminal aggression against Krajina and the genocide committed against the Serb people , Croatia advances untrue , baseless and malicious charges of the alleged involvement of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in incidents around Osijek with the aim of drawing Yugoslavia in the conflict that Croatia itself provoked .  
While the number of those killed , beaten , detained and sexually assaulted remains unknown , consistent accounts by displaced persons and United Nations personnel lead to a strong presumption that Bosnian Serb soldiers committed substantial violations of international humanitarian law following the fall of Srebrenica , including mass arbitrary detention of civilian men and boys , and summary executions .  
We are firmly committed to initiating a new era in the Caribbean region characterized by the strengthening of integration , concerted action and consultation in order to ensure greater cultural , economic , political , scientific , social and technological cooperation among our peoples , Governments and countries ;  
It aims at training senior managers of Chinese military enterprises for conversion to production of civilian goods for the domestic and world markets , and facilitating joint ventures by bringing together major domestic and international investors from the private sector in the most attractive and committed Chinese enterprises .

Today , we recall that almost visionary determination , and we are fortunate to do so in an organization that is vibrant with issues to address and problems to solve , and that is deeply involved in finding solutions to major international crises and increasingly committed to economic development , human rights and social and environmental problems .  
Horrendous atrocities committed by the regular army of Croatia in Western Slavonia and Krajina which resulted in the slaughter of thousands of Serbs , the looting and burning of Serb houses and the expulsion of about 500,000 of them from their ancestral homes , have proved that the main Croatian political goal is to establish an ethnically pure State .  
It is particularly outrageous that Croatia should blame the Serbs for aggression when it is quite clear that the regular army of Croatia has been guilty of horrendous atrocities committed in western Slavonia , the Krajina and Bosnia and Herzegovina , which have resulted in the slaughter of thousands of Serbs and the burning and looting of their homes .  
A positive scenario for rapprochement between the people , its Government and the political parties would be the definition , with broad civil participation , of a national development strategy for the medium and long term , to which the main political forces and the Government were committed .  
NULLWhile one reason the abuses , human rights violations or crimes allegedly committed by military commissioners and members of CVDCs , whether for political or general reasons , continue is that the people are afraid to say anything , the main reason they continue is that , in much of Guatemala the institutions responsible for maintaining public order and administering justice either do not exist or are very weak . 
Since the fall of KNU bases at Manerplaw in January 1995 and following the split in KNU in December 1994 , several reliable sources have reported that DKBO has committed widespread human rights abuses , e.g . , reprisals against civilians following insurgent ambushes , looting and forced relocations .  
The Special Rapporteur has not received any communication from the Government regarding the questions raised in his previous reports and at the same time the Government did not put forward any explanation or substantial denial in relation to the most serious abuses and violations , namely those committed against children living or working in the street and the camps set up for children belonging to these categories .  
NULLUNFPA is committed under its 1982 memorandum on cooperation and liaison with OIC to promote awareness of the social , economic and environmental implications of national and international population problems , and to extend systematic and sustainable assistance to OIC member States , at their request , in dealing with their population problems .  
As such , the programme has been unable to provide any substantial financial assistance to meet capital assistance needs which have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries which are committed to these ends but which face economic hardship due to economic problems , crisis or transition .  
Another concerned the proposed function of the International Court of Justice : assuming that it continued to operate in its current manner , was the Court suited to make the final decision with regard to the existence of an international crime and would it be able to respond quickly enough to an international crime which was being committed by a State ?  
Article 14 , after all , prohibited " extreme economic or political coercion designed to endanger the territorial integrity or political independence of the State which has committed an internationally wrongful act " , while article 13 stated clearly that such measures would not be permitted .  
Article 14 contained a list of prohibited countermeasures , including extreme coercion designed to endanger the territorial integrity or political independence of the State that had committed an internationally wrongful act , in other words measures of " intervention " .  
Ad hoc tribunals could not be a substitute for a permanent international criminal court with the ability to prosecute persons accused of gross violations of humanitarian and human rights law wherever the crimes were committed .  
But let me not be misunderstood : while we are deeply worried about the situation in Croatia , we are fully aware of the different qualitative and quantitative dimensions of the violations of international humanitarian law and the human rights violations committed by Bosnian Serbs in Srebrenica , Zepa and the wider Banja Luka area .  
It was pleased to note that , with the assistance and support of the international community and through the committed efforts of the Palestinian population , the Palestinian Authority had gradually established its administration and had taken a number of measures to ensure public order and to normalize Palestinian political , social , economic and cultural life , as well as to improve living conditions .  
Australia was actively promoting more innovative and effective approaches to emerging refugee and humanitarian problems ; was willing to respond generously to humanitarian need in all forums and was committed to alleviating the plight of displaced persons and refugees , the resettlement of whom had contributed to shaping his country into a culturally diverse and tolerant nation .  
To achieve precisely that objective , Botswana had committed itself to promoting universal access to education up to junior secondary level and had adopted in 1994 new policies on education aimed at increasing access to both the secondary and tertiary levels of education .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;

that at the first regular session of 1994 of the Administrative Committee on Coordination , in April 1994 , the executive heads of all United Nations agencies discussed the implications of the results of the Conference for their respective programmes and committed themselves to supporting the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the coordination of the United Nations organs , bodies and the specialized agencies whose activities deal with human rights , as set out in General Assembly resolution 48 / 141 ,

concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , according to which genocide and systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
was no doubt that international law had a key role to play in the search for solutions to the problems of an interdependent world in which economic , social and ecological issues had assumed paramount importance , and Indonesia was therefore committed to working towards the codification of that law .  
Henze ( Germany ) : The report of the Secretary-General on violations of international humanitarian law committed by Bosnian Serbs in the areas of Srebrenica , Zepa , Banja Luka and Sanski Most is a sad and particularly worrying summary of the current state of information on the key issues of missing persons , executions and the involvement of Bosnian Serb leaders and of Serbian paramilitary forces in those crimes .  
it is of the utmost importance that the same legal standards , the same norms of law and the same critical objectivity are applied everywhere be it in the areas in question , in other parts of the former Yugoslavia or elsewhere in this world .  There must be no selectivity , no attempts to either diminish or enlarge violations of international humanitarian law committed by one side for partisan reasons of political convenience .  
fact , through the draft resolution before us , members of the Council have the opportunity to express , in a united voice and in the strongest possible terms , their condemnation of all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights committed in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia , demanding that all concerned , particularly the Serbs , comply fully with their obligations in this regard .  
of those who , with a level of savage brutality that shames the world , revived genocidal practices , perpetrated ethnic cleansing , committed abominable human rights violations or flouted the norms of humanitarian law will now have to face the consequences of their behaviour .  
Some governments are committed to , and prepared to take responsibility for , improving the capacity of their public administration and civil service and developing policies to promote good governance and participatory development , but lack sufficient means to achieve this by themselves .  
This set of realities has led Algeria , committed as it is to a vast process of economic reform , to formulate and implement a development strategy which , while subjecting the economy to the laws of the marketplace , will ensure the necessary balance between the various State functions , tying the powers of the public authorities in the coordination of economic activity to the desire to preserve to the greatest extent possible a patrimony that has been built up through the colossal efforts of our national community , while encouraging free enterprise and private initiative .  
At this time , Costa Rica , Nicaragua and the sponsors of this draft resolution would like to express their sincerest gratitude to the international community , and particularly to the friendly countries that have , in consistent and committed fashion , displayed solidarity with us in our emergency situation by supporting the efforts of our own peoples and Governments to overcome the disaster and to bring daily life back to normal in both brotherly countries .  
We urge the international community to remain committed to the cause of Bosnia and Herzegovina ; to remain vigilant as regards any ill intention against the independence and territorial integrity of that country ; to ensure the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes ; to seek the arrest and extradition to The Hague of indicted war criminals ; to prevent any negative outside interference that could potentially impede the process of peaceful and democratic reintegration ; and to make available the assistance pledged for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Bosnia .  
Honduras , like all other developing countries , is deeply committed to processes designed to combat poverty and underdevelopment and to mobilize the potential of its peoples and resources in order to attain speedy , fair and sustained growth , working jointly to enhance the effect of national efforts through solidarity , cooperation and mutual confidence .  
Therefore , assistance to promote economic development in African countries that are committed to the democratization of their institutions will result in the emergence of new political classes that are protected from need and that will be more likely to regard politics as a means of governing a community of men and women who are bound by a territory and a common destiny than as the only means to get ahead in an economically poor environment .

In the absence of a ratification making it possible to apply a universal jurisdiction clause to the country where the crime was committed , States may for efficiency 's sake take measures in their internal legislation to establish extraterritorial jurisdiction over serious crimes under international law committed outside their territory which by their nature are within the purview not only of internal criminal law but also of an international punitive system to which the concept of frontiers is alien .

Yet in the uneven balance between the beautiful and the marketplace , some people do produce books that are big sellers . Architectural writer Chen Shih-liang , from his Architecture in Postcard I and Architecture in Postcard II to Hooked on Architectural Travel has produced an excellent model for the marketability of architectural books-and has pioneered a new direction for the genre .

This exceptional diplomatic and political event constitutes an example of the peaceful and just settlement of disputes between a world Power and a small country , which today have excellent relations of friendship and cooperation based on trust and mutual respect , as is appropriate for two States committed to efforts to consolidate prosperity , peace , security and democracy on the continent .  
After more than three years of crimes of murder , destruction and ethnic cleansing that have continued to be committed by the Serbian forces against the people of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , a new turning-point has emerged in the form of the recent peace negotiations that have led to a preliminary agreement on the fundamental principles for a comprehensive settlement based on the decisions of international legality .

In its interim report ( S / 1994 / 1125 ) , the Commission submitted its preliminary conclusions on serious breaches of international humanitarian law and acts of genocide committed in Rwanda , and recommended that the individuals responsible for those acts be brought to justice before an independent and impartial international criminal tribunal .  
By the same resolution , the Security Council decided that the Mission be established for a period up to six months , subject to the proviso that it would continue beyond 6 February 1995 only if the Secretary-General reported to the Council by that date that the parties had agreed to extend the agreement of 17 September 1994 , and that they remained committed to an effective cease-fire , national reconciliation and the promotion of democracy . 
These unconstitutional and illegal acts , which in essence , constituted political and legal aggression against a sovereign State , namely the Azerbaijani Republic , have never been repudiated by the Republic of Armenia , thus proving that Armenia should bear sole responsibility as the organizer and principal agent of the aggression against Azerbaijan . During this seven-year war , the armed forces of the Republic of Armenia have committed thousands of crimes in Azerbaijani territory .  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur and the Commission of Experts that genocide and systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law and crimes against humanity have been committed in Rwanda , resulting in massive loss of life ,  
It is requested that an international judicial fact-finding mission be formed within 30 days ; it shall be composed of competent and impartial persons to investigate the coup d ' \ x { 5f4b } at of 21 October 1993 and what the political partners have agreed to call genocide without prejudice to the outcome of the independent national and international investigations , as well as the various political crimes that have been committed since October 1993 .

Gravely concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , and in particular at those committed in the context of the continuing , odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which is the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims are the Muslim population , threatened with virtual extermination , as well as the Croats and non-Serbs ,  
Condemns also the specific violations identified by the Special Rapporteur , most of which are committed in connection with ethnic cleansing by Bosnian Serbs , and which include killings , torture , beatings , arbitrary searches , rape , disappearances , destruction of houses , forced and illegal evictions , detentions and other acts or threats of violence aimed at forcing individuals to leave their homes ;  
Also expresses grave concern about the outrages committed by the outlawed Khmer Rouge , including the massacre of approximately fifty villagers in Battambang Province in October 1994 , the numerous recent incidents of kidnapping of villagers , the taking and killing of foreign hostages and other deplorable incidents detailed in the report of the Special Representative ;  
The Secretary-General is committed to a collegial , friendly and positive atmosphere in staff / management relations conducive to quality work at a level of productivity in line with staff qualifications and with the Organization 's changing mandates .

The first use of armed force by a State in contravention of the Charter shall constitute prima facie evidence of an act of aggression , although the Security Council may , in conformity with the Charter , conclude that a determination that an act of aggression has been committed would not be justified in the light of other relevant circumstances , including the fact that the acts concerned or their consequences are not of sufficient gravity .  
Without the active support of the Somali people , it is unlikely that future humanitarian programmes will meet with much success , and more than likely that the gains , made through the combined efforts of international agencies and committed Somali partners , will be undone .  
international humanitarian and international human rights instruments to prevent all forms of violence against women in situations of armed and other types of conflict and undertake full investigations of all acts of violence against women committed during war , in particular [ systematic rape ] and sexual slavery , prosecute all criminals responsible for war crimes against women and provide full redress to women victims ;  
Today is the ninth anniversary of the barbaric slaughter perpetrated by the treacherous and aggressive forces of the United States of America and NATO , the anniversary of the loathsome crime committed by the enemies of humanity , who ruthlessly deprived many of life , making women widows , children orphans , and terrorizing peaceful citizens .  
The Mission believes that URNG has committed human rights violations and has failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population , by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting the " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines or explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals . 
Having been instigated by Belgrade to serve as an instrument in a genocidal campaign against their neighbours and having been influenced by an incessant anti-Croatian propaganda campaign from Belgrade , many of these ethnic Serbs - even though most are not personally responsible for the crimes committed - have decided to leave rather than face their surviving neighbours who are returning to live in the region .  
The agreement put forward by Israel , that the so-called South Lebanese Army ( SLA ) militia is responsible for the detention camp of Al-Khyam is totally refuted and unacceptable and does not exonerate it from responsibility since Israel is the occupying Power in south Lebanon and is , in the final analysis , responsible in international law for acts committed on the territories it occupies and the SLA militia is but a tool of the Israeli occupying force and would not exist without its support . 
An international judicial commission of inquiry , however , could be viable and useful if its mandate gave it powers that would guarantee that its conclusions and recommendations would be put into effect and achieve the objective of prosecuting and punishing those responsible for the assassination of the President of Burundi on 21 October 1993 , for the massacres that followed and for other serious acts of violence and political crimes committed since October 1993 ;  
Furthermore , all the reports prepared in connection with acts of violence that have swept through the country since then indicate that serious , systematic and widespread violations of human rights have been committed and that international law has been violated .  
During the Conference , deep concern was voiced over the recent brutal attacks carried out by Bosnian Serbs against United Nations-declared safe areas , special emphasis being given to the massacre of civilians and the continued policy of ethnic cleansing and atrocities committed against the civilian population . 
Despite the repeated appeals by the President of the Republic , Dr . Franjo Tudjman and the Croatian Government to the local Serbian population to lay down their arms and stay in their homes , as well as promises and guarantees of amnesty and abolition to all those who have not committed war crimes , and renewed guarantees for the safety and constitutional rights of the Serb ethnic community in Croatia , a large number of Serb civilians in the liberated areas have left their homes .  
Should evidence surface that unlawful acts were committed , we are determined to bring to justice all those responsible for violations of international humanitarian law , as would anyway be the case with any individual who would be responsible for crimes committed , in particular , against civilian population .  
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is very disappointed that the Security Council did not most resolutely condemn the Croatian aggression and the crimes committed , particularly ethnic cleansing and other gross violations of fundamental norms of international humanitarian law , human rights and the principles of international law in times of war , in the light of the horrible crimes that the Croatian army committed against Serbian civilians and prisoners of war .  
Thus , while we fully share the pain and suffering experienced by the peoples of both Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia because of the wars raging in their countries , we have at the same time maintained a balanced position vis - - vis the conflicts in those countries .  We have joined in the condemnation of all violations of international humanitarian law committed in these conflicts irrespective of who may have committed them .  
The report also noted that URNG had committed human rights violations and had failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines and explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals .

Following the massive crimes in western Slavonia in May 1995 committed by the Croatian forces , which resulted in territory cleansed of Serbs , Croatia is now resorting to the same method in the Krajina , namely , the media and international humanitarian organizations and the United Nations representative are denied access to the area before all incriminating traces are removed .  
Following unscrupulous and criminal aggression against Krajina and the genocide committed against the Serb people , Croatia advances untrue , baseless and malicious charges of the alleged involvement of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in incidents around Osijek with the aim of drawing Yugoslavia in the conflict that Croatia itself provoked .  
While the number of those killed , beaten , detained and sexually assaulted remains unknown , consistent accounts by displaced persons and United Nations personnel lead to a strong presumption that Bosnian Serb soldiers committed substantial violations of international humanitarian law following the fall of Srebrenica , including mass arbitrary detention of civilian men and boys , and summary executions .  
We are firmly committed to initiating a new era in the Caribbean region characterized by the strengthening of integration , concerted action and consultation in order to ensure greater cultural , economic , political , scientific , social and technological cooperation among our peoples , Governments and countries ;

The Turkish invasion of northern Iraq was accompanied by flagrant violations committed by the invading forces through intensive utilization of weapons that were not commensurate with the number of those who were subjected to the military campaign , in which military aircraft and heavy military equipment were used , causing great damage to property and killing Iraqi Kurdish citizens .  
At the bilateral level , the Algerian Government has made sustained efforts to coordinate policies and strategies to combat terrorism , for example by strengthening judicial cooperation , exchanging information , and circulating details of persons who have committed terrorist acts so that they might be arrested , handed over or extradited .

Today , we recall that almost visionary determination , and we are fortunate to do so in an organization that is vibrant with issues to address and problems to solve , and that is deeply involved in finding solutions to major international crises and increasingly committed to economic development , human rights and social and environmental problems .  
Horrendous atrocities committed by the regular army of Croatia in Western Slavonia and Krajina which resulted in the slaughter of thousands of Serbs , the looting and burning of Serb houses and the expulsion of about 500,000 of them from their ancestral homes , have proved that the main Croatian political goal is to establish an ethnically pure State .  
It is particularly outrageous that Croatia should blame the Serbs for aggression when it is quite clear that the regular army of Croatia has been guilty of horrendous atrocities committed in western Slavonia , the Krajina and Bosnia and Herzegovina , which have resulted in the slaughter of thousands of Serbs and the burning and looting of their homes .  
A positive scenario for rapprochement between the people , its Government and the political parties would be the definition , with broad civil participation , of a national development strategy for the medium and long term , to which the main political forces and the Government were committed .  
NULLWhile one reason the abuses , human rights violations or crimes allegedly committed by military commissioners and members of CVDCs , whether for political or general reasons , continue is that the people are afraid to say anything , the main reason they continue is that , in much of Guatemala the institutions responsible for maintaining public order and administering justice either do not exist or are very weak . 
Since the fall of KNU bases at Manerplaw in January 1995 and following the split in KNU in December 1994 , several reliable sources have reported that DKBO has committed widespread human rights abuses , e.g . , reprisals against civilians following insurgent ambushes , looting and forced relocations .  
The Special Rapporteur has not received any communication from the Government regarding the questions raised in his previous reports and at the same time the Government did not put forward any explanation or substantial denial in relation to the most serious abuses and violations , namely those committed against children living or working in the street and the camps set up for children belonging to these categories .  
NULLUNFPA is committed under its 1982 memorandum on cooperation and liaison with OIC to promote awareness of the social , economic and environmental implications of national and international population problems , and to extend systematic and sustainable assistance to OIC member States , at their request , in dealing with their population problems .  
As such , the programme has been unable to provide any substantial financial assistance to meet capital assistance needs which have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries which are committed to these ends but which face economic hardship due to economic problems , crisis or transition .  
Another concerned the proposed function of the International Court of Justice : assuming that it continued to operate in its current manner , was the Court suited to make the final decision with regard to the existence of an international crime and would it be able to respond quickly enough to an international crime which was being committed by a State ?  
Article 14 , after all , prohibited " extreme economic or political coercion designed to endanger the territorial integrity or political independence of the State which has committed an internationally wrongful act " , while article 13 stated clearly that such measures would not be permitted .  
Article 14 contained a list of prohibited countermeasures , including extreme coercion designed to endanger the territorial integrity or political independence of the State that had committed an internationally wrongful act , in other words measures of " intervention " .  
Ad hoc tribunals could not be a substitute for a permanent international criminal court with the ability to prosecute persons accused of gross violations of humanitarian and human rights law wherever the crimes were committed .  
But let me not be misunderstood : while we are deeply worried about the situation in Croatia , we are fully aware of the different qualitative and quantitative dimensions of the violations of international humanitarian law and the human rights violations committed by Bosnian Serbs in Srebrenica , Zepa and the wider Banja Luka area .  
It was pleased to note that , with the assistance and support of the international community and through the committed efforts of the Palestinian population , the Palestinian Authority had gradually established its administration and had taken a number of measures to ensure public order and to normalize Palestinian political , social , economic and cultural life , as well as to improve living conditions .  
Australia was actively promoting more innovative and effective approaches to emerging refugee and humanitarian problems ; was willing to respond generously to humanitarian need in all forums and was committed to alleviating the plight of displaced persons and refugees , the resettlement of whom had contributed to shaping his country into a culturally diverse and tolerant nation .  
To achieve precisely that objective , Botswana had committed itself to promoting universal access to education up to junior secondary level and had adopted in 1994 new policies on education aimed at increasing access to both the secondary and tertiary levels of education .

was no doubt that international law had a key role to play in the search for solutions to the problems of an interdependent world in which economic , social and ecological issues had assumed paramount importance , and Indonesia was therefore committed to working towards the codification of that law .  
Henze ( Germany ) : The report of the Secretary-General on violations of international humanitarian law committed by Bosnian Serbs in the areas of Srebrenica , Zepa , Banja Luka and Sanski Most is a sad and particularly worrying summary of the current state of information on the key issues of missing persons , executions and the involvement of Bosnian Serb leaders and of Serbian paramilitary forces in those crimes .  
it is of the utmost importance that the same legal standards , the same norms of law and the same critical objectivity are applied everywhere be it in the areas in question , in other parts of the former Yugoslavia or elsewhere in this world .  There must be no selectivity , no attempts to either diminish or enlarge violations of international humanitarian law committed by one side for partisan reasons of political convenience .  
fact , through the draft resolution before us , members of the Council have the opportunity to express , in a united voice and in the strongest possible terms , their condemnation of all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights committed in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia , demanding that all concerned , particularly the Serbs , comply fully with their obligations in this regard .  
of those who , with a level of savage brutality that shames the world , revived genocidal practices , perpetrated ethnic cleansing , committed abominable human rights violations or flouted the norms of humanitarian law will now have to face the consequences of their behaviour .  
Some governments are committed to , and prepared to take responsibility for , improving the capacity of their public administration and civil service and developing policies to promote good governance and participatory development , but lack sufficient means to achieve this by themselves .  
This set of realities has led Algeria , committed as it is to a vast process of economic reform , to formulate and implement a development strategy which , while subjecting the economy to the laws of the marketplace , will ensure the necessary balance between the various State functions , tying the powers of the public authorities in the coordination of economic activity to the desire to preserve to the greatest extent possible a patrimony that has been built up through the colossal efforts of our national community , while encouraging free enterprise and private initiative .  
At this time , Costa Rica , Nicaragua and the sponsors of this draft resolution would like to express their sincerest gratitude to the international community , and particularly to the friendly countries that have , in consistent and committed fashion , displayed solidarity with us in our emergency situation by supporting the efforts of our own peoples and Governments to overcome the disaster and to bring daily life back to normal in both brotherly countries .  
We urge the international community to remain committed to the cause of Bosnia and Herzegovina ; to remain vigilant as regards any ill intention against the independence and territorial integrity of that country ; to ensure the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes ; to seek the arrest and extradition to The Hague of indicted war criminals ; to prevent any negative outside interference that could potentially impede the process of peaceful and democratic reintegration ; and to make available the assistance pledged for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Bosnia .  
Honduras , like all other developing countries , is deeply committed to processes designed to combat poverty and underdevelopment and to mobilize the potential of its peoples and resources in order to attain speedy , fair and sustained growth , working jointly to enhance the effect of national efforts through solidarity , cooperation and mutual confidence .  
Therefore , assistance to promote economic development in African countries that are committed to the democratization of their institutions will result in the emergence of new political classes that are protected from need and that will be more likely to regard politics as a means of governing a community of men and women who are bound by a territory and a common destiny than as the only means to get ahead in an economically poor environment .  
Even though misunderstandings and aggressions appear on one continent or another , based on deep-seated racial , religious or political hatred , and leading to genocide or local wars , we can not speak of a conflagration , especially when the will of the people of all regions rises above these wars , committed to the restoration of peace .  
I should also like to express my special appreciation for the enlightened and committed leadership of your predecessor , Mr . Freitas do Amaral , who , in the course of the historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly , made an undeniable contribution to the continued progress of the United Nations .

At the domestic level , the national Government , owing to radical economic reforms , has made progress in the far-reaching process of bilateral cooperation with countries committed to the peaceful use of nuclear energy .  
We are committed to supporting the implementation of the recommendations , which we hope will lead to real progress in fostering human and social capacity , in strengthening economic performance and in protecting the environment , thus laying firm foundations for a better future for all African people .  
New Zealand will make that commitment , because we are committed to building a strengthened and effective United Nations that is ready and able to tackle the challenges that lie ahead , and a United Nations system that is more internationally democratic and more representative of the world we live in as the century draws to a close .  
An additional problem linked to the existence of settlements was the violent acts committed by settlers , who were consistently protected by the army , were often armed and who had become more violent and aggressive during the preceding year .  
With regard to the situation in the territory of the former Yugoslavia , double standards were evident , with certain countries demanding air strikes in retaliation for ethnic cleansing committed by one side , while turning a blind eye to identical acts committed by the other sides .  
The Government of Cyprus was committed to ensuring that women enjoyed all their human rights and that they were equal partners in shaping the economic , political , social and cultural development of their country .  
Responding to allegations that the armed forces of Myanmar had committed unseemly acts in border areas , he rejected them and insisted that the local population in those areas was experiencing unprecedented levels of progress in the political , economic and social fields and that the armed forces of Myanmar , which had a distinguished history and a fine tradition born of the struggle for independence , were well known for their good discipline and exemplary conduct .  
KAMAL ( Pakistan ) , speaking on agenda item 112 ( c ) , said that , while there were many types of human rights violations , the primary concern of the United Nations was the systematic violation of human rights committed by States and persons in authority and that the United Nations could influence Member States to take legislative , administrative and judicial measures to promote and protect human rights .

We , the States participating in the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) , [ , are committed to a political , economic , environmental , ethical and spiritual vision of human settlements based on the principles of equality , solidarity , partnership , human dignity , respect and cooperation .  
In obtaining evidence for the verification of this commitment , the Mission faces the persistence , characteristic of Guatemala , of large numbers of homicides , death threats , kidnappings and other serious crimes which , because they are committed by ordinary criminals or unidentified persons , are not recorded as human rights violations which are directly attributable to agents of the State or politically motivated , but are nevertheless a result of the State 's failure in its duty to provide guarantees and to prevent , investigate and punish crime .

I am pleased to report that the efforts to focus attention on this issue bore fruit and on 8 August the Government of Croatia and UNTAES signed an agreement by which the former committed itself to contribute to the regular monthly financing of public services in the region , including health and social welfare , education , police , administration , operating costs and related administrative expenses , in the amount of 4.5-million kunas ( approx . $ 860,000 ) ( see S / 1996 / 648 ) . 
The international community reached a consensus and committed itself to the goal of poverty eradication at the major United Nations conferences and summits of the 1990s , as an ethical , social , political and economic imperative .  
The hostile actions of the United States represent a concrete example of organized State terrorism being committed against the people of Iraq by a major Power without regard for the humanitarian and material consequences that such illegal and unlawful actions may entail .  
The Special Representative believes that the speedy creation of an independent electoral commission would send an unambiguous signal to the people of Cambodia that the Government of Cambodia is committed to free and fair elections .  
Once an organization had been shown to engage in terrorist activity in one country and there was cogent evidence of such involvement , its designation as a terrorist organization in the country where acts were committed should be prima facie evidence , if not conclusive proof , anywhere in the world , of the nature of its activities and sufficient to include , for purposes of liability , front organizations and other devices set up to conceal its true identity .  
Governments recognized UNCTAD 's technical cooperation programme as an important element in providing practical assistance to developing countries , especially those with the greatest need , and committed themselves to strengthening its effectiveness and impact as an essential complement to the institution 's policy-oriented analytical and deliberative work .  
Communal violence , understood as acts of violence committed by one ethnic , religious , linguistic , national or social group against another group , was reported in Bangladesh , Burundi , Cameroon , Chad , Djibouti , Mali , Nigeria and Somalia . Government forces are often said to support one side in the conflict or even instigate hostilities , rather than intervene to stop violence between different groups .  
These measures are : ( a ) the establishment of a permanent international criminal court with universal jurisdiction over mass violations of human rights and humanitarian law ; such an international criminal court would have to be bestowed with an adequate mandate and sufficient means to enable it to conduct thorough investigations and enforce the implementation of its decisions ; and ( b ) the adoption of a convention , similar to the Convention against Torture , which would provide domestic courts with international jurisdiction over persons suspected of having committed mass violations of the right to life .  
Torture , which is an aggravated and deliberate form of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , is defined in article 1 of the Declaration as follows : " any act by which severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental , is intentionally inflicted by or at the instigation of a public official on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or confession , punishing him for an act he has committed or is suspected of having committed , or intimidating him or other persons " .  
It was mentioned that the Centre was also committed to protecting and maintaining the historic , cultural and natural heritage of indigenous and other people , and that Governments , as enabling partners , should create and strengthen effective partnerships with vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities .  
This mandate is underlined by paragraph 11 of the Secretary-General 's report in response to paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 808 ( 1993 ) ( S / 25704 ) , in which the Secretary-General recalled that the Security Council had condemned " the practice of ' ethnic cleansing ' and the massive , organized and systematic detention and rape of women , and reaffirmed that those who commit or have committed or order or have ordered the commission of such acts will be held individually responsible in respect of such acts " .  
It is therefore pertinent to ask how long the international community can countenance the present untenable status quo ; what the reasoning is behind the stated preference of some Members for the present state of affairs over changes in the composition of the Security Council and its decision-making processes ; and whether we are genuinely committed to a Council that would reflect the undeniable realities of the contemporary world .  
The reform and structural adjustment programmes to which African countries are committed have all been multidimensional in nature , including measures for domestic economic and commercial liberalization aimed at improving financial management , expanding the tax base and enhancing efficiency and transparency in the fiscal system .  
The Government of the United States of America , in giving illegal protection to Iraqis who have committed serious crimes against their country and to foreigners ( Americans and others ) and in introducing them into Iraq illegally in order to achieve illegal goals that jeopardize its security , stability , territorial integrity and political regime , is committing a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and an act of aggression against an independent Member State of the United Nations and is guilty of blatant interference in its internal affairs .  
In view of the unacceptable nature of such human rights violations , the General Assembly must express its deep concern over the recalcitrant attitude of the Nigerian Government to world opinion and adopt measures that were commensurate with the magnitude of human rights violations that had been and continued to be committed by the Government of Nigeria .  
Although the Department of Peacekeeping Operations had established a number of bodies to increase its effectiveness , acquired considerable experience in that area and carried out many studies , Mozambique was concerned to see that the Organization remained slow to respond to conflict situations and that it repeated errors which had been committed in past operations .

Children aged between 10 and 13 can not be held in police custody , but may be temporary detained if there is strong , concurring circumstantial evidence to the effect that they have committed or attempted to commit a crime or an offence punishable with a least seven years ' imprisonment .  
This will not only require a society of States committed to democratic principles and processes ; it will also demand an enlarged international civil society deeply involved in democratic institutions , whether State , inter-State or supra-State , private or quasi-private ; committed to democratic practices , procedures and political pluralism ; and composed of peoples ingrained with those habits of openness , fairness and tolerance that have been associated with democracy since ancient times . 
Two years ago , during the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , we committed ourselves not only to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war , but also to rededicate our efforts to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness for our universal Organization , with a view to enabling it to play a pivotal role in promoting sustainable development , particularly in the developing countries .  
In the spirit of Olympic ethics , any form of discrimination racial , religious , political , linguistic or otherwise is totally excluded , and the fundamental principle of equality prevails .

At the Social Summit , heads of State or Government committed themselves to the goal of eradicating poverty in the world , through decisive national actions and international cooperation , as an ethical , social , political and economic imperative of mankind .  
Also in relation to the clause mentioned in paragraph 20 , the National Reconciliation Act shall extinguish criminal liability for related common crimes committed in the armed conflict , such crimes being defined as those which are directly , objectively , intentionally and causally related to the commission of the political crimes referred to in the preceding paragraph and which can not be shown to be motivated by personal goals .  
It is clear , therefore , that the legislative progress made at the federal level in connection with compensation for victims of offences has been suitably supplemented by federative entities , and it is to be hoped that , in the near future , all the necessary and relevant legal provisions on the subject will be in place , particularly in respect of acts committed by public servants .  
Moreover , the Programme of Action is committed to improving the quality of life by focusing on three interdependent goals : reductions in infant , child and maternal mortality ; expanded access to education , particularly for women and girls ; and universal access to primary health care , including reproductive health and family planning services .  
The purpose of the workshop was once again to make the international community more aware of the very serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law which are committed by Government authorities , armed groups or individuals in situations of internal disturbances , crises and tensions , including latent or low _ intensity conflicts .  
Given this appalling situation , we urge the international community , as represented by its specialized organizations and institutions and first and foremost by the Security Council , the International Committee of the Red Cross , the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the States signatories to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 , to discharge their humanitarian responsibilities and obligations by condemning these most heinous violations committed by the criminal Ethiopian Tigray forces against the civilians and soldiers who have fallen victim to the brutal aggression launched on our eastern borders .  
The Sudan urges the institutions entrusted with ensuring respect for international humanitarian law to institute an inquiry into the savage crimes committed by the Ethiopian Tigray forces against the innocent Sudanese prisoners and detainees in their possession , which have included physical liquidation , so that the perpetrators and war criminals implicated in these practices will not escape the justice of the law .  
As mentioned in his previous report , the Special Rapporteur continued to receive reports and information on grave and widespread violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms by government agents , and abuses and atrocities committed against the life , liberty and security of individuals by members of different parties to the armed conflict in the country other than the Government of the Sudan in the areas under their control .

It should be noted that , for the purposes of the present exercise , all official development finance committed for development assistance is assumed to be dedicated to sustainable development , so that analysis focuses on any changes in the allocation of financial assistance among the economic , social and environmental components of sustainable development that may have been made in response to the series of global conferences beginning with the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and other determinants of aid composition .  
The Estonian criminal code considered as organized crime groups those criminal associations composed of three or more members who , on a constant basis and with identified functions , committed serious criminal offences ; using that definition , the Estonian authorities reported that in the last decade more than 10 criminal associations had been identified in the country , 8 of them operating permanently since their formation in the mid-1980s .  
Greece indicated that although no legal provisions had been enacted that dealt with organized transnational crime in particular , its law enforcement agencies were operating against organized crime and making use of criminal legislation designed to tackle illicit drug trafficking , crimes related to firearms , money-laundering , trafficking in illegal migrants and other offences typically committed by organized crime groups , and that a number of characteristics of organized crime had been identified within the framework of EU and were being applied by national authorities to classify an illegal action as a form of organized crime .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends but that face economic hardship ;  
Noting that , at the first regular session of 1994 of the Administrative Committee on Coordination , held in April , the executive heads of all United Nations agencies discussed the implications of the results of the Conference for their respective programmes and committed themselves to support the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the coordination of the United Nations organs , bodies and the specialized agencies whose activities deal with human rights , as set out in resolution 48 / 141 ,  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations , and that the international community must exert every effort , in cooperation with national and international tribunals , to bring those responsible to justice , in accordance with international principles of due process ;  
We are greatly encouraged by the fact that the member countries of the European Union are fully committed to this goal and that the United Nations General Assembly , with 150 votes in favour and none against , adopted last fall a resolution in which urgent and vigorous measures for the conclusion of an effective , legally binding international agreement leading to a comprehensive ban on the use , stockpiling , production and transfer of APLMs are called for .  
Stressing that , in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , Governments committed themselves to eradicating poverty throughout the world through national action and international cooperation , taking account of the fact that this is an ethical , social , political and economic imperative of humankind ,  
Reiterates the unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of States ;  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
Regarding crimes against humanity , article 3 of the statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda stresses the prosecution of persons responsible for crimes " when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds " , that is , it does not associate those crimes primarily with armed conflicts .  
D . 1 .  * This compilation of information concerning criminal acts committed by the separatists is based on the evidence of 15,000 witnesses and innocent victims of those acts , as also on a large amount of photographic and video material gathered by the Prosecutor 's Office of Georgia in the process of the investigation and contained in more than 100 volumes .  
In the absence of a ratification making it possible to apply a universal jurisdiction clause to the country where the crime was committed , States may for efficiency 's sake take measures in their internal legislation to establish extraterritorial jurisdiction over serious crimes under international law committed outside their territory which by their nature are within the purview not only of internal criminal law but also of an international punitive system to which the concept of frontiers is alien .  
In order to avoid military courts , in those countries where they have not yet been abolished , helping to perpetuate impunity by virtue of a lack of independence resulting from the chain of command to which all or some of their members are subject , their jurisdiction must be limited solely to specifically military offences committed by military personnel , excluding human rights violations constituting serious crimes under international law , which come under the jurisdiction of the ordinary domestic courts or , where necessary , an international court .  
For the first time in its history , a peaceful hand-over of power between two democratically elected presidents took place in February 1996 , when President Pr � al assumed office ; several election rounds have been held without violent incidents ; and the fledgling police force , which is making progress towards the day when it can alone assume public security functions , is already having a positive effect on security in the country : compared to 1995 , the average number of homicides committed monthly in 1997 has decreased .  
I have the honour to inform you that your letter dated 8 August 1997 ( S / 1997 / 633 ) concerning your decision to appoint Mr . Reed Brody ( United States of America ) as the third member of the investigative team to investigate alleged grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo committed since 1 March 1993 has been brought to the attention of the members of the Council .  
Noting with concern the absence in the countries concerned of specific legislation to govern offences committed by minor children , the absence of preventive and educational measures for their reintegration into society which would enable minor detainees to become rehabilitated and no longer marginalized , as well as the very limited number of children 's magistrates capable of understanding the problems of delinquent children and seeing that they are cared for ,  
Deeply concerned at the continuing reports of grave abuses and acts of violence committed against women , and that some groups of women are especially vulnerable to acts of discrimination , violence and abuse based on gender , including women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant workers , women living in rural communities , women living in poverty , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and girl children ,  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the annihilation of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening territorial integrity and international peace and security , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
Such provocative actions by the separatist leaders of the Armenians in Nagorny Karabakh , at a time when positive trends are emerging towards a just and decisive resolution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict on the basis of respect for the principles of territorial integrity of the Azerbaijani Republic and the granting of broad autonomy to Nagorny Karabakh , once again demonstrate that the separatists , consolidating the results of the aggression committed against Azerbaijan , intend to nullify the efforts of the Co-Chairmen of the Minsk group of OSCE and thereby to destroy the peacemaking process . 
In the coming months , Canada would continue to promote action in favour of sustainable development at various important regional and global meetings , and it was committed to cooperating for the achievement of satisfactory results at the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly on the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the annihilation of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening territorial integrity and international peace and security , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;

At the World Conference on Education for All and the World Summit for Social Development , Governments committed themselves to ensuring universal access to quality education , attaining the highest possible standards of physical and mental health and ensuring access of all to primary health care .  This should include efforts to rectify inequalities relating to social conditions , race , national origin , age or disability , and between urban and rural areas .  
That mandate is underlined by the Secretary-General in paragraph 11 of his report submitted pursuant to paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 808 ( 1993 ) ( S / 25704 ) , in which he recalled that the Council had condemned the practice of ethnic cleansing and the massive , organized and systematic detention and rape of women , and reaffirmed that those who commit or have committed or order or have ordered the commission of such acts will be held individually responsible in respect of such acts .  
Human rights monitoring has a developed expertise regarding violations committed in a context of political conflict and repression but relative security ; it is not intended to monitor violations of international humanitarian standards in the course of full-scale armed conflict .  
Genocide can be committed irrespective of any armed conflict and comprises certain crimes ( such as killing or causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of a particular group ) committed with the intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group , as such .  
Crimes against humanity require that certain capital crimes ( such as murder , extermination , imprisonment , torture , rape or persecution on political , racial and religious grounds ) are committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnical , racial or religious grounds .  
The Ecuadorian State is committed to following this line of conduct and to promoting and protecting all human , civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , including the right to development .  
Furthermore , in accordance with the collective will of the people of the Sudan , a presidential decree granted an unconditional general amnesty in respect of all crimes committed and all civil and criminal claims asserted during the 14 years preceding the signing of the agreement .  
Through the three-pronged approach adopted by the Summit , States committed themselves to pursuing the objective of eradicating poverty in the world , promoting full employment as a fundamental public-policy priority and promoting social integration by fostering stable , safe and just societies on the basis of respect for human rights , non-discrimination and the closest possible involvement of all in decisions affecting their well-being .  
Convinced of the need effectively to tackle the problems confronting them in this area , they have committed themselves to creating an economic , social , political , cultural and ecological environment that is conducive to social development , as well as to giving priority to national and international policies and initiatives aimed at eliminating poverty , promoting employment , combating unemployment and fostering social integration .  
We share the basic premise that we live in a world of contradictions : integration and globalization coexist with fragmentation and marginalization ; computer science , while a source of progress , is also facilitating the expansion of transnational criminal networks , drug trafficking , money laundering and terrorism ; greater awareness of environmental problems is not accompanied by the political will to find satisfactory solutions ; and despite the strengthening of democracy , extremely serious violations of human rights continue to be committed .  
We warmly commend the timely initiative taken by Canada in convening earlier this month an international meeting of countries that have committed themselves and taken national action to advance a global ban on anti-personnel landmines .  
As stated in his previous report , the Special Representative believes that the speedy creation of an independent electoral commission would send an unambiguous signal to the people of Cambodia that the Government of Cambodia is committed to free and fair elections .

In addition , Austria made reference to the Convention applying the Schengen Agreement , which Austria has signed but not yet ratified , under which measures of cross-frontier observation and prosecution are only admissible if one of the listed offences has been committed , which also included the " illicit trade in poisonous and harmful substances " .  
At the regional level , it establishes a permanent multinational task force , composed of national law enforcement officers from each party capable of operating across the borders to combat criminal activities committed in the illegal trade in wildlife .  
In the light of the judicial nature of the International Tribunal , it is clear that any such determination would not affect ongoing legal proceedings or the obligation to surrender persons accused of having committed serious violations of international humanitarian law while the armed conflict was still ongoing .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
Reiterates the unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of States ;  
The Ministry of the Interior had established a department whose responsibilities included the programme of reparation for acts committed between 1976 and 1983 , while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had instituted a department with responsibility for shaping foreign policy in the area of human rights and the advancement of women and for coordinating with international bodies in that field . 
He reaffirmed his Governments view that the Fourth Geneva Convention applied to territories occupied by Israel since 1967 ; it opposed the specific reference to Jerusalem which had no effect on issues of sovereignty and prejudged the final political arrangements in territories that could be determined only by the direct negotiations to which the parties had committed themselves .  
Turkey considered that such a convention should also include organized transnational crimes committed in the perpetration of or linked to terrorist acts and illicit trafficking in firearms , in chemical and nuclear materials and in children and other persons .  24 .  The United States noted that Member States had not had sufficient time to discuss the question of the elaboration of an international convention against organized crime and to exchange their views on the issue .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
By its resolution 827 ( 1993 ) of 25 May 1993 , the Security Council decided to establish an international tribunal for the sole purpose of prosecuting persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1 January 1991 ( " International Tribunal " ) and adopt the Statute of the International Tribunal annexed to the Secretary-General 's report prepared pursuant to Security Council resolution 808 ( 1993 ) of 22 February 1993 .  
If it is committed by any State body or official , acting within its / his authority or ultra vires , it is considered to be an act by the State ( regardless whether it is suitable for discussion at the international level ) . 
Gross and massive violations of human rights can be committed by local State bodies and officials , too , but the danger of such violations increases immeasurably when they are committed by , for example , a parliament passing racist laws , or a ministerial cabinet conducting a repressive policy .  
On the subject of human rights violations committed on the orders or with the sanction of Governments , it must be borne in mind that the term Government in this context is used not in the narrow sense , to designate the highest executive organ ( the council of ministers , cabinet or suchlike ) , but the entire system of State bodies , particularly legislative and executive , and the associated officials , since it is they who are most often the instigators when violations of human rights occur .
