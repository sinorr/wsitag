All state representatives at the Tunis Summit claimed that this plan proved the countries ' commitment to pursue and strengthen political , economic , social , and educational reforms .  However , these reforms had to be carried out according to the national conditions , cultural backgrounds , religious beliefs , and the possible extent of change of individual states to silently resist the U.S . intention of forcing the Arab states into carrying out political and economic reforms by means foreign to the Arabs .  
After the spring term begins , all middle and primary schools , education administrative departments and relevant organizations should publicize the government 's educational policy and the correct educational thinking and methods to the parents , exchange with them or introduce to them the experience of educating children scientifically , guide them to take a correct attitude toward education and know the true meaning of talent , and guide their eagerness to see their children succeed in life to the right direction .

constitutes a fundamental guiding ideology for China 's educational reform and development under the historical conditions of socialist market economic development , reform , and opening up ; serves as a guide to action for deepening educational reform and promoting quality education in an all-around manner ; and has great , practical significance as a guide as well as far-reaching historical significance .  
All categories of schools at all levels , educational and administrative departments , and relevant organizations should disseminate the party 's policy on education and the accurate ideas and methods for education among the broad masses of students ' parents , exchange and popularize the experience in educating children in a scientific way , guide the parents to foster accurate outlook on education and talented persons , and enable them to accurately conduct family education for their children .  
The speech profoundly points out the existing problems and weak links in educational work , reflects Comrade Jiang Zemin 's great concern and care about education .  Not only the speech has realistic guiding significance on carrying out the Party 's educational policy in an all-round way and carrying forward our country 's education reform and development , but also will create profound historical influence .  
We should take seriously studying and all-round carrying out Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech as a turning point to launch widespread and profound studies and discussions among the Party Committees and governments at all levels and all related departments especially education departments as well as all social related parties .  We should deepen our understandings , unify the thinking and lay a good ideological foundation in order to carry out quality education , strengthen and promote educational work , and create a new situation of paying attention to the healthy growth of youths among the whole society .  
Ma Huisheng , principal of the Fuxing Middle School in Shanghai Municipality and member of the CPPCC National Committee held that schools at all levels should keep to the orientation of educational reform and development , clearly define the education of qualified personnel as their central task , and train more and better personnel for national economic and social development .

He said : The important speech delivered by Comrade Jiang Zemin recently on educational issues was not directed at any specific chance occurrences .  It was an exposition of great foresight made in consideration of the destiny of our country , national rejuvenation , the implementation of the strategy for rejuvenating the nation by applying scientific and technological advances and promoting education , and the development of socialist modernization .  
It is necessary to propel forward the scientific and technological revolution of agriculture , reform the agricultural scientific and technological structure , and gradually establish an agricultural scientific and technological innovative system which can attain the advanced level in the world , a technical dissemination system which can transform scientific and technological achievements in a highly efficient and productive way , and an agricultural educational and training system which can noticeably enhance the scientific , technological , and cultural quality of peasants .  
Zhu Rongji said : Mr President is the Chinese people 's old friend .  We satisfactorily see that in the last 36 years since China and the Republic of Congo forged diplomatic ties , our bilateral friendly and cooperative relations have been steadily and smoothly developing .  Sound cooperation full of positive results has been carried out in the political , economic and trade , public health , and educational fields .  
After summing up the situation in reviewing the " three stresses " educational work of the previous stage , Zhang Quanjing pointed out : The central authorities have decided to conduct a " review " campaign after concluding the centralized " three stresses " education .  This is an important move for further consolidating and expanding the achievements in the " three stresses " education and is the specific embodiment of the principle of running the party strictly in the " three stresses " education .  
He stressed the need to conscientiously study and comprehensively understand General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's recent important speech on strengthening and improving the educational work , and implement his instructions in routine work .  School education , family education , and social education should be properly combined .  With the joint efforts of all parties concerned , a benign atmosphere for quality education should be created in society , and more favorable environment and conditions be created for youngsters ' healthy growth .  
conducted education and training with strenuous efforts , established and improved various forms of educational and training systems , and continuously raised the political and professional qualities and legal awareness of policemen , thereby effectively improving the fighting capacity of the public security force .  
It is necessary to adhere to the principle of doing ideological and political work and doing economic and vocational work at the same time .  Ideological and educational work should permeate practical work , and the actual results in ideological and political work should be increased .  
Deng Xiaoping also called for fostering new people with " a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good educational background , and a strong sense of discipline " and took this as the fundamental objective of developing socialist spiritual civilization .  He also stressed that ideals and the sense of discipline are the most important among all the four criteria .  
We have persisted in implementing the strategy of rejuvenating the city on the strength of science and education , conscientiously placing education in the strategic position that gives top priority to educational development , and continuously increasing the financial input into education , so that a relatively complete educational system has been formed , and the 12-year education system has been made universal in the city five years ahead of schedule prescribed by the state .  
As we have deepened the educational structural reform and promoted the quality education in a comprehensive way , distinctive features are formed in moral education , foreign language , computer science , special education , and advanced vocational education .  
As a result of the continuous increase in the input of educational infrastructure construction , the reinforcement of cultural market management , and the bold assimilation and innovation of all fine achievements of ancient , modern , Chinese , and foreign cultures , we have created a situation under which the tourism culture , popular culture , and elegant culture with Shenzhen 's characteristics have attained common development .  
Construction of urban infrastructure facilities including communications , post and telecommunications , water supply , power supply , gas supply , sewage disposal , and so on progressed ahead of schedule , and the residents ' housing , water and electric supply , medical treatment and public health , and cultural and educational conditions were considerably improved .  
For many years we have worked hard to put into practice Deng Xiaoping 's thinking of common prosperity .  Having gained a certain economic strength , we began to carry out the " project of common prosperity " and , relying mainly upon the financial departments at the city level for many consecutive years , raised funds totaling 1.88-billion yuan and put them into the relatively backward areas of the city in a bid to improve their infrastructure facilities , industrial layout , and cultural and educational conditions , thereby bringing about the coordinated development of various localities .  
The " Program " has put forward the overall objective and subordinate objectives for the educational reform and development of military academies in the coming decade , clearly defined the guiding ideology and the development principle for the work , drawn the outline of an educational system in military academies which enjoys the special characteristics of our army , and has put forward a series of mutually supporting and mutually dovetailing major reform measures .  
Jiang Zemin indicated : The cooperation between our two countries has also proved satisfactory in the educational , cultural , and scientific and technological fields .  Last year , in particular , China successfully held a watercolor painting exhibition and a Chinese Film Week in Greece ; while the Greek National Opera successful staged the ancient Greek tragedy " ( Maidyr ) " in Beijing , which was warmly received by the Chinese audience .  
All types of educational institutions at all levels and all educators in the country are shouldering a solemn mission .  They should have a fundamental aim of improving the quality of our nationals , give priority to cultivating the students ' innovativeness and practical abilities , and try hard to bring up developers of and successors to the socialist cause who achieve all-round moral , academic , physical , and artistic development .  
All quarters of society and educational departments should make concerted efforts to strengthen the comprehensive management of society and cultural development ; should air more selected radio and television programs , show more selected movies , and publish more selected books and journals that are beneficial to the youngters ' healthy growth so as to resolutely resist the poisoning of youngsters by various feudal superstitions and decadent ideas and cultures ;  
On the one hand , the ideological and political construction should push forward military academies and universities to further emancipate their thinking , change their perceptions , face modernization , face the world , face the future , catch up with the world trend of scientific and technological advances , of military revolution and of educational advances , create famous brands and struggle to be first class .  
At present , our military 's political and ideological work is facing many new problems like how to correctly understand and appropriately handle the relationship of honoring modern educational laws versus bringing to full play our military 's political advantages , teaching scientific and cultural knowledge versus cultivating military people 's ideological and political qualities and stimulating an academic and research atmosphere versus maintaining high ideological unity .  
By learning and singing these songs , we aim to strengthen the spiritual backbone of revolutionary military professionals , to improve the moral quality of the broad number of officials and soldiers , and to enable them to receive education , to purify their spiritual world , mold their attitude and improve their conscientiousness through aesthetic educational activities conducted in a way that influences their environment .  
Strengthen examination and inspection over coordinated educational activities following introduction of information technology .  Make timely organization of such activities as selection of proper topics , collective classes , key rehearsals , and on-the-spot visits .  It is necessary to ensure the concentration of topics and the correct subject contents .  
When conducting ideological and political education , we should expand intention and extension of ideological and political education , and while helping raise the ethical quality of officers and men we must also incorporate the raising of their scientific and technological levels into the educational scope .  
He said that our army 's cadre ranks must be developed in an allaround way and up-to-standard ideologically and politically and in terms of scientific and educational level , military occupational specialty , and physical and mental conditions , and they must have a good overall quality .  
A group of universally recognized cadres who have both ability and political integrity and made outstanding administrative performances have clinched their leading posts by means of competition .  All this has generally lowered the average age of middle-ranking cadres in various city party and government organizations .  The educational level and the overall quality of these cadres are notably raised .  
The city transferred a number of cadres with knowledge about industrial and urban development from city-level organs to work in suburban counties ; as a result , knowledge of local party and government leaders has been diversified , their average age was five years younger , and their average educational level has been raised , which has effectively boosted local economic work .  
Through reform , all the military 's colleges and universities should enable our military 's colleges and universities to catch up with the world 's technological progress , military revolution and trends in educational development with respect to educational concepts , infrastructure , curricular and research capabilities , and academic levels .  All military colleges and universities should create famous brands , try to be members of the first class , and make greater contributions to cultivating and supplying talented military professionals of high quality .  
Educational activities directed at certain targets , defining certain content , and organized around a relative focus , such as winter training for Party members , basic level Party schools , political schools for workers , night schools for peasants , theory study groups for young people , local educational institutes , and various types of training groups , etc .  
During the three major political struggles last year in particular , the educational leadership role of the news media was given full play , and waves of resistance to foreign aggression , protection of sovereignty , opposition of splittism , and strengthening of China were set off .  A healthy atmosphere in the whole society opposing superstition and resisting heretical teachings formed .  
The party 's central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core not only consistently upholds Deng Xiaoping Theory and holds high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , but has also enriched and developed Deng Xiaoping Theory in combination with the new conditions and new experience in the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnical policy , military , diplomatic , united front , and party building fields , and added new contents to scientific system of Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
The rules of the GATS are extremely advantageous to the developed countries that have superiority in qualified personnel , information , and management , and an excess of educational resources , which have opened up their paths for occupying the commanding height for economic development in the 21st century and winning the battle of contending for talented personnel in the world .  
Moreover , under the situation that relevant laws , regulations , and policies are not very perfect , opening China 's education markets will give rise to contradictions and problems in terms of education sovereignty , direction of running schools , education concepts , national cultural traditions , and management , and vehemently impact the relatively weak domestic educational industry , such as the production of educational instrument , studying appliances , books , software , toys , and so on .  
In this regard , Zhang Li proposed that facing the situation of China 's accession to the WTO soon , the educational sector at the government level should take the work of research , exposition , and verification as a matter of great urgency , use the experience of the 40 countries that have joined the education trade agreement for reference , set up a special organ to coordinate pertinent departments , and begin the procedure of making initial preparations .  
The " Decision " by the party committee of the PLA General Staff Headquarters pointed out : With a strong sense of dedication to the revolutionary cause and a highly developed sense of political responsibility , Comrade Liu Yixin has brought up large numbers of outstanding talents for the modernization building of our army , and has achieved fruitful results in teaching and scientific research ; and his devotion to the military academic and educational undertaking has set an example for us .  
An online long-distance teaching was demonstrated , with main classrooms at the University of Science and Technology for National Defense and branch classrooms at the University of Science and Engineering . The online teaching is adapted to the educational trend of the information era ; and it is an advanced teaching method and a new way to realize independent studies , share resources and train high-quality military personnel .  
Early in the War to Resist the United States and Help Korea , suddenly arriving new armaments were strange to many officers and soldiers because officers and soldiers of our armed forces had rather low scientific and educational levels and had all along used rather crude armaments during long years of domestic war .  Thus , in the second campaign , over 2,000 captured automobiles were destroyed by bombings executed by US armed forces because basically no one was able to drive an automobile to a place under cover .  
promoting the economic , educational , scientific , and cultural cooperation and interchange between Macao and the inland , connecting people from all circles of Macao , improving the association between Macao and the inland , reflecting the opinions that Macao residents have to the inland , managing the related Taiwan affairs , undertaking other matters that the central government hands over . 
Since hostile forces and saboteurs at home and abroad seize every opportunity and try by hook or by crook to steal China 's political , military , economic , cultural , and educational intelligence , cases of leakage of secrets are frequent and startling , posing a serious threat to the information security of the party , the state , and the military .

Political restructuring and the development of the socialist democracy and political system must be conducive to maintaining and giving play to the features and advantages of our political system , and conducive to maintaining the unity of the country , ethnic unity and social stability .  In addition , the historical conditions and the level of economic , cultural and educational development must also be taken into full consideration .  
In order to actively meet the requirements of the new situation and tasks and earnestly master features and laws , on the basis of making sufficient study and argumentation , the Central Military Commission and PLA General Departments have staged a series of new policies and regulations focusing on improving educational quality , conducting troop training in science and technology , strengthening the cultivation of cadres , implementing socialized safeguards , improving the work style of leaders , and so on .

However , there still exists a wide gap between our army and foreign armies in the cultivation of high-quality talent .  For example , officers holding master 's degree and above make up a relatively low proportion in our army ;  
Liu Huadi : In the 50 years since its peaceful liberation , Tibet has witnessed a fast development in its education undertakings .

The ideal Chinese woman of ancient times played the backstage role of dutiful wife and loving mother . With time and social progress women began taking on low-level jobs outside the home . Eventually , as society demanded more capable workers , and women 's educational opportunities increased , so did their appearance in management and top-level jobs .  
" Taiwan 's economic progress over the past thirty or more years has raised living and educational standards and increased the desire of the populace to participate in politics . This , together with other changing objective conditions , has made ' lifting martial law ' and ' opening up the formation of new political parties ' a natural decision , " says government spokesman Chang King-yuh .  
Master Sheng-yen has two explanations for the turnabout . First , at a time when contemporary man 's living space grows ever smaller and social tensions ever greater , Buddhism offers people explanations for the flux around them and a limitless spiritual space to roam in . And second , as people rise in educational level , they gain a new understanding of Buddhism which they find more acceptable .  
Our reliance upon foreign countries is still great . As the U . S . seeks royalties for its reading material , we can compete on a reasonable basis if we can increase the prices of these materials in order to benefit R . O . C . products . On the other hand , academic , educational , and technological material might be sold in larger quantities at lower prices .  
These included : The government should increase cultural and educational investment , establish a complete social welfare system and robust rule of law system , and strengthen public trust and public authority . The mass media should educate society and improve social habits , and should avoid exaggerating stories .  
In order to maintain rapid economic growth , spur social advancement , develop manpower resources , further culture and understanding , and join the ranks of the advanced nations , the ROC must actively carry out educational reform and promote the concept of lifelong education , spurring the nation and its people to a new educational level .  
Development of National EducationOur educational system has endowed the general public with the ancient Greek ideal of a healthy mind in a healthy body . This has produced a source of efficient manpower , and it points out the future direction which national education should take .  
The goal of national park management is to conserve treasured natural scenic areas in Taiwan which are judged to be of national or international significance . Besides pursuing conservation goals , park administration is aimed at providing sites for scientific studies , educational training , and recreational activities .  
Environmental Conservation and ProtectionWorking under an overall plan , the Environmental Protection Administration of the Executive Yuan has taken several important steps since its establishment . It has actively promoted policy reform , set up a sound organizational system , strengthened administration and management , revised or drafted new laws and regulations , provided educational guidance , strictly controlled major sources of pollution , expanded engineering projects , developed technology for environmental protection , established an environmental evaluation system , and set guidelines for resolving disputes caused by pollution .  
Our middle class is constantly expanding , and these people have an excellent educational level and potential as opinion-formers . Once they become aware of the importance of regenerating spiritual values in our civilization , I believe balanced social development will be within our grasp .  
With an educational credit system inherited from Europe , Australian universities used to recognize degrees from Taiwan from only a few public universities as qualifying their holders for direct admission to graduate school , but they have gradually relaxed their standards . Only a few , such as Sydney and Melbourne , are more strict and may require an oral interview or a trial year in the undergraduate program before deciding on admission .  
The formation of culture is strongly influenced by geographical factors , " says Tsai Hsiang-hui , an associate professor of history at the Chinese Culture University who serves as a trustee to the cultural foundation in Peikang . " The significance of local cultural and educational foundations lies in bringing together people from the same area , sharing similar customs and backgrounds , to show their concern for local culture . If we are n't elementary school classmates , we may be distant cousins .  
In his view , housing belongs to the infrastructure and can not easily be altered once built , whereas cultural and educational work can be developed and improved through mistakes , and is a long term project that can not be left undone .  
Some people have criticized the education of gifted children as elitist , as a " gilded lily " taking up valuable educational resources , but Tzeng Su-jung , a doctor of education , disagrees . " If gifted students are put in ordinary classes and wind up with blank expressions all the time because they 've mastered the material , is n't that a form of learning disadvantage , too ? "  
Hsiao Yeh , who was once with CMPC and devoted much effort to the promotion of new cinema , is even more adamant : " This has nothing at all to do with new cinema , it 's a flash in the pan , " because the cultivation of film-makers alone is inadequate for raising standards throughout cinema , when " the whole cultural and educational environment has been static for so long , without any improvement .  
The Department of Education has already planned to spend 20 percent of its budget on improving the government primary and junior schools in Taiwan Province . Apart from this we want to aid private schools to raise the average educational level .  
To stay outside the patterns of adult life and just hang out means to waste the most precious period of life of learning skills and knowledge . Also , given the disapproving attitude of others , it will be hard to avoid a decline in self-respect and self - esteem , which will have a negative influence on long-term prospects . At the same time , it is also a great waste of educational resources , social re sources and economic development .  
They need more care : Of course , these children would n't need extra guidance if they did n't have problems . Every teacher is aware that very few children are able to make decisions of their own about their course in life . Assailed from every direction - - their natural talents , family environment , educational level , social status and so forth - - children who did n't have a very firm grasp on the tiller to begin with may easily wind up shaken and at a loss . "  
After the special education law was passed in 1984 , disabled children just like normal children had the right to an education , and the educational authorities established classes for the retarded at some elementary schools and junior high schools .  
Since the 1960s women in Taiwan have been entering the labor market in droves , making a major contribution to the island 's economic miracle . There are equal educational opportunities , greater opportunities in the work place , and an ever more diverse society . . . . These have allowed Taiwanese women to break through the historical Chinese mold for women as weak , dependent and subservient , revealing active , independent and self-motivated women striving for personal achievement .  
Last year , during the school 's summer camp , there were posters all over the school proclaiming " Say No to Drugs . " From a discussion about rampant drug abuse in the United States , she delved into modern Chinese history , examining how China lost power and was humiliated after the Opium War . Using a biography of Lin Tze-hsu as supplementary educational material , she was able to capture the students ' interest .  
Three years ago , when Mr . You invited me to act as convener of Ilan 's " Editorial Committee for Locally Oriented Language Teaching Materials , " I made my acceptance conditional on his placing local vernacular education work in the cultural and educational sphere , and resisting any attempt to put it on the political level where it could become a tool in the Democratic Progressive Party 's political battles with the Nationalist Party ( KMT ) .  
When the Republican Period began , Tan developed close relations with the Nationalist government , relying on his membership in the early revolutionary society Tung Meng Hui . With the additional factor of his considerable wealth , he indulged himself without reservation in various altruistic educational endeavors . He also commissioned his younger brother Tan Keng Hean to return to their home town and take charge of the business of founding and upgrading schools .  
Steering clear of collision " High educational background does n't equal high-level talent , " Chang Pei-chi says . Only a fter along time did he figure out that the high-level personnel cried out for by entrepreneurs are actually " outstanding higher-level technical personnel capable of leadership and rich in experience . " This is worlds apart from the garden variety nerd who has just earned his diploma but completely lacks practical experience .  
After having seen many such examples , NGO leaders are not unaware that criticizing is easier than doing the actual work . " The government is n't going to ask me to come serve in the public sector . If they did ask me , I 'm afraid it would n't be easy to do a good job , " admits one leader of an educational reform group . Once he switched roles from offense to defense , it would also be hard for him to escape " being vulnerable to attack . "  
In fact , outside the charmed circle of leading business families are large numbers of ethnic Chinese whose forebears came as laborers , and who still live at a low economic level with limited educational opportunities , just like the rest of the population . For many young women from this background , marriage is a means of escape from a life of poverty .  
The aim of educational reform is to put into practice a concept of education that imparts happiness , contentment , pluralism and mutual respect . Such education is designed to develop potentialities , respect individualism , promote humanism , and encourage creativity . All unreasonable restrictions will be removed to allow the emergence of a system of life-long learning . Ample room will be reserved for individual originality and personal traits to ensure the continued pursuit of self-growth and self-realization .  
Frankly speaking , the entire educational system in Taiwan is seriously lacking in understanding of aboriginal culture . Thus , not only Han Chinese , but even many indigenous people themselves , are mostly in the dark about their culture . This has meant that many pieces of aboriginal music already widely considered to be " treasures of world culture " ( please see accompanying article ) do not get the attention in Taiwan that they should .  
In the context of such an impressive and long-lasting buxiban culture , the Committee of Taipei Historical Records held a seminar in September of last year on " Examination-Oriented Supplementary Schools in Retrospect . " They invited a wide number of Taipei City 's senior pedagogues , such as the prestigious 1970s buxiban teachers Hsu Chen-liang and Chang Chin-wen , affirming the decades of educational work they contributed and expressing the hope that one day , when exemplary teachers are listed on Teachers ' Day , buxiban teachers will have a place too .  
At the end of September , work formally began on an investment by Acer Computer to build a multi - functional intelligent park in Taoyuan . Total investment is expected to be NT $ 200 billion . When completed , the park will have factories , residences , cultural and educational facilities , and more . It amounts to a privately funded version of the HSBIP , writing a new page for the " Invest in Taiwan " program .  
For the progress of their people , the educational workers of this mountainous area firmly man their posts , happy to lead simple , virtuous lives . Just like the orchid that attracts not the slightest attention , opening up little bright yellow blossoms under the cold wind and clamorous rain , they stand proud , refusing to bow their heads .  
As for the railway museum , five years ago the TRA set up a museum planning team to find suitable locations , " but all of the NT $ 5 million which we had budgeted was cut by the provincial assembly . They thought it was more appropriate for museums to be planned by cultural and educational departments , " says Chen Te-pei , spreading his hands in a gesture of frustration .  
In this sort of cultural tradition , even if many contemporary women and their husbands enjoy a substantial level of educational achievement and income , when these women return to their motherinlaw 's house , they still come down a notch , afraid of offending at every turn , making their inlaws unhappy and causing trouble for their husbands .  
But academics tended to the view that the activity was a shallow publicity stunt , and had no real significance in terms of sexual equality or educational reform . As for the general public , according to a newspaper opinion poll 55% assessed the camp positively , while 25% came out strongly against it . Perhaps the effectiveness of the training itself is secondary-just by attracting such wide attention and prompting such serious thought , it has already been well worthwhile ! ( Marlene Chen and Anna Wang / tr . by Robert Taylor )  
And how can we keep this concept-along with the familiar concept of IQ , and the newly-emerging one of children 's motor intelligence ( MQ ) - from being merely fashionable phrases which are mouthed parrot-fashion , and instead allow them to help us turn back from educational methods which have been twisted by an obsession with academic success , and give back to parents the opportunity to raise physically healthy and emotionally balanced children ?  
Taiwan 's mainstream educational structure is divided into the five categories of ethics , scholastic learning , physical education , social skills and the fine arts . Among these , the category of scholastic learning has always been given the greatest weight . Yet the recent craze for " EQ , " with its emphasis on self-discipline , interpersonal relationships , emotional expressiveness and a balance between the mind and body , could be described as encompassing things ethical , physical , social and artistic .  
Because the theory of EQ includes a balanced , multifaceted educational perspective that emphasizes both the mental and physical aspects of individuals ' emotions , it has not only become popular among the population at large , but has also garnered considerable interest in the academic community , being seen as compatible with the call to educational reform .  
One educational reformer has commented that , in this age of " free market education " where textbooks have become " intellectual commodities , " it is difficult to expect publishers not to concern themselves with business and other factors not related to education . But the bigger question is , are the rules of the new privatized education game fair ? Are they consistent ?  
Tzung-han is a gifted child with an IQ of 180 . The school he attended was unable to meet his educational needs and attending class was just boring for him . His teacher beat him everyday for forgetting to bring a handkerchief or toilet paper , or for losing things . He is a sensitive boy and the jealousy of his classmates hurt him .  
The screen shows the powerlessness and terror expressed in the gentle , youthful face of a girl in junior high experiencing corporal punishment . It serves as a silent accusation about the authoritarian educational environment and has stirred up quite a lot of sympathy , taking top prize for food commercials at the China Times Advertising Awards this year .  
Lee suggests that Lin will promote educational reform in a steady , careful manner . Although Lin Ching-jiang is under the heat of intense public scrutiny , he displays considerable self-confidence . He has declared that educational reform is not about swashbuckling heroism , but about long-term commitment . He intends to implement smaller class sizes by the year 2006 , and emphasizes that the Ministry of Education will place high priority on adult education .  
Those who " set out with great hopes only to return defeated " were left both angry and disappointed . As one person who works in the media noted , in metropolitan Taipei , " The leisure industry was pushing its leisure facilities down people 's throats all day long . Media packaging made for holiday crowds of historic dimensions on government-sponsored educational package tours and at private amusement parks , new department stores and even the Hollywood-transplanted Warner Village movie theater complex . "  
Although this is a new and ambitious research project and no one can tell if it will succeed or not , the chance to help numerous people improve their nutritional intake , physical condition and thus national educational levels and competitiveness , is well worth the effort .  
These various musuems large and small not only pioneer new aspects of culture and enrich existing ones , they are spread across the island and are flexibly run , closing the psychological distance between museums and the public at large . They are educational and recreational resources that have become part of people 's daily lives .  
People have long been aware of the educational and recreational functions of museums . But now the global trend is toward moving the focus of museums away from the elite to the general public , and relating them more closely to the lives of the people who live nearby . From elite to mass  
Vincent Siew particularly emphasizes that educational reform is a firm policy of the Executive Yuan . It has already approved the " Educational Reform Stimulus Package " drafted by the Ministry of Education . Starting from 1999 , more than NT $ 150 billion will be spent over a five-year period to advance 12 educational reform projects , including " promoting education for the entire citizenry " and " encouraging diversification and increased quality in vocational education . "  
Today , the goal is to keep children from being affected by the two extremes of repressed desire or ignorant promiscuity , and to help them establish correct sexual attitudes as early as possible . Thus the Ministry of Education has begun to promote sex education in schools under the name of " sex and gender equality education . " It has been discussed and seminars have been held continually at schools at all levels . Sexual education has gone from being a taboo subject on campuses to being one of the most prominent aspects of educational reform .  
Shih Ying does not deny that there were already a number of community organizations active in Wenshan District , and that it already had quite a strong cultural and educational ethos . Thus siting the first community college there " in fact was a soft option-but that does n't mean we are n't aware of the difficulties to be faced later . " He says that in the future it is hoped that community colleges will spread to communities throughout Taiwan , but this will depend on each community 's degree of readiness and preparedness .  
The Ministry of Education also has plans to establish " community colleges , " but their main goal is to give those students from the technical and vocational educational stream who are unable to squeeze in through the narrow doors of the conventional universities an extra opportunity to gain a university-level qualification ; the aims do not seem very different from those behind the establishment of the old night schools or today 's Open University .  
Many Takasago Volunteers who survived the cataclysm of the war returned to live under a " new dynasty , " the ROC , and found that their formerly Japanese-speaking world had suddenly become a Mandarin one . The language of the broadcast media had changed overnight , along with the dominant ideology . As time went by , their children and grandchildren grew up under the educational system of the nationalist government , completely different from the system during the Japanese era , and the ex-Volunteers became a lonely , lost group .  
Eighty to ninety percent of the new performers returning to Taiwan from studies abroad were trained in such classes . " Within the formal educational system , specially arranged art and music laboratory classes provide intensive training to develop artistic talents .  
This was largely based on the notion that so long as no physical injury results , a little pain-an " appropriate " level of punishment-is quite acceptable But the move was reversed after it came under fierce attack from commentators , the public and educational reform groups , who asserted that giving the green light to corporal punishment in this way would be a setback for educational reform .  
This led to the questions getting more and more difficult . It was the sole basis for determining educational advancement , but it was completely removed from the basic educational level . What we want to do is to expand the base . " As long as the schools put the emphasis on imparting basic knowledge , then they will be meeting the goal of the reforms .  
For example , one mother had very high educational ideals and understood how to stimulate her child 's potential . Their family did n't watch TV , and she often took her son to music concerts . After he graduated from junior high , her son applied and was admitted to Taipei 's top senior high school , Chienkuo , and then tested into prestigious National Taiwan University ( NTU ) .  
Take for example the class for outstanding students in math and science . Teachers have carefully created a systematic curriculum , designed diversified teaching activities , and produced supplementary educational materials and lectures not part of the standard textbooks . When necessary , they undertake deeper and broader learning activities . The goal is to develop students with the ability to think creatively and with a spirit of scientific research .  
In particular , there have been salient achievements in the pluralization of education . The joint college entrance exam system , which has dominated educational thinking for nearly half a century , is about to be abolished , and other topics such as women 's rights , children 's issues , workers ' rights and environmental protection have all come to the fore as campaign issues at one time or another .  
We will soon seek a consensus among the ruling and opposition parties , academia and the public so as to carry on with educational reforms and build a healthy , proactive , lively and innovative educational system , which will allow Taiwan to cultivate an uninterrupted stream of top-notch talents amid the fierce international competition .  
Of course we are well aware that statesmanship ca n't be learned just from a short series of classes , but we hope that by laying on these courses from our standpoint as a cultural and educational foundation , and not from a party political standpoint , we can make a start by using culture and education to purify people 's hearts . Because in fact a real political leader needs to speak from the heart and express his true hopes .  
Holding that meditation will , along with natural science and behavioral science , emerge as one of the three most important educational disciplines , WLEF has designed a Zen leadership program that emphasizes state of mind . Students are encouraged to probe their inner selves during moments of solitude and thereby cultivate self-discipline , increase their wisdom and potential , and improve their physical endurance and ability to handle pressure . They learn both how to get involved in the world and how to morally transcend it .  
While he dedicated his life 's work to economic and technological development , he did not forget the importance of raising educational standards , narrowing the gap between urban and rural citizens and controlling population growth , and these were not overlooked in the promotion of his new ideas .  
For instance , the course content offered by his college 's Graduate Institute of Technology and Innovation Management is only suitable for postgraduate work . " But due to the regulations imposed by the Ministry of Education , if you set up only a graduate school the educational resources available from the government do not compare with those for a combined undergraduate department and graduate school . " Wu says that this results in institutions having to make a choice between " actual need " and " winning more resources . "  
" If Taiwan could elect a president like former British prime minister John Major , whose highest educational attainment was graduation from primary school , perhaps only then will the perverse custom of everyone trying to advance to a higher level of education gradually disappear , " says Chou . With a shake of her head and a sigh , Chou says that the deconstruction of social values will require a great deal of time .  
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) , with over 170 member states , places wild animals into one of four categories depending upon the size of their surviving populations and how endangered the species may be . Various controls and limitations on import , export , and trade are then imposed for the various categories . Protected animals may only be imported under certain conditions , such as for educational purposes or medical treatment , but not for profit .  
The eighth clause of the Basic Education Law , which was passed in June of the same year , puts it even more clearly : " During the period of compulsory education , parents are responsible for guiding and assisting their children . Moreover , parents have the legal right to select educational method and content on behalf of their children and to decide whether they enroll in a school . "  
Ku enthusiastically consults with people from all areas , and has done his utmost to assist domestic research in fields related to welding . Ku also contributes by " resuscitating " expensive machinery damaged by human errors or natural disasters , thus helping industry and educational institutions reduce the massive financial losses that can result from such events . While his work has guaranteed that machinery works , he has helped even more people by passing the torch of his knowledge on to his students .  
As a result of educational reform , children today are no longer ranked in strict order of their test marks . Instead , their attainment is reflected by broader grades-A , B , C and so on . Also , the principle of more equal emphasis on five major aspects of education is gradually being implemented . Today intellectual education accounts for only 60% of overall grades , while physical education accounts for 20% , and moral and social education each account for 10% .  
Chang Tien-fu says : " Schools chose to focus on transforming themselves and in the process forgot their own position and character . " Although many schools did change their name , their relative position in the educational hierarchy was not improved . On the contrary , having reorganized themselves many technical and vocational schools began to turn their back on earlier achievements . In other words , they stopped focusing on the need for practical work and started to emphasize theory and R &amp; D .  
In addition to technical and vocational students continuing on in education in large numbers and thus leading to the withering away of the " inherently " inferior " second track , " the lack of official expenditures in this area have amounted to " kicking a man when he is down , " and the gap between the two national educational " tracks " has widened significantly .  
Logically , after students are streamed into the vocational educational system , the future path to higher education should not be determined on the basis of general subjects . " But whether they want to become nurses or civil engineering technicians , and whether they are applying to a technical college or a technical university , in the exams they are tested in Chinese , English and math , " says Tien . " There is no emphasis on professional abilities at all . "  
The bill also stipulates that residents of autonomous areas will enjoy equal rights in participating in political , economic , social , educational and cultural affairs , and are entitled to equal treatment .  
However , " although Chiang Wei-shui and others were found guilty in the Social Order and Police Incident , " writes Huang Huang-hsiung in his Chiang biography , " they indirectly benefited from this , because it became a focal point for the political and social movement . " The overreaction and repression by the colonial authorities against these activists-whose petition campaign was moderate and perfectly legal , and whose cultural association restricted itself to educational activities-not only fueled popular resentment , but also hardened the attitudes of activists toward the regime .  
Whereas their predecessors ' values were shaped most by great economic opportunity and the experience of collective action for political and social change , many different elements have affected the values of these generations . Besides larger structural factors , educational reform has also been important . The reforms introduced by the government in the late 1990s increased the number of universities and graduate programs significantly , so that many more young people have access to higher education than did their predecessors .  
Classical studies in kindergartens has become more fashionable , but in the mainland the educational environment is fiercely competitive . Even getting into a good elementary school entails being tested and paying bribes under the table , so the pressure to advance is felt right down to the toddlers graduating from these kindergartens , and it can impinge seriously on their classical studies time .  
Wu says that the causes of low creativity and the cultural context are being fixed , but no systematic changes have been made as yet . One encouraging point is that the MOE has included creativity as a core educational ability . Industry , government , and the educational sector , however , have yet to come together . If all of them can move forward together and embrace one another , the circle will get larger and larger .  
Because of this , creative education has been established as a four-year pilot project with an annual budget of NT $ 60 million . In spirit , it will encourage diversification , differentiation , and maybe even a little rebellion and mischief . In practical terms , whether in innovation in educational methods , reform in educational materials , innovation in student performance or in reforming and restructuring campus spaces , any good ideas will receive support . And because this effort is a local , piecemeal , gradual bottom-up process , it will not encounter much opposition .  
As well as holding seminars and other such activities , the Educational Issues group also seeks to ' correct twisted educational values , ' " hoping to bring together the voices of concerned parents . After having held a public forum on this and come up with no obvious answers , they moved on to try tapping parent-teacher associations and study groups in an effort to establish a network and stake out a position in the community .

This global agenda is not restrictive , and can be achieved through the political , cultural , educational , social , economic , information and even technological domains .  
As laudable and worthy as those studies may be , the international community should not spare equivalent efforts to reinforce simple educational tools that are increasingly valuable in saving the lives of many innocent people .  
This laid the groundwork for a strategic partnership with three major strands , one political , one economic and one cultural , educational , scientific and technical .  
Among the main laws are the law on educational reform within the framework of sustainable human development which covers social , economic , political and cultural aspects intended to promote peoples growth as individuals and members of society .  
The ageing of populations and the increase in the number of elderly throughout the world which are the results of medical , hygienic , scientific and educational achievements are phenomena of the late twentieth century .  
While UNESCO will be responsible for the conceptual aspects and educational content , ITU , which is developing the standards , will take primary responsibility for the technical implementation and choice of technological solutions .  
Furthermore , the teaching of human rights and international humanitarian law , adapted to each educational level , has not been incorporated into the curriculum as a compulsory subject .  
This requires sustained educational and proactive initiatives in those various sectors at the community level which are geared towards promoting harmonious social relations between different ethnic groups .  
The report also ignores the cumulative impact of the sanctions on all the economic , social , cultural , educational and even psychological aspects of life for the Iraqi people and their projected impact on future generations even if they were to be lifted now .

Since 1993 , however , secondary-level institutions have been undergoing extensive restructuring through the Reform of Secondary Education ( ROSE ) project which is aimed at improving the quality and equity of educational provisions at the secondary level through the establishment of a common national curriculum for grades 7 to 9 .  
The main priorities for the Ministry of Education beginning in 1999 were : closing the gaps by raising peripheral municipalities and weak population groups ; affirmative action for the Arab educational system ; elevating special education ; increasing the number of students with matriculation entitlement .  
These include the allocation of revenues from taxes collected in Kosovo to minority communities through the community committees at the municipal level ; the implementation of employment-generating projects in these communities ; improved public services and utilities ; the integration of the 24 local community offices as part of the local administration structure to ensure equal access to public services ; and provision of more educational and health facilities as well as social welfare benefits .  
Article 55 of the Charter explicitly recognizes that solutions to international economic , social , health and related problems , international , cultural and educational cooperation and universal respect for human rights are all essential for the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations .  
Affirming that beyond the key role played by communities , strong partnerships among Governments , the United Nations system , intergovernmental organizations , people living with HIV / AIDS and vulnerable groups , medical , scientific and educational institutions , non-governmental organizations , the business sector including generic and research-based pharmaceutical companies , trade unions , media , parliamentarians , foundations , community organizations , faith-based organizations and traditional leaders are important ;  
We recognize that international and national exchange and dialogue [ among youth ] / [ at all levels , in particular educational institutions , religious authorities and youth associations ] , and the development of a global network among youth are important and fundamental elements in building intercultural understanding and respect and will contribute to the elimination of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
In this regard , it is important to introduce and , as applicable , to reinforce an / the anti-discrimination and anti-racism components / into human rights programmes in school curricula , to develop relevant educational material and to ensure that all teachers are effectively trained and adequately motivated to shape attitudes and behavioural patterns , etc .  / of the school curricula and to improve educational materials on human rights and anti-racism , in order to shape attitudes and behavioural patterns based on the principles of non-discrimination , mutual respect and tolerance ;  
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is invited , in cooperation with the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , concerned specialized and regional organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations active in the field of promotion and protection of human rights , to undertake periodic consultations and to encourage research activities aimed at collecting , maintaining and adapting the technical , scientific , educational and information materials produced by all cultures around the world to fight racism ;  
Considering , however , that the " market " is more than 200 countries worldwide , it would seem fair to seek an explanation among three other factors as well : Trainmar no longer coincides with countries ' needs in the way it originally did ; Trainmar is not necessarily the best option for training in maritime operations and management , compared to the increasing number of other educational and training facilities ; awareness of Trainmar is lacking , e.g . due to lack of information or positive impact from results in existing centres .  
The qualifications would specifically need to embrace : general management ( setting targets and milestones , planning strategic measures by which to achieve targets , estimating costs and design budgets , finance , implementation and control ) ; pedagogics ( theoretical formation as well as skills in the design and delivery of courses , adequate knowledge of educational and training policies and regimes ) ; substantive experience and knowledge ( trade and commerce , business and global logistics , technologies , operation , organization , economics and commercial processes of maritime transport ) .  
The institutional location of Trainmar centres is not generally relevant for an integrated approach to maritime transport and commerce , or to overall national interest : there is evidence that in some cases national authorities have not been given the opportunity of considering the most opportune institutional location of the Trainmar centres as among available educational and training institutions ; there is a heavy focus on locating Trainmar centres in ports or training facilities attached to ports .

We have persisted in implementing the strategy of rejuvenating the city on the strength of science and education , conscientiously placing education in the strategic position that gives top priority to educational development , and continuously increasing the financial input into education , so that a relatively complete educational system has been formed , and the 12-year education system has been made universal in the city five years ahead of schedule prescribed by the state .  
As we have deepened the educational structural reform and promoted the quality education in a comprehensive way , distinctive features are formed in moral education , foreign language , computer science , special education , and advanced vocational education .  
As a result of the continuous increase in the input of educational infrastructure construction , the reinforcement of cultural market management , and the bold assimilation and innovation of all fine achievements of ancient , modern , Chinese , and foreign cultures , we have created a situation under which the tourism culture , popular culture , and elegant culture with Shenzhen 's characteristics have attained common development .

Having gained a certain economic strength , we began to carry out the " project of common prosperity " and , relying mainly upon the financial departments at the city level for many consecutive years , raised funds totaling 1.88-billion yuan and put them into the relatively backward areas of the city in a bid to improve their infrastructure facilities , industrial layout , and cultural and educational conditions , thereby bringing about the coordinated development of various localities .

Last year , in particular , China successfully held a watercolor painting exhibition and a Chinese Film Week in Greece ; while the Greek National Opera successful staged the ancient Greek tragedy " ( Maidyr ) " in Beijing , which was warmly received by the Chinese audience .  
All types of educational institutions at all levels and all educators in the country are shouldering a solemn mission .  They should have a fundamental aim of improving the quality of our nationals , give priority to cultivating the students ' innovativeness and practical abilities , and try hard to bring up developers of and successors to the socialist cause who achieve all-round moral , academic , physical , and artistic development .

In order to maintain rapid economic growth , spur social advancement , develop manpower resources , further culture and understanding , and join the ranks of the advanced nations , the ROC must actively carry out educational reform and promote the concept of lifelong education , spurring the nation and its people to a new educational level .  
Development of National EducationOur educational system has endowed the general public with the ancient Greek ideal of a healthy mind in a healthy body . This has produced a source of efficient manpower , and it points out the future direction which national education should take .  
The goal of national park management is to conserve treasured natural scenic areas in Taiwan which are judged to be of national or international significance . Besides pursuing conservation goals , park administration is aimed at providing sites for scientific studies , educational training , and recreational activities .  
Environmental Conservation and ProtectionWorking under an overall plan , the Environmental Protection Administration of the Executive Yuan has taken several important steps since its establishment . It has actively promoted policy reform , set up a sound organizational system , strengthened administration and management , revised or drafted new laws and regulations , provided educational guidance , strictly controlled major sources of pollution , expanded engineering projects , developed technology for environmental protection , established an environmental evaluation system , and set guidelines for resolving disputes caused by pollution .  
Our middle class is constantly expanding , and these people have an excellent educational level and potential as opinion-formers . Once they become aware of the importance of regenerating spiritual values in our civilization , I believe balanced social development will be within our grasp .  
With an educational credit system inherited from Europe , Australian universities used to recognize degrees from Taiwan from only a few public universities as qualifying their holders for direct admission to graduate school , but they have gradually relaxed their standards . Only a few , such as Sydney and Melbourne , are more strict and may require an oral interview or a trial year in the undergraduate program before deciding on admission .  
The formation of culture is strongly influenced by geographical factors , " says Tsai Hsiang-hui , an associate professor of history at the Chinese Culture University who serves as a trustee to the cultural foundation in Peikang . " The significance of local cultural and educational foundations lies in bringing together people from the same area , sharing similar customs and backgrounds , to show their concern for local culture . If we are n't elementary school classmates , we may be distant cousins .  
In his view , housing belongs to the infrastructure and can not easily be altered once built , whereas cultural and educational work can be developed and improved through mistakes , and is a long term project that can not be left undone .  
Some people have criticized the education of gifted children as elitist , as a " gilded lily " taking up valuable educational resources , but Tzeng Su-jung , a doctor of education , disagrees . " If gifted students are put in ordinary classes and wind up with blank expressions all the time because they 've mastered the material , is n't that a form of learning disadvantage , too ? "  
Hsiao Yeh , who was once with CMPC and devoted much effort to the promotion of new cinema , is even more adamant : " This has nothing at all to do with new cinema , it 's a flash in the pan , " because the cultivation of film-makers alone is inadequate for raising standards throughout cinema , when " the whole cultural and educational environment has been static for so long , without any improvement .  
The Department of Education has already planned to spend 20 percent of its budget on improving the government primary and junior schools in Taiwan Province . Apart from this we want to aid private schools to raise the average educational level .  
To stay outside the patterns of adult life and just hang out means to waste the most precious period of life of learning skills and knowledge . Also , given the disapproving attitude of others , it will be hard to avoid a decline in self-respect and self - esteem , which will have a negative influence on long-term prospects . At the same time , it is also a great waste of educational resources , social re sources and economic development .  
They need more care : Of course , these children would n't need extra guidance if they did n't have problems . Every teacher is aware that very few children are able to make decisions of their own about their course in life . Assailed from every direction - - their natural talents , family environment , educational level , social status and so forth - - children who did n't have a very firm grasp on the tiller to begin with may easily wind up shaken and at a loss . "  
After the special education law was passed in 1984 , disabled children just like normal children had the right to an education , and the educational authorities established classes for the retarded at some elementary schools and junior high schools .  
Since the 1960s women in Taiwan have been entering the labor market in droves , making a major contribution to the island 's economic miracle . There are equal educational opportunities , greater opportunities in the work place , and an ever more diverse society . . . . These have allowed Taiwanese women to break through the historical Chinese mold for women as weak , dependent and subservient , revealing active , independent and self-motivated women striving for personal achievement .  
Last year , during the school 's summer camp , there were posters all over the school proclaiming " Say No to Drugs . " From a discussion about rampant drug abuse in the United States , she delved into modern Chinese history , examining how China lost power and was humiliated after the Opium War . Using a biography of Lin Tze-hsu as supplementary educational material , she was able to capture the students ' interest .  
Three years ago , when Mr . You invited me to act as convener of Ilan 's " Editorial Committee for Locally Oriented Language Teaching Materials , " I made my acceptance conditional on his placing local vernacular education work in the cultural and educational sphere , and resisting any attempt to put it on the political level where it could become a tool in the Democratic Progressive Party 's political battles with the Nationalist Party ( KMT ) .  
When the Republican Period began , Tan developed close relations with the Nationalist government , relying on his membership in the early revolutionary society Tung Meng Hui . With the additional factor of his considerable wealth , he indulged himself without reservation in various altruistic educational endeavors . He also commissioned his younger brother Tan Keng Hean to return to their home town and take charge of the business of founding and upgrading schools .  
Steering clear of collision " High educational background does n't equal high-level talent , " Chang Pei-chi says . Only a fter along time did he figure out that the high-level personnel cried out for by entrepreneurs are actually " outstanding higher-level technical personnel capable of leadership and rich in experience . " This is worlds apart from the garden variety nerd who has just earned his diploma but completely lacks practical experience .  
After having seen many such examples , NGO leaders are not unaware that criticizing is easier than doing the actual work . " The government is n't going to ask me to come serve in the public sector . If they did ask me , I 'm afraid it would n't be easy to do a good job , " admits one leader of an educational reform group . Once he switched roles from offense to defense , it would also be hard for him to escape " being vulnerable to attack . "  
In fact , outside the charmed circle of leading business families are large numbers of ethnic Chinese whose forebears came as laborers , and who still live at a low economic level with limited educational opportunities , just like the rest of the population . For many young women from this background , marriage is a means of escape from a life of poverty .  
The aim of educational reform is to put into practice a concept of education that imparts happiness , contentment , pluralism and mutual respect . Such education is designed to develop potentialities , respect individualism , promote humanism , and encourage creativity . All unreasonable restrictions will be removed to allow the emergence of a system of life-long learning . Ample room will be reserved for individual originality and personal traits to ensure the continued pursuit of self-growth and self-realization .  
Frankly speaking , the entire educational system in Taiwan is seriously lacking in understanding of aboriginal culture . Thus , not only Han Chinese , but even many indigenous people themselves , are mostly in the dark about their culture . This has meant that many pieces of aboriginal music already widely considered to be " treasures of world culture " ( please see accompanying article ) do not get the attention in Taiwan that they should .  
In the context of such an impressive and long-lasting buxiban culture , the Committee of Taipei Historical Records held a seminar in September of last year on " Examination-Oriented Supplementary Schools in Retrospect . " They invited a wide number of Taipei City 's senior pedagogues , such as the prestigious 1970s buxiban teachers Hsu Chen-liang and Chang Chin-wen , affirming the decades of educational work they contributed and expressing the hope that one day , when exemplary teachers are listed on Teachers ' Day , buxiban teachers will have a place too .  
At the end of September , work formally began on an investment by Acer Computer to build a multi - functional intelligent park in Taoyuan . Total investment is expected to be NT $ 200 billion . When completed , the park will have factories , residences , cultural and educational facilities , and more . It amounts to a privately funded version of the HSBIP , writing a new page for the " Invest in Taiwan " program .  
For the progress of their people , the educational workers of this mountainous area firmly man their posts , happy to lead simple , virtuous lives . Just like the orchid that attracts not the slightest attention , opening up little bright yellow blossoms under the cold wind and clamorous rain , they stand proud , refusing to bow their heads .  
As for the railway museum , five years ago the TRA set up a museum planning team to find suitable locations , " but all of the NT $ 5 million which we had budgeted was cut by the provincial assembly . They thought it was more appropriate for museums to be planned by cultural and educational departments , " says Chen Te-pei , spreading his hands in a gesture of frustration .  
In this sort of cultural tradition , even if many contemporary women and their husbands enjoy a substantial level of educational achievement and income , when these women return to their motherinlaw 's house , they still come down a notch , afraid of offending at every turn , making their inlaws unhappy and causing trouble for their husbands .  
But academics tended to the view that the activity was a shallow publicity stunt , and had no real significance in terms of sexual equality or educational reform . As for the general public , according to a newspaper opinion poll 55% assessed the camp positively , while 25% came out strongly against it . Perhaps the effectiveness of the training itself is secondary-just by attracting such wide attention and prompting such serious thought , it has already been well worthwhile ! ( Marlene Chen and Anna Wang / tr . by Robert Taylor )  
And how can we keep this concept-along with the familiar concept of IQ , and the newly-emerging one of children 's motor intelligence ( MQ ) - from being merely fashionable phrases which are mouthed parrot-fashion , and instead allow them to help us turn back from educational methods which have been twisted by an obsession with academic success , and give back to parents the opportunity to raise physically healthy and emotionally balanced children ?  
Taiwan 's mainstream educational structure is divided into the five categories of ethics , scholastic learning , physical education , social skills and the fine arts . Among these , the category of scholastic learning has always been given the greatest weight . Yet the recent craze for " EQ , " with its emphasis on self-discipline , interpersonal relationships , emotional expressiveness and a balance between the mind and body , could be described as encompassing things ethical , physical , social and artistic .  
Because the theory of EQ includes a balanced , multifaceted educational perspective that emphasizes both the mental and physical aspects of individuals ' emotions , it has not only become popular among the population at large , but has also garnered considerable interest in the academic community , being seen as compatible with the call to educational reform .  
One educational reformer has commented that , in this age of " free market education " where textbooks have become " intellectual commodities , " it is difficult to expect publishers not to concern themselves with business and other factors not related to education . But the bigger question is , are the rules of the new privatized education game fair ? Are they consistent ?  
Tzung-han is a gifted child with an IQ of 180 . The school he attended was unable to meet his educational needs and attending class was just boring for him . His teacher beat him everyday for forgetting to bring a handkerchief or toilet paper , or for losing things . He is a sensitive boy and the jealousy of his classmates hurt him .  
The screen shows the powerlessness and terror expressed in the gentle , youthful face of a girl in junior high experiencing corporal punishment . It serves as a silent accusation about the authoritarian educational environment and has stirred up quite a lot of sympathy , taking top prize for food commercials at the China Times Advertising Awards this year .  
Lee suggests that Lin will promote educational reform in a steady , careful manner . Although Lin Ching-jiang is under the heat of intense public scrutiny , he displays considerable self-confidence . He has declared that educational reform is not about swashbuckling heroism , but about long-term commitment . He intends to implement smaller class sizes by the year 2006 , and emphasizes that the Ministry of Education will place high priority on adult education .  
Those who " set out with great hopes only to return defeated " were left both angry and disappointed . As one person who works in the media noted , in metropolitan Taipei , " The leisure industry was pushing its leisure facilities down people 's throats all day long . Media packaging made for holiday crowds of historic dimensions on government-sponsored educational package tours and at private amusement parks , new department stores and even the Hollywood-transplanted Warner Village movie theater complex . "  
Although this is a new and ambitious research project and no one can tell if it will succeed or not , the chance to help numerous people improve their nutritional intake , physical condition and thus national educational levels and competitiveness , is well worth the effort .  
These various musuems large and small not only pioneer new aspects of culture and enrich existing ones , they are spread across the island and are flexibly run , closing the psychological distance between museums and the public at large . They are educational and recreational resources that have become part of people 's daily lives .  
People have long been aware of the educational and recreational functions of museums . But now the global trend is toward moving the focus of museums away from the elite to the general public , and relating them more closely to the lives of the people who live nearby . From elite to mass  
Vincent Siew particularly emphasizes that educational reform is a firm policy of the Executive Yuan . It has already approved the " Educational Reform Stimulus Package " drafted by the Ministry of Education . Starting from 1999 , more than NT $ 150 billion will be spent over a five-year period to advance 12 educational reform projects , including " promoting education for the entire citizenry " and " encouraging diversification and increased quality in vocational education . "  
Today , the goal is to keep children from being affected by the two extremes of repressed desire or ignorant promiscuity , and to help them establish correct sexual attitudes as early as possible . Thus the Ministry of Education has begun to promote sex education in schools under the name of " sex and gender equality education . " It has been discussed and seminars have been held continually at schools at all levels . Sexual education has gone from being a taboo subject on campuses to being one of the most prominent aspects of educational reform .  
Shih Ying does not deny that there were already a number of community organizations active in Wenshan District , and that it already had quite a strong cultural and educational ethos . Thus siting the first community college there " in fact was a soft option-but that does n't mean we are n't aware of the difficulties to be faced later . " He says that in the future it is hoped that community colleges will spread to communities throughout Taiwan , but this will depend on each community 's degree of readiness and preparedness .  
The Ministry of Education also has plans to establish " community colleges , " but their main goal is to give those students from the technical and vocational educational stream who are unable to squeeze in through the narrow doors of the conventional universities an extra opportunity to gain a university-level qualification ; the aims do not seem very different from those behind the establishment of the old night schools or today 's Open University .  
Many Takasago Volunteers who survived the cataclysm of the war returned to live under a " new dynasty , " the ROC , and found that their formerly Japanese-speaking world had suddenly become a Mandarin one . The language of the broadcast media had changed overnight , along with the dominant ideology . As time went by , their children and grandchildren grew up under the educational system of the nationalist government , completely different from the system during the Japanese era , and the ex-Volunteers became a lonely , lost group .  
Eighty to ninety percent of the new performers returning to Taiwan from studies abroad were trained in such classes . " Within the formal educational system , specially arranged art and music laboratory classes provide intensive training to develop artistic talents .  
This was largely based on the notion that so long as no physical injury results , a little pain-an " appropriate " level of punishment-is quite acceptable But the move was reversed after it came under fierce attack from commentators , the public and educational reform groups , who asserted that giving the green light to corporal punishment in this way would be a setback for educational reform .  
This led to the questions getting more and more difficult . It was the sole basis for determining educational advancement , but it was completely removed from the basic educational level . What we want to do is to expand the base . " As long as the schools put the emphasis on imparting basic knowledge , then they will be meeting the goal of the reforms .  
For example , one mother had very high educational ideals and understood how to stimulate her child 's potential . Their family did n't watch TV , and she often took her son to music concerts . After he graduated from junior high , her son applied and was admitted to Taipei 's top senior high school , Chienkuo , and then tested into prestigious National Taiwan University ( NTU ) .  
Take for example the class for outstanding students in math and science . Teachers have carefully created a systematic curriculum , designed diversified teaching activities , and produced supplementary educational materials and lectures not part of the standard textbooks . When necessary , they undertake deeper and broader learning activities . The goal is to develop students with the ability to think creatively and with a spirit of scientific research .  
In particular , there have been salient achievements in the pluralization of education . The joint college entrance exam system , which has dominated educational thinking for nearly half a century , is about to be abolished , and other topics such as women 's rights , children 's issues , workers ' rights and environmental protection have all come to the fore as campaign issues at one time or another .  
We will soon seek a consensus among the ruling and opposition parties , academia and the public so as to carry on with educational reforms and build a healthy , proactive , lively and innovative educational system , which will allow Taiwan to cultivate an uninterrupted stream of top-notch talents amid the fierce international competition .  
Of course we are well aware that statesmanship ca n't be learned just from a short series of classes , but we hope that by laying on these courses from our standpoint as a cultural and educational foundation , and not from a party political standpoint , we can make a start by using culture and education to purify people 's hearts . Because in fact a real political leader needs to speak from the heart and express his true hopes .  
Holding that meditation will , along with natural science and behavioral science , emerge as one of the three most important educational disciplines , WLEF has designed a Zen leadership program that emphasizes state of mind . Students are encouraged to probe their inner selves during moments of solitude and thereby cultivate self-discipline , increase their wisdom and potential , and improve their physical endurance and ability to handle pressure . They learn both how to get involved in the world and how to morally transcend it .  
While he dedicated his life 's work to economic and technological development , he did not forget the importance of raising educational standards , narrowing the gap between urban and rural citizens and controlling population growth , and these were not overlooked in the promotion of his new ideas .  
For instance , the course content offered by his college 's Graduate Institute of Technology and Innovation Management is only suitable for postgraduate work . " But due to the regulations imposed by the Ministry of Education , if you set up only a graduate school the educational resources available from the government do not compare with those for a combined undergraduate department and graduate school . " Wu says that this results in institutions having to make a choice between " actual need " and " winning more resources . "  
" If Taiwan could elect a president like former British prime minister John Major , whose highest educational attainment was graduation from primary school , perhaps only then will the perverse custom of everyone trying to advance to a higher level of education gradually disappear , " says Chou . With a shake of her head and a sigh , Chou says that the deconstruction of social values will require a great deal of time .  
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) , with over 170 member states , places wild animals into one of four categories depending upon the size of their surviving populations and how endangered the species may be . Various controls and limitations on import , export , and trade are then imposed for the various categories . Protected animals may only be imported under certain conditions , such as for educational purposes or medical treatment , but not for profit .  
The eighth clause of the Basic Education Law , which was passed in June of the same year , puts it even more clearly : " During the period of compulsory education , parents are responsible for guiding and assisting their children . Moreover , parents have the legal right to select educational method and content on behalf of their children and to decide whether they enroll in a school . "  
Ku enthusiastically consults with people from all areas , and has done his utmost to assist domestic research in fields related to welding . Ku also contributes by " resuscitating " expensive machinery damaged by human errors or natural disasters , thus helping industry and educational institutions reduce the massive financial losses that can result from such events . While his work has guaranteed that machinery works , he has helped even more people by passing the torch of his knowledge on to his students .  
As a result of educational reform , children today are no longer ranked in strict order of their test marks . Instead , their attainment is reflected by broader grades-A , B , C and so on . Also , the principle of more equal emphasis on five major aspects of education is gradually being implemented . Today intellectual education accounts for only 60% of overall grades , while physical education accounts for 20% , and moral and social education each account for 10% .  
Chang Tien-fu says : " Schools chose to focus on transforming themselves and in the process forgot their own position and character . " Although many schools did change their name , their relative position in the educational hierarchy was not improved . On the contrary , having reorganized themselves many technical and vocational schools began to turn their back on earlier achievements . In other words , they stopped focusing on the need for practical work and started to emphasize theory and R &amp; D .  
In addition to technical and vocational students continuing on in education in large numbers and thus leading to the withering away of the " inherently " inferior " second track , " the lack of official expenditures in this area have amounted to " kicking a man when he is down , " and the gap between the two national educational " tracks " has widened significantly .  
Logically , after students are streamed into the vocational educational system , the future path to higher education should not be determined on the basis of general subjects . " But whether they want to become nurses or civil engineering technicians , and whether they are applying to a technical college or a technical university , in the exams they are tested in Chinese , English and math , " says Tien . " There is no emphasis on professional abilities at all . "  
The bill also stipulates that residents of autonomous areas will enjoy equal rights in participating in political , economic , social , educational and cultural affairs , and are entitled to equal treatment .  
However , " although Chiang Wei-shui and others were found guilty in the Social Order and Police Incident , " writes Huang Huang-hsiung in his Chiang biography , " they indirectly benefited from this , because it became a focal point for the political and social movement . " The overreaction and repression by the colonial authorities against these activists-whose petition campaign was moderate and perfectly legal , and whose cultural association restricted itself to educational activities-not only fueled popular resentment , but also hardened the attitudes of activists toward the regime .  
Whereas their predecessors ' values were shaped most by great economic opportunity and the experience of collective action for political and social change , many different elements have affected the values of these generations . Besides larger structural factors , educational reform has also been important . The reforms introduced by the government in the late 1990s increased the number of universities and graduate programs significantly , so that many more young people have access to higher education than did their predecessors .  
Classical studies in kindergartens has become more fashionable , but in the mainland the educational environment is fiercely competitive . Even getting into a good elementary school entails being tested and paying bribes under the table , so the pressure to advance is felt right down to the toddlers graduating from these kindergartens , and it can impinge seriously on their classical studies time .  
Wu says that the causes of low creativity and the cultural context are being fixed , but no systematic changes have been made as yet . One encouraging point is that the MOE has included creativity as a core educational ability . Industry , government , and the educational sector , however , have yet to come together . If all of them can move forward together and embrace one another , the circle will get larger and larger .  
Because of this , creative education has been established as a four-year pilot project with an annual budget of NT $ 60 million . In spirit , it will encourage diversification , differentiation , and maybe even a little rebellion and mischief . In practical terms , whether in innovation in educational methods , reform in educational materials , innovation in student performance or in reforming and restructuring campus spaces , any good ideas will receive support . And because this effort is a local , piecemeal , gradual bottom-up process , it will not encounter much opposition .  
As well as holding seminars and other such activities , the Educational Issues group also seeks to ' correct twisted educational values , ' " hoping to bring together the voices of concerned parents . After having held a public forum on this and come up with no obvious answers , they moved on to try tapping parent-teacher associations and study groups in an effort to establish a network and stake out a position in the community . Calling in the experts  
In the era of the knowledge-based economy , ideas are the ultimate source of profits . However , Hsu has observed that Taiwanese children growing up under the rigid educational system have lost out on many opportunities for hands-on learning and learning by doing , making it very difficult to spark creative ideas .

Among the main laws are the law on educational reform within the framework of sustainable human development which covers social , economic , political and cultural aspects intended to promote peoples growth as individuals and members of society .  
The ageing of populations and the increase in the number of elderly throughout the world which are the results of medical , hygienic , scientific and educational achievements are phenomena of the late twentieth century .  
While UNESCO will be responsible for the conceptual aspects and educational content , ITU , which is developing the standards , will take primary responsibility for the technical implementation and choice of technological solutions .  
Furthermore , the teaching of human rights and international humanitarian law , adapted to each educational level , has not been incorporated into the curriculum as a compulsory subject .  
This requires sustained educational and proactive initiatives in those various sectors at the community level which are geared towards promoting harmonious social relations between different ethnic groups .  
The report also ignores the cumulative impact of the sanctions on all the economic , social , cultural , educational and even psychological aspects of life for the Iraqi people and their projected impact on future generations even if they were to be lifted now .

Since 1993 , however , secondary-level institutions have been undergoing extensive restructuring through the Reform of Secondary Education ( ROSE ) project which is aimed at improving the quality and equity of educational provisions at the secondary level through the establishment of a common national curriculum for grades 7 to 9 .  
The main priorities for the Ministry of Education beginning in 1999 were : closing the gaps by raising peripheral municipalities and weak population groups ; affirmative action for the Arab educational system ; elevating special education ; increasing the number of students with matriculation entitlement .  
These include the allocation of revenues from taxes collected in Kosovo to minority communities through the community committees at the municipal level ; the implementation of employment-generating projects in these communities ; improved public services and utilities ; the integration of the 24 local community offices as part of the local administration structure to ensure equal access to public services ; and provision of more educational and health facilities as well as social welfare benefits .  
Article 55 of the Charter explicitly recognizes that solutions to international economic , social , health and related problems , international , cultural and educational cooperation and universal respect for human rights are all essential for the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations .  
Affirming that beyond the key role played by communities , strong partnerships among Governments , the United Nations system , intergovernmental organizations , people living with HIV / AIDS and vulnerable groups , medical , scientific and educational institutions , non-governmental organizations , the business sector including generic and research-based pharmaceutical companies , trade unions , media , parliamentarians , foundations , community organizations , faith-based organizations and traditional leaders are important ;

Considering , however , that the " market " is more than 200 countries worldwide , it would seem fair to seek an explanation among three other factors as well : Trainmar no longer coincides with countries ' needs in the way it originally did ; Trainmar is not necessarily the best option for training in maritime operations and management , compared to the increasing number of other educational and training facilities ; awareness of Trainmar is lacking , e.g . due to lack of information or positive impact from results in existing centres .  
The qualifications would specifically need to embrace : general management ( setting targets and milestones , planning strategic measures by which to achieve targets , estimating costs and design budgets , finance , implementation and control ) ; pedagogics ( theoretical formation as well as skills in the design and delivery of courses , adequate knowledge of educational and training policies and regimes ) ; substantive experience and knowledge ( trade and commerce , business and global logistics , technologies , operation , organization , economics and commercial processes of maritime transport ) .  
The institutional location of Trainmar centres is not generally relevant for an integrated approach to maritime transport and commerce , or to overall national interest : there is evidence that in some cases national authorities have not been given the opportunity of considering the most opportune institutional location of the Trainmar centres as among available educational and training institutions ; there is a heavy focus on locating Trainmar centres in ports or training facilities attached to ports .
