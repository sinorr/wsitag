( Agence France-Presse , Tokyo , 26th ) - National Tax Agency of Japan said the prolonged economic recession in Japan has already hit employees in the private sector throughout Japan . The average annual wages of private company employees has decreased for the fourth consecutive year .  
President Paqieco pointed out in his speech after signing the bill that the " National Competitiveness commission " was formed by people in charge of economic , foreign trade , agriculture , tourism , transportation and other public or private sectors .

"  
In June 1995 , Li Teng-hui paid a visit to the United States in a so-called " private " capacity .  The Chinese Government launched a decisive anti-splittism and anti - " Taiwan independence " struggle and lodged a strong protest against the action of the US Government openly allowing Li Teng-hui to visit the United States , which violated the pledges made by the United States in the three Sino-US joint communiques and serious damaged China 's sovereignty , and solemnly and justly took up the matter with the US side .  
It is also worth mentioning that the private companies under Chen ostensibly included some joint ventures with Hong Kong businesses , some joint ventures with banks , and also some joint ventures with the Yuhu Prefectural Government . As such , public ownership were intermixed with private ownership to give people many false impressions and make it difficult for people to discern their nature off-hand .  This was to make it easy for them to profit from confusion and to slip away unpunished in the event of an exposure of their offenses .  
A group of leading cadres in Liaoning Province who violated policies by occupying too many houses , illegally taking funds for housing purchases , illegally turning public houses into private ones , and using public funds to renovate houses beyond the standard were investigated and handled sternly .  Party and government disciplinary measures were taken against 62 cadres at or above the county department level in the province , and eight people were transferred to judicial organs to be investigated and affixed criminal responsibilities .  
It is necessary to maintain a good image of strictly disciplining ourselves and practicing clean and honest government , take a correct view of the powers in our hands , take the lead in observing discipline and law , persist in honest administration , and wage resolute struggle against negative phenomena of corruption such as abuse of power , harming the public for private profit , using public office for private gain , and extravagance and waste .  
He regarded the powers granted him by the party and people as a means for pursuing individual private interests , engaged in bribery and corruption in a big way , and wildly extorted money , reaching a stage where he was blinded with lust for gain and was audacious in the extreme .  
We should continue to improve the ownership structure where the public ownership plays a dominant role and various economic elements develop simultaneously and to develop nongovernmental scientific and technological enterprises , three types of joint ventures , and private and individual economic sectors , so as to make the economy of the capital full of vigor and vitality .  
Deputy Doje Cering , commissioner of the Ngari Prefectural Administrative Office in Tibet , said : Thanks to its national unity and social stability , Ngari Prefecture has attracted more and more people from the interior of the country to do business or set up enterprises in the prefecture .  The prefecture 's annual tax revenue from the individual and private economic sectors increased from less than 100,000 yuan in 1997 to more than 1-million yuan in 1999 .  
Tanzania , Rwanda , and some other African countries have recently expressed one after another that they would never allow the religious groups that " affect social stability or engage in reactionary deeds " to launch activities within their territories , and they would take resolute actions against the cults that " seek private gains , publicize heretical beliefs , and collect money and property to get rich " in order to " prevent the recurrence of the Uganda Tragedy . "  
Hu Changqing lived a life of utter decadence and corruption and was not afraid to reveal his insatiable avaricious nature .  From that standpoint , to say that Hu Changqing hanged out with the rich and used his power to seek private gain was to put it politely .  In fact he was a complete political hooligan . "  
Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , we have been implementing an economic system that takes public ownership as the mainstay and encourages common development of multiple economic sectors .  We have broken down the unitary system of ownership by the whole people under the traditional planned economic system .  This has given rise to an economic situation characterized by the common development of different economic sectors amid competition , including state-owned economy , collective economy , individual economy , private economy and foreign businessmen 's economy .  
Sometimes maybe only units of a certain armed service are needed , but usually combined forces including active units and reserve forces are needed " .  " In the meantime , the skills and resources provided by multinational forces , regional organizations , international bodies , non-government organizations , voluntary organizations , and private organizations should be adequately made use of , if possible " , to ensure that the US army 's " non-war military operation " will achieve the intended objective .  
As for inventing pretexts , complying in appearance but opposing in heart , refusing to comply with regulations , continuing to take in and spend - - all must be dealt with as soon as discovered .  Likewise for withholding , appropriating and siphoning off funds for private use .  Privately saving public monies , setting up " small exchequers " , and other such perverse and illegal activities will also be severely dealt with .  
What the hostile western forces want to preserve is the capitalist private ownership system and the political and economic systems , values , and way of life that the bourgeoisie highly esteem , and all this runs counter to the essence of the socialist system under communist party leadership .  
The share of direct government investments among the total amount of investments society-wide will be reduced , while the share of independent , non-government investments , including individual , private , and foreign capital , will go up .  
All this does not tally with the guideline set by the 15th National CPC Congress . To give private enterprises equal treatment is not an expedient measure under the condition of underdeveloped productive forces .  It is a long-term policy for at least 100 years required by our basic system during the initial stage of socialism .  
Therefore , a large portion of the US ' scientific research capability is focused in private departments , university / technical schools , and scientific research centers relying on Department of Defense funds .  They have strong executive mechanisms which organize and maintain a tight relationship between the " procurer " and research center .  
the import of technological equipment for private use by domestic-investment and foreign-investment industrial projects encouraged by the state , as well as superior industrial projects within their total amount of investments in the western region , will be exempted from paying tariffs and the import value-added tax , with an exception for commodities that are not allowed to enjoy tax exemption as stipulated by the state .  
2 ) as nonpublic enterprises are numerous in number and distributed in extensive areas , the management and supervision of their safety are ineffective .  Moreover , there really existed the tendencies that a small number of government workers in charge of supervision and management of production safety neglected their duties and that some corrupt elements even collaborated with lawbreakers so that some owners of individual and private businesses in violation of laws and regulations became emboldened in the knowledge that they had strong backing ;  
Lai Changxing at that time relied on the network of connections he had woven over many years in key Party , government and military organs by wearing the hat of a private entrepreneur who was famous all over the country , a member of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference of Fujian Province and an honorary citizen of Xiamen City , among other political glories .  
There is a need to lift the planned economy-flavored " accession " limit , open up various investment channels at home , let abundant private capitals inject blood into the long anemic car industry , and change the government 's monopolistic management marked by its interfering in everything and switch into a system enabling the sector to exercise self-discipline .  
In the last 10 years , China 's private enterprises ' average registered capital has increased from 93,000 yuan to 681,000 yuan , increasing by more than 6 folds , but each enterprise 's employment has been reduced from 18.1 persons to 13.4 persons , cutting back by as much as one-quarter .  
This means each 100,000 yuan increase in capital only increased employment by 1 person .  This equipment level is comparable to the Chinese industries ' current average equipment level , and the trend is for the level to rise year after year .  The private economy 's labor-intensive characteristic is fast eroding .  
In sharp contrast to the slump in fixed asset investments is the continued and abnormal rise in registered capital and output value of the civilian-run economy , represented by the private economic sector .  
During the " Ninth Five-year Plan " period , the annual rate of increase in the private economic sector 's registered capital hovered between 36.3 percent and 43.1 percent ; the annual rate of increase in total output value ranged between 21.6 percent to 49.2 percent .  Both displayed a pattern of rapid and steady growth , and behind the rapid increase in capital seemed to be a strong investment momentum .  
As a result , the DPP government under Chen Shui-bian has the " multi-party coalition government " , and if there are contradictions among the various party factions on the one China or " Taiwan is a sovereign , independent nation " , no choice can be made , and no unified consensus can be formed .  So the enlightened coalition government trick will in the final analysis be only a struggle of private interests .  
NSC Consultative Committee Member Ko Chen-heng has seriously considered this issue .  He thinks that the system under which the military 's command authority belongs to the minister of national defense in peacetime and to the chief of the general staff during wartime is dangerous and is faulty in design .  Ko Chen-heng told his friends in private that the only military suggestion that he , as a Consultative Committee member , has given President Chen is : " The command authority in the military command system must be an integral whole and should not be divided " .  
In a recent speech at a forum in Zhejiang , entitled " New and High Technology , and Risk Investment , " the renowned economist Wu Jinglian said : With the evaporation of bubbles of the Nasdaq , which represents US high-tech shares , there has been an upsurge of Chinese students returning home from their high and new technology jobs in the United States . As Zhejiang has the features of rich private capital and flexible enterprise mechanisms , the wave of returned Chinese students from abroad will bring new opportunities to Zhejiang 's economic development .  
To fulfill the tasks in the transitional period and realize the change into socialism , the key lay in the proper accomplishment of the socialist transformation .  That was an ownership revolution of guiding individual and private economies into socialism .  
Through a special form of redemption , that is , the paying of fixed interest to original owners of the private businesses , the most complicated task in our country 's socialist transformation was smoothly and stably accomplished .  
Communist China will extensively revise its party constitution at the 16th CPC National Congress to be held next year .  Besides the inclusion of Jiang Zemin 's " three represents , " the revised party constitution will include content on expanding the representation of party membership .  People of various social strata will be allowed to join the party , including proprietors of private enterprises , individual business operators , and those who are not " proletariat " so long as they are " ideologically and politically " qualified with correct " behavior . "  
A large number of private enterprise owners and individual business operators have emerged .  Besides , there are also people at managerial level of foreign funded enterprises and independent workers .  Therefore , China 's society can no longer be divided simply based on people 's class content .  
Qiu Xiaohua was of the view that this year the theme of China 's economy is steady growth .  He predicted that steady growth in China 's domestic demand will be maintained in the near future and growths in both government and private investment will see a good development trend .  He added that , because of the government 's policy of encouraging utilization of foreign capital , it is expected that growth in foreign capital utilization also will be quite satisfactory .

Representatives of the masses presented hada , carved agate , and highland barley wine to the members of the delegation , and expressed their warm welcome and heartfelt best wishes to their honored guests who had traveled from afar .  
Since coming to power , the Bush administration has stressed seeking " absolute security " for the US and attached importance to the " potential challenges " posed by regional powers .  Communist Chinese Foreign Ministry officials have on many occasions expressed concern in private about the Bush administration 's moves .  They are worried that this tough " Bushism " which is taking shape on the international scene would cast a shadow on the development of Sino-US relations .  
However , on the whole , the slowdown in global economic growth will not have a serious impact on China 's economy : Firstly , China has a huge domestic market ; public investment and private consumption take up most of the total supply and demand ; and economic growth in real terms is based on domestic demand .  
To meet the needs of China 's imminent entry into the World Trade Organization [ WTO ] , authorities in charge of industry and commerce administration are stepping up the reform of the enterprise registration system , said Wang Zhongfu , director of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce , at the ongoing national forum of industry and commerce bureau directors in Beijing . He said that work is under way to gradually standardize the registration procedure for foreign and domestic enterprises , including private businesses , and to form a unified system for market access .  
He said : Those indifferent to the party 's cause , who comply with the party 's principle and policy in public but oppose them in private , or who form cliques and factions , hold mountain-stronghold mentality , or practice localism for a long time , if they refuse to correct their mistakes after being criticized , should be removed , transferred , or changed , if it is justified .  Those involved in serious cases should be brought to justice .

Major changes have already taken place , and are currently taking place , in China 's economic system and in its composition of social classes .  In rural areas , along with the deepening of economic restructuring and the progress of agricultural industrialization , peasants have been organically integrated with the market ; and some of peasants have been separated from land and have engaged themselves in the secondary and tertiary industries , among whom some have joined township and town enterprises , some have become self-employed businessmen , while others have become entrepreneurs of private enterprises .  
An informed source disclosed that , worried about their future , some ICAC personnel kept close to members of the Ministry of State Security in the period leading to 1997 , hoping to maintain their posts after Hong Kong 's reversion .  But the ICAC stayed unconnected with the Ministry of State Security after Hong Kong 's reversion , strictly banning private contacts between its subordinates and sensitive people .

These have produced obvious results .  
By the end of 1997 , there were 7,617 environmental protection enterprises in China , with the total fixed assets amounting to 62.09 billion yuan .  They have formed a pattern under which the state-owned enterprises are developing alongside the township collective enterprises and private enterprises .  
This means that , in national security and fields needed for national economic development where private investment can not or is unwilling to access , the state-owned economy needs to advance , creating the essential terms for national security and national economic development , to give the state the relevant regulation and control capacity over economic development .

This grand occasion attracted the intense focus of the Chinese and foreign media - - more than a major sporting event would .  The official press proudly announced : " In this new millennium , Chinese private enterprises are finally seeing the light of day . "  
In the past 50 years , Chinese private enterprise went though all kinds of ups and downs as the state political situation changed .  After reform and opening up began , the policies of " helping the state and restricting the private " made it hard for private enterprises for a while .  Private enterprises were described as an economic community growing up in " gray shadows . "  For a long time , it was not finding much of a place in mainstream awareness .  Now , however , the private economy has begun to take off .  
In fact , whether in traditional industries such as clothing , food , metals , furniture , construction , or in the industries that incorporate modern technology , like home appliances , automobiles , pharmaceuticals , communications , or network , " almost every industry that the government has opened up has the lively presence of private enterprises , and these enterprises have grown up through fierce competition .

" The decision on the pay offer has been made after careful consideration of all relevant factors under the existing civil service pay adjustment mechanism , including the net pay trend indicators derived from an independent private sector pay trend survey , the state of the economy , budgetary considerations , changes in the cost of living , the staff sides ' pay claims and civil service morale , " Mr . Wong said .  
" In the light of the prevailing economic situation , our serious budgetary position and the pay adjustment trends in the private sector , we consider that the pay offer of a negative pay adjustment in line with the net pay trend indicators is reasonable and has struck a balance between the concerns of civil servants and the interests of the community at large , " he added .  
Having carefully considered the request of the Staff Side of SCSC , the Chief Executive is of the opinion that it is a matter of settled public policy that in determining the size of each year 's civil service pay adjustment , the Government takes into account the following factors : the net pay trend indicators derived from an independent private sector pay trend survey , the state of the economy , budgetary considerations , changes in the cost of living , the staff sides ' pay claims and civil service morale .

The 1987 Taiwan economic construction plan approved by the Executive Yuan , which foresees the attainment of an eight percent growth rate , includes many policies and measures , among which particularly to be stressed is that , besides maintaining an appropriate increase in exports , domestic demand must also be expanded , including raising the private willingness to invest and expanding public investment , thereby making domestic demand and export trade the two main forces for economic growth .  
Unless we further accelerate the training of technical personnel , it will be difficult for us to join the ranks of the industrialized nations . 4 ) Sluggish renovation of technology by private enterprise . The most fundamental reason why the nation 's industrial structure is weak and its speed of adjustment is slow is that the level of creativity in products and production processes is inadequate and technological renovation by private enterprise is sluggish .  
The Ministry of Education has made the following revisions : Now , students who have graduated from a public or private high school , or any higher level of education , or passed the Higher Civil Service Examination or Junior-Grade Civil Service Examination and has completed his military duty , or those who are exempt from military duty , may apply to study abroad .  
Because this meeting is to be held in Peking , the government had to carefully weigh the valued ties to the organization and the possible reactions of the public and academic community against the policy of no official contacts with Peking . Lien explains that " official contacts " are not thinkable , but that it was easier to allow the delegates to attend in a private capacity . However , " it is hard to say " if this is a precedent .  
In Kuo 's extended family , the more than forty children belonging to her generation , starting at age three , were instructed by an elderly teacher in the family 's private schoolroom , where they studied the Three Character Classic , the Thousand Character Classic , the Four Books , and the Five Classics , practiced calligraphy , and learned how to compose in literary Chinese , before going on to junior high school at age fourteen .  
Tariffs have been cut on 3,500 categories of items , lowering the average effective tariff rate from 7.8 to approximately 5 percent , comparable to the rates in industrialized countries . Moreover , the New Taiwan dollar has been allowed to appreciate by more than 40 percent against the U . S . dollar since 1985 ; and private individuals can now buy as much as US $ 5 million for outward remittances .  
The government hopes that overseas experts and consultants can work together with domestic construction firms and academic institutions from the viewpoints of urban planning , financing , and urban management in exploring the comprehensive utilization of space in the area and in determining urban design control , development methods for public and private lands , development organizations , implementation schedules , and the like in order to promote the comprehensive development of the entire area .  
In recent years it has become the custom to erect museums , galleries , and exhibition halls through private subsidy and ownership as opposed to setting up state-run facilities . Bands , dance troupes , orchestras , and puppet shows will continue to spring up and flourish at an astonishing pace . A prominent feature of our program for the future is the construction of libraries and audio-visual centers for every township and every rural district or village .  
In view of the greater access to improved modes of travel , the Tourism Bureau intends to transform the Yueh-mei Farm in Taichung County into an amusement complex with varied functions . The complex is designed to reflect traditional Chinese culture and yet present the natural sciences and modern science and technology . The Bureau will also promote private investment in tourist hotels and recreational facilities in the area .  
Another US $ 7 billion or more comes under the " capital account , " which includes part of the hot money that was drawn into the country over the past two or three years by the appreciation of the NT dollar and is now flowing out again . Then there 's immigration and overseas investment by the private sector plus government loans and aid to foreign countries , such as that provided by the International Economic Cooperation Development Fund .  
Currently , the government has already ordered that the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion be terminated . In the foreseeable future , cases involving the two sides will develop in the direction of " private international law . " That is , Taiwan and the mainland will be treated as two separate " legal jurisdictions " and the concepts for dealing with " conflicts of law between two jurisdictions " will be employed .  
Trade and business contacts , academic scholarly exchange , events sponsored by private groups , and overseas tourism by ordinary citizens are all channels for showing people overseas the good side of our people and for demonstrating the united effort being made inside and outside government . This is how a good international image is built up .  
But a couple of years ago such was private sector demand for experienced and well qualified personnel in the securities , banking and broadcasting industries that suitable civil servants became avidly sought after , while relatively low pay and an inflexible advancement system also contributed to the civil service brain drain .  
The problem is that our civil servants have not yet comprehended this shift , and are still stuck in the thinking and methods of the 1950 ' s . They just think about playing the leading role and telling others what they should do and ca n't do , which product to develop - - these are not official topics , so there are always conflicts with private entrepreneurs . In fact in many things the people are more capable than officials .  
But the distribution of health resources is still not equal . Major urban areas have continually built public and private large scale hospitals , not only saturating the area , but also creating vicious competition . Whereas local and base levels have been ignored . This is something the government has to accept responsibility for .  
Despite Taiwan 's small size , its tropical and sub-tropical climate and unique geography mean that it has a rich flora , many original varieties of which retain excellent characteristics . We need the government to set up a seed source bank to preserve these , while at the same time encouraging private enterprise to develop new improved varieties .  
" Opposition from the minority engaged in fisheries was understandable , " says Lin Chong-min , engineer with the firm of consultants , " but otherwise the project involved no appropriation of private holdings and no removal of people 's homes . Also there would be no pollution from the project after its completion , and in the future it could even bring a boom to the area . Yet most respondents neither supported nor were opposed to the plan . "  
The Department of Education has already planned to spend 20 percent of its budget on improving the government primary and junior schools in Taiwan Province . Apart from this we want to aid private schools to raise the average educational level .  
" External trade had shown a large surplus for several years running , and there was a great deal of idle capital in private hands ; moreover the NT dollar was appreciating , and speculative foreign money poured in , add to this that the policy of ' returning price increases to the general public ' had not been effectively implemented over the long run , and land became a highly profitable investment , " says Hsieh Chao-yi , an associate professor in the graduate program in urban planning at Chung-hsing University .  
As for the R . O . C . , which has deep ties with both Berkeley and Dr . Tien - - he graduated from Kien Kuo senior high school and National Taiwan University before going to the U . S . and Berkeley boasts more members of Academia Sinica than any other university overseas - - the Ministry of Education , the Legislative Yuan and the private sector have donated US $ 3 million since his appointment was announced in support of its research on East Asia and other broad academic areas . "  
Since we have come to understand more about the Japanese , We have discovered that generally they are embarrassed about beliefs that might sound unscientific . On the other hand , they are quite open and brash about things that Americans consider to be private , such as personal finance and sexual experience - - especially the men .  
Vuu Khai Thanh , initiator of what was then the Binhtien Imex Cooperative Society , relied on hard work and struggle , and the advantages of distributing low-priced goods with insignificant labor costs to Southeast Asia . In 1989 , he received the first license to be issued by the government permitting a private enterprise to engage in direct foreign trade . It was only this that landed him the opportunity to leave the country for an observation tour and go to Taiwan to find technological and management partners , thus speeding up the expansion of the business .  
In this situation the government decided to set up a special project , enlisting the ITRI 's Mechanical Industry Research Laboratories to bring in American technology for combined research and development . When the development was finished , hands were joined again with the private sector to establish a compressor factory , with joint production and distribution free of Japanese control .  
When asked what qualities they expected in members of the anti-corruption movement , as many as 40% replied that it was enough for them to act fairly and cleanly in office ; their origins and background , posts held with commercial enterprises and their morality in their private lives were all secondary considerations . Thus it seems that the requirements the public in Taiwan places on its politicians are fairly reasonable and equitable .  
As society has become democratic and diverse , corruption , which previously few people learned about , is now being spotlighted by the media and legislators . The bidding for the huge contracts of the major construction projects that have followed in the wake of Taiwan 's affluence are said to be fertile ground for illegal linkages of private money and government power . With corruption frequently in the news , popular sentiment has boiled over and the Ministry of Justice is drawing up an anti-corruption plan called " Taking the Knife to Corruption . "  
Actually , public and private schools have a deep connection . A few of the schools were established by retired members of the military dog training center . Also , when the police canine division was first formed , they trained both the people and the dogs by relying on the long experience of private dog schools .  
Planning an Itinerary : Most major travel destinations are south of Shihtiping . For this reason , it is best to lay an emphasis on visiting the central and southern portions of the east coast , whether traveling by private vehicle or by public transport . Be sure to plan for a journey of at least three days and two nights .  
Kinmen kaoliang , king of liquorsWhen it comes to the subject of what gifts to take back home , one is sure to think of Kinmen kaoliang . Since Kinmen 's state-owned distillery was obliged to stop selling its products directly to the public to avoid engaging in unfair competition with private enterprise , Kinmen 's pure , silky-smooth aged sorghum spirit has been in short supply , causing its price to rocket . In recent times especially , it has been hard to get hold of at any price .  
There has never been a case of a country which establishes a public school in a geographic location belonging to a foreign power . And furthermore Taiwan does not have official diplomatic relations with Indonesia . Chaoalso notes that the overseas schools of America and Japan , although partly subsidized by their respective governments , remain nevertheless private schools . "  
Looking in turn at the three major forms of enterprises in the mainland today , state-run enterprises still labor under a heavy burden of weak incentives created by the " iron rice bowl " ; private enterprises are still in their infancy ; and township collective enterprises , which stand between these first two types in terms of scale , are mainly rural , and still lack the capital , information , and trained personnel to pose a direct challenge to Taiwan firms .  
Land is state property , and most people live in homes owned by their work units , so that these can not serve as collateral for " start-up capital . " Another reason why private enterprise is having a hard time burgeoning is because " government policy is tilted in favor of foreign and Taiwan investors . " It is still up in the air whether or not the mainland can duplicate Taiwan 's development experience .  
Right now the mainland economy is heated up , and the financial market has the jitters . Of course private companies ca n't compete with state-owned enterprises which have access to deep and extensive human relations networks , " Yang Donghong observes . If a state-owned establishment defaults on a loan , the loan officer holds little responsibility . But if a private business goes insolvent , the officer who sponsored the loan will almost certainly be unable to escape blame .  
He offers the analogy that inviting foreign investment is like " borrowing a hen to lay eggs . " The country is still responsible for providing the twigs and making the nest . Yet local private enterprises , which , like quails , are small in stature but large in number , have not been given the attention they deserve . They have even been viewed as opportunistic and money hungry .  
In the coastal regions of every Asian country along the western Pacific ocean live large numbers of marine turtles , but many of the islands where they are distributed lack reliable monitoring and protection . Sea turtles have even gotten innocently embroiled in local wars or been negatively affected by the capers of private individuals . For this reason international conservation groups intend to devote the year 1995 to the West Pacific Marine turtle , hoping to encourage research and protection of marine turtles in this region .  
While overseas he saw many Chinese people in a state of ignorance and superstition , with a low level of cultural cultivation . In his hometown he saw old private schools in a state of decay , and the new Western-style schools corrupt . Many children in the village already over the age of ten were still naked and played in the streets : " It almost returned to a prehistoric state of barbarity .  
What 's more , in 1993 a private financial consortium built the nearby Shin Kong Life Tower , a 53-story skyscraper that has already become a new symbol of the city . And the new 12-story KMT party headquarters is to be located by the East Gate directly across from the Presidential Palace . The Po Ai District is gradually being enclosed amid a concrete jungle of modern skyscrapers .  
In terms of railroads , though the controversial budget for the high-speed train did not pass the Legislative Yuan last year , the " Regulations for Encouraging Participation " in railroad privatization did . There is a proposal to create a special high-speed railroad budget of over NT $ 120 billion to be spent over the next four to five fiscal years ( though original costs are expected to be moderated somewhat by the participation of private capital in the program ) .  
The government should long ago have lifted the ban on private groups producing their own textbooks in order to get rid of the bad reputation for brainwashing students , " says Chou Chuan , who fought to have the ban on competition with the unified textbook system lifted . Few countries in the world except communist or backward nations use unified textbooks adopted at the national level . Even Communist China currently uses a system in which the central and local governments produce different textbooks .  
The DOH did not begin to encourage the private sector to establish hospitals for chronic illnesses until 1991 . Up to the end of 1993 , there were only 20,000 beds reserved for chronic disease patients nationwide , half of which were for psychiatric patients . Only 4,450 hospital beds are set aside for the more than 60 kinds of ordinary chronic illnesses . Moreover , most of those beds belong to the veterans ' hospitals , to which the general public has no access . "  
There are no strict requirements for the registration of the dog population , so the rate of stray dogs being picked up by owners is low . City and County animal shelters are also extremely lacking . Even private organizations are overwhelmed . For instance , the Stray Animal Home , which can shelter 300 animals , was packed to overflowing less than three months after it opened .  
Whether they be from the financial sector or political parties , or are veteran broadcasters or members of the arts starting up their own private operations , the vast majority are interested in stations broadcasting to urban areas with a relatively wide range of listeners and high impact .  
But during the exhibition the year before last of works by Monet , 300,000 people pressed into the gallery . This year 's special exhibition of jade from private collections will also be housed there ; meanwhile the Contemporary Art Gallery 's own special exhibition " Creating from Tradition : a Taste of Our Modern Art " is being held in the newly-completed Documents and Library Building , and includes the works of 1O modern craft workers . Among them are pictorial ceramic panels by Sun Chao and wood and gold carvings by Wu Ching . "  
Because of administrative financial difficulties , their environmental conservation budget is limited . Many wildlife conservation activities are even limited to private lands . This has led to a reaction , in which many voices have arisen claiming that more human energy and material should be focused on protecting entire ecosystems and habitats .  
Even if there are numerous homes and senior citizen centers that have been set up by government agencies and private organizations which can solve the problems of part of the elderly population , many of these places do not accept people who are indigent , too sick or aged , entirely unable to care for themselves , or who have been abandoned by their families . Most of the elderly at home alone are n't served by the homes and senior citizen centers .  
A well-designed domed facility should be highly flexible , with adjustable activity size , space , lighting , and sound . Also , to attract spectators , it must provide " full service , " including private boxes , food and beverage services , concessions to sell memorabilia , and so on . And to meet the needs of the press at major events , there must be TV broadcast facilities , a press box , darkroom , and phone and fax equipment .  
Kwan Wen-yen looks at it from the point of view of economic growth . Looking at the current standards of mass sporting events , he says that management of medium-sized 8,000-seat facilities is still inadequate . If the domed stadium is built , it would be OK if it were turned over to the private sector , but if it were managed by the government , based on the current structure , it would be difficult to do the job well .  
Thus , the expectant mother is put in a strange , frigid and sterile environment , lies supine on the operating table with both legs stretched out , has her private portions examined , receives an enema , and has her pubic hair shaved . This kind of clinical birthing experience often makes women feel embarrassed , pained or uneasy , and they naturally wish to avoid it at all costs .  
Now close your eyes and imagine yourself looking out over the foggy ocean . In less than three years , that stretch of land now occupied by dismal-looking aquaculture ponds will be transformed into Mailiao International Port . This will be the first-ever port in Taiwan built with private funding , as well as Taiwan 's deepest harbor . The handling capacity after only the first phase of construction will be a full half of today 's giant Kaohsiung Harbor ( one of the busiest in the world ) .  
After intensive discussion , the three parties finally agreed that the compromises achieved before the conference should not be lightly abandoned . Besides retaining the definition of the two sides of the Strait as " equal political entities , " the conference simply added proposals by Ju Gau-jeng for a " cross-strait forum " and " inviting representative persons from both sides of the Strait to participate as private individuals to peacefully resolve cross-strait issues through an exchange of opinions without any non-negotiable positions . "  
The landlord refused at first to accept the re-survey result , and hired a private firm of his own . The outcome was the same-his land was cut by about half . It is inferred that when using the triangulation method to measure the original lot , the workmen perhaps neglected to divide by two when calculating the area .  
However , because these organizations are all run by private individuals or civic groups , and are constantly being changed in response to social problems , to date no complete statistical survey has been done which would accurately reflect the actual resources which can be provided by Taiwan 's halfway houses .  
He observes that according to statistics , nearly 13% of people in the US have some sort of mental disorder . This clearly illustrates the famous words of Jesus Christ : " Man does not live by bread alone . " The ancient religious practices of meditation and contemplating the impermanence of life can positively help modern people , who are undergoing immense changes in social relations and also witnessing rapid transformations both at work and their private lives .  
In looking toward all of the preparations for the handover , those relating to government-including the establishment of the Basic Law and the holding of elections , the building of the airport , and even the appointment of the special administrative region 's chief executive and the arrival of the People 's Liberation Army-all have been accomplished . People 's private responses to the turnover-including the rush to get second passports , the return flow of emigrants , the real-estate boom-these too have already happened . Will there be big changes in the future ?  
In September 1994 the Cultural Committee of the Preparatory Committee began to formally discuss such matters as the names and emblems of government departments and agencies , arrangements for public holidays , the design and issue of postage stamps , the content of school textbooks , recognition of academic qualifications and so on , and also affirmed the principle of removing the visible trappings of colonial rule . Since then , wave after wave of actions to remove historical symbols has swept through both the public and private sectors .  
What private sector publishing firms originally set their sights on was the huge primary school textbook market , which consists of over 300,000 student readers . This , plus the possibility of publishing additional reference materials and teaching aids , adds up to potentially enormous profits . It is the main reason publishers were initally jumping at the chance to get in on the textbook market .  
It 's just that state firms often are less efficient than private ones because they have three burdens to bear : implementing state policies based on non-economic concerns , accepting legal restraints and interference from government agencies , and the human failing of usually performing public tasks more poorly than those involving private profit . Thus people often are dismayed with state firms .  
If the government did not take responsibility for major infrastructure , the private sector-devoid of capital in those early days-could never have done so itself . And it was unthinkable to allow a few people outside the state to control essential goods and services . Thus public ownership of key industries in Taiwan-sugar , salt , steel , petroleum , water , electricity-was based on the needs of a particular era .  
" The strong prey on the weak , the old consume the young , " sighs one telecom company manager . Early on , the DGT earned huge profits with its exorbitant mobile phone charges ; it was this fat market that private firms yearned for .  
In past cases where private property has been set aside for public use , the owner generally has n't received reasonable compensation and has also lost the chance to benefit from increased land prices . No wonder that people in Taiwan say : " Being the owner of a historic building is just too painful . "  
Through long-term arrangements by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and overseas representative offices , Vice President Lien Chan conducted his second visit to Europe under the low profile of a " holiday " and " private visit . " He made substantive , face-to-face contact with a nation with which the ROC does not have diplomatic ties , and established the critical beginnings of friendship and progressive exchange . The incessant actions of Beijing are additional proof of the barriers which the ROC currently faces in foreign relations .  
These past few years , unrelentingly high housing prices and crowded public spaces have been among the ubiquitous symptoms that Taipei City , constrained as it is within a ring of mountains , is filled to bursting point . In search of a better quality of life , more and more people are moving out to the suburbs , and Taipei 's dormitory zone has spread as far as Hsinchu and Miaoli . How much private and public time and resources are consumed by their daily commute ?  
The Taipei District Court ruled that although the topic of Ho Ya-wei 's report-about how Huang Chao-fu had spent NT $ 20 million in his first campaign as a KMT nominee for the legislature but received only 200 votes-could be described as " fair game . . . its sarcasm virtually dripped from the page . . . Because this affected the reputation of the plaintiff 's private moral character , the defendant was clearly acting maliciously . "  
Those who " set out with great hopes only to return defeated " were left both angry and disappointed . As one person who works in the media noted , in metropolitan Taipei , " The leisure industry was pushing its leisure facilities down people 's throats all day long . Media packaging made for holiday crowds of historic dimensions on government-sponsored educational package tours and at private amusement parks , new department stores and even the Hollywood-transplanted Warner Village movie theater complex . "  
" I keep mulling over this thought : Has this natural , simple , non-calculating character of the common man been lost under the capitalist system with its private ownership of property ? When these three people begin to specialize , they will become more adept at running the restaurant and become more calculating . Will the three of them be as happy then as they are now ? "  
But the long-term problems caused by recreational facilities are not going to go away . These private facilities , in fact , existed long before the park was established . Many of them , such as Sun Moon Ranch , are known far and wide . They break the law in various ways , including using national land , building illegal structures , and operating without proper permits .  
They helped Chang retrace his first heartthrob , who he has never forgotten , and also his middle school military instructor , who devoted great efforts to guiding him . He is thrilled at the idea of expressing gratitude through TV , saying it is 100 times more effective than contacting these people in private . " I can let the whole world know how grateful I am to them ! "  
By paying for each procedure carried out , NHI is encouraging the medical community to emphasize quantity rather than quality of treatment . It is also encouraging doctors to go into easier fields which pay well . For this reason , dermatology , pediatrics and physical rehabilitation have become hot areas to work in , and doctors are leaving hospitals to set up their own private clinics . On the other hand , more difficult areas of medicine such as surgery are suffering from a shortage of doctors .  
In the view of scholars of folk culture , the lion museum , with its rich collection of artifacts but its thus far somewhat inadequate " software " such as explanatory materials , guides and research activities , apart from reflecting the purchasing power of private collectors , is also indicative of the unending stream of mainland Chinese antiques flowing into Taiwan .  
Lee could hardly have told us much of anything new in his memoirs , for he had already devoted a tremendous effort during 30 years in office to the task of recounting the events that preceded the founding of the republic . Furthermore , Singapore has been deeply influenced by its long years under British rule . The Singaporean government maintains copious records concerning all its domestic and foreign affairs . Political statements over the years have drawn upon a large body of diplomatic documents , parliamentary reports , private letters , and government proclamations .  
These private art museums or memorial museums on the one hand afford centralized management and exhibition of these senior artists ' works , and privately held works of art might be donated to foundations as public cultural assets open to the public . In another sense , they bring greater diversity to art appreciation , spreading and expanding viewing opportunities beyond the select few major public art museums .  
Consequently , private museums established after this law came into effect have been treated precisely the same as large public museums in terms of facilities and organizational requirements : minimum structural support capacities , obstruction-free spaces , or such public safety issues as fire safety are all scrutinized against the standards governing large museums .  
In the analysis of Chiang Tsu-ning , head of the Secretariat of the Grand Justices , most of the private petitions raised over the years have revolved around basic constitutional rights . In earlier years , petitions concerning property rights and the right to equality before the law dominated , while in recent years such issues as human rights , gender equality and the right to liberty have come to the fore .  
Two important pieces of legislation were passed in regard to educating the populace . The " Citizens ' Education Law " was modified to encourage private individuals to engage in private education . The principle of " nine years of continuous compulsory education " was revised to state that " curricula shall center around students ' all-round mental and physical development and emphasize continuity . "  
On January 18th , Premier Vincent Siew returned home from Central America . Besides fulfilling his trip 's main purpose of cementing international friendships , Premier Siew also observed the results of using investment and trade as the central plank of a pragmatic foreign policy , and resolutely pushed for private enterprises to participate in popular diplomacy .  
He recalls how in the 1960s , when Taiwan and mainland China were engaged in a propaganda battle on the airwaves , and listening to mainland broadcasts was forbidden in Taiwan , the government encouraged the establishment of private radio stations . The number of radio stations quickly grew to over 80 , and there was an enormous demand for programs . Father Bourret produced classical music programs , five-minute stories , and short radio dramas , all of which he made available to radio stations free of charge .  
Whether for reasons of courtesy or safety , the idea that there are times when a mobile phone should be turned off is not very widespread in Taiwan . Given the difficulty of forcing people to turn off their phones , the MOTC will soon begin accepting applications from the private sector to install mobile-phone signal disrupters . This will stop the phones from functioning in areas where their use is restricted , thus resolving the problem of their use in public venues . Other controversies still exist .  
Now that the Sanxingdui exhibit has brought over a huge bronze statue of a man and many other exotic items , another blockbuster exhibit from the mainland has been scheduled for October . The autumn event will feature the superbly preserved silk paintings found at the Mawangdui site in Hunan Province as well as the stunning jade pieces discovered in Guangzhou at the royal tomb of the Nanyue kingdom . Going in the other direction , a private Taiwanese collection ( Ku Yue Ko ) was put on exhibit four years ago at the Palace Museum in Beijing .  
Museum director Chin Hsiao-yi has announced that another major exhibit , on the culture of the Han dynasty , will travel to Taiwan in late 1999 . Relics to be displayed include selected items from the museum 's own collection , items from the famed sites of Mawangdui and the royal tomb of the Nanyue kingdom , and other items to be borrowed from various private collectors in Taiwan . This exhibit will give a clear feel for the vast sweep of Han culture . ( photo by Pu Hua-chih )  
Hu Tsu-ching , an associate professor of political science at Soochow University , warns that there are several problems that must be addressed : The Kosovo government-in-exile is mired in internal strife , and it must be decided which " Kosovo " to assist . Ways must be found to ensure that the aid provides practical help to the refugees , and is not diverted into private pockets . With regard to the proposed training program in Taiwan , there are problems of language , health clearance , and so on .  
Amidst the hasty passage of the amendments , a provision allowing private gambling , long supported by a certain group of legislators , was attached to and passed along with the regulations . This rider reads : " For the purposes of staging internationally recognized events , application may be made to the competent authority for approval of special issuance of public welfare lottery tickets . "  
To make matters worse , the government has also been downsizing . The result is that virtually everyone-whether from large multinational firms or small enterprises , white-collar or blue-collar workers , senior specialists or low skilled laborers , from private firms or from the civil service ( long reputed to be the safest of careers ) - now lives under the shadow of an unexpected change in career path .  
On Xuanzong 's private chuiwan course , the grass is trimmed neat and smooth , and the four large greens bear a total of ten holes which , just as on a modern golf course , are all marked by flagpoles bearing different-colored pennants .  
Many scholar-officials also formed communities out of their own extended families by establishing clan congregations , updating genealogies , and setting up private schools to educate promising youngsters . These new forms of local organization helped society to remain orderly and civilized , and fostered an overall mood of culture and enlightenment . Rule by the learned  
Ho Pi-chen , chief executive officer of TWRF , strongly contests the contention of the Japanese government that the comfort women were engaged in private prostitution . In talking with former comfort women from many different countries , Ho has learned : " Most of these women were transported to the front on naval vessels . The comfort stations were built by the military , and the military determined how they were to be run . When the women got sick , they were attended to by military doctors .  
If elected , I will change the obsolete bureaucratism in the central government , and undertake complete reinvention of the government . I will create a clean , honest , and capable government , one that adheres to the concept of " government by partnership , " so that whatever the local governments can do , the central government should not get involved in ; and whatever the private sector can do , the central government should also not get involved .  
Currently , around a dozen public and private universities in Taiwan , including NTU , National Chiaotung University , National Sun Yat-sen University , Da-Yeh Institute of Technology , and Yuan-Ze Institute of Technology , offer advanced degree programs for executive management personnel . What is it that makes graduate programs in management so popular among the working population ? Liao Ching-jong , director of the NTUST College of Management , relates that new entrants into the professional ranks concentrate on accumulating professional know-how , while seasoned middle - and top-level executives seek an edge in management .  
Many Taiwan business people saw the establishment of formal diplomatic relations as a green light for investment in Palau . The foreign ministry delegation that visited Palau in March included private sector firms involved in tourism , textiles , electronics , and fishing , who went to investigate the investment environment .  
Given that education was run by and for government bureaucrats , those who studied did so only in order to further their ambitions and become officials . They cared little for knowledge or morality , or for the intrinsic value of learning . Philosophers realized that education and teaching materials lacked vitality and in fact limited people 's development in various ways . In order to escape the rigid and lifeless official education system , private education began to flourish .  
Under Zhu Xi , who had a knack for " management , " private academies grew in size and became increasingly widespread . Especially worthy of note was the Bailudong Academy in Jiangxi . The latter , a famous institution nestled amidst mountains and rivers as idyllic as a painting , had fallen into decline in the Northern Song period .  
In the future , when everything is connected , information technology will be an inescapable part of daily life . Your personal information will be included in various government or private databanks , to be monitored and processed by those who control these databanks . At the same time , each individual can build a little private Internet of their own , and put everything about themselves in for ease of management .  
For true flower lovers , the shy orchids of the wild are just as precious as the oversized local or exotic orchids grown in private gardens .  
In addition , having seen the constant human resource conflicts that resulted from joint ventures between Taiwanese capital and Vietnamese private or public enterprises , the government now allows foreign ventures to wholly own their local affiliates .  
The " one priority " was arts education . The " two legs to walk on " was a reference to the importance of state-run professional opera troupes and the encouragement of private theater troupes . And the talk about " three items of equal importance " meant that traditional opera , contemporary opera , and newly composed works dealing with historical subjects were all equally deserving of attention .  
Thus , while the first shots fired for financial reform may look good , those on the inside can not help but worry that the government will quickly run out of ammunition .

To this end , we shall establish , based on the successful public / private sector Caribbean Coalition on Tourism Marketing Programme for North America , broad-based regional marketing programmes and joint representation in the major markets , including the intra-Caribbean market , on a sustainable basis , and develop , not later than the end of 1995 , a financing arrangement to sustain this initiative .  
The SPF secretariat encourages enterprise sector participation in regional industrial development activities through various measures such as ongoing regular and consultation visits to public and private enterprises , liaison with national chambers of commerce and industry , training seminars and workshops , and provision of technical assistance facilities ( a marketing support fund scheme was set up to provide assistance to new exporters , for example ) .  
Other steps included close cooperation to ensure that all the group 's financial sector operations were carried out in the context of a sound reform strategy ; explicit support by the group to privatization , through the provision of advisory services to Governments and the provision of finance for public enterprise restructuring and investments in privatized firms ; and the intensification of the group 's research on private sector issues .  
Through its collaboration with the regional agricultural credit associations , FAO encourages financial institutions to revise their approaches and restructure their operations to better serve private sector enterprises and to enable them to act as contacts for new , emerging grassroots ' financial intermediaries at the national level .  
The work deals with comparative experiences in the privatization of water supply , focusing on private sector participation in urban water utility operations in industrialized , developing and transitional countries , an important area of intergovernmental policy discussions , including those relevant to Habitat II .  
A special effort was made to bring to the Conference experts from industry , public and private , and to emphasize the practical issues and options of the conversion process .  The subjects covered included the nuclear industry , military machines , shipbuilding , electronics , aeronautical and aerospace industries , information , intellectual property and international cooperation .  
It aims at training senior managers of Chinese military enterprises for conversion to production of civilian goods for the domestic and world markets , and facilitating joint ventures by bringing together major domestic and international investors from the private sector in the most attractive and committed Chinese enterprises .  
In general , the United Nations system should be able to help Governments define the role and scope of the public , mixed and private sectors and to suggest options in the modalities of interaction in accordance with the realities in each country , especially at the local and municipal levels , by means of specific technical assistance , dissemination and exchange of country experiences and research on the conditions for successful replication .  
Establish , consistent with data protection legislation , databases on women and their qualification for use in appointing women to senior decision-making and advisory positions , for dissemination to Governments , regional and international organizations and private enterprise , political parties and other relevant bodies .  
Implementation is primarily the responsibility of Governments , but is also dependent on a wide range of institutions in the public , private and non-governmental sectors at the community , national , subregional / regional and international levels . specifically devoted to women 's advancement globally . 
Implementation of the Platform for Action by national , subregional / regional and international institutions , both public and private , would be facilitated by transparency , by increased linkages between networks and organizations and by a consistent flow of information among all concerned .  
On average , women represent a mere 10 per cent of all elected legislators world wide and in most national and international administrative structures , both public and private , they remain underrepresented .  
To this end , Governments , the international community and civil society , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , are called upon to take strategic action in the following critical areas of concern [ with full respect for religious and ethical values , cultural backgrounds and philosophical convictions and in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms ] :  
Undertake to explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures , trade in arms and investment in arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to permit the possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development , in particular for the advancement of women ;  
Academic institutions and professional associations have a major role to play in accumulating theoretical knowledge on organized transnational crime and in disseminating this knowledge , in close cooperation with governmental agencies and the education system , as well as in concert with the media , non-governmental organizations and the private sector .  
Thus , contemporary United States domestic law on federal , state and local levels provides strong protections against racial discrimination in all fields of public endeavour and in many areas of private life .  
Thus , contemporary United States domestic law on federal , state and local levels provides strong protections against racial discrimination in all fields of public endeavour and in many areas of private life .  
Policy makers in some developing countries have thus begun to focus on the disparate characteristics of different types of private financial inflows and many now question the wisdom of early and complete liberalization of the capital account in international transactions .  Meanwhile , in some of the developed countries , the prospective role of development assistance itself is being re-examined .  
A related concern is that the foreign debt difficulties of developing countries - debt owed to both private and official creditors - have for the most part not yet been resolved in a durable manner more than a decade after the debt crisis burst onto the international political stage .  
Some countries , such as Morocco , South Africa , Tunisia , Uganda and Zimbabwe , have seen an increased inflow of private capital ; in 1994 , for example , South Africa recorded the first net capital inflow since 1984 , comprising mainly commercial bank loans and public and private international bond issues . 
NULLFor most of the post-war era , it has been taken for granted that the domestic savings of developing countries need to be supplemented with foreign savings to boost investment adequately and that it is not practical to expect private international financing to do the job : some projects that are developmentally important are just not bankable or practical areas for direct foreign investment .  
Many audits identified such problems as private cheques ( even vendors ' cheques ) that were being encashed by the cashiers out of funds in their custody , reconciliations of cash not being performed on a regular basis , old reconciling items not being cleared , cash advances remaining uncleared for long periods and improperly credited cash receipt vouchers .  
NULLThe objective of this undertaking was to draw policy recommendations from an in-depth review of the existing financial systems in African countries , including the current traditional systems and practices of capital formation at the local level , with a view to improving financial systems in those countries through the adoption of practical and realistic measures focused specifically on development of the private sector . 
NULLPursuant to General Assembly resolution 36 / 151 , voluntary contributions to the Fund from Governments , non-governmental organizations and private individuals are to be distributed through established channels of assistance , as humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals whose human rights have been severely violated as a result of torture and to relatives of such victims .  
NULLAs emphasized in previous reports , one of the circumstances leading to abuses against women is the practically unlimited powers granted to members of the Popular Police Forces and the People 's Committees " in the preservation of the moral health of the society " .  Article 5 , chapter I of Constitutional Decree No .  1993 concerning private and public life states as follows :  
Uganda intended to continue to work with its bilateral and multilateral development partners on innovative ways of mobilizing private productive capital and , to that end , had taken a number of domestic administrative and policy measures .  
Turning to the report on the sources of finance for development at mid-decade ( A / 50 / 397 ) , he noted that the marked increases in private resource flows to Asia and Latin America , which had far exceeded official flows , reflected successful economic reforms and strengthened political confidence in those regions .  
By confiscating the property of expelled Serbs in Krajina , the Government of the Republic of Croatia has violated the universal and sacred right of the inviolability of private property .  Considering that it has carried out this act guided exclusively by national criteria , this represents a glaring example of national , racial and religious discrimination and hatred .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
The main focus of the country programmes , as determined during the missions , will be on the strategic management of industrial development , human resources development , quality control and standardization , the environment , private sector development , with emphasis on small and medium industries , and the implications of the Uruguay Round agreements for the industrialization of Africa .  
Zambia adopted market liberalization and private sector development as an integral part of its economic reform programme , in moving away from its past socialist development strategy , which had been dominated by a rigid , inefficient centralized state sector .  
Also stresses the urgent need for creditor countries , private banks and lending institutions to expand their efforts to address the commercial debt of debt-distressed developing countries , and to extend appropriate new financial support , as well as provide additional and innovative measures , to enable these countries to achieve sustained economic growth and development ;  
The FS initiated partnerships with international , Federal , State , and private organizations for ecosystem assessment , leading to greater use of satellite data and increased understanding of global ecological processes .  
Stresses the necessity for the international community , especially the developed countries , to create a favourable international environment to reduce volatility in private capital flows to developing countries and to enhance their growth-promoting role through , inter alia , the expansion of productive capacities in developing countries , to support their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
The policy agenda agreed at the meeting had a strong accent on the following areas : ( a ) a greater external orientation of the least developed countries ' economies ; ( b ) development of a dynamic private enterprise sector ; ( c ) human resources development ; ( d ) eradication of poverty ; and ( e ) a renewed commitment to provide external support .  
The growth of a dynamic private enterprise sector should be underpinned by an appropriate economic , fiscal and legal framework with the following essential features : stable and predictable policies ; tax , monetary and trade policies that ensure adequate incentives for investment ; and a legal system which protects property rights and commercial contracts .  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities such as triangular funding arrangements and private sector funding ;  
Thanks to free enterprise , a number of popular daily and weekly newspapers enjoyed mass circulation and dozens of private radio stations and some independent television companies were now in operation .  
The United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , which was the core of the system of operational activities , had provided assistance in such crucial areas as national capacity-building in management , governance and democratization , private sector development and economic reforms , human resources , the social sector and the development of environmentally sound energy sources .  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
that the international community should continue to give strong support to the efforts of the developing countries to solve their grave economic and social problems as well as to promote a favourable climate for private financial flows through the creation of a favourable international economic environment ,  
concern also that a significant number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets ,  
developing countries , an active private sector , including the informal sector - whose linkages with the formal sector should be strengthened - and small and medium-sized enterprises provided the principal means to generate productive employment .  
the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access ;  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , particularly in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
The immediate effects of the beginning of the war in 1991 were as follows : the tourist market was depressed as a result of the lack of security ; many hotels and private accommodations were occupied by displaced persons and refugees ; commercial and communication links were immediately cut from the north ; and routes inland towards Bosnia and Herzegovina were blocked . 
Invites creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions , within their prerogatives , to consider continuing the initiatives and efforts to address the commercial debt problems of the least developed countries and the requests for continued mobilization of resources through the Debt-reduction Facility of the International Development Association in order to help eligible least developed countries reduce their commercial debt ;

Notes with appreciation the contribution of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in formulating international measures to deal with the special problems of the land-locked developing countries , and urges the Conference , inter alia , to keep under constant review the evolution of transit-transport infrastructure facilities , institutions and services , monitor the implementation of agreed measures , collaborate in all relevant initiatives , including those of the private sector and non-governmental organizations , and serve as a focal point on cross-regional issues of interest to land-locked developing countries ;

the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access ,  
Faced with the growing threat and multifaceted problem of drug abuse , Governments have come to realize the urgent need to develop and implement a comprehensive set of responses , coordinated to achieve the maximum impact and relying on the active involvement of all government agencies and numerous bodies and institutions , including in the private sector , that play a role in drug control . 
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to include in his report to the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole estimates of the projected resource requirements from all sources , public and private , domestic and international , needed for the full implementation of the New Agenda , the amount expected to be mobilized and proposals to address any resource gaps , taking into account the specific economic and development situations of African countries ;  
Reiterates the call for formulating or strengthening by 1996 comprehensive cross-sectoral strategies for implementing the outcome of the Summit and national strategies for social development , including government action , actions by States in cooperation with other Governments , international , regional and subregional organizations , and actions taken in partnership and cooperation with actors of civil society , the private sector and cooperatives , with specific responsibilities to be undertaken by each actor and with agreed priorities and time-frames ;  
Modernizing public administration in order to establish clear parameters for a modern , innovative civil service must include among its priorities the updating of the private sector and enhancing the ability to compete in foreign markets , while taking into account the economic and social balance required and ensuring sustainable development and employment .  
The 1990s have been a decade of political and economic upheaval throughout the world , and there has been an increasing tendency towards democratization and the participation of non-governmental actors in development , with a particularly strong emphasis on the need for good governance and for sound financial and economic policies at the national level and a greater reliance on market forces and on the private sector as basic requirements of development .  
In August 1985 , a major shift took place in our economic policy that included , among other measures , a reform and simplification of the taxation system , a drastic reduction in the fiscal deficit , price deregulation , a reordering of the public enterprise sector and a greater openness to private investment , both foreign and domestic .  
It also involves injecting new capital from the private sector , either domestic or foreign , into national public enterprises through an innovative , efficient capitalization and administration plan , in collaboration with strategic private partners .  
Streamlining governmental machinery , increasing its productivity and reducing costs , improving economic and financial management , promoting the interaction between the private and public sectors , and stimulating the participation of the various actors in this process have been at the forefront of recent efforts for public administration reforms in Austria .  
The transition from a centrally planned economy and a centralized public administration with the State directly involved in the production of goods and services , to a fully developed public and private sector is not easy to achieve ; it takes time and is expensive .  
The lessons learned so far have proved that without supportive and predictable administrative and legal structures at all levels , and without access to public services particularly to a justice system the private sector and citizens would live in a state of uncertainty and insecurity , hindering the development of their full potential .  
This set of realities has led Algeria , committed as it is to a vast process of economic reform , to formulate and implement a development strategy which , while subjecting the economy to the laws of the marketplace , will ensure the necessary balance between the various State functions , tying the powers of the public authorities in the coordination of economic activity to the desire to preserve to the greatest extent possible a patrimony that has been built up through the colossal efforts of our national community , while encouraging free enterprise and private initiative .  
The immediate consequences of this were the destruction of approximately one seventh of the population , the majority of whom were in the productive labour force ; the destruction of infrastructure and equipment , both public and private ; the collapse of institutions , including the civil service , judiciary and local administration , to mention but a few ; a severe setback in economic activity , particularly agriculture and industrial activities ; the exodus of between 1-million and 2-million people to neighbouring countries as refugees ;  
They include the elimination of automatic direct access to the civil service for all of those leaving training institutions ; the opening up of training institutions to the private sector , as well as to foreign students , especially those from the subregion , provided they pay for their training ; revision of the institutions ' current rules to permit them to generate their own resources and to allow for self-management ; and revitalizing the work of improving the various institutions , work in which the potential users will be able to participate .  
In a democratic country , public administration which is effective and enlightened because it is refocused on its essential tasks can contribute powerfully to a country 's economic development not only by coordinating the efforts of public and private enterprise , but also by attracting worthwhile investment .  
Indeed , the need for fundamental review in the role of public administration and development has become urgent because countries have to meet the complex developmental challenges of dealing with the impact of increasing globalization and the role of non-governmental organizations and the private sector , while focusing on the primary objectives of eliminating poverty and promoting social justice and economic growth .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
The Committee identified as major factors and difficulties in implementing the Convention : the weak State machinery to effectively maintain the peace process ; the difficult process of national reconciliation ; the breakdown of public infrastructure and private support systems ; the large number of Rwandan refugees and internally displaced persons ; the great number of militias and some civilians who are still armed ; and the shattered economy and extreme poverty .  
In the past four years the economy recorded an average growth rate of 8.2 per cent , resulting in increased employment opportunities and significantly rising living standards in the country , primarily in urban areas , where private enterprises are flourishing , and in fertile rural areas , where farmers have better incentive to grow and market their produce .  
The agreements of the Uruguay Round concluded in 1994 , the rapid redefinition of economic groupings in the developed countries , and the ever more important role of private capital in the world economy , have created a new international environment in which the interests of Africa do not seem to have been taken into account , or in which they are even threatened or compromised . 
This has been done to achieve balance and stability in the economy as a whole and to activate the role of the private sector on the basis of a market economy and free competition , while taking into account the importance of improving basic essential social services , building a modern State and improving the standard of living of citizens .  
That is why in many African countries today Governments continue with determination to carry out bold and difficult reforms , reflected , inter alia , in the improved and more rational use of public funds , in the opening of our economies to international trade and in the creation of conditions conducive to private enterprise and to the transparent management of public affairs with , most importantly , all sectors of society participating in the work of national development , in the interests of all .  
As expected , the series of global conferences held recently under the auspices of the United Nations , which involved not only Governments but also non-governmental organizations , civil society , the media and the private sector , have raised awareness of and built consensus around a number of overarching issues concerning economic growth and sustainable development .  
In light of the vital role played by non-governmental organizations and the private sector in children 's advocacy , raising public and political awareness , mobilizing resources and fostering more active and systemic involvement should be encouraged at all levels , from developing and implementing strategies for the second half-decade to monitoring and assessing their progress .  
Finally , sound monetary and fiscal policies implemented by a government which is transparent and accountable will also help to provide the confidence needed to attract private sector investment that is critical to growth and job creation . 
Also proclaimed is the critical importance of the cooperation , support and contributions of the international community , the United Nations , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society including private citizens for social development .  
On the home front , supporting the private and informal sectors , promotion of self-employment , provision of credit facilities to the unemployed , encouraging the creation of volunteer organizations including grass-roots financial organizations , investment in training and education programmes , optimal use of resources such as land and water , expansion of labour-intensive economic activities and a focus on the service sector are among the necessary first steps .  
The definitive solution to the problem of the external debt , of ownership and of a considerable improvement in national , foreign and private investment , in the framework of a sound and responsible macroeconomic policy favouring internal savings and contributing to improving the standard of living of the Nicaraguan people , must be our goal .  
While in the beginning of this partnership large amounts had to be contributed towards emergency measures , today the extensive bilateral development cooperation focuses mainly on the consolidation of structural adaptation processes , the rehabilitation of social infrastructures , the promotion of private enterprises ( including vocational training ) , agricultural development , and the protection of the environment and natural resources .  
Success in reforms , promotion of the private sector and direct foreign investment , increased activity in the democratic process and the strengthening of civilian society are essential elements of an Agenda for Development , and to a large extent depend on the support of the international community , in terms of resources and political will .  
This commitment is reflected in the vital and multifaceted relations that we have with African Governments both at the bilateral level and through a range of multilateral agencies , and which take the form of the continuing engagement of Canadian non-governmental organizations throughout the continent , and growing number of partnerships in the private sector . 
If we agree that long-term , sustained growth and sustainable development depend on the private sector and on attracting foreign direct investment , then we must identify a true incentive for investment , since Africa , despite its conducive climate , is still unable to attract foreign direct investment .  
In order to achieve the major objectives of the New Agenda and the target growth rate of 6 per cent , the international community must accelerate its support to African countries in order to sustain the momentum leading to recovery and sustainable development in areas such as the further alleviation of the burden of external debt , the attraction of foreign private investment , increased official development assistance , trade facilitation and market access , and development assistance for capacity-building .  
For example , even though calls for the promotion of the private sector , increased industrial development and foreign direct investment , and the reduction of external debt in African countries are regularly made in various forums , harsh marketplace reality shows that portfolio equity investment remains virtually absent , and that less than 5 per cent of global foreign direct investment is targeted to African countries .  
Even though it is important to reaffirm a strong commitment of the private sector , donor Governments , agencies and non-governmental organizations to genuine partnership for the accelerated industrial growth of Africa , a critical step must be made to design policies based on the real needs of individual African economies , as development will take place in Africa only when its peoples have democratic control over their own policies .  
Each nation is responsible for itself and must create , through rigorous public management and compliance with its legislative rulings , optimum conditions for freeing private initiative , a factor in economic and commercial progress .  
The presentation of Uruguay 's initial report ( CRC / C / 3 / Add . 37 ) at the latest session of the Committee on the Rights of the Child had provided an opportunity for a constructive dialogue which had demonstrated the priority now accorded to children by the Government of Uruguay in its political programme to promote public and private activities carried out with the financial aid of the international community . 
Requests improved annual reporting on financial flows , including allocations / expenditures , based on consistent criteria and related to the costed elements of the Programme of Action , including a clear account of levels and trends of funding by source ( bilateral , multilateral ( both core and non-core ) and private funds , domestic allocations and the like ) ;  
Reaffirms the need for ensuring an effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners and the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Calls upon the international community to seek to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including , as mutually agreed , on concessional and grant terms ;

Themes found in both the guidelines and the common advocacy statement include putting people first ; promoting sustainable human development ; reducing gender inequality and inequity ; fostering accountability and transparency ; developing common indicators that are critical to the monitoring of programme impact ; strengthening country-level collaboration ; enhancing national capacity-building ; and facilitating dialogue between and among the United Nations resident coordinator system , Governments , non-governmental organizations , the private sector and civil society . 
As industrialization proceeds in the dynamic developing economies and middle-income developing countries , rising standards of living and rapid urbanization will contribute to strong growth in electricity demand and petroleum consumption will rise from an increase in private motor transport .  
The Constitution contained provisions entitling women to remedial and affirmative action , with a view to enabling them to participate in political , economic and social life and gain access to positions in public and private institutions on an equal footing with men .  
In view of those difficulties , the Government was developing a policy that combined campaigns to eradicate stereotypes in several areas , ranging from the sharing of domestic responsibilities to the role of the media , with the establishment of affirmative action programmes in the public and private sectors .  
Stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Recognizing that the international community should continue to give strong support to the efforts of the developing countries to solve their grave economic and social problems as well as to promote a favourable climate for private financial flows through the creation of a favourable international economic environment ,  
Expressing concern also that a significant number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets ,  
Invites creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions , within their prerogatives , to consider continuing the initiatives and efforts to address the commercial debt problems of the least developed countries and the requests for continued mobilization of resources through the Debt-reduction Facility of the International Development Association in order to help eligible least developed countries reduce their commercial debt ;  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access ,  
Notes with appreciation the contribution of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in formulating international measures to deal with the special problems of the land-locked developing countries , and urges the Conference , inter alia , to keep under constant review the evolution of transit transport infrastructure facilities , institutions and services , monitor the implementation of agreed measures , collaborate in all relevant initiatives , including those of the private sector and non-governmental organizations , and serve as a focal point on cross-regional issues of interest to land-locked developing countries ;  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
He has published several books and numerous articles on the law of nationality , private international law , in the strict sense , and international civil procedural law in Venezuelan and foreign journals .  
It was recognized that , while private capital flows to developing countries could make an important contribution to growth and development , many of those inflows were in the form of portfolio investment rather than direct investment in productive capacity , and their distribution among developing countries was uneven , with countries needing capital most being unable to attract them .  
However , the progress made towards establishing the institutional and physical infrastructure for the active involvement of the public and private sector in the economy , though notable , fell short of expectations , which appeared to have been overly optimistic .  
Although the structural causes of the problems have often to be dealt with at the national and sometimes the international level , progress will depend to a large degree on local authorities , civic engagement and the forging of partnerships at all levels of government with the private sector , the cooperative sector , non-governmental and community-based organizations , workers and employers and civil society at large . 
In Habitat II , Governments at all levels , the community and the private sector considered how the achievement of the two principal goals of " Adequate shelter for all " and " Sustainable human settlements development in an urbanizing world " can be furthered at the local level through an enabling process in which individuals , families and their communities play a central role .  
The sooner communities , local governments , partnerships among the public , and private and community sectors join efforts to create comprehensive , bold and innovative strategies for shelter and human settlements , the better the prospects will be for the safety , health and well-being of people and the brighter the outlook for solutions to global environment and social problems .  
Establish and implement consultative mechanisms among the governmental authorities that are responsible for economic , environmental , social , human settlements and shelter policies , and the organization of civil society and the private sector so as to coordinate the shelter sector in a coherent manner , which should include identifying the market and precise criteria for allocations , subsidies and other forms of assistance ;  
Adopt an enabling legal and regulatory framework based on an enhanced knowledge , understanding and acceptance of existing practices and land delivery mechanisms so as to stimulate partnerships with the private business and community sectors , specifying recognized types of land tenure and prescribing procedures for the regularization of tenure , where needed ;  
To provide opportunities for productive employment and private investment , Governments at the appropriate levels , including local authorities , in consultation with workers ' and employers ' organizations , chambers of commerce , industry , trade , consumer organizations , professional associations , and the financial sector , including the cooperative sector , and in the context of comprehensive urban planning , should :  
The registration of aircraft , that has been provided for - as far as civil aircraft are concerned - in the 1944 Chicago Convention , and the registration of space objects that has been provided for in the 1975 Registration Convention which provides for any object launched into outer space ; both instruments establish different ways of , and requirements for registration ; Liability , which in the case of an aircraft is based on international treaties and partly on national law and is attributable to private persons .  
This requires , as appropriate , establishing policies , laws and regulations for both public and private activities , encouraging responsible private activities in all fields , facilitating community groups ' participation , adopting transparent procedures , encouraging public-spirited leadership and public-private partnerships , and helping people to understand and exercise their rights and responsibilities through open and effective participatory processes , universal education and information dissemination .  NULL  
Partnerships among countries and among all actors within countries from public , private , voluntary , and community-based organizations , the cooperative sector , non-governmental organizations , and individuals are essential to the achievement of sustainable human settlements development and the provision of adequate shelter for all and basic services .  
Chapter 7 of Agenda 21 developed the concept of an " enabling approach " in the human settlements sector , whereby a partnership among the public , private and community sectors sought to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and the rural poor .

Also reiterates the call for formulating or strengthening by 1996 comprehensive cross-sectoral strategies for implementing the outcome of the Summit and national strategies for social development , including government action , actions by States in cooperation with other Governments and international , regional and subregional organizations , and actions taken in partnership and cooperation with actors of civil society , the private sector and cooperatives , with specific responsibilities to be undertaken by each actor and with agreed priorities and time-frames ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 7 ] / including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;

The most updated theory of international aviation law states than an aircraft designed for " civilian " air transport belonging to a private airline and operated by a civilian crew may in a particular situation be considered to be " State aircraft " if it performs a military , customs or police function . . .  Other aircraft , besides those involved in military , customs or police services , could also be considered " State aircraft " because the enumeration in the Convention is not preclusive .  
The active involvement of a wide variety of major groups , including national and international non-governmental organizations , the media , corporations and firms in the private sector , the scientific community , educational organizations and indigenous communities , is now sought on a more consistent basis .

The services feature advice and assistance to adjust the role of Governments to ensuring adequate competition , promoting new investment , achieving quality standards , meeting environmental and social requirements and enabling more active participation of the private sector in the industrialization process , including policy formulation and institutional support .  
While Governments , in the new context of the growing importance of the market and the private sector , have a diminished productive role in economic development , it is important to note that all Governments will retain responsibility for providing a regulatory framework for the effective operation of a competitive market system . 
Public administration will continue to fulfil critical functions in development , supporting measures for economic growth , protecting the environment , determining the relationship between the public and the private sector , reducing poverty and illiteracy and other social development activities , thereby achieving the goals of sustainable development .  
Tasks like facilitating public administration by effectively and creatively utilizing human resources ; building government processes and institutions to provide a peaceful resolution of conflict ; the need to shift non-core functions of government to the private sector ; to maintain the vitality of technical cooperation while changing the mechanisms of delivery to incorporate additional technological advances ; and to perform those tasks successfully while balancing severe resource constraints .

A significant increase in private sector investment for environmental protection also occurred in the newly industrialized developing countries , while in economies in transition a marked increase is expected in the future , in particular in economies with a rapid rate of privatization of industries .  
ITU had been instrumental in the establishment of the World Telecommunication Organization ( WorldTel ) , a cooperative body financed by private investors from industrialized countries which assisted developing countries in providing access to telecommunication facilities for a large segment of their population through the introduction of cost-effective technologies and the creation of a liberal economic environment .  
That could include the development of model legislation dealing with matters such as the exercise of jurisdiction over stateless vessels on the high seas ; providing legal authority for stopping , boarding and searching vessels in accordance with article 17 of the 1988 Convention ; and the collection , translation and distribution of relevant legislation , of bilateral and multilateral agreements , and of national and international memoranda of understanding between States , agencies or other entities such as private companies .  
Fundamental to this expanded inflow has been the increased confidence generated within the private sector , including the banking and insurance sectors , as a result of the willingness of country administrations to demonstrate a continued responsiveness to private investor concerns in the area of policy development , in the development and enhancement of stable and transparent mining and investment codes , and in the development of supportive administrative frameworks .  
Directly tied into this process has been the continued dissemination of individual country information through the very successful investment seminars and round-table discussions which have enabled private companies , financial institutions and technical advisers to gain a better understanding of various countries and their risk factors , and to develop good working relationships with private and government officials and the multilateral and bilateral aid institutions , all with a view towards creating a sustainable economic and environmentally sound base of operations on which to build within the various countries .  
Rather than the initial very simple structure of a pure equity investment by an individual foreign investor where risk was self insured , a number of joint venture investments have concluded and have been structured to include a mix of equity and non-recourse project debt , with insurance provided by either private or agency insurers .

In all countries of the ESCAP region , the private sector is viewed as a key instrument for achieving economic goals in a world of rapidly increasing global competition as it is considered to be more efficient , flexible and productive than the public sector in undertaking a large variety of investment , production , distribution and service-related activities .  
However , the success of the policies followed depends on the underlying preconditions for private sector development , including stable and credible political conditions , law and order , and the continuity of policies which in themselves must be credible , consistent and transparent , as well as stable macroeconomic conditions .  
With the increasing relevance of competition policy in managing a competitive economy based on the private sector , a pressing need emerges for each country in the region to legislate viable laws governing the potential abuses of market power .

To strengthen the capacity of Governments at the national and local levels as well as of the private sector to manage the rapidly growing demand for infrastructure and services in urban and rural settlements in an economically efficient and environmentally and socially sustainable manner ;  
The capacity of African societies and economies for real and sustained growth are being increasingly realized , as most economic policies are now focused on the creation of an enabling environment for the private sector and efficient operation of the market economy .  
In particular , the private enterprise sector , which is the key agent of development , is not well developed in most African countries , and its growth is constrained by shortages of capital and of entrepreneurial , managerial , technical and marketing skills .  
Since private capital flows are becoming a major source of financing for developing countries , African countries that seem to be involved in a process of adjusting their financial structures and liberalizing their economies are likely to attract foreign resources , both for portfolio , and more particularly , direct investment .  Creation of domestic capital markets , as complementary measures to the process of economic liberalization and privatization , is essential if the countries need to broaden and improve the savings / investment process .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
The political and professional debate has in recent years focused , and is likely to continue to focus , on a number of major questions : the relationship between a high level of social provision and individual incentives to work and national competitiveness ; the extent to which individual and family responsibility might be undermined by social provision ; the relative efficiency of public and private provision and of various mixes of the two ; how to divide responsibility among different levels of government ; and how to keep costs in check .

As the implementation of the Habitat Agenda will require adequate funding , we must mobilize financial resources at the national and international levels , including new and additional resources from all sources - multilateral and bilateral , public and private .  In this connection , we must facilitate capacity-building and promote the transfer of appropriate technology and know-how .  
The period has seen the rise of numerous institutions - national ( governmental , academic and private ) , subregional and regional - which engage in analytical and operational activities similar to those of ECLAC .

Mainly because of the prevailing low rates of both public and private saving , lack of competitivity in international trade and some ill-adapted economic policies , African countries did not succeed in mobilizing the aggregated $ 82.5-billion that were to come from Member States to support the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development over the period from 1986 to 1991 .  
Measures to enhance socio-political stability and good governance and to secure sound macroeconomic policies that will be conducive to private foreign and domestic investment should be strongly encouraged .

Systematic and continued involvement of all concerned parties in all stages of the work , including governmental institutions , forest owners , the private sector , local and indigenous communities , indigenous and non-indigenous forest dwellers and relevant national non-governmental organizations , will be necessary in order to help ensure overall soundness of approach , timely implementation and sustainability of efforts over time .  
Considering the current economic and financial situation worldwide , the decreasing levels of official development assistance and the concentration of private investment in countries with abundant forest resources , special attention will have to be given to the needs of the least developed countries with low forest cover .  NULLIn addressing the needs and requirements of countries with areas of low forest cover or with low forest cover overall , particularly developing countries , the Panel may wish to consider the proposals outlined below .  
Other indicators of the deepening integration of countries in transition with international capital markets are the rise in borrowing by private and partially privatized corporations and municipalities ( departing from the past practice of uniquely sovereign borrowing ) , the use of a broader range of instruments ( for example , increasing use of syndicated loans in addition to bonds ) , and further geographical and currency diversification of financial sources .  
In developing countries , however , the current flows of private investment are highly concentrated among a few countries with export potential while serious shortages of funds are experienced in countries where forestry is oriented towards domestic markets .  
This can be accomplished by educating capital markets about the investment opportunities in SFM ; by packaging and structuring these opportunities in ways that are easily understood and recognizable to private sector investors ; and by reducing risks and incremental costs specific to an emerging industry .  
It is desirable for the information systems to be Internet-based for this would allow easy access and information-sharing among multilateral agencies , countries ' institutions , non-governmental organizations and other interested parties .  The Panel may wish to invite relevant multilateral forest agencies and international organizations to review and initiate the development of improved information systems that support activities for sustainable forest management , particularly so as to facilitate private sector investment , speed up technology transfer to developing countries and improve coordination in financial assistance .  
The Panel recognized the importance of international cooperation for the management , conservation and sustainable development of forests , particularly in developing countries , in spite of the fact that it was each country 's responsibility to develop policies that would create an enabling environment for private , bilateral and multilateral investments in the forest sector .

Mobilization of substantial new and additional resources from all sources , domestic and international , public and private , and from traditional and new sources would also be instrumental .  
New ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development , including poverty eradication , should be explored .

It is patently clear - and accepted throughout the developing world - that functioning markets and private initiative are among the most efficient and powerful mechanisms to generate wealth and thus permit increased standards of living .  
Governments as enabling partners should create and strengthen effective partnerships with women , youth , the elderly , persons with disabilities , vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities , local authorities , the private sector and non-governmental organizations in each country " .  It further indicates that " national mechanisms should be established or improved , as appropriate , to coordinate actions at all relevant government levels that have an impact on human settlements and to assess this impact prior to governmental actions " .  
The 124 national reports received by the Habitat II secretariat confirm that national planning processes generally adhered to this pattern , including representatives of national ministries , public and parastatal organizations , local authorities , the scientific and academic community , professional organizations , non-governmental and community-based organizations and the private sector .  
At the same time , the possibilities of financial support from non-traditional sources of funding , which have been opened up by the new partnerships established by the Habitat secretariat with , among others , the organized private sector , private foundations and municipal and local authorities , will be actively pursued by the Centre . D . Involvement of local authorities and civil society ,  
The Government 's development efforts in the last three months have centred on encouraging passage by Parliament of two key laws related to the structural adjustment programme - civil service reform and modernization of public enterprises , maintaining the macroeconomic balance necessary to attract private investment and reactivating externally financed public investment to improve the country 's infrastructure and provide a much-needed stimulus to domestic demand .  
As indicated in Declaration No . 1 / 488 , SLORC set itself four objectives : first , the re-establishment of peace and tranquillity in the country ; second , the restoration and provision of communication and transport ; third , measures to ensure better supply of food , clothing and shelter by facilitating the operations of private enterprise and the cooperatives in these sectors ; and fourth , when the first three measures would have been accomplished , the holding of multi-party democratic elections to be held in a free and fair manner .  
The strengthening of the private sector 's role in the development process and in the creation of jobs has been accompanied by an investment promotion policy focused on a recasting of the Investment Codes into a single , better adapted and more flexible Code covering all economic sectors and the financial and fiscal reforms .  
In accordance with article 1 of the Code , these include industrial , trade and agricultural establishments and their dependencies , of whatever nature , whether public or private , religious or secular , even if they are of a professional or charitable nature ; liberal professions , craft establishments , cooperatives , civil law partnerships , unions , associations and groupings of any kind .  
While the State bears the cost of wages and supplementary social charges for no fewer than 14 days when work is suspended ( decree No . 1447 of 31 December 1987 ) , to enable public officials to celebrate a variety of religious , political and social holidays , private enterprises would find it difficult to support such charges , which place a substantial burden on production costs .  
At independence , social security coverage extended only to established civil servants and established staff of administrative public institutions , local public authorities , staff of some public enterprises and some categories of employee in the structuralized private sector ( family allowances scheme , contractual retirement plan ) .  
It spells out the functions of the public and private health facilities and establishments , which are required to provide , free of charge or in return for payment , preventive , curative , palliative , diagnostic and functional rehabilitation services with or without hospitalization .  
A large number of public and private institutions are responsible , depending on the cultural or artistic speciality in question , for ensuring academic or vocational and practical training .  
However , it is still the case that the means placed in man 's hands by science and technology , which now enable him to affect , even indirectly , the physical integrity , freedom or privacy of the individual , constitute a serious threat to human rights in any country , especially since scientific and technological progress has achieved such a degree of sophistication that individuals hardly have any truly " private " life any more and are no longer safe from genetic manipulation .  
Although it had been said that global economic growth was the result of the globalization of the economy , the international community should be fully aware that that process was limited largely to interaction among the private sectors of those countries , and that their sole objective was to make profits .  
Those programmes were beginning to bear fruit : the level of absolute poverty had been reduced while per capita income had increased ; economic growth had been sustained ; the debt service ratio had decreased in relation to exports ; and the Philippines had re-entered the private capital market in order to seek sources of external financing .  27 .  In order to promote sustainable human development to achieve real prosperity , economic growth in developing countries must reach between 5 and 9 per cent .  
The United Nations should emphasize the formulation of policies aimed at fostering a consensus on development strategy as a vital step towards the building of a new global partnership , and should develop specific programmes to assist the least developed countries - most of which had yet to benefit from increased flows of private capital - and the African countries , which were suffering from a heavy debt burden and a lack of basic infrastructure for development .  
Also reaffirms that , in order to achieve the goals of the International Conference on Population and Development , there is a need for adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels as well as of new and additional resources to developing countries from all sources , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources , and calls upon those countries in a position to do so to increase their contributions to the United Nations Population Fund ;  
In 1995-1996 , the United Nations Industrial Development Organization 's ( UNIDO ) technical cooperation programmes with the front-line States focused on , inter alia , the following : developing support strategies and formulating policies for accelerated industrial development ; providing support for developing existing industries and industrial infrastructures ; private sector development with emphasis on strengthening private sector institutions ; small and medium enterprises development ; and industrial information investment and technology promotion .  
Concerning the use of national human resources , he said that the national staff of UNDP were among its most valuable resources ; in many of the field offices , the only international staff members were the resident representatives and their deputies , while all the others were nationals , who were generally experienced in the work of UNDP programmes and projects , familiar with the culture and language , and frequently had worked for the Government , the private sector , non-governmental organizations and the mass media . 
Such education was available at all school levels , starting with municipal and private kindergartens and including both public and private schools maintained by the national minority , which received the same financial support from the State as public schools .  
Commit ourselves to working towards the greater use of solar energy through the provision of adequate technical assistance and funding , the full utilization of existing international funds , and the facilitation of increased participation by both public and private sectors .  
Tied to this factor , the modern domestic private sector is still embryonic and indigenous entrepreneurial capacity is scarce , lacking capital and managerial expertise and experience .  
Mr . CHUNG ( Republic of Korea ) said that industrialization played a vital role as a catalyst for economic and social progress and that international cooperation had a role to play in industrial development , although the process increasingly was being driven by the laws of the market and by the private sector .  
In the least developed countries and in a number of African countries where the private sector was weak , the public sector should play an active role in establishing the basic essential infrastructure , and international cooperation should focus on countries and sectors where the lack of such infrastructure was most acute .  
UNIDO played an active role in the implementation of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer , was an authority on environmentally sound industrial development and promoted direct contacts between government officials and representatives of the private sector on a global level .  
It is heartening to note that , avoiding a pitfall encountered in the past , African countries and their development partners successfully concluded their discussion and analysis of the performance of all the parties involved , even in such controversial areas as political and economic reform , promotion of the private sector , human development , regional and subregional cooperation and integration , resource flows , external debt , trade , economic diversification and capacity-building .  
It is also important to set the ways and means to achieve this by utilizing not only official development assistance but also private investment , trade , social infrastructure building , human capacity development , and all other elements which are essential to achieving those targets , as well as by devising an ideal policy mix to suit the concrete socio-economic conditions of the countries involved .  
" Recognizing the need to promote social responsibility and appropriate standards of ethics on the part of private and public corporations and individuals engaged in international commercial transactions , inter alia , through observance of the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business , and taking into account the impact of their activities on economic and social development and environmental protection ,

To denying , in countries that do not already do so and in accordance with the fundamental principles of their legal systems , the tax deductibility of bribes paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a Member State to any public official or elected representative of another country ;  
This biased attitude of the republic of Croatia is evident also in the report of Ms . Elizabeth Rehn of 14 March 1996 , which contains ( on pp . 62-86 ) numerous examples of human rights violations , killings , and mistreatment of the civilian population , destruction of private property , prevention of the return of refugees and so on effected by wilful extremists whose behaviour escapes control .  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation and follow-up of the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas ;  
Given the many areas where there is a mutual interest in government-private sector cooperation , including , for example , skills , technological and infrastructure development , environmental protection and the promotion of inter-firm backward and forward linkages , the ability of the Government and the private sector to build up a confident and effective working relationship with each other assumes a particular importance .  
However , experiences from the industrialized countries have shown that investment alone does not pay off in terms of productivity gains if not accompanied by complementary policies creating an enabling environment , as well as an adequate level of cooperation between public and private R &amp; amp ; D .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
While underlining that the law was applied without religious discrimination and with respect for the rights of non-Muslims , Mr . Turabi explained that consumption of alcohol was not a crime in the southern states , while in the north it was authorized for non-Muslims in private and forbidden in public .  
The IOM budget is composed of an administrative part , funded by assessed contributions from all member States according to an agreed percentage scale and an operational part funded wholly by voluntary contributions from Governments and multilateral and private sources .  
The Heads of State again emphasize the special importance of developing and extracting the rich natural resources of their countries , in the first instance natural gas , petroleum and hydro-energy resources , and called for urgent measures to conduct joint projects for laying pipelines and electricity transmission lines to deliver energy to world markets , with the involvement in these projects of the States concerned , international financial institutions and State and private structures .  
Notes that while sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country to promote macroeconomic stability are essential elements for determining the volume and structure of private capital flows , international macroeconomic policies play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness , and should contribute to creating a favourable international economic environment ;  
" Recognizing the need to promote social responsibility and appropriate standards of ethics on the part of private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals engaged in international commercial transactions , inter alia , through observance of the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business , and taking into account the impact of their activities on economic and social development and environmental protection ,

After touching briefly on the issue of economic growth and some of the reasons for the continued slow growth of the world economy , he said that it was increasingly being recognized that private capital flows were not a viable long-term solution .  
Concerned about continuing deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers involved in Operation Lifeline Sudan and international private voluntary agencies ,  
Their major expected results are : the establishment of legal and institutional frameworks , of commercially viable reforms and instruments to foster efficient trade and transport operations ( with direct and active participation of concerned public and private agencies and operative Trade Points , and through National Trade and Transport Facilitation Committees representing all functional interests ) ; and the establishment of adequate training programmes .  
In developing countries the current flows of private investment are highly concentrated on a few countries with export potential , while serious shortages of funds are experienced in countries where forestry is oriented towards domestic markets .  
While Government and other stakeholders have been dedicating resources to the development of new financial instruments to address sustainable forestry , the huge shifts in global capital markets over the last five years suggest that the main issue for capturing private sector funding for forest management is not developing new financial instruments , but linking existing investment flows more directly to sustainability and with sustainable forest management in particular . 
In order to address these concerns and to reach the goal of economically efficient , socially balanced and ecologically sound sustainable forest management , the experts call upon the Governments , private sector and investment community , multilateral international organizations , non-governmental organizations and the voluntary sector to recognize their shared responsibility and to take urgent action as follows :  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation and follow-up of the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas , and in that process to emphasize the need to integrate the gender perspective ;  
Requests the Commission on Human Settlements to review at its sixteenth session , its working methods in order to involve in its work the representatives of local authorities or international associations of local authorities , as appropriate , and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector and non-governmental organizations , in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , taking into account the rules of procedure of the Commission on Human Settlements and the relevant provisions of Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 31 ;  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions , and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
These included macroeconomic stability , high rates of domestic saving , maintenance of sound financial intermediaries , high priority given to human resource development ( especially to high _ quality primary and secondary education ) , competitive exchange rates , export orientation , a supportive environment which rewarded entrepreneurship and allowed open and constructive dialogue between government and the private sector regarding objectives and policies , and governance which balanced the promotion of social cohesion and consensus with that of competition between individuals and companies .  
In his view , the role of Governments was to create a stable macroeconomic and political environment , to put in place a competent and effective administration , and to create a juridical framework that favoured private investment and guaranteed the maximum development of human resources .  
Consequent to the low tariff rates , imports had increased while economic development and exports had been circumscribed by , in addition to other causes , exogenous factors including the restrictive policy of other countries coupled with the sluggish and diminished flow of both private and official funds .  
The Court of Appeal further stressed that the contract had been concluded between a seller with its place of business in France and a buyer resident in Portugal , that France was a State Party to CISG whereas Portugal had neither signed nor ratified it , and that it was therefore necessary to ascertain whether CISG was applicable through the provisions of private international law ( art . 1 ( 1 ) ( b ) ) .  
Concerned about continuing deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers involved in Operation Lifeline Sudan and international private voluntary agencies ,  
The representatives of the broadcasters - both private and public - who attended the event discussed at length the increasing impact television has on decision-making by alerting world attention to international conflicts and threats to peace and security and its potential role in sharpening the focus on other major issues , including economic , social and cultural issues , and in promoting understanding among peoples .  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation and follow-up of the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas ;

Nevertheless , the legal institution of reservations may well have to be reassessed in the light of the particular nature of human rights treaties ; this results from their specific object , which is to provide maximum protection for individuals victimized not only by their own Governments but also at the hands of private parties , from their recognition in international and regional jurisprudence as establishing non-reciprocal and objective obligations , and from the existence of treaty monitoring bodies .  
Recognizing the need to promote social responsibility and appropriate standards of ethics on the part of private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals engaged in international commercial transactions , inter alia , through observance of the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business , and taking into account the impact of their activities on economic and social development and environmental protection ,

Notes that while sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country to promote macroeconomic stability are essential elements for determining the volume and structure of private capital flows , international macroeconomic policies play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness , and should contribute to creating a favourable international economic environment ;  
During that event , more than 140 leading media figures from around the globe , representing more than 50 countries , had discussed the growing significance of television in the changing contemporary world , the opportunities offered by the current technological revolution in communications , which vastly increased the possibilities of cultural exchange , the role of both private and public broadcasters in providing information on global events and the strengthening of the partnership between the United Nations system and the international media .  
During the Forum , broadcasters from both the public and private sectors had supported the idea of establishing an annual World Television Day , to be celebrated each 21 November by global exchanges of television programmes focusing in particular on such issues as peace and security , economic and social development and the enhancement of cultural exchanges .  
Encouraged national authorities to consider the need to enhance capacities in all relevant sectors , including [ public , private ] [ the public and private sectors , indigenous peoples , local communities ] and non-governmental sectors , [ effectively and in a coordinated manner , ] taking into account the role played by each of the interested parties in the [ sustainable development ] [ management , conservation and sustainable development of all types ] of forests , in order to achieve country-led design and implementation of NFPs .  
The Panel recommended that indigenous people , forest owners , forest dwellers and local communities should be enabled to play a [ key ] role in [ defining ] participatory [ approaches to forest and land-use management ] [ approaches to sustainable forest management and land-use planning ] [ with the involvement of ] [ together with ] all interested relevant parties from both public and private sectors , and with greater focus on resource management , land-use systems and conflict resolution . 
The Panel recognized that there is a need to promote new and innovative forms of finance and [ combine ] [ complement ] [ facilitate ] all forms of finance , at the public , private , international , domestic and local levels and to combine them with existing ones , as well as to ensure the predictability and continuity of flow of financial resources .  
Invited [ [ UNDP and the World Bank to take the lead ] [ the Bretton Woods institutions ] , together with other ] relevant international organizations , to further explore [ innovative ways to use existing financial mechanisms more effectively and ] [ possibilities ] to generate additional forest-specific public and private financial resources at [ the domestic as well as at ] the international level .  
BAKER ( Israel ) shared the view expressed by the Commission as to the difficulty of distinguishing between codification and progressive development of international law , especially in an era in which the development of international law took place in specialized spheres through the activities of various institutions , the regionalization of the handling of specific issues and an increase in law-making bodies , whether private or official , formal or informal .  
The special session of the General Assembly for the purpose of an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 would have a major impact on environmental conservation and preservation and required the support of both the developed and the developing countries , the United Nations system and civil society , especially non-governmental organizations and the private sector . 
Topics that should be included in the discussions of the special session of the General Assembly included : international cooperation in the area of finance and technology ; consideration of the crucial role of the private sector with a view to proposing initiatives for stimulating private investment in sustainable development projects ; relationship between production and energy consumption and the interaction between energy and atmosphere ; international discussions on forests ; the challenge of urbanization ; and the strengthened role of the Commission on Sustainable Development as a political forum .  
Stresses the need for all countries to develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
Endorses Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 48 of 26 July 1996 on new and innovative ideas for generating funds , in which , inter alia , the Council decided that funds generated by new and innovative ideas should not substitute for official development assistance , that they should be distinct from funding the regular budget and the peacekeeping budget of the United Nations , and should be part of global partnership and interdependence and that the role of private investment in financing development should be stressed ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 5 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
In its deliberations , the Commission noted the interest that BOT and other forms of private participation in public infrastructure projects had raised in many States , in particular in developing countries , as the successful implementation of such projects would enable States to achieve significant savings in public expenditure and to re-allocate resources that otherwise would have been invested in infrastructure in order to meet more pressing social needs .  
These actors include international and regional intergovernmental organizations ; individual States ; parliamentarians ; non-governmental organizations from the local to the global levels ; and private actors such as legal professionals , the media , academics , private institutions and civic associations , including ethnic , cultural and religious groups .  
This will not only require a society of States committed to democratic principles and processes ; it will also demand an enlarged international civil society deeply involved in democratic institutions , whether State , inter-State or supra-State , private or quasi-private ; committed to democratic practices , procedures and political pluralism ; and composed of peoples ingrained with those habits of openness , fairness and tolerance that have been associated with democracy since ancient times . 
Moreover , " international relations " - not relations among nations but relations among sovereign States - are increasingly shaped not only by the States themselves but also by an expanding array of non-State actors on the " international " scene , ranging all the way from individual persons to civic associations , non-governmental organizations , local authorities , private multinational business , academia , the media , parliamentarians and regional and international intergovernmental organizations .  
A development agent and a positive factor for social integration within and among States , the private business sector - especially transnational business - must be recognized as an integral player in international organization and more closely involved in international decision-making .  
The same can be said of the pioneering efforts under way towards linking international organizations , both governmental and non-governmental , with national and private multinational banks in order to provide the funds and services which small and medium-sized entrepreneurs in transitional and developing countries require for sustainable development activities .  
Among the issues that remain to be solved are the privatization of parts of the public rental housing stock , meeting the cost of renovation of private homes in mixed-ownership buildings , the future role of private rental housing , strengthening of market-type financial institutions in the housing sector and the introduction of legal and financial elements of real estate renting .  
To address the situation , the Government is planning a number of measures , which include a review of the distribution of responsibilities in housing affairs in the public sector ; limiting public agencies ' construction activities to essential needs ; developing a viable approach to improving the housing conditions of low income citizens ; and mobilizing private capital into housing . 
The Government 's overall objectives for housing have been set out in a White Paper entitled " Our Future Homes " ( 1995 ) and these include increasing the number of owner-occupied homes , reducing significantly the population of homes lying vacant and transforming the remaining large-scale , poor quality public estates through public and private sector partnership . 
The White Paper also sets out the role of the central Government in providing the right conditions for public and private investment through management of the overall economy and local authorities will be encouraged to take a strategic enabling approach in respect of all housing tenures and a reduced role as landlords .  
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
The State has the overall responsibility in various areas , including , inter alia , social , economic and environmental policy formulation , and for creating an enabling environment for the private sector ; the State should encourage effective participation by the private sector and major groups in activities which complement and reinforce national objectives .  
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development will be undertaken .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods , the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework . 
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to this Agenda .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
To transform the Gambia into a financial centre , a tourist paradise , a trading export-oriented agricultural and manufacturing nation , thriving on free market policies and a vibrant private sector , sustained by a well-educated , trained , skilled , healthy , self-reliant and enterprising population , and guaranteeing a well-balanced ecosystem and a decent standard of living for one and all , under a system of government based on the consent of the citizenry .  
Governance is effective only where three key elements the State , the private sector and civil society function in partnership in creating the political , economic and social conditions which are conducive to ensuring sustainable human development .  
It highlights the dynamics of the market system and the effective coordination among basic economic actors in the framework of the system , with the State as the guiding and organizing power , the private sector as the prime catalyst of the capital market and the civil sector as the receiving body which is passively or positively influenced by the programmes .  
This is not to mention bolstering the role of institutions and charitable organizations , notably the Zayed charitable organization and the Red Crescent , as well as other organizations , aimed at helping them achieve their humanitarian objectives for the purpose of mobilizing local efforts in the public and private sectors , and meeting appeals to meet human needs and emergency demands in parts of the world that have been affected or are impoverished .  
In another context , and at the level of the private sector , Egyptian businessmen have not held back initiating a number of economic projects with their Palestinian counterparts designed to enhance the efficiency of the Palestinian economy and save it from the consequences of the destructive closures imposed on it at random by Israel .  
Central importance should be assigned to employment in the formulation and implementation of economic and social policies , with the understanding that the public sector , private sector , cooperatives and civil society have a shared interest in and responsibility for employment , and that the achievement of full employment should be a permanent goal for all of them .  
The Commission calls upon Governments and the international community to seek to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and to use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including on concessional and grant terms .  
UNHCR notes that involvement of local rather than international non-governmental organizations is likely to provide a closer link with the private sector at the country level and with institutions of civil society , such as voluntary agencies , human rights groups , cultural and academic associations , churches and other religious bodies , and refugee community groups .  
With regard to measures adopted for ethnic minorities and other social groups , these are designed , inter alia , to guarantee to indigenous and tribal peoples and to ethnic minorities especially favourable treatment as regards access to educational facilities and employment in the public or private sector .  
Under international humanitarian law applicable in international armed conflicts , in particular article 123 of the Third and article 140 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 , this Geneva-based organization is the principal agency authorized to collect all the information it can obtain through official or private channels concerning prisoners of war and protected civilians .  
States should enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , that will ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
About one quarter of the Governments , including 33 per cent of the developed and 21 per cent of the developing countries , have produced national directories of public and private organizations concerned with ageing and / or services and opportunities for the aged . 
Until waste management authorities overcome these institutional shortcomings and develop a more flexible management structure , responsive to the needs of public , private and community sectors , isolated schemes will remain good examples of " best practice demonstrations " and will not be incorporated into the overall waste management system .  
Among the challenges faced by Turkey in achieving women 's equality , the representative identified the disparities in status and opportunities for urban middle-class and rural women ; violence against women in the private domain ; a strengthening of the contribution of the media to the advancement of women , including through an increase in the number of female professionals in this area ; and the revision of educational materials , which continued to portray women in their traditional roles as mothers and wives .  
Bridging the data gap will require a strategy of more widespread participation in data collection and assessment , bringing together Governments , scientists , non-governmental organizations , the private sector ( including industry ) , local authorities , and even the general public in coherent efforts to document key issues and trends as a basis for management decisions at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
Law 70 / 95 has a wide and generalized range of application , since it is applicable , with no distinction , to any computerized filing system or data bank , both private and public , owned by either a physical or legal person ( art .  1 ) .  
Anyone who without just cause reveals the contents of the documents mentioned in the preceding article ( whether public or private ) , which have been brought to his knowledge by the means defined therein or by other unlawful means , shall be punished by a term of three months ' ordinary imprisonment to three years ' rigorous imprisonment .  
The World Bank has estimated that electric power delivered to end-users equals only about 40 per cent of installed capacity in developing countries , compared to over 80 per cent of installed capacity in developed countries . 19 Establishing the principle of full ( or nearly full ) cost-recovery would permit much greater recourse to foreign financing as bond financing for either public or private national enterprises operating on fully commercial principles within an adequate regulatory environment . 
According to ICC , the private sector 's priorities for the next phase include increasing use of multilateral arrangements to resolve transboundary environmental issues ( instead of unilateral approaches ) ; incentive-based approaches , such as joint implementation ; greater involvement of business and industry in multilateral agreements and organizations through innovative consultative mechanisms ; and a more prominent role for international environmental technical and management standards and voluntary codes , as complements to regulatory frameworks .  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas , and in that process to emphasize the need to integrate the gender perspective ;  
Replace the existing text with the following : 3 .  To re-examining , with a view to denying it in countries which do not already do so , the tax deductibility of bribes , paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a member State to any public official of another country , in accordance with the basic principles of its legal order ;  
In this connection , the Parsi minority is one of the most active and prosperous in India , both in the economic field as well as in terms of private school establishments , and also one of those that attaches the greatest importance to maintaining itself as a specific and distinct ethnic and religious community .  
Theft of and illicit trafficking in motor vehicles had become another activity of organized crime that employed methods such as corruption of public officials and bribery in the private sector , thereby undermining both democratic and economic institutions .  
However , the ever-growing demand on the United Nations human rights programme to engage in such areas as confidence _ building measures , technical cooperation , education , monitoring , etc . makes it indispensable to establish an adequate and reliable mix of regular budget resources and voluntary contributions from Governments and private entities .  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
Stresses the need for all countries to develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
Endorses Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 48 of 26 July 1996 on new and innovative ideas for generating funds , in which , inter alia , the Council decided that funds generated by new and innovative ideas should not substitute for official development assistance , that they should be distinct from funding the regular budget and the peacekeeping budget of the United Nations , and should be part of global partnership and interdependence and that the role of private investment in financing development should be stressed ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 5 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
This programme is designed to enhance effective and efficient management capacities for the public and private sectors in the context of a market economy and a democratic society ; and initiate a programme of support to the Palestinian Authority in the area of governance and public administration with the overall aim of strengthening and improving its institutional capacity .  
They include : a Swedish firm with a successful record of restructuring private companies , which helped in the design and start-up of the overall change process , and whose former chief executive officer continues to advise UNDP 2001 ; a Canadian expert on change management ; an American expert on public sector change ; and a leading information technology management group from the United States .  
Concerned about continuing deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers involved in Operation Lifeline Sudan and with international private voluntary agencies ,  
The new technologies may be destroying more jobs than they create ; there is a great risk that they will in fact widen the gap between rich and poor ; and the huge capital investments required to strengthen national capabilities to produce and use ICTs may divert both public and private resources from other activities which could have greater development impact .  
Another proposal was that a definition should be based on the elements of a certificate contained in the note by the Secretariat , which referred to the certificate as being an electronic record that listed a public key together with the name of the certificate subscriber as the subject of the certificate , and confirmed that the prospective signer identified in the certificate held the corresponding private key ( A / CN . 9 / WG.IV / WP . 71 , para .  36 ) .  
It was generally felt that it would be of little avail for the purpose of protecting the end-users to require the certification authority to follow adequate procedures for establishing the accuracy of the information , or properly identifying the holders of private keys , and at the same time to allow the certification authority to avoid liability by issuing certificates that fell below the minimum level of information required to be contained in a certificate .  
Despite the concomitant increase in private capital flows , which have been concentrated in a relatively few countries , ODA remains an essential element for sustainable development , especially in least developed and other vulnerable countries , and the commitments for new and additional resources should therefore be met .  
That new capital is envisaged to come from a redirection of private capital from mature markets to markets with new absorptive capacity created for sustainable development ; from the removal of existing subsidies ; from domestic savings ; from debt-relief ; and from public monies , including increased ODA . Efforts should be made to provide the necessary flexibility to allow those reallocations to take place naturally in response to incentives . 
While some requested an improvement in quality in public rather than private schools , maintaining free public education at the primary level , others favoured a more liberal policy environment with competition between the private and public sector .  
It reiterated the need for external support through ODA and the provision of new and additional financial resources , and emphasized the need to mobilize new , innovative and additional forms of finance at the public , private , international , domestic and local levels .  
Altogether , the new directions report contains 20 major recommendations that touch on other issues such as the formulation of national TCDC policies , the strengthening of national TCDC focal points , the reorientation of capacity and needs matching exercises , the promotion of " triangular cooperation " , the establishment of improved linkages with the private sector and non-governmental organizations , and the identification of new funding arrangements for TCDC , including the formulation of subject-specific TCDC " products " that could attract special funding on the basis of their intrinsic importance .  
Commenting on the secretariat report ( TD / B / COM . 1 / 2 ) , he was of the view that it did not analyse sufficiently the existing global economic environment which , in many respects , was inimical to development , given persistent debt burdens , declining ODA , uneven private investment flows , and overly cautious deflationary policies of developed countries .  
Early implementation of key public investments would result not only in increased aggregate demand , employment and incomes , but in a recovery of private investment - an essential factor for a more sustained , self-reliant economic growth and significantly improved security .  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development _ oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and highly _ indebted countries ,  
In addition , these factors illustrate the need to exploit the potentially mutually supportive role of the public and private sectors and the importance of the current work under GATS on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications .  12 .  Trade in the health service sector also demonstrates the extremely vulnerable position of poorer , especially least developed countries , which on the one hand suffer from a " brain drain " and on the other do not have access to advanced technologies .  
Multilateral and bilateral donors , Governments and the private sector should increase support to non-governmental organizations , particularly to women 's organizations , in playing an active role in advocacy for the implementation of Agenda 21 at the international and national levels , particularly in supporting national policies and programmes for sustainable development in the developing countries .  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti _ discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Their economic and social achievements have raised their international credit standing to such a degree that it induces very substantial private investment and financial flows .  
Also , more effective use will be made of policy seminars , conferences and training workshops addressed to specific development issues , bringing together senior national policy makers and representatives of civil society and the private sector and facilitating a shared understanding of the development challenges that African countries face and the policy options that are available .  
The entities within the United Nations system have an important role to play in developing a reference framework for the energy-related activities of the United Nations system based on a common understanding of a sustainable energy future , and thereby providing synergies to the activities . 3 Such a framework would promote a balanced and mutually reinforcing approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of sustainable energy development and foster partnerships for sustainable energy development with relevant actors outside the United Nations system , particularly with non-United Nations intergovernmental organizations dealing with energy and the private sector . 
Serve as a mobilizer of ideas and a catalyst for action to identify and promote new policy options at the national , subregional and regional levels for the removal of constraints on the economic and social development efforts of these countries , with emphasis on the adoption of measures for increased mobilization of domestic and foreign resources , trade and private sector development , public sector reform , and provision of economic advice , on request , to Governments with limited internal capacity .  
While the international law of human rights is , indeed , addressed to the behaviour of States and deals with acts or omissions of government officials 18 / or their agents , modern developments of international humanitarian law , 19 / recent authoritative pronouncements such as indicated in the introductory section of this working paper , 20 / and a respectable body of theory 21 / tend to embrace elements leading to some modification of the traditional position that private individuals or groups are not capable of violating human rights .  
All these elements should , in fact , be sought out and thoroughly explored in order to assess objectively whether ( and , eventually , to what extent ) international human rights law is moving beyond the traditional dichotomy of individual versus State , beyond the duty of States to respect and ensure the observance of human rights , and towards the creation of obligations applicable also to private individuals and other non _ State actors , including liberation movements and terrorist organizations .  
In any event , the conditions under which social services are provided must be determined by the State and reflect the rights of citizens , not simply be the result of a private contractual relation between individuals and private firms .  30 .  The State must reclaim the central role in the formulation of public policies , which it sometimes has lost to the private sector and international financial institutions .  
The European Union proposed that the objective would be to focus on strengthening partnership for development and finding new balances in development cooperation ( for instance between multilateral and bilateral cooperation ; between the role of Governments , private sector and civil society ; between capacity building and other forms of cooperation ) by analysing and drawing lessons from changes in the international and national contexts which are relevant for development cooperation .  
The planning and implementation of national reconstruction and development have continued during the period under review in accordance with the national objectives and following the strategic options taken by the Government a few years ago : development of basic infrastructure and public services infrastructure ; creation and strengthening of legal frameworks , in particular for private sector development ; and rehabilitation and development of institutional frameworks .  
The follow _ up process has engaged the national authorities at the highest level through a number of initiatives towards friendly countries and international institutions as well as the private sector ; these have involved traditional western and Arab donors , but also countries such as Brazil , the Republic of Korea , Malaysia , and Eastern European countries . 
The need for such volunteer effort is greater today than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse or HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of society , given the concern of the international community for the eradication of poverty and given the contemporary trend for civil society , in partnership with Governments and the private sector , to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process .  
Convinced that the need for volunteer effort is greater than ever , in light of the adverse impact of such global problems as environmental degradation , poverty , drug abuse and HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of societies , and of the trend for civil society , in partnership with government and the private sector , to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process ,  
The vulnerability of the Palestinian economy to the interaction of such factors has been compounded by a range of inherent weaknesses coupled with the absence of an adequate regulatory and institutional framework at the public and private sector levels .  
Some progress has been made by the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) since 1995 with regard to drafting essential legal instruments governing economic activity in areas such as private investment , enterprise activity , banking , public finance , industrial zones , standards and safety , civil service and intellectual property .  
These include weak domestic employment capacity , uneven sectoral growth , weak intersectoral articulation , severe marketing bottlenecks , poorly coordinated and fragmented new investments in both public and private ventures and structural imbalances among macroeconomic aggregates .  
The study deals with : a review of major recent developments affecting private investment , including the regulatory framework , policy environment , trade and financial regimes and their recent performance ; an examination of the main supportive capacities and services important for private investment ; analysis of the scale , composition and impact of private investment in the economy ; and , prospects and policy options relevant to the future direction and magnitude of private investment in the Palestinian territory .  
These include the existence of a properly functioning banking system with the ability to mobilize an adequate level of domestic savings ; a legal system that protects private property ; the existence of company laws that allow multiple ownership as a precondition for share ownership by the public ; and the freedom of foreign investors to own domestic assets in clearly specified sectors of the economy .  
The idea was also raised that building up a domestic institutional investor base could help provide additional local private demand for marketable securities .  
As they moved along the path of reform , their objectives became more complex and ambitious , shifting from the limited concerns of macroeconomic imbalances and stabilization to the promotion of development by a plethora of market-oriented reforms , including the improvement of economic efficiency , curbing of public sector intervention , encouragement of the private sector and liberalization of the external trade sector .  
For example , consider the launching of programmes by Governments , United Nations agencies and other international organizations , and major groups , on which consensus was developed by IPF ; consider appropriate mechanisms for the mobilization of institutional , human and financial resources and capacity-building ; and encourage the development of voluntary codes of conduct for the private sector ;  
Consider the feasibility of establishing an international fund to support activities for sustainable forest management ; and explore innovative ways both to use existing financial mechanisms more effectively and to generate new and additional public and private financial resources ;  
Whenever health supplies received under resolution 986 ( 1995 ) are sold through private sector pharmacies , equitable distribution requires uniform and transparent pricing that is not excessive in comparison with fees levied in public pharmacies , valid medical prescription and guarantees that the use of private sector pharmacies does not unduly disadvantage those who can not afford to purchase the drugs they require .  
The Expert Meeting welcomed the initiative of the UNCTAD secretariat in arranging for the participation of a substantial number of actors from the business community in its deliberations , and encouraged UNCTAD to continue to involve private sector representatives in its future dialogues and to facilitate contacts and promote interaction among business people .  1 .  The Expert Meeting observed that the growth of international food trade had been high , at almost 7 per cent a year during the previous 10 years , not much lower than that of trade in manufactured goods .  
About 30 needs assessment / diagnostic missions , on request , on programme design and project formulation on governance ; civil service reform ; human resource management and development ; information technology for public management ; local governance ; decentralization ; post-conflict rehabilitation ; budgeting and budgetary systems ; mobilization of internal and external resources ; financial management capacities ; tax reforms and tax administration ; the role of the State and private sector in development ; and the peace-development link ; ( ii ) Seminars and workshops . 
To establish conditions that help the private sector to be competitive in the emerging global economy , the Governments of new or restored democracies should provide a predictable legal framework , control of corruption , high quality public service and a supportive environment .  
Attention is drawn to the definition of violence against women contained in article 1 of the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women ( General Assembly resolution 48 / 104 ) : [ A ] ny act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm and suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life .  
One State19 reported that legislative amendments had been made to allow for proper control over foreign entertainers , while another20 noted that women migrant workers in the private sector were provided with the same rights as male migrant workers , as well as additional benefits , such as maternity leave and child protection .  
Encourages relevant United Nations funds and programmes and specialized agencies , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to support local , national and international programmes and projects for the Year and also encourages them , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , as well as international financial institutions , to ensure that the concerns and contributions of older persons are integrated into their development programmes ;  
There has been a sizeable expansion of private flows of financial resources from developed to a limited number of developing countries and , in a number of countries , efforts have been made in support of domestic resource mobilization , including the increasing use of economic instruments to promote sustainable development .  
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , official development assistance remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
The creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
The effort of the international community should be aimed at encouraging the emergence of pluralist political forces supported by a civil society that is aware of its basic rights and on a private sector that is both dynamic and entrepreneurial .  
At the national level , there are three major types of private actors involved in capital market operations : security exchanges ( the parallel and the over-the-counter markets ) ; domestic custody , settlement and clearing institutions ; and listed companies and brokers .  
As indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on sources for the financing of development ( see A / 52 / 399 ) , there has been a shift in the composition of financial flows to developing countries from public to private sector sources , with the latter now accounting for an overwhelming share of the total ( albeit not for all individual countries ) .  This situation is unlikely to be reversed in the foreseeable future .  
In addition to the services provided at the primary level , UNRWA aims , in principle , at providing essential in-patient medical services to the refugee population at its own facilities , at local contracted hospitals or through partial reimbursement of costs incurred by refugees for treatment at government or private hospitals .  
The Special Representative notes that in the past , senior officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran have attempted to distinguish between the act of private worship , which is permitted , and more public acts such as teaching , forming assemblies and working with the administration of the Baha'i community , which were forbidden on the grounds that those were hostile and conspiratorial acts that were criminal in nature .  
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies in each country for promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
The State has the overall responsibility in various areas , including social , economic and environmental policy formulation , and for creating an enabling environment for the private sector ; the State should encourage effective participation by the private sector and major groups in activities that complement and reinforce national objectives .  
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , will be undertaken so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods and the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework . 
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to the Agenda .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
At that time , the restructuring process was fully under way in both the private and public sectors , with the addition of new technologies and production , distribution and marketing processes , a significant increase in productivity resulting from the stability and with a change in the previous economy 's suffocating rules of the game , such as the cheapening of capital goods and the disappearance of inflation as an instantaneous means of relaxing labour costs .  
Within the context of increased financial flows to developing countries and the continuing surge in foreign direct investment , equity and bonds , he noted with optimism the rapid turnaround in private sector financial flows to Mexico and Argentina after the crisis of 1995 and the modest private sector flows to Africa .  
Development called for the private sector to act as the engine of sustained economic growth , in partnership with the public sector , which played a crucial role in basic infrastructure and services and in establishing and maintaining sound macroeconomic policies , protecting human rights and the environment and creating a conducive legal environment for private investment and entrepreneurship .  
The role of private capital should be considered in a comprehensive and objective manner , bearing in mind that while it represented a positive aspect at the global level , many developing countries , especially African and least developed countries , had failed to benefit sufficiently from it .  
In order for developing countries to be able to attract private capital flows , they must maintain good governance , sound macroeconomic policies and close , cooperative working relations with international financial organizations .  
The articles in the four publications covered a wide spectrum of issues , including the critical role of the informal sector in the development of indigenous industrial capabilities ; the development of international competitiveness ; the private sector and entrepreneurship development ; privatization in Africa ; the Uruguay Round Agreements and implications for African industry ; and the current status of African metallurgy industries and prospects for the year 2000 .  
Further , implementation strategies advocated were not adopted at the country level , the nascent African private sector was not fully prepared to assume the new responsibilities in the industrial investment process and financial support , including term lending , from both domestic and foreign sources was not readily available for industrial projects .  
The speaker said that significant changes would be required in order to increase the flow of FDI to a meaningful size in areas such as governance , development of an enabling policy environment and sustained policy reforms , and an improved partnership between the public and private sectors .  
The results had been reduced government expenditure , improved economic administration , a stabilized Yemeni rial , promotion of private sector activities , enactment of transparent investment and trade policies , agricultural privatization , giving priority to technical education and starting the implementation of a social security system .  
While there was no simple solution to pursuing development goals in an increasingly competitive and globalized world and even though economic growth was not automatic , notable strides had been made by those who embraced credible macro-economic settings ; those who addressed the social dimension of development in tandem with the pursuit of economic growth ; those who fostered domestic private sector development ; and those who pursued representative , open and accountable governance .  
The needs of the audiovisual library may be included in the annual circular note of the Secretary-General requesting financial assistance for different components of the Programme as one of the items for which States , their institutions or private individuals may wish to make voluntary contributions in monetary terms or in kind ( tapes , equipment , etc . ) .  
There might , however , be specific situations in which the adoption of a separate competition policy would be accorded a lower priority : in some economies , particularly small economies , competition from imports and from foreign firms might be sufficient to minimize the possibilities for restrictive business practices by private firms , while in other economies , lack of resources and human resources for effective implementation of competition law might limit the ability to adopt a competition policy , at least in the immediate future .  
A regional network and national networks of institutions concerned with decentralization will be created in at least 12 countries ; an open information system in the Internet connected to a UNDP global Management Development and Governance Division programme called MAGNET will support the networks and will provide access to a wide range of actors ( local governments , NGOs and private sector organizations ) .  
The objective in this thematic area is to provide Arab societies with additional capacity for pro-poor strategy , policy and programme development and implementation by increasing their ability to effectively formulate pro-poor policies and programmes and enhancing the performance of institutions ( public , private , civil society ) that deal with services for social development and especially for poverty eradication .  
The objective of programming in this area is to increase understanding of the socio-economic determinants of the HIV epidemic at a policy level , among Governments , and in the private sector and civil society , resulting in policies and programmes to promote an improved and effective response to the epidemic .  
He underscored the importance of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries and said that additional resources were needed in support of such cooperation from the United Nations system , international financial institutions and other public and private sources .  
Although the commercial private sector and non-profit civil society provided a volume of investment and development activities which dwarfed the financial flows channelled through the United Nations , the vast majority of speakers in the plenary meetings of the General Assembly as well as in the Second Committee had reinforced the central role of the United Nations in development cooperation .  
Joint ventures , often utilizing extrabudgetary funds , have been organized with influential media organizations , leaders of civil society , intellectual and educational groups , the business community , appropriate private enterprises and relevant governmental institutions .  
Calls upon all countries to develop economic policies that promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 7 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Among the cross-cutting development constraints hampering the private sector were an ineffective or shallow financial sector ; lack of a legal and regulatory system ; weak infrastructure ; obsolete technology , poor on - and off-farm storage facilities , high taxation , and generally inadequate support services ; an inadequate policy framework ; an inefficient and overly dominant public enterprise sector ; misdirected development assistance ; high transaction costs ; and lack of trust in the interaction between the Government and the private sector .  
The Commission considers that the work undertaken by the UNCTAD secretariat in demonstrating to international private investors that micro finance represents an important potential market for investment , and UNCTADs efforts in creating and enhancing awareness among member States of the enabling environment for micro finance institutions , should be pursued in close cooperation with the competent bodies of the United Nations and other international organizations in this field , including existing national initiatives .  
Expressing its concern that a number of developing countries , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , have become more vulnerable to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate of private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
The main objective of the Symposium was to provide an opportunity for representatives of space industry and the private sector to interact with international space scientists , space technology experts and policy makers from developing and developed countries and to explore possibilities for increased scientific and technical cooperation .  
Stressing , given the fact that much of the most advanced environmentally sound technology is developed and held by the private sector , that the creation of an enabling environment on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private-sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries , as affirmed by the General Assembly in paragraph 90 of the annex to its resolution S / 19-2 of 28 June 1997 ,  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access , and recognizing the need for African countries to use both human and financial resources more effectively in the process of industrialization ,  
Requests the United Nations Industrial Development Organization , the Economic Commission for Africa and other relevant United Nations organizations , in accordance with their agreed mandates , work programmes and priorities , to work closely with Governments and the private sector in Africa at the national , regional and international levels to foster industrial production and development ;  
Recognizing the sovereign right of each State to decide on the development of its private and public sectors , taking into account the comparative advantages of each sector , bearing in mind the economic , social and cultural diversity in the world ,  
It emphasizes promoting healthy habits in schools ; rekindling the commitment of local governmental units , non-governmental organizations , and the private and public sectors to make lodging facilities , food establishments and marketplaces more sanitary and healthful ; and promoting healthy workplaces , non-polluting vehicles and clean and sanitary streets .  
It was reported that , unlike traditional publicly funded projects , in which the Government was responsible for the entire implementation of the project , including for obtaining financing and guaranteeing its repayment , in the case of privately financed infrastructure projects the Government engaged a private entity to develop , maintain and operate an infrastructure facility in exchange for the right to charge a price , either to the public or to the Government , for the use of the facility or the services or goods it generated .  
In its deliberations , the Commission noted the interest that various forms of private participation in public infrastructure projects had raised in many States , in particular in developing countries , as the successful implementation of such projects would enable States to achieve significant savings in public expenditure and to reallocate the resources that otherwise would have been invested in infrastructure in order to meet more pressing social needs .  
Invites Governments to consider , where appropriate , including in their delegations to future sessions of the Commission on Human Settlements , in accordance with the specific conditions of each country , representatives of local authorities and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector , non-governmental organizations and research organizations in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Barbados is improving living conditions by revitalizing the main town centres , developing systems of physical planning and coastal management , and promoting partnerships between the public and private sector , disposing of waste and extending water resources .  
Among the issues that remain to be solved are the privatization of parts of the public rental housing stock , meeting the cost of renovation of private homes in mixed-ownership buildings , the future role of private rental housing , strengthening of market-type financial institutions in the housing sector and the introduction of legal and financial elements of real estate renting .  
Modalities for cooperation between the public and private sectors are being developed and the construction industry is reorganizing itself to meet the changing demands of large and complex redevelopment projects , involving mixed uses and integrated infrastructure and finance mechanisms . 
To address the situation , the Government is planning a number of measures , which include reviewing the distribution of responsibilities in housing affairs in the public sector ; limiting public agencies ' construction activities to essential needs ; developing a viable approach to improving the housing conditions of low income citizens ; and mobilizing private capital into housing . 
The Government 's overall objectives for housing have been set out in a White Paper , entitled " Our future homes " ( 1995 ) and these include increasing the number of owner-occupied homes , reducing significantly the population of homes lying vacant and transforming the remaining large-scale , poor quality public estates through public and private sector partnership . 
The White Paper also sets out the role of the central Government in providing the right conditions for public and private investment through management of the overall economy , and local authorities will be encouraged to take a strategic enabling approach in respect of all housing tenures and a reduced role as landlords .  
The key elements for attaining sustainable economic development are a sound policy framework that encourages stable growth , a vigorous private sector , the strengthening of institutional and legal foundations and , last but not least , good-governance and anti-corruption measures .  
We must mobilize the dynamic private sector , together with bilateral and multilateral official development assistance to secure sustainable growth and poverty reduction in developing countries .  
In the area of macroeconomic policy , we have proceeded to liberalize the trade and exchange regimes to foster enhanced competitiveness ; streamline the incentive framework ; privatize State-owned enterprises to promote increasing levels of private investment ; promote entrepreneurial activity through , among other measures , a venture capital regime ; and to modernize and strengthen intellectual property legislation to encourage investment and the transfer of technology .  
There is absolutely no doubt that increased international assistance and initiatives for debt relief or cancellation , increased official development assistance to meet agreed targets , private capital flows , increased foreign direct investment , and improved terms of trade would play a catalytic role in Africa 's efforts to achieve economic development .  
In addition , even though the Government is divesting itself of some of its holdings and encouraging greater private investment in vital services and commodities , there are some areas , particularly those surrounding technology , in which the Government has to remain directly involved and catalytic ; it will continue with its practice of seeking consensus on determining key industries and activities crucial and critical for development . 
Like other members , I noted with particular interest that President Clinton first at the Waldorf Astoria hotel on the evening of 21 September , then the following day in this Hall forcefully and germanely stressed the need for the United Nations to ensure that the globalization of the economy does not create deep disparities between rich and poor and that it establishes innovative partnerships between the private sector , non-governmental organizations and international financial institutions .  
The objectives are the following : the continuation and consolidation of the process of democratizing political and social life ; the increased participation of the citizens in political , economic and social life and in making decisions that concern them ; the establishment of sound rules of government ; the promotion of the private sector ; the development of human resources ; and the restoration and safeguarding of environmental equilibrium and of the ecosystem , with special attention being paid to environmental problems related to human activities .  
A growing number of countries on our continent , including my own country , Ethiopia , have taken decisive measures to liberalize their economies , to cut Government spending , to institute sound macroeconomic policies and to enhance the role of the private sector and civil society .  
In this regard , our objectives are to correct the economic , financial and structural imbalances ; to achieve steadiness and stability in the economy as a whole ; to activate the role of the private sector in the competitive free-market economy ; to achieve sustainable development ; to foster stable environments so as to attract foreign investments ; to upgrade the basic necessary services of society ; and to build the new State and improve the standards of living of all citizens .  
As it was agreed that for most developing countries official development assistance is still a main source of external development financing and can not generally be replaced by private capital inflows , I should like to urge the donor community to intensify efforts to reverse the declining trend in official development assistance as we experience it today .  
The Commission , which at its thirty-fifth session considered the question of employment and sustainable livelihoods , reached certain agreed conclusions that have as their goal productive employment ; decreasing unemployment through improved social services , such as education and health care ; giving loans to the private sector in both urban and rural areas ; and improving information and guidance services .  
The international economic system must be overhauled to enhance the trade prospects of the poor countries and to facilitate their access to science and technology , technical assistance and increased financial flows , both private and official .  
We share the views of the representative of the Getty Information Institute on the need to rely on some standardized , basic method of exchanging information on stolen cultural property and on the importance of having precise information about such property , as well as the conclusion that only through closer cooperation between private organizations and the public sector , at both the national and the international level , will we be able to curb this illicit traffic . 
The level of private capital flows to emerging markets is likely to increase further in the future , in part due to increasing pressure on pension funds and other institutional investors to diversify their investments and to the efforts of many developing countries to attract additional foreign investment .  
In the face of the increasing power of private global actors to determine the distribution of income and production and the content of economic and social policies , outside the political process , it is important to broaden participation in decision-making and to strengthen political accountability by means of increased transparency of decision-making in existing regional and international institutions . 
In their efforts to attract foreign private investment , many Governments are fearful of the consequences of raising direct taxes ; in the short term at least , low rates of taxation or tax relief seem an obvious and quick way of attracting capital .  
Volatile financial flows not only pose threats to the solvency of national financial institutions , whether public or private but also have the potential to destabilize the international financial system , given the increasingly integrated nature of world capital markets .  
When resources of the central government are insufficient to meet the needs for public services and infrastructure , local authorities and non-governmental organizations can play an important role in raising resources , providing services , strengthening rural / urban linkages , stimulating private investment , and implementing national policies .  
In the face of the economic slowdown in Western Europe , and thus the slower growth of exports to the main foreign markets of these countries , aggregate demand was boosted by strong private consumption , made possible by rising real wages , and increased investment .  
However , the political will to promote these fundamental changes is still not evident , and most of the effort remains on technical fixes related to more efficient vehicles and not on a major shift from private to public transport systems .  
Clearing arrears and establishing a sustainable debt-servicing position create an opportunity which , combined with structural adjustment and official financial support , can promote foreign and private investment and , thus , economic growth .  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Cooperation and corporate responsibility of the private sector in acknowledging and addressing public concerns over unintended consequences of technological applications , including biotechnology , are essential for the success of economic and financial policies of Governments , including the implementation of transparent EIAs on proposed projects .  * The report was prepared by the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , as task manger for chapter 15 of Agenda 21 , in accordance with arrangements agreed to by the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development ( IACSD ) .  
Accordingly , the need to safeguard private investment through strong intellectual property regimes must be compensated by workable arrangements that ensure equitable sharing of socio-economic benefits with the developing world .  
In following up its implementation at the national level , the establishment of a participatory mechanism facilitating effective and constructive interaction between the private and public institutions ( industry associations , United Nations and other international bodies , non-governmental organizations etc . ) aimed at considering controversial issues and resolving conflicts of interest will be useful .  Such mechanism may have a profound effect in assuring public confidence and providing useful inputs , inter alia , to the Commission on Sustainable Development , the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and other international forums .  
Governments as enabling partners should create and strengthen effective partnerships with women , youth , the elderly , persons with disabilities , vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities , local authorities , the private sector and non-governmental organizations in each country .  
Nevertheless , the conclusions and recommendations of international experts have regularly emphasized that while private flows are a necessary condition for sustainable development they are not sufficient , because first , most of the poorest countries do not obtain substantial amounts of private capital , and second , sustainable development requires some types of social and environmental investments that do not attract private capital .  
Developing countries are concerned that private capital flows are concentrated in a few developing countries ( 12 countries accounted for about 80 per cent of total private flows and three quarters of FDI in developing countries during the first half of the 1990s ) , mostly middle-income countries in Asia ( which accounted for about two thirds of the expansion of total private flows ) and Latin America that have adopted outward-looking strategies and sound macroeconomic policies .  
If undertaken on the basis of an integrated and participatory approach - with the Governments as the formulators and enforcers of economic and legal policies , non-governmental organizations and the scientific community as the environmental agencies that know the most about the resilience and carrying capacity of the Earth , and the private sector as the prime mover for technological development , transfer and diffusion - TNAs can contribute to policy integration by making both public and private decision makers more aware of the environmental consequences of their actions .  
Public-private partnerships are being implemented that try to link the advantages of private sector companies - access to finance and technology , managerial efficiency , entrepreneurial experiences and engineering expertise , the capacity for producing technological innovations - with the social responsibility , environmental awareness-raising , scientific research and job generation functions of local or national Governments .  
Although no concrete data are available , there is overall recognition that the level of technology and technology-related investments from public and private sources in developed countries directed to developing countries has not , in general , been realized as envisaged at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development .  
The predominant role of the private sector in the transfer and diffusion of ESTs and , more importantly , its leading function in the transition to cleaner production , have increased the private sector 's responsibility for ensuring that technology-related investments and industrial and business operations are consistent with community requirements for sustainable lifestyles and environmental protection .  
Commenting on the secretariat report ( TD / B / COM . 1 / 2 ) , he was of the view that it did not analyse sufficiently the existing global economic environment which , in many respects , was inimical to development , given persistent debt burdens , declining ODA , uneven private investment flows , and overly cautious deflationary policies of developed countries .  
Security at the office in Kigali was lax in the extreme ; private security officers did not check identifications ; they were observed sleeping at their posts and were not supervised by international staff on nights and weekends ; pass procedures were so poor as to be non-existent ; the front desk and front gate were observed unattended , with the gate and front door wide open .  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
These include not only technological progress , but also political , social and structural changes around the world and their impact on the liberalization of telecommunication services , the introduction of non-GSO satellite systems for commercial communications , growing market orientation , the change in the way this widening market is shared between private and public service providers and the general globalization and commercialization of communication systems .  
What is required fundamentally is a different perspective that integrates the micro and macro , bridges the public and private domains ( especially the productive and reproductive spheres ) and empowers different sectors of society , including both women and men to be effective in environmental decision-making .  
In connection with item 3 of the provisional agenda , and in accordance with paragraph 4 of its agreed conclusions on enterprise development strategy ( see annex I ) , the Commission decided to convene an expert meeting on The respective roles of government and the private sector , including NGOs , and the interactions between them in creating a coherent policy framework and setting up effective support measures and structures for the development of SMEs and micro-enterprises , in particular those in least developed countries .  
This role was manifested at two levels : at the macro level in terms of creating an enabling environment , good macroeconomic policies , a sound legal , regulatory and tax framework and political stability ; and at the micro level inter alia through providing appropriate support measures and structures and investing in capacity _ building , including in the areas of education , training and health .  It could create an environment in which the private sector knew what was happening .  
However , while macroeconomic stabilization was a necessary but not sufficient condition for enterprise development , structural adjustment and liberalization measures had produced encouraging positive results such as the emergence of an enterprise culture and increased entrepreneurial activities to take advantage of the enlarged economic opportunities for the private sector arising from such measures .  
Its President 's statement to the Special Rapporteur , the documentation he turned over and his account of the company 's background in the countries where it has concluded specialized service contracts offer an alternate way of looking at things in which military sciences are likely to be taken out of the State context and to move into the private sector where they offer skilled professional services in a free and global market .  
Even though it is more complete than article 47 of Additional Protocol I , it does not differ much from that text as far as the definition of a mercenary is concerned and it lends itself to different and perhaps contradictory interpretations , when it is States themselves that , on the initiative of their Governments , hire private firms to perform services connected with public order and security . 
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Recognizing the need to promote social responsibility and appropriate standards of ethics on the part of private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals engaged in international commercial transactions , inter alia , through observance of the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business , and taking into account the impact of their activities on economic and social development and environmental protection ,  
To take effective and concrete action to combat all forms of corruption , bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions , in particular to pursue effective enforcement of existing laws prohibiting bribery in international commercial transactions , to encourage the adoption of laws for those purposes where they do not exist , and to call upon private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals within their jurisdiction engaged in international commercial transactions to promote the objectives of the present Declaration ;  
To deny , in countries that do not already do so , the tax deductibility of bribes paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a State to any public official or elected representative of another country and , to that end , to examine their respective modalities for doing so ;  
Despite abject poverty in the slums surrounding the cities , living conditions are still considered preferable to those in rural areas , particularly with regard to access to water and the availability of basic services , such as health and education , as well as access to markets , which provides opportunities in the private sector .  
That included all violent acts against female victims that resulted in , or could result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , as well as threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivations of liberty , whether occurring in public or private life .  
Encourages relevant United Nations funds and programmes and the specialized agencies , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to support local , national , and international programmes and projects for the Year , and also encourages them , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , as well as the international financial institutions , to ensure that the concerns and contributions of older persons are integrated into their development programmes ;  
Central importance should be assigned to employment in the formulation and implementation of economic and social policies , with the understanding that the public sector , the private sector , cooperatives and the civil society have a shared interest in and responsibility for employment , and that the achievement of full employment should be a permanent goal for all of them .  
Although increased private flows have led to investments in industry and technology in some developing countries and economies in transition , many other developing countries have been left behind , slowing the process of technological change in those countries and limiting their ability to meet their commitments under Agenda 21 and other international agreements .  
Therefore , at both the national and international levels , further work should be undertaken on the design of appropriate policies for attracting private foreign capital , in particular foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , reducing its volatility , and enhancing its contribution to sustainable development , for example by promoting innovative schemes , such as co-financing and " green " credit lines and investment funds .  
Multilateral and bilateral donors , Governments and the private sector should increase support to non-governmental organizations , particularly to women 's organizations , in playing an active role in advocacy for the implementation of Agenda 21 at the international and national levels , particularly in supporting national policies and programmes for sustainable development in the developing countries .  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti _ discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Governments have moved to accord high priority to child survival and health ; the work of non-governmental organizations and of the private sector has expanded ; community participation has increased , and families have been empowered by gaining greater knowledge and skills about utilizing low-cost , easily available life-saving technologies for their children ; bilateral and multilateral agencies have mobilized greater resources for child survival and health interventions ; and immunization , nutrition and reproductive health programmes have expanded .  
Invites Governments to consider , where appropriate , including in their delegations to future sessions of the Commission , in accordance with the specific conditions of each country , representatives of local authorities and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector , non-governmental organizations and research organizations , in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Another school of thought , while recognizing the responsibility of the State to protect those living in its territory , held that the international community should also hold private individuals who perpetrated violence accountable , under the Protocols additional to the Geneva Conventions , especially Protocol II , and that ethical and legal position had been gaining ground . 
Recognizing the sovereign right of each State to decide on the development of its private and public sectors , taking into account the comparative advantages of each sector , bearing in mind the economic , social and cultural diversity in the world ,  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access , and recognizing the need for African countries to use both human and financial resources more effectively in the process of industrialization ,  
Requests the United Nations Industrial Development Organization , the Economic Commission for Africa and other relevant United Nations organizations , in accordance with their agreed mandates , work programmes and priorities , to work closely with Governments and the private sector in Africa at the national , regional and international levels to foster industrial production and development ;  
It also needs to be emphasized that , unlike the western European countries in the late 1940s and 1950s which benefited from Marshall aid and other official support for financing their current account deficits over a number of years and thus sustaining growth and reconstruction , the transition economies are largely dependent on private financial flows which are much more nervous and fickle than official commitments .  
The stated goals of the Centre are " to assist Governments in policy and strategy formulation to improve the living conditions of people in their communities by expanding access to adequate shelter , infrastructure and services for all . . . and to strengthen the capacity of national Governments and local authorities to mobilize public and private resources and to improve urban environmental conditions and productivity " .  
In fact , the team did not come across any system to assess organizational performance in Habitat 's two basic goals , namely , that of assisting Governments in policy and strategy formulation to improve the living conditions of people in their communities and that of strengthening the capacity of national Governments and local authorities to mobilize public and private resources to improve urban environmental conditions and productivity .  
While the private sector is the " engine of development " , the Government has to lay and maintain the " tracks " that is , create and maintain the legal and regulatory environment for private ownership and fair competition , correct appropriately for market failures , protect the disadvantaged and maintain economic stability , law and order .  
The paper is divided into four main sections , which deal respectively with increasing opportunities in the private sector , the business-enabling environment , promotion of competition and social regulation , and a final section which briefly touches on the role of the international community with regard to the foregoing .  
Where there is insufficient competition , the government may divide the work ( e.g . geographically ) between outside contractors and inside workforces , as is done for instance by the city of Bogota , Colombia , where solid waste collection is shared between public and private agencies , with a private firm made responsible for monitoring the operations of all the agencies . 2 Continued government provision of at least part of the service provides in-house knowledge of costs and technology changes and thereby some protection against inflated contracts ; 
There are a number of situations in which partnership between public and private sector institutions is the most efficient and effective mechanism , due to the presence of mutually reinforcing goals - which in the final analysis converge towards an equitable and sustainable economic development of the country - and to the complementarity of capacities and roles .  
Through these novel modalities , the advantages of the private sector - dynamism , access to finance , knowledge of technologies , managerial efficiency , entrepreneurial spirit - are combined with the social responsibility , network of contacts , environmental awareness , local knowledge , and job generation concerns of the public sector . 
Typically , the EMPRETEC business support centres established in each country are active coalitions of public institutions , private business associations , national and foreign companies , and multilateral organizations , led by National Executive Committees comprising high-level public officials , entrepreneurs ' representatives and prominent business leaders from local and multinational companies operating in the country .  
The twelfth Meeting of Experts on Public Administration and Finance ( see A / 50 / 525-E / 1995 / 122 ) recommended that the United Nations Programme help governments define the role and scope of the public , mixed and private sectors and to suggest options in the modalities of interaction in accordance with the practical realities in each country , especially at the local and municipal levels , by means of specific technical assistance , dissemination and exchange of country experience and research on the conditions for successful replication .  
The documents were distributed in provisional form , starting in early 1995 , and comments were invited and received through an extensive review process involving experts from governments , sister UN agencies , development banks , selected centres of excellence , NGOs , the private sector , and eminent persons , among others .  
Such violations shall include , but not be limited to , murder , ill _ treatment or deportation to slave labour or for any other purpose of civilian population of or in occupied territory , murder or ill _ treatment of prisoners of war or persons on the seas , killing of hostages , plunder of public or private property , wanton destruction of cities , towns or villages , or devastation not justified by military necessity ;  
In the case of UNDP , non-core resources are constituted by funds contributed by governmental or private sources and intended for specific purposes , i.e . , identified projects or programmes , or assistance within geographic or thematic areas .  
In the mid-1990s , private flows have been exceeding official sources : ODA has shrunk to an all time low of 0.27 per cent of GNP , and a growing portion is going to meet humanitarian needs ( rising from US $ 1-billion in 1990 to US $ 3-billion in 1993 , peaking in 1994 ) and debt relief .  
Eight workshops on enhancing policy analysis capacity in African public services ; developing standards and indicators for better civil service performance ; strengthening the leadership and the managerial and technical capacities of local government ; formulation of policies and measures to foster small enterprises and micro-enterprises ; and investment promotion centres and private sector development in Africa ; ( i ) Advisory services .  
The Ministerial Council reaffirmed its absolute and unwavering belief in Iraq 's obligation to comply with all the relevant Security Council resolutions , in particular those pertaining to the release of Kuwaiti and third-country prisoners and detainees ; cooperate fully with the Special Commission in its investigation of Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction ; return all public and private property to Kuwait ; continue to comply fully with the compensation mechanism ; and refrain from all hostile or provocative acts directed against Kuwait and neighbouring States , pursuant to resolution 949 ( 1994 ) .  
The Council may urge that structural reforms aimed at establishing a competitive domestic financial system , privatization and / or restructuring of public enterprises continue to be implemented in order to enhance the efficient allocation of resources and support private sector development ; such reforms are also expected to boost domestic savings and investment and thereby contribute to higher economic growth .  
Among the contributing factors to this surge in private flows are the high growth rates experienced by many developing countries , the spread of market reforms and , in particular , the deregulation of private capital flows , the liberalization of world trade , the rise of global institutional investors and the accelerating capitalization of emerging markets and their integration into world financial markets .  
While Governments may have assisted in making globalization possible by reducing legal and administrative barriers to flows between countries and regions , the main actors in the process have been mostly private enterprises , largely based in developed countries , although , in recent years , enterprises from newly industrialized countries have become active in other developing countries .  
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
The State has the overall responsibility in various areas , including , inter alia , social , economic and environmental policy formulation , and for creating an enabling environment for the private sector ; the State should encourage effective participation by the private sector and major groups in activities which complement and reinforce national objectives .  
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development will be undertaken .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods , the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework . 
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to this Agenda .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
The importance of the national professional project personnel as the major source of expertise for technical cooperation projects has increased steadily in recent years because of their crucial advantages in transferring national private sector expertise to public institutions , using national talent that could be lost through the brain-drain and cultural compatibility with national work environment .  
The Task Force is focusing on country-level follow-up , and at its most recent meeting , the Chairperson emphasized that special attention should be focused on developing partnerships with non-governmental organizations , the private sector and civil society in assisting countries in achieving the goals agreed to at the recent United Nations global conferences .  
Among the challenges faced by Turkey in achieving women 's equality , the representative identified the disparities in status and opportunities for urban middle-class and rural women ; violence against women in the private domain ; a strengthening of the contribution of the media to the advancement of women , including through an increase in the number of female professionals in this area ; and the revision of educational materials , which continued to portray women in their traditional roles as mothers and wives .  
While it is not for the Government itself to build or finance the housing units required to satisfy all of the demand in the country , it should make every effort to ensure that a fair share of the resources available is utilized for making low _ cost housing available to the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sectors of society , and enabling the private sector to contribute to that endeavour .  
Governments should focus on being enabling partners and facilitators by creating and strengthening effective partnerships with a broad spectrum of national and grass-roots groups including local authorities , the private sector , non-governmental organizations , women 's and youth groups and the scientific and academic communities .  
There has been a sizeable expansion of private flows of financial resources from developed to a limited number of developing countries and , in a number of countries , efforts have been made in support of domestic resource mobilization , including the increasing use of economic instruments to promote sustainable development .  
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , ODA remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
The creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
It was agreed at Rio that the developed countries were to bring the level of their official development assistance to the nominal level of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and that sufficient resources were to be mobilized by each country and by the international community , including both the public and private sectors , for the survival of our planet Earth .  
Except for two years since Rio , Zambia has been unable to register positive growth in its gross domestic product , despite my Government \ x { e5b8 } very determined effort to put in place comprehensive reform measures in the private and public sectors .  
Regarding the national plan , I must stress that it was developed through a participatory approach involving international donors , public administrations , academic and scientific research institutions , the private sector , local communities , non-governmental organizations and professional organizations .  
The sustainable management of natural resources , the combatting of pollution and environmental degradation , the development of human resources through the implementation of a population policy , education and health , regional integration , the creation of productive jobs in rural areas and through the development of the private sector in order to eradicate poverty all these represent the strategic framework which will make it possible to ensure human sustainable development in our country .  
Therefore , Member States , the developed nations in particular , international development organizations and the private sector must fulfil the commitments they undertook in Rio , especially in terms of the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the provision of financial and technical resources , with a view to creating an equitable , fair and just international economic and social environment that would ensure the incorporation of the efforts of the developing countries into the implementation of the overall strategies of sustainable development and environmental protection .  
This part of the study , which deals solely with economic , social and cultural rights , concerns all current or recent violations of those rights and of so _ called collective rights such as the right to development and the right to a healthy environment , irrespective of their perpetrators , whether States or their agents , groups of States , national or international private organizations or individuals or groups acting outside the competence of the State .  
Measures adopted for ethnic minorities and other social groups , are designed , inter alia , to guarantee to indigenous and tribal peoples and to ethnic minorities especially favourable treatment as regards access to educational facilities and employment in the public or private sector .  
Convinced that the need for volunteer effort is greater than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse and HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of societies , and the contemporary trend for civil society _ in partnership with Government and the private sector _ to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process ,  
Noting that the appointment of a special rapporteur had now become advisable , Ms . Palley drew the attention of the working group to five issues : the legality of privatization under international human rights law ; the extent of delegation of duties possible under privatization ; the question of whether United Nations standards must be further developed ; the minimum safeguards required ; the most appropriate human rights monitoring method for private prisons .  
This section analyses provisions on financial transfers and mechanisms in recent MEAs ( in particular provisions on " compliance assistance " contained in the Montreal Protocol , the CBD and the FCCC ) , as well as other ways of generating new public and private financial resources to assist developing countries in promoting sustainable development and more particularly in tackling global environmental problems .  
Clear examples and opportunities exist for providing benefits to source countries as well as indigenous and local communities in terms of health improvement , resource management capacity , and sustainable use of natural resources .  The key to its success will be in the ability to provide near - and long-term benefits that effect changes in the behaviour of individuals , communities and private companies , as well as in natural resource policies of both developed and developing country governments .  
Where developing countries have been watchful of the cost of incentives and applied them within an outward-oriented approach , microeconomic measures addressing specific supply constraints have helped build supply capabilities which the private sector could not have accomplished as rapidly by itself . \ x { ffff } seq level0 \ * arabic \ x { ffff } 24 \ x { ffff } .  
The Programme believed that the international capital markets and the private sector played a vital role in the promotion of sustainable energy concepts , since total private sector investments in energy far outweighed all flows of official development assistance to the sector .  
Furthermore , irrational phenomena still existed in the world economic system which were hampering the development efforts of developing countries , including the stagnation of international cooperation in such areas as finance , debt , trade and the transfer of technology ; the protectionism still practised by some of the major developed countries in international trade and economic activities ; and the emphasis placed by those countries on the role of private capital and market mechanisms , while minimizing the responsibility of their Governments to meet their commitments with regard to official development assistance .  
A common vision had developed that sound financial and economic policies , including development of human resources and respect for human rights , good governance , individual initiative and the private sector , were critical to creating an environment conducive to economic growth , environmental sustainability and social equity .  
For the first time , more than half the gross domestic product had been generated by the private sector , and more favourable conditions for national and foreign investors had been created through the ongoing privatization process , the completion of the first phase of financial stabilization , the gradual liberalization of domestic and foreign trade and the introduction of a new national currency .  
Even though participants in the Conference had included the main representatives of the public , private and community sectors involved in the development of human settlements , the appeal which had been made at the Conference could not bear fruit without assistance and cooperation at the national level and , in particular , without the solidarity and effective and timely delivery of international contributions .  
As indicated in paragraphs 7 to 10 of that report , over the past few years , increasingly large amounts of private capital had moved from developed countries to a number of developing countries in Asia , Latin America and the Middle East ; while such inflows had generally promoted economic growth , they had sometimes generated inflationary pressures and , in some instances , sudden capital outflows as a result of a loss of confidence by investors .  
The situation was particularly difficult for the developing countries since the liberalization of their foreign transactions made them increasingly vulnerable to the unpredictable fluctuations of private capital flows in the international financial markets .  
Despite the decisive role of domestic policy in respect of the influx of private capital , it was essential to take measures at the international level to ensure the effectiveness of domestic reforms ; in that respect it should be recalled that , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 50 / 91 , cooperation and coordination must be broadened among interested countries and the Bretton Woods institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries .  
Although Nicaragua had been able to make progress in solving the problem of the external debt , through the cooperation of the international community and friendly countries , such as the Russian Federation , which had recently announced the cancellation of the debt balance , the external debt was still a very heavy burden which impeded economic growth and inhibited public and private investment .  
The Platform for Action adopted at the Conference was established as a powerful tool for the empowerment of women , aimed at removing all the obstacles to womens active participation in public and private life by promoting their full and equal participation in economic , social , cultural and political decision-making processes .  
For example , financial contributions to relevant multilateral institutions and programmes were often not reported , many national communications provided limited detail on bilateral programmes related to the implementation of the Convention , and there was little discussion of transfer of technology through the private sector . 
Experts identified five main areas of potential policy incoherence : between macroeconomic policy and microeconomic policy ; between public and private sector bodies involved in SME support services ; between the federal and local levels ; between implementation and design ; and between internal and external policies .  
Three main types of credit funds have been established in the Russian Federation , namely ( i ) those co-financed by national and international private investors , ( ii ) federally funded schemes and ( iii ) micro-credit schemes .  
There might , however , be specific situations in which the adoption of a separate competition policy would be accorded a lower priority : in some economies , particularly small economies , competition from imports and from foreign firms might be sufficient to minimize the possibilities for restrictive business practices by private firms , while in other economies , lack of resources and human resources for effective implementation of competition law might limit the ability to adopt a competition policy , at least in the immediate future .  
It must be mentioned , however , that even when Trade Points have not been prevented from operating in the private sector , they sometimes had to face an unfriendly environment : since one of the most immediate practical impacts of Trade Points is to diminish the importance of intermediaries by bringing local enterprises a step closer to their markets and their customers and suppliers , Trade Points sometimes had to face direct or indirect opposition from such intermediaries ; this opposition should not be expected to diminish in the future .  
The international conferences of the 1990s recognized the crucial role of the private sector , together with other actors of civil society , in achieving goals of economic , social and environmentally sound development .  
To achieve successful sales of public enterprises to the private sector , it is necessary to have a strong legislative framework , a high degree of capital market development and , in many cases , sufficient persons with the capacity and integrity to develop an effective regulatory system .  
The major issues addressed included providing an enabling environment for conversion at both national and local levels ; the role of public and private sectors ; conversion of military bases and defence industries to export processing zones ; tourism development in former military bases and defence complexes ; civilian manufacturing , prospects for small and medium-sized enterprise development ; and continuity of social infrastructure services .  
After years of living under centrally planned regimes where the private sector hardly existed as in the countries of eastern and central Europe and the former Soviet Union most fledgling entrepreneurs lacked financial and business experience and the facilities were not available for them to start operating .  
When the provision of such vital services as telecommunications , electricity supply , railways , freight transport , fuel distribution and so forth are acquired by private owners , whether through the acquisition of a State monopoly by a single large private corporation or through a widely distributed share ownership , it is appropriate that the Government set up an independent and effective regulatory body to look after consumer interests and wider national and environmental concerns .  
Any balanced approach to development must take into account current economic , political and technological realities , especially the increasing influence of the private sector , which played a catalytic role in Malaysias economic growth .  
The drug dimension was incorporated with UNDCP assistance into mainstream national health , education , social welfare , critical poverty and rural development programmes , by elaborating new drug-control partnerships with sectoral ministries , relevant United Nations organizations , international financial institutions , non-governmental organizations , private industry and other partners .  
Further indicators include a net increase in the following : the number of coca-farming families assisted by national agencies and committed to the elimination of their coca crops ; geographic coverage and number of hectares devoted to alternative development ; the use of central , regional and local entities for alternative development planning and implementation ; private investment in alternative development activities ; the donor base and the value of alternative development activities coordinated by agencies .  
Yet the attainment of a proper mix of distributive and redistributive policies is important , because private initiative , although crucial , is not sufficient for the achievement of an equitable and prosperous society .  
It also emphasized the need to introduce a wide range of policy , legal , regulatory and institutional reforms which provide the private sector with a more favourable and competitive business environment .  
They should pursue sound macroeconomic policies , strive to increase domestic savings and investment , strengthen institutional , legal , regulatory and supervisory capacities and improve economic management in the public and private sectors .  
Assistance to Governments , at their request , in creating an enabling institutional and legislative environment for the effective contribution of public and private utilities to the provision of water supply and sanitation to urban and rural communities .  
The Special Rapporteur was also informed of the existence of commercial sexual exploitation of children , through loosely organized networks , in rich , private houses known as Mbwa kali , which refers to the Beware of fierce dog signs posted outside the gates .  
These institutions succeeded where traditional public programmes failed , and she supported UNCTADs initiative aimed at creating an essential direct link between private investors and micro finance institutions in developing countries . 
The project focuses on the nature of the private investment decisions of southern European manufacturing firms required to incorporate technological change in the transition to sustained and competitive growth in the single European market .  
Partnerships between the public and private sectors , which are becoming common in many developing countries , ensure that essential skills and theory acquired through formal education are complemented by enterprise-based practical training .  
Although his Government had been successful in attracting private capital through a policy of privatization and facilitating foreign investment , financial flows to developing countries were determined largely by the major industrialized States .  
At the national level , over the past 10 years , his Government had substantially increased domestic resources for development financing , but it continued to need external resources , both private and official , in order to sustain current growth rates .  
Thirdly , the real capacity of the private sector to provide resources that were predictable , continuous , assured , universal , neutral and commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries had to be ascertained .  
Furthermore , the distribution of private financial flows to the developing countries had remained highly uneven , so that the rapid growth of foreign direct investment did not represent a growing benefit for all the developing countries .  
The Government 's annual budget , however , contained no direct allocations to medical or pharmaceutical research , which was funded by various public and private agencies .  
Its objective is twofold : ( a ) to assess how to enhance national capacities to manage private capital , both domestic and foreign , in least developed countries and ( b ) to search for feasible ways and means of facilitating private investment in support of SHD .  
This is the concern of everyone , ranging from the communities where such diseases are endemic to the public , private and voluntary sectors at national and international level .  
A well developed financial sector is critical in stimulating private domestic savings and investment in Africa to achieve sustained economic growth and development .  
Still other cooperative mechanisms , such as the WMO World Weather Watch programme , support the coordination of global scientific activity for prompt and accurate weather information and other services for public , private and commercial use .  
However , to mobilize private investors , a legislative and regulatory framework will have to be established that is stable , predictable and transparent , making it possible for rational economic decisions to be taken .  
During the first half of the year , the region was receiving substantial private credit inflows on a net basis , continuing a trend that had started in 1996 owing to low international interest rates and improving growth prospects .  
It includes citizen initiative and participation , the sharing of responsibility between the central State authorities and autonomous State or private bodies , incentives to creativity and responses based very clearly on the specific needs of vulnerable groups .  
The second stage would focus on major structural transformations of the national economy by promoting domestic production , thereby creating further opportunities for private business and favourable conditions for sustainable economic growth .  
It was also essential to promote an enabling international economic environment which ensured a minimum of stability to counter adverse effects arising from sudden movements in private capital flows .  
The Committee decided that in the future it would meet in private half an hour before starting consideration of a country report , in order to pinpoint the main problems to be addressed during public discussion .  
By supporting democratically accountable local governments , UNCDF has demonstrated that civil society can be empowered and the local private sector stimulated to participate in poverty reduction .  
The least developed countries had received only a tiny portion of foreign direct investment in developing countries , which underscored the need to mobilize private capital for the least developed countries at a time when ODA continued to decline .  
Despite the increasing role of private capital in development , official development assistance still played a critical and catalytic role in facilitating the development of the least developed countries .  
A critical element is the availability of public resources to finance and support publicly provided services and to stimulate and complement private and voluntary provision , as appropriate , and their more effective and efficient use to meet stated objectives .  
Regretting that the financial markets have exhibited extreme volatility , which has resulted in higher interest rate spreads and a sharp decline in private capital flows to developing countries , leading to a significant slowdown in economic activity ,  
Sound macroeconomic policies and a legal and economic framework that enhanced the growth of a dynamic private sector were seen as essential in improving countries capacity to trade .  
The Bretton Woods institutions play a central role in supporting the national authorities in public policymaking and in private sector development ; the World Bank is a major financing source , active in all key sectors of the recovery programme .  
In its preliminary conclusions and recommendations , the paper stated that human rights education , with special emphasis on racial discrimination , should not be confined to public and private schools and universities .  
Full-scale effort to reform regulatory , procedural and managerial systems at a regional or subregional level requires effective institutional support arrangements and trained manpower at both the government and private sector levels .  
The gap between the official and unofficial exchange rates continued to widen , discouraging domestic production and leading to a situation whereby foreign currency is used side by side with the national one , in both official and private transactions .  
The high level of unhedged private external debt made the option of devaluing the baht a painful choice that was avoided until foreign exchange reserves had been nearly exhausted in defending the exchange rate .  
It also emphasized the need to introduce a wide range of policy , legal , regulatory and institutional reforms which would provide the private sector with a more favourable and competitive business environment .  
At the same time , higher and specialized secondary medical teaching institutions , both State-owned and private , are being certified and accredited by an ad hoc commission established by joint order of the Ministries of Health and Education .  
Regretting that the financial markets have exhibited extreme volatility , which has resulted in higher interest rate spreads and a sharp decline in private capital flows to developing countries , leading to a significant slowdown in economic activity ,  
It is the task of the national statistical system to make available to government , the public and the private sector relevant and reliable statistical information for economic , social , cultural and environmental developments in a country ;  
A sound financial sector , good governance , broad-based social investments , respect for human rights , and transparency in both the public and private sector were factors at the national level conducive to economic and social growth and development .  
Before the crisis , economic orthodoxy had held that a current account deficit was acceptable and sustainable if it stemmed from investment as opposed to consumption and if it was a result of private sector activities .  
Under green aid , we would utilize official development assistance and private financial resources to cope with the issues of energy and global warming and promote cooperation with developing countries through the development of human resources .  
In the ensuing discussion , delegations focused on the following key issues : the biennial support budget ; the level of the operational reserve ; funds from private foundations ; the national execution modality ; and unpaid contributions .  
As reported in this year 's Trade and Development Report , there is ample evidence to show that Africa 's external debt burden is in fact having a severe adverse effect on both public and private investment and renewed growth .  
The development process requires a united vision if it is to be sustainable , and it requires joint responsibility on the part of the public and the private sectors to ensure continuity combined with the political stability that strengthens democratic governance .  
Recognizing that the implementation of the Platform for Action rests primarily at the national level , that Governments , non-governmental organizations and public and private institutions should be involved in the implementation process and that national mechanisms also have an essential role in this regard , and bearing in mind that enhanced national efforts and international cooperation are essential for the effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and the Platform for Action ,  
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
The current financial crisis , caused by massive inflows of private capital and their sudden reversal , had , however , forced the Committee to view the implications of private capital flows into developing countries from a completely different perspective .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
Additional information is needed on approaches that can be used to devise markets for forest products , and the role of the public and private sector in assuring that new or expanded markets are consistent with the social , economic and ecological components of sustainable forest management .  
Such issues as trade , market access and transparency , and economic , environmental and social policies which directly or indirectly affect the forest sector , as well as governance and corruption , private investment , financial resources and transfer of technology , need to be addressed in an integrated manner to achieve efficiency and effective results . 
Whatever the outcome on public funding arrangements , the essential role of the private sector in the productive , entrepreneurial aspects of sustainable forest management needs to be recognized , reinforced and promoted .  
This would be accomplished by capitalizing on existing and potential public and private-sector financial resources , primarily at the global level , with a specific view to leveraging higher levels of private sector finance .  
Financing of technology transfer and accompanying know-how and capacity-building through official development assistance ; multilateral technical assistance , public and private partnerships , joint ventures and foreign direct investments ;  
For that purpose , the Guide helps identify areas of law that are typically most relevant to private capital investment in public infrastructure projects and discusses the content of those laws which would be conducive to attracting private capital , national and foreign .  
Among the general factors are significant technological innovations ; high indebtedness and stringent budget constraints limiting the public sectors ability to meet increasing infrastructure needs ; the expansion of international and local capital markets , with a consequent improvement in access to private funding ; and an increasing number of successful international experiences with private participation and competition in infrastructure .  
With the withdrawal of the State from direct provision of housing or housing subsidies to the poor and the deregulation of the rental market , the poor are exploited by private property owners , often paying over half of their meagre income on rent .  
Based on past experience and the changes brought about by the rapid globalization of the economy , there had been a growing convergence of policies that encouraged investment in human resources and government responsibility in creating a dynamic domestic framework in which the private sector could play its role as the driving force of industrial development .  
Obviously , however , development of the private sector was impossible without support at the public level , which should include , inter alia , demonopolization , the introduction of tax incentives , a sound legal environment and the promotion of domestic and foreign investment .  
Discussions around financial resources in IPF and IFF have also included such issues as effective private sector involvement ; integration with national policies and priorities and effective coordination ; the application of economic instruments and tax policies ; the mobilization of national financial resources ; and the possibility of finding a mechanism to raise funds to establish a forest fund dedicated to support activities aimed at sustainable forest management .  
The Court has handed down two decisions on the matter : in one , it upheld the Departments power to refuse to renew private companies licences to deal in arms and ammunition but established that it could not restrict transactions covered by such licences prior to their cancellation ; in the other , it declared unconstitutional a Department directive restricting the purchase of ammunition .  
Therefore , private investors , national and foreign , bringing new or advanced technology into the host country or developing original solutions will need to be assured that their intellectual property rights will be protected and that they will be able to enforce those rights against infringements .  
An illegal act which violates human rights and which is initially not directly imputable to the State ( for example , because it is the act of a private person or because the person responsible has not been identified ) can lead to international responsibility of the State , not because of the act itself but because of the lack of due diligence to prevent the violation or to respond to it as required by the Convention .  
The Department of Social Affairs had also tried to reduce poverty by providing financial assistance to private institutions , food assistance to primary school children and children of poor families , financial and technical assistance to groups of poor families and other social welfare recipients undertaking economic activities , and by providing assistance to the children of the unemployed .  
UNIDO harnesses the joint forces of government and the private sector to foster competitive industrial production , develop international industrial partnerships and promote socially equitable and environmentally friendly industrial development .  UNIDO is the only worldwide organization dealing with industry from a development perspective .  
While other agencies had long faced problems in choosing legitimate or representative partners in the private sector , those partners were usually non-profit bodies , whereas working on operational projects with profit-seeking partners was clearly more problematic ; association with the United Nations could be interpreted as giving an unfair commercial advantage over its competitors , national and international . 
By the Governments decision , the National Council for Womens Affairs , headed by a Cabinet member , the Minister for Health and Social Welfare , was established at the end of 1996 , and its operational by-laws were accordingly adopted . the Council is made up of MPs , officials of ministries concerned , representatives of womens non-governmental organizations , voluntary movements , mass organizations , owners of private companies , business and cooperative entities . 
In particular , fast and balanced growth was urgently needed in the heavily indebted countries of sub-Saharan Africa , where the future of innumerable families was literally mortgaged in order to service loans from bilateral institutions , private banks and international organizations .  
The programme is aimed at families living on municipal , State _ owned or private land , involving negotiations between landowners , the community and the municipal government , or families who have been relocated , through the new organized settlements programme , to the above _ mentioned land because they had previously been living in high-risk areas , on rights of way , in ecological or archeological reserves or on private property .  
The programme is aimed at poor families living in minimal housing conditions and in high-risk areas , on rights of way , in ecological or archaeological reserves or on private property , persons over 18 years of age , and persons who belong to a family unit with an income of less than two monthly minimum wages when they can prove that the family has no assets and have expressed a desire to purchase a plot . 
at the national level , there are cases of discrimination against unmarried female pupils and teachers who , because of pregnancy , are expelled from private religious schools or , exceptionally , from State educational institutions on the ground that they may have a bad influence on other pupils .  
The global seed trade is dominated by large private industry giants whose vast economic power and commercial control over plant germplasm is beginning to overshadow the role of the public sector in plant breeding and other agricultural research in many countries .  
In some developing countries , a combination of weak or nonexistent policies on the one hand and the efforts of private firms on the other has already stimulated a shift from food production for subsistence for local communities to large-scale production of few crops and varieties for national and international markets , resulting in a loss of diversity .  
More generally , small island developing States believe that the potential for greater resource mobilization can be enhanced by more effective coordination on a number of fronts : at the national and regional levels , including a strengthened regional mechanism ; among donors , through more creative interaction with the private sector and NGOs ; and through the strengthening of focal points within the United Nations system , including the small island developing States Unit .  
With regard to the volatility of financial flows , he said that while the amount of those flows to the developing countries had increased from $ 100-billion in 1990 to over $ 250-billion in 1996 , they were composed almost entirely of private capital and were concentrated in a limited number of developing countries .  
Global financial integration had helped to generate a massive expansion of private capital flows to some developing countries , but also posed enormous challenges to national financial and banking systems in terms of ensuring the sustainability of those flows .  
In order to prepare for the high-level consideration of the topic of financing for development , it was important to focus on a number of key elements : States should begin with the mobilization of domestic resources , review the allocation of national expenditures and their fiscal priorities , look into the private sector and review their legal and administrative structures for rapid growth .  
The declining trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) and the increasingly frequent imposition of conditions of an economic and financial or a political , legal or humanitarian nature had forced many developing countries to resort to private capital flows , which had been concentrated in a small number of countries and had proved unstable and crisis-prone .  
The cantons were required to provide victims with access to independent public or private counselling centres whose task it was to offer medical , psychological , social , material and legal support and to give information on victim assistance .  
Hospitals , schools , factories , refugee accommodation centres , private houses and farms , food depots , landmarks of priceless cultural and spiritual value , industrial facilities , and public utility services , such as water supply systems , power plants and Post , Telephone and Telegraph communication centres , have been destroyed or severely damaged .  
More effective use will be made of policy seminars , conferences , and training workshops addressed to specific development issues , bringing together senior national policy makers and representatives of civil society and the private sector and facilitating a shared understanding of the development challenges that African countries face and the policy options that are available .  
Through information exchange with donors , regional groups , national committees , Governments and the corporate sector , ensuring that priorities of Governments are met by the UNEP programme of work and individual projects ; and organization of innovative fund raising from previously inadequately tapped sources , such as the private sector .  
Concerned States will be assisted to secure adequate financial and technical assistance and support for their alternative development programmes , particularly from the international financial institutions , non-governmental organizations , relevant United Nations organizations and the private sector .  
In view of the crisis with regard to private capital flows and the further decline in official development assistance ( ODA ) since 1997 , it will be necessary to again demonstrate that ODA is a main source of external funding for developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , and that the fulfilment of all financial commitments of Agenda 21 must be an integral part of the ODA reform discussion .  
As far as financing for the implementation of Agenda 21 from countries own public and private sectors is concerned , it may be useful to focus the discussion at the eighth session on the particular problems of developing countries in the current economic situation and continue the discussion held at previous sessions on new policy approaches in both developed and developing countries .  
While coherent and well-focused government efforts remain an integral element of social development framework , involvement of civil society and private sector proves to be highly beneficial for attaining both specific social targets and equitable development . 
The executive heads of organizations in the United Nations system outlined the elements of a shared strategy and committed themselves to the concerted effort by all agencies towards poverty eradication and also to playing a supportive and catalytic role in mobilizing the energies and resources of all development actors Governments , the private sector , civil society , donors and above all the poor themselves in the campaign against poverty .  
Crucial requirements are well known and include improving the access to and quality of primary , secondary , technical and vocational education ; improving marketing arrangements for primary commodities ; land reform ; mobilization of domestic saving for infrastructure including small scale , local public works and for private investment ; and attracting foreign direct investment under conditions that ensure benefits to the receiving countries .  
The goal of the partnership , which consists of Governments , UNAIDS co-sponsoring agencies , bilateral organizations , non-governmental organizations and the private sector , is to mobilize Governments and organizations of civil society to redirect and expand national and international political , programme and financial commitments and action to address the epidemic and its impact on life and the potential for socio-economic development in Africa .  
Sudden inflows and equally sudden outflows of foreign capital create considerable difficulties for the management of domestic monetary policy ; 27 the resulting uncertainty and higher risks implied by financial volatility lead to caution on the part of Governments ( which tend to set interest rates higher than they might otherwise have been ) and of private business ( faced with increased costs of capital and increased uncertainty over future demand ) .  
As the fallout from the initial financial crisis in Thailand enters its third year , weak international trade and the negligible improvement in private financial inflows mean that most developing and transition economies continue to face a tight external payments constraint .  
Requests the High Commissioner to set up a voluntary fund designed specifically to cover all aspects of the preparatory process for the Conference and the participation of non _ governmental organizations , especially from developing countries , and requests all Governments , international organizations , non _ governmental organizations and private individuals to contribute to this Fund ;  
On the basis of the reports prepared by the technical experts and attached to the documentation , which set forth the material damage sustained by public and private installations in the two aforementioned cities ;  
In other national laws a link is required between the property to be attached and the claim in that , for example , immunity can not be pleaded in respect of funds allocated for economic or commercial activity governed by private law upon which the claim is based or that immunity can not be pleaded with respect to assets set aside by the State to pursue its commercial activities .  
In the case of Yemen , UNDP supported the Government in consolidating the process of unification , reconciling the divergent administrative traditions , streamlining the machinery of the State through establishing a more manageable balance of responsibility and authority between the centre and the regions , and creating an enabling environment for civil society and the private sector . 
In the Asia and the Pacific region , while continuing its important partnership with the Governments of each country , UNDP formed strategic partnerships with civil society organizations , NGOs , women 's groups , trade organizations , the private sector , advocates for the environment and against child labour , politicians , parliamentarians , and poor urban and rural slum communities themselves .  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development _ oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily _ indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
Requests the High Commissioner to set up a voluntary fund designed specifically to cover all aspects of the preparatory process for the Conference and the participation of non _ governmental organizations , especially from developing countries , and requests all Governments , international organizations , non _ governmental organizations and private individuals to contribute to this Fund ;  
The new approach required that programmes be demand driven and consist of integrated services tailored to solve specific problems identified by clients in both the public and private sectors .  
Requests the Secretary-General to ensure broad professional and geographical participation at the workshop from , inter alia , policy advisers , law enforcement and prosecutorial authorities , judicial officers , academics , social workers , relevant United Nations bodies , including the United Nations Development Programme , relevant non-governmental organizations , members of the private security industry , the business community , the media , local government officials and crime prevention coordinators .  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .  
In this regard , it is instructive to note that the international organizations and public or private sector entities that have studied electronic commerce from a variety of perspectives have tended to focus on certain common elements that would be present in any favourable legal environment .  
In his seventh report , in response to various suggestions for dealing with the question of liability by giving greater weight to domestic or private law remedies , Barboza proposed that civil liability should be primary and State liability should be residual . 82 In this regard , State liability would only replace civil liability if the private person who is liable can not fully compensate the harm or if that person can not be identified or located . 
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .  
The proposed Convention would be built on the following main pillars : the creation of free trade zones , building on existing regional groups to facilitate the liberalization process , and the granting of special and differential treatment for the least developed ACP countries to facilitate their integration into the multilateral trading system , reinforce their institutional capacity and create a favourable policy framework to attract foreign investment and develop a dynamic private sector .  
In fulfilling its role as a catalyst of change , EBRD encourages co-financing and foreign direct investment from the private and public sectors , helps to mobilize domestic capital and provides technical cooperation in relevant areas .  
The general human rights climate has also been worsened by the accompanying wave of protests and demonstrations , some of them violent and destructive of private property , and by the heightened sense of insecurity springing from an increase in threats and acts of intimidation , and by the spates of armed crime , acts of violence and assassinations or attempted assassinations , some of them possibly politically motivated .  
The wording as it stood was unfortunate as it included no mention of compensation for expropriation , which in France was determined , after the administrative phase of the expropriation procedure had been carried out , in special court proceedings and subject to constitutional constraints whereby the judge was the guarantor of respect for private property rights .  
In its resolution S-20 / 4 , entitled Measures to enhance international cooperation to counter the world drug problem , the Assembly set out specific actions to be taken by Member States and by UNDCP and called for UNDCP to play a catalytic role in mobilizing international financial institutions , non-governmental organizations , United Nations organizations and the private sector for work on the drug problem and for assisting interested Governments .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
In 1995 , the national task force for children , a national coalition which included the public and private sectors , the relevant ministries , non-governmental organizations , international agencies and dedicated individuals , had been established by royal decree .  
In addition , a wealth of knowledge can be tapped through a participatory process and strategic partnerships forged at the common country assessment stage , not only among the United Nations system partners , including the Bretton Woods institutions , but foremost with relevant government entities , civil society , including NGOs , and the private sector , as well as other multilateral and bilateral development partners .  
Internal enabling environment : policy framework incentives for domestic private savings , equitable tax systems ( development and enforcement of ) , macroeconomic policies , disincentives to corruption ; good governance ; transparency ; effective regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector ; banking infrastructure , pension funds ; corporate governance ; internationally accepted accounting standards , and a sound legal system ( land and property rights ) ;  
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) : need to spread FDI more widely and to diversify private capital flows in order to reduce country / sector concentration , strengthened contribution of FDI for domestic capacity-building and national development goals , role of South-South flows , reasons for marginalization of countries with a sound investment environment ;  
Use of ODA for reinforcing developing countries potential for better access to global markets , and poverty eradication , leveraging larger levels of domestic or foreign private capital ;  
Need to tackle , where appropriate , bilateral , official , multilateral and private debt ( criteria for assessing extent of debt relief ; special issues of least developed countries / Africa / heavily indebted poor countries ; debt relief to provide lasting exit from debt problems , forgiving aid-related bilateral debt for least developed countries , need to improve creditworthiness , and the reduction of spreads in new lending ) ;  
To set up a voluntary fund designed to cover all aspects of the preparatory process for the World Conference and the participation of non-governmental organizations , especially from developing countries , and requested all Governments , international organizations , non-governmental organizations and private individuals to contribute to that Fund ;  
In late 1998 , the firm Veng S.A . was set up with the aim of developing new-generation space vehicles through unconventional mechanisms of financing by the private sector and scientific and technological bodies .  
Commends the ongoing efforts being made by national Governments and the international community to promote improved , expanded and diversified linkages with the private sector , non-governmental organizations and civil society ;  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
There has been a dramatic but uneven increase in the flow of private capital , particularly equity capital , to developing countries . 11 In order to alleviate the balance-of-payment and debt problems and to increase income , many developing countries have adopted investor friendly policies such as low or no corporate taxes , tax holidays , subsidies to investors , and privatization . 
Commends the ongoing efforts being made by national Governments and the international community to promote improved , expanded and diversified linkages with the private sector , non-governmental organizations and civil society ;  
Like previous regional urban forums , the Third Forum would include representatives of national and local governments , private sector businesses , civil society organizations , including NGOs , academic and training institutes , and the media .  
A number of constraints militating against the successful implementation of the recommendations of the Conference were also identified , including economic and financial constraints ; technical and institutional limitations ; poorly coordinated actions among government departments , NGOs , civil society , the private sector and external partners ; and inadequate political will related to the use of available human and institutional capacity .  
Continue to undertake detailed analyses of the financial and economic crisis , paying particular attention to the role of financial markets , and to present options to members and associate members which they may use , as appropriate , as inputs in the formulation of their relevant national policies , with a view to ensuring the attraction of a steady inflow of private capital ;  
Having reviewed and shared experiences with tax reforms in their various countries , the Ministers agreed to reinforce macroeconomic stability and deepen financial market and institutional reforms , as well as to ensure sound interest and exchange-rate policy management so as to enhance private and public savings .  
The Ministers stressed the critical role of capital markets in raising the level of domestic savings , attracting foreign private investment , and stemming and reversing capital flight .  
In the view of several Ministers , efforts were necessary to stabilize State revenue by means of a fair system of taxation and efficient tax administration , and to mobilize more domestic capital through an effective private sector financial system subject to adequate bank supervision .  
The Tokyo Agenda for Action , adopted by the Second Tokyo International Conference on African Development , held in October 1998 , also established a number of priorities based on widespread consultation among African and Asian Governments and the private sector , donor countries and international and regional organizations in a series of preparatory activities prior to the Conference . 
Relaxation of foreign exchange regulations has removed some important obstacles to transit trade , also enabling private sector transport operators in many landlocked and transit developing countries to retain some hard currency for purchase of spare parts and equipment .  
UNDPs second country programme for St . Helena ( 19931996 ) focused on developing national capacities in two areas : ( a ) sustainable livelihoods ; and ( b ) ensuring social protection throughout the transition from an aid-dependent economy dominated by the public sector to a self-financing economy , in which the private sector has an expanded role .  
Net private capital flows to emerging markets in 1999 barely increased from the low levels of 1998 , when flows contracted to less than half of their pre-crisis peak , but have been recovering modestly since mid-1999 . 
To promote optimal allocation and use of public and private investments to foster human resources , sustainable food , agriculture , fisheries and forestry systems , and rural development , in high and low potential areas ;  
The framework law should include provisions on its purpose ; the targets or goals to be achieved and the time-frame to be set for the achievement of those targets ; the means by which the purpose could be achieved described in broad terms , in particular the intended collaboration with civil society and the private sector and with international organizations ; institutional responsibility for the process ; and the national mechanisms for its monitoring , as well as possible recourse procedures .

Governments , with the increased participation of the United Nations system , civil society , donors and the private sector , are urged to pursue the research and development of new , safe , low-cost and effective family-planning and contraceptive methods , for both men and women , including female-controlled methods that both protect against sexually transmitted diseases , including HIV / AIDS , and prevent unwanted pregnancy .  
The private sector may assist the efforts of Governments , but it can not substitute for the Governments responsibility to ensure and provide quality , full , safe , accessible , affordable and convenient health services , including reproductive health , family planning and sexual health services .

Developing coordinated , integrated and balanced approaches to health delivery , including reproductive health care , requires good teamwork and strong leadership as well as shared vision , and partnerships with civil society and the private sector need to be strengthened .  
Thanks to this law , the enforcement and development of a private medical-care system part of the national policy on the population 's medical care will pay special attention to women 's health , which is far more sensitive to social and economic changes and to political , cultural and psychological factors . 
After the Cairo Conference , the National Department of Health , in collaboration with other Government agencies , the private sector , civil society and donors , prepared our fourth National Health Plan , which encourages a fundamental shift in the way health services are delivered to Papua New Guineans living in urban and rural areas .  
Achieving the multiplicity of goals set at various conferences such as Agenda 21 , the Barbados Programme of Action for Small Island Developing States and the Cairo Programme of Action is not easy , but we can fully realize that objective if the international community , international financial institutions , the private sector , non-governmental organizations and national Governments together make a firm and collaborative commitment to such a worthy undertaking .  
These include ( a ) strengthening macroeconomic stability and reducing distortions so as to encourage private sector investment ; ( b ) improving the quality of government spending in order to invest in basic social services and raise the level of human capital ; and ( c ) rationalizing the assistance provided by external donors .  
Although it has been argued that there are no universally accepted international law principles regulating the position of employees of foreign States , relevant case law has often considered a contract of employment as merely a special type of commercial / private law contract .  
immediate restitution of all illegally and forcibly taken real estate to its rightful private and State owners , and reinstatement of those employed in the private and public sectors who were dismissed from their jobs because of the tacit and tolerant attitude of UNMIK and KFOR ;  
Although it has been argued that there are no universally accepted international law principles regulating the position of employees of foreign States , relevant case law has often considered a contract of employment as merely a special type of commercial / private law contract .  
Monitoring and documenting economic and social conditions in the occupied Palestinian territory and providing periodic analyses on these aspects and special reports on specific issues relevant to the development effort , such as the prospects for growth in the private sector and the constraints thereon ;  
The Commission had subsequently identified four areas for future analytical work and expert meetings : ( a ) the respective roles of government and the private sector and the interactions between them in SME development ; ( b ) inter-firm cooperation ; ( c ) SME clustering and networking ; and ( d ) the provision of sustainable financial and non-financial services for SME development .  
Globalization , diversification of forms of migration , the declining role of State leadership in migration , decrease of State _ organized migration as compared to spontaneous migration , increase in temporary migration , growth of private recruitment agencies , increase in irregular migration , trade in human beings and - what is very important - feminization of migration have substantially changed the context of contemporary migration .  
The pursuit of sound , growth-oriented macroeconomic policies , moreover , needs to be complemented by a general social , legal and political environment conducive to the efficient functioning of markets and , in particular , to the development of the private sector , whose investment decisions are at the centre of growth .  
UNCTADs work should therefore be guided by a dual effort at integration and collaboration : integration of its analytical , normative and technical cooperation work , and collaboration with other development-related international organizations , as well as with civil society and the private business sector . 
Widespread reliance on information-based technologies has resulted in an unprecedented degree of global connectivity and interdependence , with the result that many aspects of national and international activity , public and private sector alike , theoretically can be put at risk by criminal or terrorist misuse .  
[ Globalization and in particular financial liberalization , the extent of resources controlled by the private sector and corporate strategies for investment have at the same time far / Globalization greatly increased trade and capital flows , opens new opportunities for sustained economic growth and development of the world economy and also permits countries to share experiences and to learn from one anothers achievements and difficulties .  
However , the results in the field fell far short of the continents hopes and aspirations : for instance , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of sub-Saharan Africa had been decreasing at a rate of 0.8 per cent each year for the past 20 years and both official development assistance and private capital flows to African countries had proved extremely disappointing .  
The public and private sectors , civil society and NGOs had participated , together with UNIDO , in the design of that programme , whose implementation was of great importance for the countrys social , political and economic stability , sustainable industrial development being a key factor in creating a more prosperous and equitable society .  
Both the training sessions and the Symposium featured a lively exchange of views , further development of the training materials for local use and concrete first steps towards creating a dynamic knowledge base on these issues within the PA public and private sectors .  
Taking into account the dependency of small island developing States on conventional energy sources , there is a need for mobilization of resources from all sources , including from the private sector , for the provision of technical , financial and technological assistance , as appropriate , to small island developing States , to encourage energy efficiency , and to accelerate and maximize the development and utilization of environmentally sound renewable energy sources .  
Furthermore , participants in the conference considered that the current and future international trade agenda , such as the upcoming negotiations on trade in services , was of crucial importance for the partnership between the public and private sectors in both originating and destination countries .  
The Commission had subsequently identified four areas for future analytical work and expert meetings : ( a ) the respective roles of government and the private sector and the interactions between them in SME development ; ( b ) inter-firm cooperation ; ( c ) SME clustering and networking ; and ( d ) the provision of sustainable financial and non-financial services for SME development .  
Uncertainty about future developments in the international economy has grown in the aftermath of the global financial crisis , which demonstrated the volatility of international private capital flows and its damaging effects on levels of economic activity and peoples livelihoods in developing countries .  
The former , with inconvertible local currencies and relatively low foreign private capital inflows , proved less vulnerable to the effects of the crisis .  
In this regard , it stressed that the current forms of cooperation involving the public and private sectors of developing countries should be built upon and expanded , and also stressed the importance of identifying barriers and restrictions to the transfer of publicly and privately owned technologies .  
The global seed trade is dominated by large private industry giants whose vast economic power and commercial control over plant germplasm is beginning to overshadow the role of the public sector in plant breeding and other agricultural research in many countries .  
No doubt the shared use of facilities increases the legal and jurisdictional complexities of project financing , but increasing experience on how to tackle ownership issues has been gained through international water-sharing projects . 47 Also , the private financing of multi-country infrastructure projects creates complementary interests between landlocked and coastal countries as transit infrastructure directly generates foreign exchange . 
The methodological framework of the STIP reviews is the " national system of innovation " ( NSI ) , defined as the network of economic agents whose actions initiate , import , adapt and diffuse new technologies , taken together with the public and private institutions and policies that influence their innovative behaviour and performance .  
In launching the preparatory process for the Conference , the Secretary-General of the Conference emphasized the importance of a comprehensive and participatory preparatory process at the country level , which should involve interministerial departments , civil society , private sector and local government representatives .  
In its resolution 1999 / 78 , paragraph 53 , the Commission on Human Rights requested the High Commissioner to set up a voluntary fund designed specifically to cover all aspects of the preparatory process for the World Conference and the participation of non-governmental organizations , especially from developing countries , and requested all Governments , international organizations , non-governmental organizations and private individuals to contribute to that Fund .  
More generally , small island developing States believe that the potential for greater resource mobilization can be enhanced by more effective coordination on a number of fronts : at the national and regional levels , including a strengthened regional mechanism ; among donors , through more creative interaction with the private sector and NGOs ; and through the strengthening of focal points within the United Nations system , including the small island developing States Unit .  
Through renewed support for IDDA , efforts must be intensified to reduce the gap between those with knowledge and skills and those without , as well as to facilitate foreign and domestic private sector investment in the value chain of primary products and other manufacturing activities in order to address the emerging problems of the technology gap , urban unemployment and rural poverty .  
The new approach stresses the need for better integrated ( or comprehensive ) technical cooperation programmes , regular dialogue with key stakeholders in the countries , especially those in the private sector , and stronger partnership among United Nations agencies and donor agencies to promote private sector-led industrial development and good corporate governance through interactive policy formulation and implementation .  
Further , additional financial resources will be decentralized to country offices to provide greater flexibility in providing short advisory services to member States and to facilitate regular public and private sector policy dialogue .  
To close the income and technological gap between the region and the rest of the world requires a more comprehensive approach , including effective public and private investments in industrial infrastructure , strengthening of technological capabilities through human resource development , institution-building and effective economic governance .  
He has published several books and numerous articles on the law of nationality , private international law , in the strict sense , and international civil procedural law in Venezuelan and foreign journals .  
The formation of capital at the regional level maintained the same growth pattern ( 11 per cent in 1998 , compared to 10 per cent in 1997 ) , mainly owing to private investment , but also because of an increase in public investment in productive and social infrastructure , principally in El Salvador and Guatemala . .  
Links are being forged or strengthened with international , regional and sub-regional organizations ; academic and other institutions ; international financial institutions ; the private sector ; members of civil society ; and even military organizations and police structures .  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .  
IRIN updates and alerts , covering a wide range of humanitarian , human rights , political , economic and social issues , are drawn from an extensive network of United Nations and other sources , ranging from Governments , international organizations , academic institutions and think-tanks in capital cities to non-governmental organizations , religious missions and private enterprise .  
I support the proposal put forward by Secretary-General Kofi Annan that a global pact on common values and principles be concluded within the framework of a public / private partnership , between the United Nations and major companies , in order to lend the law of the market a human face .  
They also stressed the importance of sound domestic policies , private capital flows and appropriate functioning of markets , as well as a favourable and open international economic environment , to overcome this crisis and reverse the marginalization of some developing countries , in particular the least developed ones .  
The Seminar offered presentations by representatives of the academic and non-governmental communities and the private sector on international policy issues and trends and on selected project experience from Africa and Latin America , which included activities supported by the United Nations Voluntary Fund on Disability . 41 .  A major cross-cutting theme considered at the Seminar was gender-sensitive and disability-responsive policy design and evaluation .  
Conscious that the ageing of the worlds population represents an unparalleled and urgent policy and programme challenge to Governments , non-governmental organizations and private groups in ensuring that the needs of the aged and their human resource potential are adequately addressed ,  
Expressed appreciation to the countries that participated in the current round of reviews ; to the senior officials from capitals who engaged in open , frank and meaningful dialogue and shared valuable experience with other Governments - - which could also benefit from the process - - and to the international private sector ;  
Calls upon all Governments , and all relevant United Nations organizations , and multilateral and regional financial institutions to increase allocations of financial resources for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries , and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
UNCTAD should do analytical work and provide a forum for exchanges of experiences at intergovernmental and at expert level on the formulation of policies favourable to the development of the private sector at local , national and regional levels .  
Analytical work should be carried out on the establishment of a legal and regulatory framework conducive to the development of the private sector and favourable to FDI and to domestic investment and the development of local expertise as well as regional networks .  
A comprehensive approach was needed in addressing Africa 's structural constraints , including its weak infrastructure and high transport costs , which continued to undermine the expected gains from economic reforms , making it difficult to attract adequate foreign private investment .  
Norwegian support of private sector development in developing countries was aimed at increasing income for individuals , providing jobs for poor groups , and raising tax revenues so as to create the necessary economic base for a rise in domestic investment .  
She emphasized that the Conference would involve a comprehensive and extensive preparatory process at the country level which should involve ministerial departments and representatives of civil society , the private sector and local government .  
There were four principal means of financing infrastructure development : ( i ) development finance institutions ; ( ii ) the private sector ; ( iii ) government ; and ( iv ) private-public partnerships ( PPPs ) and community private-public partnerships ( CPPPs ) , which incorporate joint projects between the private and the public sector , with just a portion of the financing provided by the public sector .  
The Asian financial crisis has accelerated initiatives to improve the timeliness and quality of information concerning key macroeconomic variables as well as the financial reporting of banks and non-financial firms . 8 These are viewed as essential for better decision-taking by private lenders and investors , greater market discipline over policy makers , more effective policy surveillance by multilateral financial institutions , and strengthened financial regulation and supervision . 
The failure of IMF surveillance in preventing international financial crises reflects , in part , belated , and so far only partial , adaptation of existing procedures to the problems posed by the large autonomous private capital flows ; but perhaps more fundamentally that failure is due to the unbalanced nature of these procedures , which give too little recognition to the disproportionately large global impact of monetary policies in a small minority of OECD countries .  
Encourages the Secretary-General to make efforts to promote public awareness activities in all Member States , with the support of international , regional and national institutions , both public and private , regarding the strategic importance of the Global Renewable Energy Education and Training Programme 1996-2005 in attaining the objective of sustainable development ;  
His Government was convinced that development required , at the national level , the development of sound economic policy , respect for the rule of law , promotion of the private sector , accountability and transparency in public affairs .  
Conditions which might assist developing countries in addressing poverty issues at the macroeconomic , institutional and policy levels were , respectively , globalization ; the awareness-building role of civil society and the role of the private sector , particularly in creating jobs and spurring rapid economic growth ; and the achievement of a balance between the economic and financial aspects of development and social , cultural and institutional concerns .  
The problem needed to be addressed nationally , by supporting the private and informal sectors , promoting self-employment , providing credit facilities to the unemployed , encouraging the creation of volunteer organizations and investing in training programmes ; internationally , by dismantling trade barriers , ensuring adequate capital flows to developing nations , encouraging technology transfer , alleviating the debt burden and sharing experiences .  
One view was that the application of chapter V should only supplement the substantive law provisions of the draft Convention and thus apply only to the transactions falling within the ambit of the draft Convention as defined in chapter I . In support of that view , it was stated that , from a legislative policy point of view , it would not be appropriate to attempt , in essence , to prepare a mini private international law convention within a substantive law convention . 
In addition , it was pointed out that draft article 27 could be deleted , since it addressed the contractual aspects of assignment , namely a matter which was not the main focus of the draft Convention and might already be sufficiently regulated by private international law ( even though the principle of freedom of choice of the applicable law might not be common to all legal systems ) .  
It had also urged Governments and the private sector to increase their support for developing an adequate science and technology capacity through appropriate education and research programmes as an indispensable foundation for economic , social , cultural and environmentally sound development .  
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources , will also be required ;  
Further recognizing the continuing need for the international community to extend technical and other support , including , inter alia , enhanced official development assistance , investment guarantees , debt-for-industrial-development swaps and enhanced market access to enable the continent to leverage domestic and international resources and investment to take advantage of the increasing role of the private sector ,  
Mr . Rao ( Observer for the World Intellectual Property Organization ( WIPO ) ) said that the objectives of the Decade were close to the nature and functions of WIPO , which was not only the international secretariat for existing treaty bodies relating to intellectual property but was also unique in that it provided direct access to private innovators and industry for the registration of patents , trademarks and industrial designs for the purpose of international recognition .  
Welcoming the efforts of the United Nations system to facilitate the active and constructive involvement of the private sector in the development process , and recognizing the importance of the global compact on human rights , labour , environment , proposed by the Secretary-General on 31 January 1999 at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum held in Davos , Switzerland ,  
Encourages multilateral institutions , Governments and the private sector , including corporations engaged in international activities , to strengthen partnerships to advance sustainable development through , inter alia , supporting the stable functioning of the international finance and trade system and investment flows ;  
Mr . Leiro ( Norway ) said that the assumption that globalization benefited everyone had yet to be proven ; the gap between rich and poor was growing both within and between nations and many poor countries attracted minimal foreign investment , lacked a dynamic private sector and were often deprived of the benefits of increased export earnings by heavy debt burdens and limited market access . 
Given the difficult financial situations faced by many Member States , however , he called on UNRWA to explore creative measures to alleviate its financial difficulties through alternative sources of income such as contributions from the private sector and expanded joint programmes with international organizations .  
Stressing the importance of the provision of adequate financial resources for the development of developing countries , including through public and private financial flows , international trade , official development assistance and debt relief , and that the comprehensive and integrated consideration of these issues should constitute a very important element of the dialogue and collaboration between the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions ,  
Deeply concerned at the continuing decline in official development assistance , which is a significant external source of financing for development and an important support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Mindful of the need that the benefits of the increasing integration of global markets should be extended to all nations and peoples , in particular to the developing countries , especially the least developed among them , that in spite of the important role of private capital flows for promoting economic development they are not evenly distributed , and that for the majority of developing countries they are unavailable or inadequate ,  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
The above law is applicable both to the public and private sectors , and , apart from defining the concept of indirect discrimination , it establishes that discriminatory practices occur when there is a considerable disproportion between the number of male and female workers .  
In spite of having a generic application , once the decree is applied , to both self-employed workers as well as to dependent ones , in both the public and private sectors , it will ensure the adoption of complementary legislation for certain groups of workers sensitive to specific risks , namely pregnant women .  
To intensify the growing involvement and cooperation between entities , public and private , at both local and regional levels , to best explore the available resources , aiming for an easier professional re-integration of women in regular jobs , and / or in income generating work and increasing their participation in local and regional development ;  
There were several reported attempts to disrupt the activities of emerging or newly constituted groups , the most egregious example of which was the disruption by pro-Aristide demonstrators of a rally , on 28 May 1999 , organized by the private sector and supported by a wide spectrum of civil society organizations and political parties to protest mounting insecurity and what they termed anarchy .  
The Government , in cooperation with the private sector , had also sought to provide shelter and rehabilitative services to girls who had been sexually abused , and a national plan of action against the commercial sexual exploitation of children was being developed .  
Such low-income countries find considerable difficulty in attracting private foreign investment or loans from commercial banks , while loans from the international financial institutions have generally been concentrated in the larger countries .  
First were matters relating to the macroeconomic management of the world economy : institution of more effective macroeconomic coordination and of improved monitoring and surveillance of international financial flows , arrangements for quicker response to crises , and ending of a system where the private sector was too readily rescued from the risks attendant on its own imprudence .  
In their discussions with the Special Rapporteur , government officials , private individuals and members of non-governmental organizations generally agreed that there had been a gradual change in the attitude of some of the government actors , from the federal to the municipal level , who were now more inclined towards improving the overall human rights performance of public institutions and agencies .  
The Special Rapporteur notes that the civil society , including NGOs , the media and private individuals , has often been instrumental in pressing the competent authorities to launch inquiries into incidents of extrajudicial killings or to reopen investigations into cases already considered closed .  
Calls upon the international community to consider supporting the creation of special economic zones and development corridors in the Community , with the active participation of the private sector , while recognizing the responsibilities and the ongoing efforts of the countries concerned to create the necessary environment , including the appropriate legal and economic framework for such activities ;  
Notes with appreciation that some affected developing countries and one region have adopted their national and regional action programmes , and therefore calls upon the international community to contribute to the implementation of those programmes through , inter alia , the conclusion of partnership agreements , relevant bilateral and multilateral cooperation programmes that are available to implement the Convention and contributions from non-governmental organizations and the private sector ;  
The EU stresses its concern at the use of diamonds , gold and other resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to fund military operations in the region , and calls on all the parties to ensure that all commercial dealings of this nature are legal under the relevant domestic and international law , transparent , consistent with States ' arrangements with the international financing institutions , and benefit the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and not private individuals .  
Calls upon all Governments and all relevant United Nations organizations and multilateral and regional financial institutions to consider increasing allocations of financial resources for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries , and to strengthen funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Calls upon the international community to consider supporting the creation of special economic zones and development corridors in the Community , with the active participation of the private sector , while recognizing the responsibilities and the ongoing efforts of the countries concerned to create the necessary environment , including the appropriate legal and economic framework for such activities ;  
Encourages Governments , multilateral institutions and the private sector , including corporations engaged in international business activities , to strengthen partnerships to advance sustainable development through , inter alia , supporting the stable functioning of the international finance and trade system and investment flows , particularly in support of the development efforts of developing countries , as well as countries with economies in transition ;  
Urges the private sector , including corporations engaged in international business activities , to conduct orderly and fair business practices while adhering to and promoting the principles of honesty , transparency and accountability in international commercial transactions with a view to contributing to efforts to create an enabling environment for business and investment ;  
Notes with appreciation that some affected developing countries and one region have adopted their national and regional action programmes , and therefore calls upon the international community to contribute to the implementation of those programmes through , inter alia , the conclusion of partnership agreements , relevant bilateral and multilateral cooperation programmes that are available to implement the Convention and contributions from non-governmental organizations and the private sector ;  
Encourages the Secretary-General to make efforts to promote public awareness activities in all Member States , with the support of international , regional and national institutions , both public and private , regarding the strategic importance of the Global Renewable Energy Education and Training Programme 1996-2005 in attaining the objective of sustainable development ;  
The establishment or maintenance of private educational institutions , if the object of the institutions is not to secure the exclusion of any group but to provide educational facilities in addition to those provided by the public authorities , if the institutions are conducted in accordance with that object , and if the education provided conforms with such standards as may be laid down or approved by the competent authorities , in particular for education of the same level .  
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular least developed countries to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Underlines the importance that sovereign risk assessments made by private sector agencies be based on objective and transparent parameters , and in this regard invites the relevant national , regional and international regulatory bodies to contribute to the development of appropriate standards to ensure that risk-assessment agencies provide complete and accurate information on a timely and regular basis ;  
Global financial integration had helped generate strong private capital flows to some developing countries , but had also posed enormous challenges to national financial and banking systems in terms of ensuring the sustainability of those flows .  
Therefore , private investors , national and foreign , bringing new or advanced technology into the host country or developing original solutions will need to be assured that their intellectual property rights will be protected and that they will be able to enforce those rights against infringements , which may require the enactment of criminal law provisions designed to combat infringements of intellectual property rights .  
For this reason , countries with a well established tradition of private participation in infrastructure projects have developed a series of control mechanisms and remedies to protect government contractors against arbitrary or improper acts by public authorities , such as access to impartial dispute settlement bodies and full compensation schemes for governmental wrongdoing .  
It should be remembered that the national legislation of most countries established regimes of absolute liability for the cases covered by the draft articles , in other words for acts which were lawful but dangerous , which were tolerated because they had beneficial effects for society as a whole , even if they could in fact cause damage to private persons .  
Stressing the importance of the provision of adequate financial resources for the development of developing countries , including through public and private financial flows , international trade , official development assistance and debt relief , and that the comprehensive and integrated consideration of these issues should constitute a very important element of the dialogue and collaboration between the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions ,

Encourages multilateral institutions , Governments and the private sector , including corporations engaged in international activities , to strengthen partnerships to advance sustainable development through , inter alia , supporting the stable functioning of the international finance and trade system and investment flows ;  
Encourages Governments , multilateral institutions and the private sector , including corporations engaged in international business activities , to strengthen partnerships so as to advance sustainable development through , inter alia , supporting the stable functioning of the international finance and trade system and investment flows , particularly in support of the development efforts of developing countries , as well as countries with economies in transition ;  
Urges the private sector , including corporations engaged in international business activities , to conduct orderly and fair business practices while adhering to and promoting the principles of honesty , transparency and accountability in international commercial transactions , with a view to contributing to efforts to create an enabling environment for business and investment ;  
The total cost of crime to communities ( in terms of criminal justice , lost property , shattered lives and private security ) , measured as a proportion of gross domestic product , is several times greater in developing countries than in developed countries .  
According to the information received by the Special Rapporteur and the observations he has made during his various missions , mercenary activities continue to be carried on both through traditional means of recruitment and hiring and in new forms , including recruitment by private companies offering military security services , which take part in armed conflicts in specific countries by virtue of contracts signed with Governments .  
Significantly , the Genocide Convention makes individuals liable to prosecution whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers , public officials or private individuals and it envisages the establishment of international mechanisms to enforce individual criminal responsibility for major human rights violations .  
Internal enabling environment : policy framework incentives for domestic private savings , equitable tax systems ( development and enforcement of ) , macroeconomic policies , disincentives to corruption ; good governance ; transparency ; effective regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector ; banking infrastructure , pension funds ; corporate governance ; internationally accepted accounting standards , and a sound legal system ( land and property rights ) ;  
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) : need to spread FDI more widely and to diversify private capital flows in order to reduce country sector concentration , strengthened contribution of FDI for domestic capacity-building and national development goals , role of South-South flows , reasons for marginalization of countries with a sound investment environment ;  
Use of ODA for reinforcing developing countries potential for better access to global markets , and poverty eradication , leveraging larger levels of domestic or foreign private capital ;  
Need to tackle , where appropriate , bilateral , official , multilateral and private debt ( criteria for assessing extent of debt relief ) ; special issues of least developed countries Africa heavily indebted poor countries ; debt relief to provide lasting exit from debt problems , forgiving aid-related bilateral debt for least developed countries , need to improve creditworthiness , and the reduction of spreads in new lending ) ;  
The Report estimates that developing countries have lost four times as much due to the protectionism of developed countries as they have received through private capital inflows a key negative equation considering that trade earnings are much needed incomes to back production and employment , while capital inflows are monies to be repaid with interest .  
While international assistance and debt relief are clearly important , their positive effects depend on sound national efforts towards economic and structural reform and good governance , under which the private sector and civil society are able to play productive roles .  
Adopted in 1997 , after broad discussions with decentralized communities , civil society , the private sector and donors , this programme aims to improve the living conditions of the poorest population by increasing the income of the poor through the promotion of micro-enterprises and income-generating activities ; improving provision to meet basic social needs ; and establishing a permanent follow-up system on household living conditions .  
Mr . Savimbi is still interested in continuing his destabilizating process of preventing the smooth running of democratic institutions ; destroying cities , towns , villages , infrastructure and public and private assets ; and mercilessly killing civilians , thereby condemning all the people of Angola to misery , disease and famine .  
Today , as we look back , we can see that what we have achieved in Mongolia over the past decade in building the institutions of democracy , promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms , unleashing private initiative and developing our external relations has constituted a major advance towards a self-governing democratic society , a private-sector-led economy and a closer association with the rest of the international community .  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .  
In this regard , I am making an earnest appeal to donor States , multilateral institutions and the private sector to support Zambia and other developing States in their efforts to eradicate poverty by direct investment and cancellation of debt , and by ensuring that structural adjustment programmes are humane and responsive to social and environmental concerns .  
Notwithstanding historical and cultural traditions , by which elderly people have always been greatly respected , the improvement of their standard of living requires ongoing political efforts to mobilize and utilize available resources in the context of families , communities , civil organizations and the private sector .  
Taking into account the dependency of small island developing States on conventional energy sources , there is a need for mobilization of resources from all sources , including from the private sector , for the provision of technical , financial and technological assistance , as appropriate , to small island developing States , to encourage energy efficiency , and to accelerate and maximize the development and utilization of environmentally sound renewable energy sources .  
Particular attention will be required to coordinate eco-tourism ventures at the regional level , and to facilitate the sharing of information and experiences and the integration of the private sector within official development assistance supported eco-tourism projects .

Invites concerned non-governmental organizations , funding sources and the private sector , in coordination with national authorities concerned , to support and develop a programme that will bring a wide range of expertise and proven interventions , including alternative community-based services , to the training of local community workers , teachers and primary health care staff and to provide appropriate interventions for stress-related disorders to girls and women in crisis ;  
Engage industries and economic sectors , in both public and private sectors , and all other major groups at the national and international levels , as appropriate , in activities relating to sustainable consumption and production with the objective of developing optimal strategies and or programmes , including targets and timetables , at the appropriate levels for more sustainable consumption and production , including cleaner production and affordable eco-efficiency .  
Governments at all levels , the private sector and other major groups as defined in Agenda 21 are urged to cooperate in developing waste collection systems and disposal facilities , and developing programmes for prevention , minimization and recycling of waste , to safeguard and improve the quality of life in human settlements and coastal regions in all countries , especially in developing countries .  
Innovative and new approaches for financing development of sustainable energy , including renewable sources of energy is required and essential while continuing to pursue efforts to increase official development assistance , ensure continued replenishment of the Global Environmental Facility and encourage domestic and foreign private investments .  
The promotion of educational and information programmes designed to enhance awareness and understanding of economic , social and cultural rights , both within the population at large and among particular groups such as the public service , the judiciary , the private sector and the labour movement ;  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .  
In moving towards a world in which the benefits of scientific and technological change are spread more widely across society , public and private institutions will increasingly be called upon to motivate and interact with a larger and more diverse number of actors than in the past , for the process of innovation is interactive and system-wide .  
The services provided are the usual postal services for private or official delegation mailings , including parcel post , air mail , registered and insured mail , international and domestic money orders , information about postage rates and regulations concerning entry or dispatch of parcels to and from various countries .  
Calls upon all countries to develop economic policies that promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , 6 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and the Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Accordingly , Moroccos health policy addresses five main concerns : a ) more effective mobilization and use of resources ; b ) the building of a new relationship between the public and private sectors regarding health matters ; c ) streamlined management and regulation of the overall health care system ; d ) improved services with control of spending ; and e ) participation by local communities .  
These consultative bodies , comprising representatives of all the social partners concerned ( local communities , cultural associations and unions , private and banking sector , personalities from the arts and literature , etc . ) , constitute a genuine forum for debating cultural policy and determining the direction and priorities of cultural actions . 
In order to ensure the creation of the necessary framework conducive to foreign investment and to private sector participation in maritime transport , it is essential to harmonize regulatory instruments at least at the regional level , and to exploit existing opportunities for cooperation which could enable both local and foreign operators to access maritime markets more easily and ensure the competitiveness of small island developing States operators .  
The European Union firmly supported that project , which combined elements of public and private law and reflected in a balanced way the different existing legal systems .  
This Council includes representatives of diverse educational constituencies , formal and informal , public and private , higher and secondary , and primary .  
Hiring private companies providing security and military assistance and advice is no substitute for maintaining a collective regional security system and genuinely professional national armed forces and security forces loyal to the democratic legal order.It is a false solution . 
In the previous report he submitted to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ fourth session ( E CN . 4-1998-31 ) , the Special Rapporteur dealt fully with private companies operating in the international market offering security services and military assistance and advice , normally matters reserved for the State and for which the State must assume responsibility .  
Specifically , it is neither lawful nor advisable , no matter how often short _ term or emergency reasons are invoked , to entrust a country ' s security and the speedy settlement of armed conflicts to private companies which hire mercenaries to achieve those objectives and will earn substantial economic profits for their participation .  
The Guidelines follow three broad and interconnected approaches , namely ( a ) improvement of governmental capacity for acknowledging the Governments responsibility for multisectoral coordination ; ( b ) widespread reform of laws and legal support services with a focus on the status of women , children and vulnerable groups ; and ( c ) support for increased private sector and community participation in the response to HIV AIDS .  
Guideline 5 encourages States to enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws to protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors ; ensure privacy and confidentiality ; ensure ethics in research involving human subjects ; and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies when the laws are breached .  
Therefore , the public sector can play a catalytic role by helping to promote stable and profitable housing finance systems , the introduction of new products that satisfactorily meet demand , the introduction and adoption of banking regulations and , most of all , by promoting a housing policy model that takes the long-term view and that is based on a partnership between the public and private sectors .  
The resumption of dialogue with the international financial institutions and with private and official bilateral partners could enable these objectives to be met through the sound macroeconomic policies to which the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is committed .  
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular least developed countries , to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Regretting that the current crisis in financial markets , characterized , inter alia , by massive and sudden outflows of capital from the affected countries and the sharp decline in private capital flows to developing countries and some economies in transition , has resulted in higher interest rate spreads , leading to a significant slowdown in economic activity ,  
Also stresses the need to strengthen international and national financial systems through a more effective national , regional and international surveillance of both the public and private sectors , based upon the improvement of the availability and transparency of information , as well as the strengthening of the role of the International Monetary Fund in this regard , and the collaboration of the World Bank with technical assistance and capacity-building in this matter ;  
Calls upon the international community to pursue national and international efforts , at the intergovernmental and inter-agency levels , to contribute to minimizing the excessive volatility of global financial flows and to distribute in a more equitable manner the costs of systemic adjustments between the public and private sectors ;  
Building adequate manpower with the requisite level of skill for effective integrated island management ; small island developing States should assess their training needs and develop a training programme , involving the private sector , non-governmental organizations and Governments ; training should not be limited to technical experts ; it should include local communities , for example , fishermen , tourist hotel operators , managers of industries located in coastal regions and farmers ;  
The framework law should include provisions on its purpose ; the targets or goals to be achieved and the time _ frame to be set for the achievement of those targets ; the means by which the purpose could be achieved described in broad terms , in particular the intended collaboration with civil society and the private sector and with international organizations ; institutional responsibility for the process ; and the national mechanisms for its monitoring .  
Moreover , the increasing participation of local communities in tourism development has encouraged modern structures of public administration as well as the sharing of joint responsibilities between public institutions and the private sector .  
As the Special Rapporteur has pointed out , rape as the ultimate violent and degrading act of sexual violence , constitutes an intrusion into the most private and intimate parts of a womans body , as well as an assault on the core of her self . 11 While rape commonly occurs as a manifestation of extreme sexual violence against individual women , rape is increasingly used as a weapon of war , political repression , or ethnic cleansing . 
Besides being sometimes needed to satisfy national constitutional and other requirements , the enactment of express legislative authorization may be an important measure to foster the confidence of potential investors , national or foreign , in a national policy to promote private sector investment in infrastructure .  
Development of sustainable local services and national and international support measures including financial and non-financial services , human resource development , access to information and an assessment of access to technologies , to improve and promote the role and capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries within the framework of a dialogue between the private and the public sector .  
They included the complementary roles played by a number of agents at the macro , meso and micro levels , and the need to create constructive linkages between the public and private sectors .  
To try to make this topic the private domain of the nuclear Powers thus excluding the vast majority of States from the multilateral negotiations necessary in order to attain nuclear disarmament in a time-bound framework and under strict international control would only delay further the legitimate aspirations of mankind to live in a nuclear-weapon-free world .  
Noting also , in this context , the increasing significance of official development assistance as an external resource for many developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , in the light of reduced private flows , and further that the overall declining trend in official development assistance is a cause for concern ,  
This can be achieved through direct government policies , joint ventures with local private initiatives , and foreign investment from regional and international public and private banks .  
The circulation of press organs is not authorized , permission is not given for the functioning of new non _ governmental human rights organizations , which have been waiting for years to be recognized , the movements of the population within the country are controlled by military checkpoints , there is oppressive supervision of all private activity and in practice political dissent is viewed almost as a crime , particularly by the peripheral authorities of the mainland region .

an increased commitment by Governments at the national and local levels , and their partners in civil society , to guide public and private investments for the provision of adequate shelter , basic infrastructure and services ;  
At the start of the millennium , the growing concerns in the region for the environmental dimension of development will centre on the increasing demand for natural resources , the dominant role of the private sector in the development of such resources and the management of service concessions , the problems caused by pollution and land use and the need to comply with multilateral agreements on the environment , particularly under Agenda 21 , and international agreements on specific issues .  
Other users will include public and private agencies and bodies responsible for the design , execution and administration of programmes , policies and projects dealing with population-related issues and national , regional and local bureaux concerned with economic and social development .  
Other users will be business associations , labour organizations and technical and professional institutions connected with production sectors , universities , research centres , regional and subregional integration bodies and other public and private entities that require comparable information on the countries of the region , including experts working with UNDP and other United Nations bodies responsible for drafting reports and implementing technical cooperation projects .  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development _ oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily _ indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
Where BDS are strategically important but not yet adapted to local needs , joint efforts by public and private institutions have proven effective institutional responses .  
There are also few successful examples of DFIs that have proven able to operate profitably with SMEs - among these , the Corporaci \ n Andina de Fomento ( CAF ) , a private multilateral financial institution which promotes sustainable development and regional integration by attracting capital resources for the provision of multiple financial services to the public and private sectors of the shareholding countries . 
The key elements of the infrastructure are the databases and developing databases for different purposes and users ( private , public , scientific and government ) is the major task to be accomplished in a systematic development of infrastructure .  
Operations approved in 1999 reflect the planned shift in emphasis from emergency reconstruction to ensuring the sustainability of economic institutions and sound macroeconomic management , as well as the medium - to longer-term viability of policies aimed at stimulating private investment , banking reform and privatization .  
While the active contribution of national authorities and the United Nations system was vital for a successful implementation of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action and the New Directions Strategy , the involvement of the private sector and of non-governmental organizations was indispensable in fostering a viable business sector in the developing countries .  
Governments , with the increased participation of the United Nations system , civil society , donors and the private sector , are urged to pursue the research and development of new , safe , low-cost and effective family-planning and contraceptive methods , for both men and women , including female-controlled methods that both protect against sexually transmitted diseases , including HIV AIDS , and prevent unwanted pregnancy .  
The private sector may assist the efforts of Governments , but it can not substitute for the Governments responsibility to ensure and provide quality , full , safe , accessible , affordable and convenient health services , including reproductive health , family planning and sexual health services .  
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources , will also be required ;  
UNISPACE III had been the first global conference of the United Nations in which industry and civil society had participated as full partners of governments , reflecting the increasing economic use of outer space and the rapidly growing importance of private companies in that area as well as the heightened interest of citizens in matters relating to outer space .  
The Conference had taken stock of developments in space science and applications , explored new areas of cooperation , considered the changing economic and political environment which offered new opportunities for international cooperation and studied the constraints and issues faced by developing countries in building national capacities to benefit from space technology as well as ways to involve the private sector more closely in the process .  
Calls upon all Governments , and all relevant United Nations organizations , and multilateral and regional financial institutions to consider increasing allocations of financial resources for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries , and to strengthen funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Consideration of development financing should include the topics of ODA , primary commodity export profits and external debt , which should be addressed through genuine economic cooperation on the basis of international partnership and solidarity and of private capital flows , including foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , for financing trade and innovative sources of funding .  
Without a shared sense of social responsibility and urgency , little progress would be achieved ; on the other hand , the considerable financial , technological and information resources of the private sector , if applied with a sense of social responsibility , could contribute to the cause of human rights .  
Among the general factors are significant technological innovations ; high indebtedness and stringent budget constraints limiting the public sectors ability to meet increasing infrastructure needs ; the expansion of international and local capital markets , with a consequent improvement in access to private funding ; and an increasing number of successful international experiences with private participation and competition in infrastructure .  
For that purpose , the Guide helps identify areas of law that are typically most relevant to private capital investment in public infrastructure projects and discusses the content of those laws which would be conducive to attracting private capital , national and foreign.The Guide is not intended to provide advice on drafting agreements for the execution of privately financed infrastructure projects .  
In cases where public ownership and control is desired , direct private financing as well as infrastructure operation under commercial principles may be achieved by establishing a separate legal entity controlled by the Government to own and operate the project .  
Where the facility is operated pursuant to a governmental licence , private ownership of physical assets ( e.g . a telecommunication network ) is often separable from the licence to provide the service to the public ( e.g . long-distance telephone services ) , in that the licence can be withdrawn by the competent public authority under certain circumstances .  
In addition to loans and guarantees extended by commercial banks and national or multilateral public financial institutions , in a number of cases public funds have been combined with private capital for financing new projects.Such public funds may originate from government income or sovereign borrowing .  
While rules of private international law often allow considerable freedom to choose the law governing commercial contracts , that freedom is in some countries restricted for contracts and legal relationships that are not qualified as commercial , such as , for instance , certain contracts entered into by public authorities of the host country ( for example , guarantees and assurances by the Government , power purchase or fuel supply commitments by a public authority ) or contracts with consumers .  
Market liberalization has led to spectacular , if not always consistent , growth , but it has also led to greater inequality and polarization within and among societies ; some regions have been mostly overlooked by private capital , and in all regions the swift withdrawal of investor confidence can lead to economic collapse and social distress .  
The extent to which an effective mix of public and private contributions can provide optimal development and equitable well-being is also subject to forces of the global economy and the support of the international community .  
Achieving an efficient system of services may require innovative modes of provision that entail an adequate mix of public , private and non-profit participation and mobilizing new resources from the supply side ; basic social services should be financed through taxation , not user fees , which , in many cases , never revert to the facilities for which they were intended ;  
The drop in aid contributions , especially the continuing decline in the share of net official development assistance in the gross domestic product of donor countries , had led to increased reliance on private loans on the international capital market .  
Corruption in both the public sector and the private sector , regardless of the level at which it occurs , can jeopardize free trade , distort competitiveness and undermine the stability upon which the free market system is based . 12 Companies may resort to bribery as a means of bypassing existing trade barriers or reducing national tariffs and expediting international trade .  
It is a paradox that some rich countries have such lax laws that they provide safe havens and encourage private banks to launder illicit funds looted by corrupt persons from poor countries by facilitating the establishment of secret accounts .  
As we are aware , the financial situation of the continent is characterized by an enormous external debt , stagnant national savings , as well as declining official development assistance and weak private capital flows .

There is an ongoing lamentable tendency to downgrade the importance and significance of official development assistance ( ODA ) , which is a vital resource for poorer developing countries with little or no access to international private capital .  
It is essential to focus on creating an economic environment at the global and the national level that is conducive to longterm investment in productive capacity by both indigenous and foreign private investors .  
Governments call upon United Nations organizations , NGOs , the private sector and relevant civil society organizations to show strong political will and commitment to human development and direct investments to these critical areas .  
A third part is the increasingly large and unpredictable private capital flows across national boundaries that have substantially reduced the leverage of Governments , particularly of developing countries , in controlling their economic fate .  
The decrease in official development assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , must be reversed , especially when it was not compensated for by major flows of private capital .

First , rapidly rising income would allow domestic savings to rise , thereby increasing the amount of total investable resources ; and secondly , sustained growth would attract private capital as a substitute for official financing .  
The level and share of gross capital formation have grown in recent years , reflecting the unabated boom in private residential construction activity since 1994 .  
According to WHO , publicly funded medical care is approximately one third to one fourth the size of private medical care in terms of financing , clearly indicating wide inequality of access to adequate health care , both preventive and curative .

The United States representative noted that rapid growth in international private investment , lending and trade meant that private capital flows now exceeded ODA as the foremost source of external capital available to developing countries generally . 
It was therefore urgent that LDCs and the international community be encouraged to foster private entrepreneurship , create a domestic environment conducive to foreign investment and expand trade internally , regionally and to the world at large .  
Past experience had shown that developing countries which pursued policies encouraging private investment , trade , and entrepreneurship , along with appropriate social investment , had achieved remarkable economic growth in a short span of time .  
The majority of developing countries were unable to attract external private capital ; their share in world trade had continued to decline , contributing to low levels of development and inadequate infrastructure .  
Lastly , he stressed the importance of moving beyond the NorthSouth divide and developing partnerships with key nongovernmental actors in globalization , including international economic institutions , the private sector and civil society .  
Flows of private capital to certain developing countries must not be counted as contributions towards sustainable development , as the main driving force behind them was the profit motive , and not the wellbeing of future generations .  
Despite the modest growth achieved by many heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPCs ) , debt restructuring continued to pose problems , and those countries remained exposed to the adverse developments in commodity prices , interest rates and private capital flows .  
Regarding commercial debt of LDCs , orderly and equitable workout procedures should be established , with explicit responsibilities of creditors and debtors and clearly defined roles for the public and private sectors .  
The Minister defined the key objective of the Government as fighting poverty and improving the living conditions of the population by developing strong partnerships with the private sector , civil society and the donor community .

To ensure true respect for freedom of the press and equal access of the various political forces to the public and private media , whether written or audio-visual , under a regulatory system that is in line with democratic principles ;  
In order to maximize its impact , effective and meaningful cooperation must be established among Governments , multilateral development institutions , the donor community , the private sector , civil society , academic institutions and other relevant stakeholders in other words , strategic alliances must be created .  
The Special Rapporteur then examines the differences between traditional and new forms of mercenary activities , the relationship between terrorism and mercenary activities , the problems raised in connection with respect for human rights and international humanitarian law by private security and military assistance companies operating internationally and the limits and shortcomings of the legal definition of mercenary activities .  
Governments , relevant United Nations agencies , Bretton Woods institutions and civil society organizations ( including unions , the private sector , mass media and universities ) should all be actively involved in identifying the most effective ways to achieve sustainable social outcomes for children .  
Accordingly , the European Union had decided to support the reforms undertaken in UNIDO since the adoption of the Business Plan at the 1997 General Conference , involving , inter alia , implementation of integrated programmes in the beneficiary countries , strengthening its field offices , and the coordination effort undertaken to enhance cohesion between United Nations agencies as well as coherent action at local level by public and private agents involved in joint projects .  
Its contribution would , however , be more effective if the international economic environment was more propitious , with better distribution of foreign direct investment and private financial flows , market access , a lasting solution to the debt problem and enhanced levels of development finance .  
In conclusion , she expressed satisfaction about the increased convergence amongst different development actors in the private and public sectors , and stated that this was a highly desirable starting point in efforts to improve the situation of the LDCs in the coming decade .  
It was therefore urgent that LDCs and the international community be encouraged to foster private entrepreneurship , create a domestic environment conducive to foreign investment and expand trade internally , regionally and to the world at large .  
Past experience had shown that developing countries which pursued policies encouraging private investment , trade , and entrepreneurship , along with appropriate social investment , had achieved remarkable economic growth in a short span of time .  
The European Union considered that there was a need for parallel action on all fronts : the fight against poverty , suppression of trafficking , prosecution of those responsible , education and training , and rehabilitation of child victims ; and that all parties concerned must be mobilized , that international cooperation must be strengthened by multilateral , regional and bilateral arrangements as necessary , and that the private sector ( tourism industry , Internet exploiters ) must be mobilized .  
Ensuring adequate and affordable access to energy for present and future generations , in an environmentally sound , socially acceptable and economically viable way will require considerable efforts and substantial investments , including from the private sector .  
He drew attention to the fact that Saudi Arabia had submitted requests for membership in the Committee on several occasions and on 24 May 2000 had addressed to the Committee a memorandum on that subject in which it had outlined its expertise and activities with regard to outer space and the measures it had taken to encourage private sector participation in such activities at the national , regional and international levels . 
Not only are private capital flows , including foreign direct investment , increasingly concentrated in a small number of emerging markets , but also a part of such flows is too unstable to constitute a reliable source of development finance .  
Some delegations stated that ODA could play a catalytic and complementary role in relation to private sector resource flows in achieving development objectives , including by assisting developing countries in strengthening their civil , political , economic and financial institutions .  
An international observatory should be established to monitor racially discriminatory attitudes and acts , individual or collective , private or public , including by non-State actors , charged with the following tasks :  
International and regional forums will be established and expanded to bring together legal and technical experts in computer and telecommunications issues , from both the public and private sectors , to develop materials in support of the fight against transnational computer-related crime .  
A coherent SME policy framework is an essential component of a private sector development strategy where the primary objective is to create productive employment and foster equitable development .  
Those delegations were of the view that it would be inappropriate for the Subcommittee to give detailed consideration to matters falling within the field of private law and consequently attention should be focused exclusively on the compatibility with existing international space law of the draft Unidroit convention and preliminary draft protocol thereto on matters specific to space property .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
Critical factors to stimulate productive capacity include : stable macro-economic conditions , a conducive legal and regulatory framework , adequate institutional , physical and social infrastructure and a vibrant private sector .  
Its activities included raising awareness among families and communities of the rights of the child ; publicizing the relevant laws and instruments , such as the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child ; promoting the creation of nurseries , day-care centres , orphanages and welcoming centres ; supporting private initiatives for training and supervision during early childhood ; and taking charge of juvenile delinquents by re-educating them when they were in specialized institutions or in prison and by helping them with subsequent reintegration .  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
Urges States , international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome , so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care , research and treatment of the population in the affected countries ;  
As summarized by the joint statement of the Co-Chairmen at the conclusion of the second substantive session of the Committee , it is obvious that international private flows can make important contributions to development , and that foreign direct investment can be an effective instrument to help fill the savings / investment gap in many developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
Two main challenges in this respect , both for developing and developed countries , are to generally encourage greater flows of beneficial private investment into developing countries and countries with economies in transition ( volume ) , especially through the development and continuous amelioration of new and innovative financial instruments , and to direct these private financial flows to developing countries and countries with economies in transition , regions or sectors that do not yet benefit from such flows or are particularly dependent on external assistance ( distribution ) .  
Ending corruption is fundamental for mobilizing domestic resources , and increased direct and indirect measures are required , including increased transparency , in both government and private sector activities .  Fighting corruption is one of the main priorities of the development agenda and this has been a strong message from a wide spectrum of countries .  
An integrated approach to development , including consistency in policy-making , drawing upon synergies of different policy areas and comparative advantages of different actors , leading to an effective mobilization of financing for development from both public and private sources , is crucial for achieving the international development targets .  
As stressed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the opening meeting of the second session of the Committee , if the agreed objectives are to be attained , a large-scale , concerted effort must be made by the many different actors involved , including both rich and poor , the public and the private sectors , civil society , international institutions , and commercial and voluntary entities .  
All countries must realize that the mobilization of domestic resources for development calls for a supportive environment in which sound macroeconomic policies are applied ( stabilization of public finance , control of inflation , use of effective and efficient mechanisms for the distribution of public expenditure ) and favourable conditions in which the private sector can grow .  
Other essential factors in promoting the mobilization of domestic resources for development are political stability , good governance and the rule of law , a sound and transparent legal system , guarantees for private investors , transparency in public administration , markets and companies , respect for contract law and private property , efforts to combat corruption at the national and international levels , the participation of citizens and civil society in public life , and equal access to resources for women and men .  
Recognition of the particular problems faced by small island developing States relating to their remoteness from major markets , modest natural resource and export bases , narrow skills bases , heavy reliance on costly imports , limited access to private capital , and vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental degradation .  
The role of the private sector in the implementation of the UNFF plan of action could be twofold : first , as an important implementing agent of specific IPF / IFF proposals for action that are specifically addressed to the private sector ; and second , as a crucial financing source to complement national and international public funds .  
However , IFF recognized that private sector investment should not be considered a substitute for international public funding , including ODA . 11 In addition , the IPF / IFF process recognized the important , but differentiated , contributions of the public and private sectors , while stressing the role of Governments in fostering an enabling policy environment . 
Other relevant and interested international and regional organizations , institutions and instruments that are not members of CPF , including non-governmental organizations , private sector entities and other major groups , will be invited to contribute to specific activities of CPF , for example , certain projects , programmes , expert meetings and other activities , where their competencies would enrich the thematic work of CPF in the implementation of IPF / IFF proposals for action .  
Policy level : UNFF could call upon Governments to provide guidance to the governing bodies of the CPF members , as well as send specific calls to governing bodies , inter alia , to encourage CPF to increase joint programming ; and to continue to seek political support , as well as to have regular contacts with non-governmental organizations , private sector entities and other major groups ; Operational level : UNFF could call upon CPF to support its work at three operational levels by :  
However , the distinction between the validity of the contract creating or evidencing the security right and the validity of the security right as a property right is not universally prevalent , with some legal regimes extending the liberal validating rules of private international law applicable to the formal validity of contracts to the formal validity of the security right as a property right .  
The Hague Conference on Private International Law has recently undertaken the preparation of a fast track convention designed to create uniformity in the relevant conflicts rules and the European Unions draft directive on collateral also endorses a mix of substantive rules and rules of private international law .  
Affirms that the term violence against women means any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life , and including domestic violence , crimes committed in the name of honour , crimes committed in the name of passion , traditional practices harmful to women , including female genital mutilation , and forced marriages ;  
As reported in document DP / 2001 / CRP . 5 , one of the strategies to achieve a higher level of audit coverage has been to encourage government counterparts to use local private audit firms where there is insufficient or limited capacity in the office of the national Auditor General to meet the audit deadline .  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
Urges States , international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome , so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care , research and treatment of the population in the affected countries ;  
The view was expressed that the increasing involvement of private industry in space activities required some clarification of specific terms within the legal instruments governing outer space activities in order to strengthen their application .  
Those delegations were of the view that it would be inappropriate for the Subcommittee to give detailed consideration to matters falling within the field of private law and consequently attention should be focused exclusively on the compatibility with existing international space law of the draft Unidroit convention and preliminary draft protocol thereto on matters specific to space property .  
It is important to ensure sustained availability and flexibility in the deployment and efficient use of adequate resources for technical assistance for capacity-building , through enhanced convergence of efforts of concerned United Nations system agencies , in partnership with key financial actors , public and private .  
How can the international community support national efforts to tap civil society and private sector resources to contribute to the provision of infrastructure and social services , so that public resources can be concentrated in other areas where there can be no substitute for government activity ?  
How to strengthen public-private partnerships , including through ODA leverage and the support of the international and regional financial institutions , to finance critical infrastructure projects and other priority development areas for developing countries and countries with economies in transition , not only by sharing risk with the private sector but also by improving awareness of business opportunities in these countries ?  
As regards the particular issue under consideration , the Working Group agreed , however , that the place of conclusion of a contract , as traditionally understood in private international law , might not provide sufficient basis for a workable solution in an electronic environment and that other , more modern concepts , such as the notion of centre of gravity of a contract or other related notions , might also be considered .  
Urge States in their national efforts , and in cooperation with regional and international financial institutions , to promote the use of public investment and encourage private investment in order to eradicate poverty , particularly in those areas in which indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities predominantly live ;  
Urge States to foster the creation , growth and expansion of minority-owned businesses by increasing access to capital through , inter alia , community development banks , work with the private sector to create jobs , help retain existing jobs and stimulate industrial and commercial growth in economically distressed areas ;  
Targeted effects : ( a ) helping to relaunch agro-land reform ; ( b ) helping to establish integrated and participatory management of catchment areas for a better use of space ; ( c ) contributing to the development of ( traditional and modern ) bio-food networks and to alternative energy production ; ( d ) facilitating access by vulnerable groups , particularly women , to private and public rural financial services ; ( e ) capacity-building in the area of State planning and monitoring-evaluation of rural development , food security and natural resources management .  
In terms of regular resources from private sector , UNICEF has consolidated a unique network of national committees in industrialized countries ( raising one third of UNICEFs resources ) and has developed alliances with important corporations , foundations and non-governmental organizations .  Those efforts resulted in a net income of US $ 165-million , which combined with the US $ 343-million from Governments and US $ 55 million from other income makes the total of US $ 563-million in core funding for 2001 .  
The report addressed the following areas : mobilizing domestic financial resources for development ; mobilizing international resources for development : foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and other private flows ; trade ; increasing international financial cooperation for development through , inter alia , ODA ; debt ; and addressing systemic issues : enhancing the coherence and consistency of the international monetary , financial and trading systems in support of development .  
The resolution establishes a consultative committee composed of experts from public , joint and private sectors and of civil society and from research centres involved with scientific and technological development in member countries .  
Taking into account that the Special Unit for TCDC is understaffed and underfunded , it must be selective in its activities , which should include : improving knowledge of all TCDC programmes worldwide ; highlighting and exchanging successful and unsuccessful development experiments ; increasing research cooperation ; developing knowledge platforms in priority areas , including increasing the usefulness of WIDE ; developing new criteria for the selection of initiatives to be supported ; and increasing the participation of new actors , e.g . , the private sector , social sector , and foundations .  
The associations rejected this measure , arguing that the National Association does not represent them and that the frequencies assigned belong to the State radio TGW , so that transferring their use to private individuals would use up the nationwide frequencies in State hands and render the current legislative process meaningless . 
However , efforts to develop agricultural , livestock , fishery and forestry production as well as Guineas rural sector , have been plagued by several obstacles , such as poor rural infrastructure and facilities , the low technical level and poor management of farms and institutional weaknesses of State services , the private sector as well as of farmers organizations .  
These include the statements in the executive summary , conclusions and recommendations of the report that private firms are engaged because the United Nations agencies are short of resources ; or that firms from countries that have sound managerial principles are not used as often as others ; or that organizations appear to choose firms from certain countries because of the perception that such firms are more knowledgeable .  
Successful implementation of the objectives , policies , commitments and measures contained in the Programme of Action will require , at the national level among other things , that these be supported by good governance through transparent , accountable , and efficient institutions and practices within the Government , the private sector and civil society .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
Critical factors to stimulate productive capacity include : stable macro-economic conditions , a conducive legal and regulatory framework , adequate institutional , physical and social infrastructure and a vibrant private sector .  
Equally , it requires the definition of a clear and consistent set of public objectives , sound macroeconomic policies , efficient management of public revenue and expenditure , better allocation of resources and incentives to prevent capital flight and to encourage private savings and tax reforms , and a solid framework to implement stabilization or economic reform programmes .  
Long-term foreign private capital flows have a complementary and catalytic role to play in building domestic supply capacity as they lead to tangible and intangible benefits , including export growth , technology and skills transfer , employment generation and poverty eradication .  
The LDC Governments should undertake this task within their respective national development framework and poverty eradication strategy , including , where they exist , PRSPs , CCAs and UNDAF , and with the involvement of civil society , including the private sector , on the basis of a broad-based inclusive dialogue .  The development partners should support agreed objectives and policies designed by LDCs on the basis of the Programme of Action and existing national development and cooperation frameworks .  
With the highest rates of infection occurring in the age group of those between 24 and 54 years old , the productive capacity of the country is being diminished simultaneously with greater demands on our meagre financial resources , both private and public , for increased spending on care and facilities for the victims and to mitigate the devastating social and economic consequences of the disease .  
They further express their confidence that the results of the twenty-sixth special session of the General Assembly will include a comprehensive approach for a worldwide frontal attack on that pandemic , and recognize that prevention , care , support , and treatment are essential aspects that require international financing and cooperation from States , international organizations , and the private sector above all , the pharmaceutical industry .  
Urge the international community , particularly donor countries , civil society , as well as the private sector to complement effectively national programmes to support programmes for children orphaned or made vulnerable by HIV / AIDS in affected regions , in countries at high risk and to direct special assistance to sub-Saharan Africa ;  
We look forward to strong leadership by Governments , and concerted efforts with full and active participation of the United Nations , the entire multilateral system , civil society , the business community and private sector ;  
Under the CDI Americas initiative , the Inter-American Development Bank is committed to establishing partnerships with international , national and local public and private organizations according to the specific needs of the countries .  
Urges States , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to take steps to improve access to public information on health and environmental issues by all people , including those affected by racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ; identify and address the adverse effects of government policies and programmes on the human health and environment in targeted areas ; and promote compliance with and enforcement of all health and environmental laws , including in areas inhabited by racial or ethnic minorities , indigenous peoples , or low-income populations ;  
Urges / invites Governments , the private sector and international [ financial ] institutions , [ particularly / including the World Bank and regional development banks ] , to promote participation by persons belonging to / members of all groups , including [ minority groups ] individuals and groups affected by or vulnerable to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , in economic , cultural and social decision-making at all stages and levels [ in the development and implementation of poverty alleviation strategies , development projects , and trade and market assistance programmes ] ;  
In order to achieve economic development , the Government intended to apply strict fiscal and budgetary measures , holding inflation at about 3 per cent , enhancing the competitiveness of the domestic economy and improving the business environment so as to promote the development of the private sector .  
It has also commissioned four case studies on recent developments of transit transport systems in South-East Asia , South Asia , Latin America and southern and eastern Africa , as well as a study entitled Infrastructure development in landlocked and transit developing countries : foreign aid , private investment and the transport cost burden on landlocked developing countries .  
Each regional commission is expected to select five eminent persons from its region from a cross-section of stakeholders , including experts from Governments , research institutions and the private sector , in their personal capacities , with a view to developing ideas for concrete initiatives from regional and subregional perspectives within the framework and in support of the substantive agenda of the Conference .  
We are convinced that the United Nations system is uniquely placed to play a key role in supporting Africas efforts and to help create a momentum for a productive and mutually beneficial partnership between Africa and the international community and civil society , including the private sector .  
Recognizing also the need to integrate and coordinate the endeavours of all the parties concerned with the development of scientific and technological capabilities , including bodies from the public , joint and private sectors and the institutions of civil society , to employ technological innovation in order to promote the productivity and competitiveness of the production and services sectors in member countries of the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia ,  
The framework law should include provisions on its purpose ; the targets or goals to be achieved and the time frame to be set for the achievement of those targets ; the means by which the purpose could be achieved described in broad terms , in particular the intended collaboration with civil society and the private sector and with international organizations ; institutional responsibility for the process ; and the national mechanisms for its monitoring , as well as possible recourse procedures .  
The Ministers noted with appreciation enhanced CEI cooperation in the fields of promoting sustainable social , economic and ecological development , infrastructure and private sector investment , SME development , transborder and interregional cooperation ( such as the enhanced Szeged Process ) , human resource development , cultural as well as scientific and technological cooperation ( such as the Italian-Slovenian transfrontier television project ) , including in the field of geodesy , combating organized crime , protection of minorities , womens entrepreneurship and youth affairs .  
Such a response must be inclusive and participatory and must be based on the complete convergence of the efforts of all relevant actors : Governments , multilateral and regional institutions , the private sector and civil society .  
In that connection they pointed out that States had an obligation to exercise control so as to prohibit security firms from participating in armed conflicts , creating private armies , engaging in illicit arms trafficking , being involved in the illegal extraction of natural resources and , in that context , employing mercenaries .  
With greater support from the General Assembly and the Commission , the Special Rapporteur will thus be enabled to continue to investigate such phenomena as the role of mercenaries in internal or international armed conflicts affecting the right of peoples to self-determination and at the same time to consider other phenomena in which mercenaries have a criminal involvement , such as illicit trafficking , terrorism and the formation of mercenary teams by private security companies , which use them to intervene in the internal affairs of States with which the companies sign contracts .  
That being so , although at one time the definition was considered to be a first step , the current tendency is to describe it as partial , inadequate , applying only to international conflicts and inapplicable to new approaches such as the one involving the criminal responsibility of artificial persons ( private security firms ) that hire and employ mercenaries who violate human rights .  
In view of the suggestions that emerged from the first expert meeting and the text of Commission on Human Rights resolution 2001 / 3 , it is recommended that the Special Rapporteur should continue to study mercenary activities as a means of impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination but should also take into account other situations in which mercenaries are involved , including illicit trafficking , terrorism , the use of mercenaries by private security companies to intervene in the internal affairs of States and organized crime .  
The enabling environments component of the framework focuses on government actions , such as fair trade policies , removal of technical , legal and administrative barriers to technology transfer , sound economic policy , regulatory frameworks and transparency , all of which create an environment conducive to private and public sector technology transfer .  
In light of the additional financial resources urgently required to enable countries to achieve the poverty reduction goal as well as the other Millennium development goals , the General Assembly may wish to urge Governments to continue to implement policies to enhance domestic financial resources further and to promote foreign direct investment and other private capital flows , and to put them to efficient use .  
The Council also held the fourth special high-level meeting with the Bretton Woods institutions on two themes : development financing , in particular poverty eradication , ODA and debt ; and a move forward to a development-friendly international financial system : public and private responsibility in the prevention of financial crisis .  
Within individual countries , whether developed or developing , globalization is by no means reflected in a more equitable distribution of income , but rather aggravates existing economic injustice , insofar as it favours the concentration of capital and wealth in the hands of private interests , while opening the way for exclusion , especially as lay-offs increase .  
The members of these Councils included representatives of teachers , parents , students and government authorities at the municipal , departmental and national levels and , where appropriate , representatives of indigenous organizations , the private sector , universities and other sectors of civil society connected with educational development .  
Governments , donors , non-governmental organizations and the private sector should develop specific assistance programmes and advisory services for the development of the economic skills of rural women in banking , modern trading and financial procedures , matching the requirements of the market economy .  
The Meeting had presented a unique opportunity for public and private actors and trade negotiators and practitioners from both developed and developing countries , as well as WTO members and non-members alike , to express their views and concerns in an international forum .  
In such a culture , Governments would live up to their responsibilities , armed groups would respect the recognized rules of international humanitarian law , the private sector would be conscious of the impact of its engagement in crisis areas , and Member States and international organizations would display the necessary commitment to ensuring decisive and rapid action in the face of crisis .  
I urge Member States to adopt and enforce executive and legislative measures to prevent private sector actors within their jurisdiction from engaging in commercial activities with parties to armed conflict that might result in or contribute to systematic violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
The forms of conflict most prevalent in the world today are internal communal violence , ethnic cleansing , terrorism , private wars financed by the international trade in diamonds or oil and involve a proliferation of armed groups .  
I urge Member States to adopt and enforce executive and legislative measures to prevent private sector actors within their jurisdiction from engaging in commercial activities with parties to armed conflict that might result in or contribute to systematic violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
It appears that an effective and viable strategy for private sector involvement in financial crises in emerging markets would be to combine voluntary mechanisms designed to facilitate debt restructuring with internationally sanctioned temporary standstills to be used when needed .  
While it was recognized that the primary responsibility for development in least developed countries rested with the least developed countries themselves , the Brussels Declaration acknowledged that their efforts needed to be given concrete and substantial international support from Governments and international organizations in a spirit of shared responsibility through genuine partnerships , inter alia , with the civil society and the private sector .  
The Programme of Action acknowledged that successful implementation of the objectives , policies , commitments and measures contained in the Programme of Action would require , at the national level , among other things , that these be supported by good governance through transparent , accountable , and efficient institutions and practices within the Government , the private sector and civil society .  
As regards physical infrastructure , development partners committed to supporting infrastructure development , both through public investment and by facilitating private investment , and particularly for the creation of essential infrastructure to facilitate the functioning of liberalized domestic and regional markets .  
The least developed countries committed to increasing public and private investments in agriculture and programmes for rural economic and social infrastructure , increasing the access of the poor , particularly women , to support services and production resources , and encouraging structural adaptations in production , processing and marketing systems .  
Development partners agreed to support least developed countries efforts to increase public and private investment , and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on favourable terms , and provide technical support for geologic mapping and compilation of basic data on local mineral potential , product adaptation and market studies for small - and medium-scale mines , as well as acquisition of new technologies .  
As regards FDI and other private external flows , the Programme of Action recognizes that a stable economic , legal and institutional framework is crucial in order to attract foreign investment and to promote sustainable development through investment .  
The promotion of a conducive macroeconomic environment , good governance and democracy , as well as strengthening structural aspects of the economy and improved institutional and human capacities , was regarded as important also in the context of attracting FDI and other private external flows .  
Urges States and encourages the private sector to promote the development by the media , including the print and electronic media , including the Internet and advertising , taking into account their independence , through their relevant associations and organizations at the national , regional and international levels , of a voluntary ethical code of conduct and self-regulatory measures , in order : ( a ) To combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and do away with stereotypes ;  
Decides to extend an invitation to participate in the Social Forum to non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council and other non-governmental organizations outside Geneva and particularly newly emerging actors in the South , such as smaller groups , grass-roots organizations , voluntary , youth associations , community organizations , trade unions and associations of workers , representatives of the private sector , United Nations agencies , the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , the regional economic commissions , international financial institutions and development agencies ;  
Decides to extend an invitation to participate in the Social Forum to non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council and other non-governmental organizations outside Geneva and particularly newly emerging actors in the South , such as smaller groups , grass-roots organizations , voluntary , youth associations , community organizations , trade unions and associations of workers , representatives of the private sector , United Nations agencies , the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , the regional economic commissions , international financial institutions and development agencies ;  
In paragraph 19 of its resolution 55 / 186 , the General Assembly requested the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) to provide information on the work it has undertaken to support the promotion of long-term private financial flows , especially foreign direct investment , inter alia , through enhanced technical cooperation , to all developing countries as well as economies in transition , in particular the least developed countries and other developing countries with special difficulties in attracting private financial flows .  
Furthermore , it was reported that the relevant authorities were revising labour legislation governing the private sector with a view to producing model legislation conducive to the implementation of a policy of economic and social development .  
Urges States and encourages the private sector to promote the development by the media , including the print and electronic media , including the Internet and advertising , taking into account their independence , through their relevant associations and organizations at the national , regional and international levels , of a voluntary ethical code of conduct and self-regulatory measures , in order : ( a ) To combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and do away with stereotypes ;  
Any future international information security regime should provide for a harmonized ban on the collection , storage , use or dissemination of information about a persons private life without his or her agreement and on restrictions to public access to information , except where sanctioned in law .  The globalization of the information area has blurred the traditional concepts of geographical , State and administrative boundaries or areas of jurisdiction that normally delimit national security .  
Encourages the international donor community , relevant United Nations bodies and the private sector to provide support , including financial and technical support , for data collection and greater empirical research by Member States , particularly developing countries , and the relevant bodies of the United Nations system on the causes and patterns of migration , including on irregular migration and trafficking , as well as its social , economic and demographic impacts , and for documenting and disseminating information on successful migration management programmes ;  
He laid out the following five areas which Japan attached maximum priority in providing its assistance : ( i ) poverty reduction and social development ; ( ii ) human resources development and capacity-building for policy formulation and implementation ; ( iii ) fostering the LDCs private sector ; ( iv ) democratization ; and , ( v ) reduction of debt-burden .  
Faced with dwindling ODA , as indicated in paragraph 17 above , and bearing in mind the need to bridge the infrastructure gap ( illustrated in table 3 ) , landlocked developing countries , in keeping with global trends , have been increasingly attracted by new modes of partnership between the public and the private sectors in the development of public infrastructure , such as contracting out or management contracts , private financing of public facilities , leasing , joint ventures , build-operate-transfer ( BOT ) schemes and privatization or capitalization .  
At the national level , three distinct but complementary institutional structures are emerging to reflect the expanding role of the private sector as the main provider of transport and related commercial services .  
First , as the public sector retreats from commercial services , allowing the private sector to take the leading role , the public sector is assuming the role of regulator to ensure fair competition among service providers , protecting the consumer against monopoly abuse and enforcing quality and safety standards to protect the consumer .  
The international community should continue to support policy , legislative , regulatory and institutional reforms at the national and regional levels , establishing autonomous accountable transport authorities , strengthening private sector associations and promoting modalities for fostering effective dialogue between the public and private sectors .  
The Money Matters Institutes mission is to foster dialogue among leaders of financial services , international institutions and policy makers in developing countries to encourage the most realistic role for private capital in financing sustainable development , and to generate the requisite supporting data about emerging economies so as to facilitate this purpose .  
The panellists suggested that less reliance on private capital flows should be a common goal for all developing countries , because of ( i ) the volatility of such flows , ( ii ) the likelihood that financial flows to developing countries would decline in reaction to the less optimistic outlook for the global economy and to the falling profitability of FDI in major recipient countries , and ( iii ) the lack of meaningful international financial reforms .  
The expected American military action on Afghanistan , backed by the support of the allied States , was launched on the seventh of this month as a response to the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington last month , which shook the whole world with the heavy losses of the lives of innocent people , and the extensive destruction of a number of public and private properties it caused in the United States of America . 
High rates of unemployment , in particular among young people , the non-functioning of the national safety net system , scarce opportunities for private investment , declining domestic production and other financial , cultural and criminal factors have contributed to political instability .  
We must make good use of the forthcoming Review Conference to take more effective measures to address the remaining two core issues : strict control of private ownership and prevention of the transfer of small arms to non-state actors .  We continue to believe that the Conference on Disarmament is the single multilateral negotiating forum for all relevant disarmament matters .  
The forthcoming International Conference on Financing for Development would be addressing the inequities inherent in the global economy and would bring together for the first time the United Nations , the Bretton Woods institutions , the private sector and civil society to consider how to reform the current financial system and find means of increasing cooperation to stimulate financial flows to the developing countries . 
His delegation sincerely hoped that the International Conference on Financing for Development would be able to address in a more meaningful way the marginalization of developing countries with a view to changing the decision-making processes , adjusting the terms of trade , rescheduling the external debt and mobilizing public and private capital flows at national and international levels .  
It had been encouraging to see the positive response of the private sector , non-governmental organizations and civil society to forging a partnership with the United Nations system in order to advance the global efforts to bridge the digital divide .  69 .  His own Government had adopted a comprehensive approach to the promotion of science and technology .  
Austria congratulated the Commission secretariat on organizing a Colloquium on Privately Financed Infrastructure in Vienna in July and endorsed the initiative to establish a Working Group to draft a core model law , because a legislative and regulatory framework for infrastructure projects would send a reassuring signal to all potential private investors and might help to attract private investment for infrastructure projects in developing States .  
The European Union also wished to stress that the victims of HIV / AIDS should receive adequate social protection ; that minimum standards should be set for social protection tailored to individual countries ; and that it unreservedly supported the Secretary-Generals Global Compact as an instrument for promoting the responsibility of the private sector for social development and social protection .  
It was therefore the role of the International Conference on Financing for Development to provide developing countries with realistic advice enabling them to reformulate domestic policies and review regulatory constraints that were currently hampering the growth of the private sector and discouraging foreign investment .  
It was important to cooperate to find common solutions that would make it possible to reduce the vulnerability of the economies of the developing countries which was linked to the instability of external resources and inequitable access to private capital markets and to strengthen the world financial system so that it would serve the interests of all and lead to the attainment of the development goals established by the international community .  
The mobilization of additional resources , both domestic and foreign , was essential in order to achieve higher levels of growth and more effective poverty eradication ; private capital flows , and the promotion of trade , which would generate foreign capital , particularly in countries which had not been able to attract international financial flows , were equally important .  
While the primary responsibility for development in the least developed countries rested with those countries themselves , their efforts must be supplemented by concrete and substantial support from the international community , in a spirit of shared responsibility and genuine partnership which included civil society and the private sector .  
Given the deepening interdependence arising from globalization , holistic and participatory solutions should be sought and partnerships among the major stakeholders , donors , recipients and the public and private sector should be strengthened , in line with the initiative of the Secretary-General on the Global Compact .  
In addition to these personal aids , the State also runs a scheme of building aids , which are intended for public contractors ( such as the low cost housing fund , the national society for low cost housing and the communes ) or private contractors ( such as non-profit making companies contributing to broader subsidized housing programmes ) .  
I take heart from the new alliances I saw taking shape in Durban : the role that parliamentarians can play was highlighted by the Inter-Parliamentary Union ; the national human rights commissions sent us a powerful expression of their determination to play their part ; the treaty bodies and the special mechanisms of the Commission on Human Rights played an active part ; the vital role of the media and the private sector in combating racism was emphasized .

Highlights of the work of the Legal Subcommittee had included its discussion of a new agenda item entitled Consideration of the draft convention of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law ( UNIDROIT ) on international interests in mobile equipment and the preliminary draft protocol thereto on matters specific to space property , a timely issue because of the increased participation of private entities in space activities . 
His delegation welcomed the efforts of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law ( UNIDROIT ) with regard to a draft convention on international interests in mobile equipment and the preliminary draft protocol thereto on matters specific to space property ; given the growth in commercial use of outer space and the increasing role played by the private sector , further work was necessary to develop legal instruments and regulations to deal with matters such as financing , mortgages and guarantees .

Sixty scientific academies of the InterAcademy Panel on International Issues ( IAP ) in May 2000,5 stressed that scientific , technological and health capabilities can produce substantial progress over the next two decades towards a sustainable human future and that this progress will demand a threefold effort by the scientific and technological community : to promote the use of existing knowledge more widely and effectively ; to generate new knowledge and beneficial technologies ; and to work with Governments , international organizations and the private sector to promote a worldwide transition to sustainability .

Concerning finance , the Ministers had highlighted the importance of meeting the targets for official development assistance , the need to encourage private sector participation in the promotion of sustainable development through appropriate incentives , ensuring that additional funds were available to the Global Environment Facility , the need for debt relief for highly indebted poor countries , and ensuring market access in developed countries for the exports of developing countries .  
The Committee therefore requested that the Government provide information on the manner in which direct or indirect gender bias is removed from the wage systems established pursuant to the Wages Act and on the methods used by private sector employers in establishing wage rates in enterprises , institutions or other organizations in accordance with differences in tasks and conditions of work ( see sect . 9 of the Wages Act ) .

( Agence France-Presse , Tokyo , 26th ) - National Tax Agency of Japan said the prolonged economic recession in Japan has already hit employees in the private sector throughout Japan . The average annual wages of private company employees has decreased for the fourth consecutive year .  
President Paqieco pointed out in his speech after signing the bill that the " National Competitiveness commission " was formed by people in charge of economic , foreign trade , agriculture , tourism , transportation and other public or private sectors .  The commission set down strategy , plan and implementation programs , which involves 5 aspects as infrastructure , engergy , telecommunication , social security and capital flow .  
The report said the three northern European countries are most outstanding in the areas of " industrial network readiness " and " measures of sustainable development , " while the United States is ranked first in " improving the environment for innovation and R &amp; amp ; D , " an area most representative of economic growth and competitiveness , and in " creating an enterprise environment that is more conducive for private sector economy . "  
In June 1995 , Li Teng-hui paid a visit to the United States in a so-called " private " capacity .  The Chinese Government launched a decisive anti-splittism and anti - " Taiwan independence " struggle and lodged a strong protest against the action of the US Government openly allowing Li Teng-hui to visit the United States , which violated the pledges made by the United States in the three Sino-US joint communiques and serious damaged China 's sovereignty , and solemnly and justly took up the matter with the US side .  
It is also worth mentioning that the private companies under Chen ostensibly included some joint ventures with Hong Kong businesses , some joint ventures with banks , and also some joint ventures with the Yuhu Prefectural Government . As such , public ownership were intermixed with private ownership to give people many false impressions and make it difficult for people to discern their nature off-hand .  This was to make it easy for them to profit from confusion and to slip away unpunished in the event of an exposure of their offenses .  
A group of leading cadres in Liaoning Province who violated policies by occupying too many houses , illegally taking funds for housing purchases , illegally turning public houses into private ones , and using public funds to renovate houses beyond the standard were investigated and handled sternly .  Party and government disciplinary measures were taken against 62 cadres at or above the county department level in the province , and eight people were transferred to judicial organs to be investigated and affixed criminal responsibilities .  
It is necessary to maintain a good image of strictly disciplining ourselves and practicing clean and honest government , take a correct view of the powers in our hands , take the lead in observing discipline and law , persist in honest administration , and wage resolute struggle against negative phenomena of corruption such as abuse of power , harming the public for private profit , using public office for private gain , and extravagance and waste .  
He regarded the powers granted him by the party and people as a means for pursuing individual private interests , engaged in bribery and corruption in a big way , and wildly extorted money , reaching a stage where he was blinded with lust for gain and was audacious in the extreme .  
We should continue to improve the ownership structure where the public ownership plays a dominant role and various economic elements develop simultaneously and to develop nongovernmental scientific and technological enterprises , three types of joint ventures , and private and individual economic sectors , so as to make the economy of the capital full of vigor and vitality .  
Deputy Doje Cering , commissioner of the Ngari Prefectural Administrative Office in Tibet , said : Thanks to its national unity and social stability , Ngari Prefecture has attracted more and more people from the interior of the country to do business or set up enterprises in the prefecture .  The prefecture 's annual tax revenue from the individual and private economic sectors increased from less than 100,000 yuan in 1997 to more than 1-million yuan in 1999 .  
Tanzania , Rwanda , and some other African countries have recently expressed one after another that they would never allow the religious groups that " affect social stability or engage in reactionary deeds " to launch activities within their territories , and they would take resolute actions against the cults that " seek private gains , publicize heretical beliefs , and collect money and property to get rich " in order to " prevent the recurrence of the Uganda Tragedy . "  
Hu Changqing lived a life of utter decadence and corruption and was not afraid to reveal his insatiable avaricious nature .  From that standpoint , to say that Hu Changqing hanged out with the rich and used his power to seek private gain was to put it politely .  In fact he was a complete political hooligan . "  
Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , we have been implementing an economic system that takes public ownership as the mainstay and encourages common development of multiple economic sectors .  We have broken down the unitary system of ownership by the whole people under the traditional planned economic system .  This has given rise to an economic situation characterized by the common development of different economic sectors amid competition , including state-owned economy , collective economy , individual economy , private economy and foreign businessmen 's economy .  
Sometimes maybe only units of a certain armed service are needed , but usually combined forces including active units and reserve forces are needed " .  " In the meantime , the skills and resources provided by multinational forces , regional organizations , international bodies , non-government organizations , voluntary organizations , and private organizations should be adequately made use of , if possible " , to ensure that the US army 's " non-war military operation " will achieve the intended objective .  
As for inventing pretexts , complying in appearance but opposing in heart , refusing to comply with regulations , continuing to take in and spend - - all must be dealt with as soon as discovered .  Likewise for withholding , appropriating and siphoning off funds for private use .  Privately saving public monies , setting up " small exchequers " , and other such perverse and illegal activities will also be severely dealt with .  
What the hostile western forces want to preserve is the capitalist private ownership system and the political and economic systems , values , and way of life that the bourgeoisie highly esteem , and all this runs counter to the essence of the socialist system under communist party leadership .  
The share of direct government investments among the total amount of investments society-wide will be reduced , while the share of independent , non-government investments , including individual , private , and foreign capital , will go up .  
All this does not tally with the guideline set by the 15th National CPC Congress . To give private enterprises equal treatment is not an expedient measure under the condition of underdeveloped productive forces .  It is a long-term policy for at least 100 years required by our basic system during the initial stage of socialism .  
Therefore , a large portion of the US ' scientific research capability is focused in private departments , university / technical schools , and scientific research centers relying on Department of Defense funds .  They have strong executive mechanisms which organize and maintain a tight relationship between the " procurer " and research center .  
the import of technological equipment for private use by domestic-investment and foreign-investment industrial projects encouraged by the state , as well as superior industrial projects within their total amount of investments in the western region , will be exempted from paying tariffs and the import value-added tax , with an exception for commodities that are not allowed to enjoy tax exemption as stipulated by the state .  
2 ) as nonpublic enterprises are numerous in number and distributed in extensive areas , the management and supervision of their safety are ineffective .  Moreover , there really existed the tendencies that a small number of government workers in charge of supervision and management of production safety neglected their duties and that some corrupt elements even collaborated with lawbreakers so that some owners of individual and private businesses in violation of laws and regulations became emboldened in the knowledge that they had strong backing ;  
Lai Changxing at that time relied on the network of connections he had woven over many years in key Party , government and military organs by wearing the hat of a private entrepreneur who was famous all over the country , a member of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference of Fujian Province and an honorary citizen of Xiamen City , among other political glories .  
There is a need to lift the planned economy-flavored " accession " limit , open up various investment channels at home , let abundant private capitals inject blood into the long anemic car industry , and change the government 's monopolistic management marked by its interfering in everything and switch into a system enabling the sector to exercise self-discipline .  
In the last 10 years , China 's private enterprises ' average registered capital has increased from 93,000 yuan to 681,000 yuan , increasing by more than 6 folds , but each enterprise 's employment has been reduced from 18.1 persons to 13.4 persons , cutting back by as much as one-quarter .  
This means each 100,000 yuan increase in capital only increased employment by 1 person .  This equipment level is comparable to the Chinese industries ' current average equipment level , and the trend is for the level to rise year after year .  The private economy 's labor-intensive characteristic is fast eroding .  
In sharp contrast to the slump in fixed asset investments is the continued and abnormal rise in registered capital and output value of the civilian-run economy , represented by the private economic sector .  
During the " Ninth Five-year Plan " period , the annual rate of increase in the private economic sector 's registered capital hovered between 36.3 percent and 43.1 percent ; the annual rate of increase in total output value ranged between 21.6 percent to 49.2 percent .  Both displayed a pattern of rapid and steady growth , and behind the rapid increase in capital seemed to be a strong investment momentum .  
As a result , the DPP government under Chen Shui-bian has the " multi-party coalition government " , and if there are contradictions among the various party factions on the one China or " Taiwan is a sovereign , independent nation " , no choice can be made , and no unified consensus can be formed .  So the enlightened coalition government trick will in the final analysis be only a struggle of private interests .  
NSC Consultative Committee Member Ko Chen-heng has seriously considered this issue .  He thinks that the system under which the military 's command authority belongs to the minister of national defense in peacetime and to the chief of the general staff during wartime is dangerous and is faulty in design .  Ko Chen-heng told his friends in private that the only military suggestion that he , as a Consultative Committee member , has given President Chen is : " The command authority in the military command system must be an integral whole and should not be divided " .  
In a recent speech at a forum in Zhejiang , entitled " New and High Technology , and Risk Investment , " the renowned economist Wu Jinglian said : With the evaporation of bubbles of the Nasdaq , which represents US high-tech shares , there has been an upsurge of Chinese students returning home from their high and new technology jobs in the United States . As Zhejiang has the features of rich private capital and flexible enterprise mechanisms , the wave of returned Chinese students from abroad will bring new opportunities to Zhejiang 's economic development .  
To fulfill the tasks in the transitional period and realize the change into socialism , the key lay in the proper accomplishment of the socialist transformation .  That was an ownership revolution of guiding individual and private economies into socialism .  
Through a special form of redemption , that is , the paying of fixed interest to original owners of the private businesses , the most complicated task in our country 's socialist transformation was smoothly and stably accomplished .  
Communist China will extensively revise its party constitution at the 16th CPC National Congress to be held next year .  Besides the inclusion of Jiang Zemin 's " three represents , " the revised party constitution will include content on expanding the representation of party membership .  People of various social strata will be allowed to join the party , including proprietors of private enterprises , individual business operators , and those who are not " proletariat " so long as they are " ideologically and politically " qualified with correct " behavior . "  
A large number of private enterprise owners and individual business operators have emerged .  Besides , there are also people at managerial level of foreign funded enterprises and independent workers .  Therefore , China 's society can no longer be divided simply based on people 's class content .  
Qiu Xiaohua was of the view that this year the theme of China 's economy is steady growth .  He predicted that steady growth in China 's domestic demand will be maintained in the near future and growths in both government and private investment will see a good development trend .  He added that , because of the government 's policy of encouraging utilization of foreign capital , it is expected that growth in foreign capital utilization also will be quite satisfactory .  
When the Central Committee delegation 's private aircraft landed at Xigaze Airport , masses of all nationalities sounded gongs and drums and leapt into a lively dance .  Representatives of the masses presented hada , carved agate , and highland barley wine to the members of the delegation , and expressed their warm welcome and heartfelt best wishes to their honored guests who had traveled from afar .  
Since coming to power , the Bush administration has stressed seeking " absolute security " for the US and attached importance to the " potential challenges " posed by regional powers .  Communist Chinese Foreign Ministry officials have on many occasions expressed concern in private about the Bush administration 's moves .  They are worried that this tough " Bushism " which is taking shape on the international scene would cast a shadow on the development of Sino-US relations .  
However , on the whole , the slowdown in global economic growth will not have a serious impact on China 's economy : Firstly , China has a huge domestic market ; public investment and private consumption take up most of the total supply and demand ; and economic growth in real terms is based on domestic demand .  
To meet the needs of China 's imminent entry into the World Trade Organization [ WTO ] , authorities in charge of industry and commerce administration are stepping up the reform of the enterprise registration system , said Wang Zhongfu , director of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce , at the ongoing national forum of industry and commerce bureau directors in Beijing . He said that work is under way to gradually standardize the registration procedure for foreign and domestic enterprises , including private businesses , and to form a unified system for market access .  
He said : Those indifferent to the party 's cause , who comply with the party 's principle and policy in public but oppose them in private , or who form cliques and factions , hold mountain-stronghold mentality , or practice localism for a long time , if they refuse to correct their mistakes after being criticized , should be removed , transferred , or changed , if it is justified .  Those involved in serious cases should be brought to justice .  
According to the public prosecution , the " Xitou Gang " led by Li Changyu and Li Changhai in Beihai City played the tyrant in Beihai City for many years with guns and others means of committing crime where it perpetrated all kinds of evils , amassed ill-gotten wealth with violence and threats , and slaughtered innocent people , causing a number of deaths and heavy losses to public and private property and seriously undermining local economic and social order .  
Major changes have already taken place , and are currently taking place , in China 's economic system and in its composition of social classes .  In rural areas , along with the deepening of economic restructuring and the progress of agricultural industrialization , peasants have been organically integrated with the market ; and some of peasants have been separated from land and have engaged themselves in the secondary and tertiary industries , among whom some have joined township and town enterprises , some have become self-employed businessmen , while others have become entrepreneurs of private enterprises .  
An informed source disclosed that , worried about their future , some ICAC personnel kept close to members of the Ministry of State Security in the period leading to 1997 , hoping to maintain their posts after Hong Kong 's reversion .  But the ICAC stayed unconnected with the Ministry of State Security after Hong Kong 's reversion , strictly banning private contacts between its subordinates and sensitive people .  If " violations of rules " are discovered among its subordinates , they will be thoroughly expelled from the commission .  
A series of policies and measures have been introduced , including increasing the issue of government bonds and suitably increasing money supply , boosting investment in infrastructure construction and the technical transformation of enterprises , guiding private investment , enlarging the scope of consumption and increasing consumer credit , boosting spending on housing and education , increasing peasants ' income through various channels , providing better social security to urban residents , increasing the income of functionaries , and improving the pay and conditions of retirees .  These have produced obvious results .  
By the end of 1997 , there were 7,617 environmental protection enterprises in China , with the total fixed assets amounting to 62.09 billion yuan .  They have formed a pattern under which the state-owned enterprises are developing alongside the township collective enterprises and private enterprises .  
This means that , in national security and fields needed for national economic development where private investment can not or is unwilling to access , the state-owned economy needs to advance , creating the essential terms for national security and national economic development , to give the state the relevant regulation and control capacity over economic development .

Apart from these broader , conceptual issues , we have also taken note of the concerns expressed by the public , as reiterated by some Members today , about a growing perceived disparity in the pay levels between the civil service and the private sector as well as the inadequacy of the existing annual civil service pay adjustment mechanism to reflect the pay adjustment trends in the market .  
" The decision on the pay offer has been made after careful consideration of all relevant factors under the existing civil service pay adjustment mechanism , including the net pay trend indicators derived from an independent private sector pay trend survey , the state of the economy , budgetary considerations , changes in the cost of living , the staff sides ' pay claims and civil service morale , " Mr . Wong said .  
" In the light of the prevailing economic situation , our serious budgetary position and the pay adjustment trends in the private sector , we consider that the pay offer of a negative pay adjustment in line with the net pay trend indicators is reasonable and has struck a balance between the concerns of civil servants and the interests of the community at large , " he added .  
Having carefully considered the request of the Staff Side of SCSC , the Chief Executive is of the opinion that it is a matter of settled public policy that in determining the size of each year 's civil service pay adjustment , the Government takes into account the following factors : the net pay trend indicators derived from an independent private sector pay trend survey , the state of the economy , budgetary considerations , changes in the cost of living , the staff sides ' pay claims and civil service morale .

The replacement of HOS flats by housing loans aims at a clearer role for both public and private sector housing markets , and provides a more certain operating environment to the private property market .  This policy is keeping in line with the prevailing political , social and economic reality of Hong Kong , and strikes a balance between the interests of the general public and people from various sectors .  The community has generally expressed positive comments to the Government 's announcement .

Mr Wong said : " Our firm conviction of serving the community is reflected in the motto of the Programme - ' We serve , we care , we volunteer to share ' .  On duty , we are committed to public service ; off duty , we are still devoted to contributing to society by taking part in voluntary work , extending our community-oriented service culture into our private lives . " .  
The 26-year-old driver and a 28-year-old passenger of the private car were trapped inside the compartment .

Speaking after the meeting , the Secretary for Commerce , Industry and Technology , Mr Henry Tang said : " We are glad that this private sector initiative is gaining momentum and continual support with the positive response from the international and local chambers of commerce as well as other business and professional bodies .  
" We appreciate the effort of the operating agencies , including non-government organisations and private operators , for taking initiative to freeze or reduce their fee charges .

We have built a local public key infrastructure supported by four recognised certification authorities in the public and private sectors , in order to provide the community with digital certificates for the conduct of secure electronic transactions .  
This was mainly attributable to intensified works on some major private residential and commercial building projects , more than offsetting the scale-back in the Public Housing Programme and the tapering work on some public civil engineering projects .  
After assessing all these factors , the consultant has confirmed that the overall fire safety level of old public housing estates is comparable to that of Code-complying private buildings of the same age .  Nevertheless , since solid-core doors have longer fire resistance and are now generally used as the standard for fire resistant doors in the industry , replacement of hollow flat entrance doors with fire-resistant ones for flats at " dead ends " should further enhance the fire safety of old public housing estates .  
( c ) whether the level of rents of the Cyberport offices is lower than that of the offices of comparable quality in private commercial buildings ; if so , whether the unfavourable tenancy position of the Cyberport offices is the reason for the Administration 's setting low rents to attract tenants ; whether they have assessed if such a measure will result in a competition for profits with the private sector and deal a blow to the rental market of private commercial offices ; and  
Within the GDP deflator , the domestic demand deflator had an enlarged year-on-year decline of 4.4% in the third quarter of 2002 .  This was attributable to a larger fall in the price deflators for private consumption expenditure , for gross domestic fixed capital formation , and for government consumption expenditure .  
Will the Government inform this Council whether , up to the present , there are any groups or organizations which have applied to the Government for land by private treaty grant but have not yet been informed of the outcomes ; if so , the number and names of these groups or organizations , the size and premium per square foot at the current market value of the land concerned , and the relevant land lease term proposed by them ?

For recreational / sports facilities and private independent schools , the normal terms of new land leases are 21 years and 10 years respectively .  
Mr Ma said , " To keep Hong Kong 's capital market moving forward , we have to make sure that our regulatory standards are always on a par with international standards .  By upgrading the quality of our market , Hong Kong 's listed companies would be more attractive to international investors and their market capitalization is set to grow .  This will be conducive to attracting more quality mainland private and state enterprises to get a listing in Hong Kong . "  
As in the housing policy statement I made on 13 November 2002 , we will undertake a thorough review of the Ordinance with a view to resuming the free operation of the private rental market , giving owners the flexibility and autonomy they deserve , and mitigating the difficulties in recovering flats for re-letting in the light of the current ample supply and falling rentals .  Our objective is to relax excessive control in the rental market .

Noting that credibility of statistics is essential , Mr Leung commended the C &amp; amp ; SD for working in accordance with scientific principles , professional ethics and international standards and practices to ensure that adequate , relevant , reliable and timely statistics are produced to serve data users in both the public and private sectors .  
The improved mechanism would comprise the conduct of periodic pay level surveys to compare civil service pay levels with those in the private sector , the conduct of annual pay trend surveys based on an improved methodology and an effective means for implementing both upward and downward adjustments .  
" We shall in consultation with staff develop , on the basis of the existing mechanism , an improved civil service pay adjustment which should comprise the conduct of periodic pay level surveys to compare civil service pay levels with those in the private sector , the conduct of annual pay trend surveys based on an improved methodology and an effective means for implementing both upward and downward adjustments , " Mr Wong said . 
We believe that a more effective way to address the problem of deflation without increasing our financial burden is to increase external demand , which means attracting more visitors , overseas talent and investment immigrants to come to Hong Kong ; more foreign enterprises to set up regional offices here ; more people to attend schools in Hong Kong and seek medical treatment at our private hospitals ; and more foreign capital inflows into Hong Kong 's financial market .  
( c ) We have always encouraged the environmental industry to recover and recycle different kinds of materials .  Hence , the CWTC and some private chemical waste disposal facilities have been recycling chemical waste .  Examples include the recovery of copper oxide from spent etchant ; fuel from oily water waste ; production of lubricating oil , hydraulic oil and moulding oil from different types of recycled waste oil ; silver from photofinishing waste ; and precious metals such as gold and silver from spent plating solution .  
In conclusion , despite the financial stringency faced by the Government and the Housing Authority , I am confident that we can make use of our limited resources to implement the three main pillars of our housing policy , namely , helping low-income families gain access to affordable housing , minimising intervention in the market and maintaining a fair and stable operating environment for the healthy development of the private property market .  
The improved mechanism will comprise the conduct of periodic pay level surveys to compare civil service pay levels with those in the private sector , the conduct of annual pay trend surveys based on an improved methodology and an effective means for implementing both upward and downward pay adjustments .  
During the weekend we will clean up a great variety of venues , ranging from public housing , private housing , environmental hygiene black spots , to social , educational institutions and commercial premises , as well as engaging all sectors of the community .  The places that will be cleaned up include : ( a ) Multi-storey buildings  
Unlike public services where there is a need to differentiate eligible persons ( EPs ) from NEPs to ensure that heavily subsidised public health care services should not be diverted to non-Hong Kong residents and visitors at the expense of Hong Kong residents , no public subsidy is involved in the provision of medical services to private patients which are charged at the market rates .

Noting that the existing outline zoning plan ( OZP ) for the site envisages several commercial and residential lots for piecemeal development as well as open space and land for Government facilities and roads , the spokesman said the existing zoning is incompatible with the concept of inviting proposals from the private sector for a fully integrated development mixing cultural and commercial facilities and other diverse uses . 
The Government today ( August 8 ) has approved an application for financial assistance by the family members of a private doctor who died of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) contracted in the course of his professional practice .

A joint venture of six private chemical firms , the plant was completed in May 1973 , with a total capitalization of NT $ 320 million ( US $ 8 million ) . Equipped with ultramodern machinery , it was designed to produce Vinyl Chloride Monomer ( VCM ) for use by the local plastics industry . Because of climate and technical problems , however , the machinery did not work satisfactorily , and by 1975 , operations were halted except for four or five months a year .  
At first , people were skeptical over his intentions , since with the improving living conditions in Taiwan , beggars and private garbage collectors were becoming part of history . But despite this problem , and the rheumatism and neurasthenia that afflicted him , he continued to work until he had won the support and understanding of the public , and even his health improved .  
Jean 's soft manner has been advantageous in her often difficult position as negotiator in an organization that is part public and part private , where the interests of the two may often conflict . Jean feels that she must maintain a calm work attitude to counter the stereotype of the emotional female .  
The 1987 Taiwan economic construction plan approved by the Executive Yuan , which foresees the attainment of an eight percent growth rate , includes many policies and measures , among which particularly to be stressed is that , besides maintaining an appropriate increase in exports , domestic demand must also be expanded , including raising the private willingness to invest and expanding public investment , thereby making domestic demand and export trade the two main forces for economic growth .  
Unless we further accelerate the training of technical personnel , it will be difficult for us to join the ranks of the industrialized nations . 4 ) Sluggish renovation of technology by private enterprise . The most fundamental reason why the nation 's industrial structure is weak and its speed of adjustment is slow is that the level of creativity in products and production processes is inadequate and technological renovation by private enterprise is sluggish .  
The Ministry of Education has made the following revisions : Now , students who have graduated from a public or private high school , or any higher level of education , or passed the Higher Civil Service Examination or Junior-Grade Civil Service Examination and has completed his military duty , or those who are exempt from military duty , may apply to study abroad .  
Because this meeting is to be held in Peking , the government had to carefully weigh the valued ties to the organization and the possible reactions of the public and academic community against the policy of no official contacts with Peking . Lien explains that " official contacts " are not thinkable , but that it was easier to allow the delegates to attend in a private capacity . However , " it is hard to say " if this is a precedent .  
In Kuo 's extended family , the more than forty children belonging to her generation , starting at age three , were instructed by an elderly teacher in the family 's private schoolroom , where they studied the Three Character Classic , the Thousand Character Classic , the Four Books , and the Five Classics , practiced calligraphy , and learned how to compose in literary Chinese , before going on to junior high school at age fourteen .  
Tariffs have been cut on 3,500 categories of items , lowering the average effective tariff rate from 7.8 to approximately 5 percent , comparable to the rates in industrialized countries .

S . dollar since 1985 ; and private individuals can now buy as much as US $ 5 million for outward remittances .  
The government hopes that overseas experts and consultants can work together with domestic construction firms and academic institutions from the viewpoints of urban planning , financing , and urban management in exploring the comprehensive utilization of space in the area and in determining urban design control , development methods for public and private lands , development organizations , implementation schedules , and the like in order to promote the comprehensive development of the entire area .  
In recent years it has become the custom to erect museums , galleries , and exhibition halls through private subsidy and ownership as opposed to setting up state-run facilities . Bands , dance troupes , orchestras , and puppet shows will continue to spring up and flourish at an astonishing pace . A prominent feature of our program for the future is the construction of libraries and audio-visual centers for every township and every rural district or village .  
In view of the greater access to improved modes of travel , the Tourism Bureau intends to transform the Yueh-mei Farm in Taichung County into an amusement complex with varied functions . The complex is designed to reflect traditional Chinese culture and yet present the natural sciences and modern science and technology . The Bureau will also promote private investment in tourist hotels and recreational facilities in the area .  
Another US $ 7 billion or more comes under the " capital account , " which includes part of the hot money that was drawn into the country over the past two or three years by the appreciation of the NT dollar and is now flowing out again . Then there 's immigration and overseas investment by the private sector plus government loans and aid to foreign countries , such as that provided by the International Economic Cooperation Development Fund .  
Currently , the government has already ordered that the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion be terminated . In the foreseeable future , cases involving the two sides will develop in the direction of " private international law . " That is , Taiwan and the mainland will be treated as two separate " legal jurisdictions " and the concepts for dealing with " conflicts of law between two jurisdictions " will be employed .  
Trade and business contacts , academic scholarly exchange , events sponsored by private groups , and overseas tourism by ordinary citizens are all channels for showing people overseas the good side of our people and for demonstrating the united effort being made inside and outside government . This is how a good international image is built up .  
But a couple of years ago such was private sector demand for experienced and well qualified personnel in the securities , banking and broadcasting industries that suitable civil servants became avidly sought after , while relatively low pay and an inflexible advancement system also contributed to the civil service brain drain .  
The problem is that our civil servants have not yet comprehended this shift , and are still stuck in the thinking and methods of the 1950 ' s . They just think about playing the leading role and telling others what they should do and ca n't do , which product to develop - - these are not official topics , so there are always conflicts with private entrepreneurs . In fact in many things the people are more capable than officials .  
But the distribution of health resources is still not equal . Major urban areas have continually built public and private large scale hospitals , not only saturating the area , but also creating vicious competition . Whereas local and base levels have been ignored . This is something the government has to accept responsibility for .  
Despite Taiwan 's small size , its tropical and sub-tropical climate and unique geography mean that it has a rich flora , many original varieties of which retain excellent characteristics . We need the government to set up a seed source bank to preserve these , while at the same time encouraging private enterprise to develop new improved varieties .  
" Opposition from the minority engaged in fisheries was understandable , " says Lin Chong-min , engineer with the firm of consultants , " but otherwise the project involved no appropriation of private holdings and no removal of people 's homes . Also there would be no pollution from the project after its completion , and in the future it could even bring a boom to the area . Yet most respondents neither supported nor were opposed to the plan . "  
The Department of Education has already planned to spend 20 percent of its budget on improving the government primary and junior schools in Taiwan Province . Apart from this we want to aid private schools to raise the average educational level .  
" External trade had shown a large surplus for several years running , and there was a great deal of idle capital in private hands ; moreover the NT dollar was appreciating , and speculative foreign money poured in , add to this that the policy of ' returning price increases to the general public ' had not been effectively implemented over the long run , and land became a highly profitable investment , " says Hsieh Chao-yi , an associate professor in the graduate program in urban planning at Chung-hsing University .  
As for the R . O . C . , which has deep ties with both Berkeley and Dr . Tien - - he graduated from Kien Kuo senior high school and National Taiwan University before going to the U . S . and Berkeley boasts more members of Academia Sinica than any other university overseas - - the Ministry of Education , the Legislative Yuan and the private sector have donated US $ 3 million since his appointment was announced in support of its research on East Asia and other broad academic areas . "  
Since we have come to understand more about the Japanese , We have discovered that generally they are embarrassed about beliefs that might sound unscientific . On the other hand , they are quite open and brash about things that Americans consider to be private , such as personal finance and sexual experience - - especially the men .  
Vuu Khai Thanh , initiator of what was then the Binhtien Imex Cooperative Society , relied on hard work and struggle , and the advantages of distributing low-priced goods with insignificant labor costs to Southeast Asia . In 1989 , he received the first license to be issued by the government permitting a private enterprise to engage in direct foreign trade . It was only this that landed him the opportunity to leave the country for an observation tour and go to Taiwan to find technological and management partners , thus speeding up the expansion of the business .  
In this situation the government decided to set up a special project , enlisting the ITRI 's Mechanical Industry Research Laboratories to bring in American technology for combined research and development . When the development was finished , hands were joined again with the private sector to establish a compressor factory , with joint production and distribution free of Japanese control .  
When asked what qualities they expected in members of the anti-corruption movement , as many as 40% replied that it was enough for them to act fairly and cleanly in office ; their origins and background , posts held with commercial enterprises and their morality in their private lives were all secondary considerations . Thus it seems that the requirements the public in Taiwan places on its politicians are fairly reasonable and equitable .  
As society has become democratic and diverse , corruption , which previously few people learned about , is now being spotlighted by the media and legislators . The bidding for the huge contracts of the major construction projects that have followed in the wake of Taiwan 's affluence are said to be fertile ground for illegal linkages of private money and government power . With corruption frequently in the news , popular sentiment has boiled over and the Ministry of Justice is drawing up an anti-corruption plan called " Taking the Knife to Corruption . "  
Actually , public and private schools have a deep connection . A few of the schools were established by retired members of the military dog training center . Also , when the police canine division was first formed , they trained both the people and the dogs by relying on the long experience of private dog schools .  
Planning an Itinerary : Most major travel destinations are south of Shihtiping . For this reason , it is best to lay an emphasis on visiting the central and southern portions of the east coast , whether traveling by private vehicle or by public transport . Be sure to plan for a journey of at least three days and two nights .  
Kinmen kaoliang , king of liquorsWhen it comes to the subject of what gifts to take back home , one is sure to think of Kinmen kaoliang . Since Kinmen 's state-owned distillery was obliged to stop selling its products directly to the public to avoid engaging in unfair competition with private enterprise , Kinmen 's pure , silky-smooth aged sorghum spirit has been in short supply , causing its price to rocket . In recent times especially , it has been hard to get hold of at any price .  
There has never been a case of a country which establishes a public school in a geographic location belonging to a foreign power . And furthermore Taiwan does not have official diplomatic relations with Indonesia . Chaoalso notes that the overseas schools of America and Japan , although partly subsidized by their respective governments , remain nevertheless private schools . "  
Looking in turn at the three major forms of enterprises in the mainland today , state-run enterprises still labor under a heavy burden of weak incentives created by the " iron rice bowl " ; private enterprises are still in their infancy ; and township collective enterprises , which stand between these first two types in terms of scale , are mainly rural , and still lack the capital , information , and trained personnel to pose a direct challenge to Taiwan firms .  
Land is state property , and most people live in homes owned by their work units , so that these can not serve as collateral for " start-up capital . " Another reason why private enterprise is having a hard time burgeoning is because " government policy is tilted in favor of foreign and Taiwan investors . " It is still up in the air whether or not the mainland can duplicate Taiwan 's development experience .  
Right now the mainland economy is heated up , and the financial market has the jitters . Of course private companies ca n't compete with state-owned enterprises which have access to deep and extensive human relations networks , " Yang Donghong observes . If a state-owned establishment defaults on a loan , the loan officer holds little responsibility . But if a private business goes insolvent , the officer who sponsored the loan will almost certainly be unable to escape blame .  
He offers the analogy that inviting foreign investment is like " borrowing a hen to lay eggs . " The country is still responsible for providing the twigs and making the nest . Yet local private enterprises , which , like quails , are small in stature but large in number , have not been given the attention they deserve . They have even been viewed as opportunistic and money hungry .  
In the coastal regions of every Asian country along the western Pacific ocean live large numbers of marine turtles , but many of the islands where they are distributed lack reliable monitoring and protection . Sea turtles have even gotten innocently embroiled in local wars or been negatively affected by the capers of private individuals . For this reason international conservation groups intend to devote the year 1995 to the West Pacific Marine turtle , hoping to encourage research and protection of marine turtles in this region .  
While overseas he saw many Chinese people in a state of ignorance and superstition , with a low level of cultural cultivation . In his hometown he saw old private schools in a state of decay , and the new Western-style schools corrupt . Many children in the village already over the age of ten were still naked and played in the streets : " It almost returned to a prehistoric state of barbarity .  
What 's more , in 1993 a private financial consortium built the nearby Shin Kong Life Tower , a 53-story skyscraper that has already become a new symbol of the city . And the new 12-story KMT party headquarters is to be located by the East Gate directly across from the Presidential Palace . The Po Ai District is gradually being enclosed amid a concrete jungle of modern skyscrapers .  
In terms of railroads , though the controversial budget for the high-speed train did not pass the Legislative Yuan last year , the " Regulations for Encouraging Participation " in railroad privatization did . There is a proposal to create a special high-speed railroad budget of over NT $ 120 billion to be spent over the next four to five fiscal years ( though original costs are expected to be moderated somewhat by the participation of private capital in the program ) .  
The government should long ago have lifted the ban on private groups producing their own textbooks in order to get rid of the bad reputation for brainwashing students , " says Chou Chuan , who fought to have the ban on competition with the unified textbook system lifted . Few countries in the world except communist or backward nations use unified textbooks adopted at the national level . Even Communist China currently uses a system in which the central and local governments produce different textbooks .  
The DOH did not begin to encourage the private sector to establish hospitals for chronic illnesses until 1991 . Up to the end of 1993 , there were only 20,000 beds reserved for chronic disease patients nationwide , half of which were for psychiatric patients . Only 4,450 hospital beds are set aside for the more than 60 kinds of ordinary chronic illnesses . Moreover , most of those beds belong to the veterans ' hospitals , to which the general public has no access . "  
There are no strict requirements for the registration of the dog population , so the rate of stray dogs being picked up by owners is low . City and County animal shelters are also extremely lacking . Even private organizations are overwhelmed . For instance , the Stray Animal Home , which can shelter 300 animals , was packed to overflowing less than three months after it opened .  
Whether they be from the financial sector or political parties , or are veteran broadcasters or members of the arts starting up their own private operations , the vast majority are interested in stations broadcasting to urban areas with a relatively wide range of listeners and high impact .  
But during the exhibition the year before last of works by Monet , 300,000 people pressed into the gallery . This year 's special exhibition of jade from private collections will also be housed there ; meanwhile the Contemporary Art Gallery 's own special exhibition " Creating from Tradition : a Taste of Our Modern Art " is being held in the newly-completed Documents and Library Building , and includes the works of 1O modern craft workers . Among them are pictorial ceramic panels by Sun Chao and wood and gold carvings by Wu Ching . "  
Because of administrative financial difficulties , their environmental conservation budget is limited . Many wildlife conservation activities are even limited to private lands . This has led to a reaction , in which many voices have arisen claiming that more human energy and material should be focused on protecting entire ecosystems and habitats .  
Even if there are numerous homes and senior citizen centers that have been set up by government agencies and private organizations which can solve the problems of part of the elderly population , many of these places do not accept people who are indigent , too sick or aged , entirely unable to care for themselves , or who have been abandoned by their families . Most of the elderly at home alone are n't served by the homes and senior citizen centers .  
A well-designed domed facility should be highly flexible , with adjustable activity size , space , lighting , and sound . Also , to attract spectators , it must provide " full service , " including private boxes , food and beverage services , concessions to sell memorabilia , and so on . And to meet the needs of the press at major events , there must be TV broadcast facilities , a press box , darkroom , and phone and fax equipment .  
Kwan Wen-yen looks at it from the point of view of economic growth . Looking at the current standards of mass sporting events , he says that management of medium-sized 8,000-seat facilities is still inadequate . If the domed stadium is built , it would be OK if it were turned over to the private sector , but if it were managed by the government , based on the current structure , it would be difficult to do the job well .  
Thus , the expectant mother is put in a strange , frigid and sterile environment , lies supine on the operating table with both legs stretched out , has her private portions examined , receives an enema , and has her pubic hair shaved . This kind of clinical birthing experience often makes women feel embarrassed , pained or uneasy , and they naturally wish to avoid it at all costs .  
Now close your eyes and imagine yourself looking out over the foggy ocean . In less than three years , that stretch of land now occupied by dismal-looking aquaculture ponds will be transformed into Mailiao International Port . This will be the first-ever port in Taiwan built with private funding , as well as Taiwan 's deepest harbor . The handling capacity after only the first phase of construction will be a full half of today 's giant Kaohsiung Harbor ( one of the busiest in the world ) .  
After intensive discussion , the three parties finally agreed that the compromises achieved before the conference should not be lightly abandoned . Besides retaining the definition of the two sides of the Strait as " equal political entities , " the conference simply added proposals by Ju Gau-jeng for a " cross-strait forum " and " inviting representative persons from both sides of the Strait to participate as private individuals to peacefully resolve cross-strait issues through an exchange of opinions without any non-negotiable positions . "  
The landlord refused at first to accept the re-survey result , and hired a private firm of his own . The outcome was the same-his land was cut by about half . It is inferred that when using the triangulation method to measure the original lot , the workmen perhaps neglected to divide by two when calculating the area .  
However , because these organizations are all run by private individuals or civic groups , and are constantly being changed in response to social problems , to date no complete statistical survey has been done which would accurately reflect the actual resources which can be provided by Taiwan 's halfway houses .  
He observes that according to statistics , nearly 13% of people in the US have some sort of mental disorder . This clearly illustrates the famous words of Jesus Christ : " Man does not live by bread alone . " The ancient religious practices of meditation and contemplating the impermanence of life can positively help modern people , who are undergoing immense changes in social relations and also witnessing rapid transformations both at work and their private lives .  
In looking toward all of the preparations for the handover , those relating to government-including the establishment of the Basic Law and the holding of elections , the building of the airport , and even the appointment of the special administrative region 's chief executive and the arrival of the People 's Liberation Army-all have been accomplished . People 's private responses to the turnover-including the rush to get second passports , the return flow of emigrants , the real-estate boom-these too have already happened . Will there be big changes in the future ?  
In September 1994 the Cultural Committee of the Preparatory Committee began to formally discuss such matters as the names and emblems of government departments and agencies , arrangements for public holidays , the design and issue of postage stamps , the content of school textbooks , recognition of academic qualifications and so on , and also affirmed the principle of removing the visible trappings of colonial rule . Since then , wave after wave of actions to remove historical symbols has swept through both the public and private sectors .  
What private sector publishing firms originally set their sights on was the huge primary school textbook market , which consists of over 300,000 student readers . This , plus the possibility of publishing additional reference materials and teaching aids , adds up to potentially enormous profits . It is the main reason publishers were initally jumping at the chance to get in on the textbook market .  
It 's just that state firms often are less efficient than private ones because they have three burdens to bear : implementing state policies based on non-economic concerns , accepting legal restraints and interference from government agencies , and the human failing of usually performing public tasks more poorly than those involving private profit . Thus people often are dismayed with state firms .  
If the government did not take responsibility for major infrastructure , the private sector-devoid of capital in those early days-could never have done so itself . And it was unthinkable to allow a few people outside the state to control essential goods and services . Thus public ownership of key industries in Taiwan-sugar , salt , steel , petroleum , water , electricity-was based on the needs of a particular era .  
" The strong prey on the weak , the old consume the young , " sighs one telecom company manager . Early on , the DGT earned huge profits with its exorbitant mobile phone charges ; it was this fat market that private firms yearned for .  
In past cases where private property has been set aside for public use , the owner generally has n't received reasonable compensation and has also lost the chance to benefit from increased land prices . No wonder that people in Taiwan say : " Being the owner of a historic building is just too painful . "  
Through long-term arrangements by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and overseas representative offices , Vice President Lien Chan conducted his second visit to Europe under the low profile of a " holiday " and " private visit . " He made substantive , face-to-face contact with a nation with which the ROC does not have diplomatic ties , and established the critical beginnings of friendship and progressive exchange . The incessant actions of Beijing are additional proof of the barriers which the ROC currently faces in foreign relations .  
These past few years , unrelentingly high housing prices and crowded public spaces have been among the ubiquitous symptoms that Taipei City , constrained as it is within a ring of mountains , is filled to bursting point . In search of a better quality of life , more and more people are moving out to the suburbs , and Taipei 's dormitory zone has spread as far as Hsinchu and Miaoli . How much private and public time and resources are consumed by their daily commute ?  
The Taipei District Court ruled that although the topic of Ho Ya-wei 's report-about how Huang Chao-fu had spent NT $ 20 million in his first campaign as a KMT nominee for the legislature but received only 200 votes-could be described as " fair game . . . its sarcasm virtually dripped from the page . . . Because this affected the reputation of the plaintiff 's private moral character , the defendant was clearly acting maliciously . "  
Those who " set out with great hopes only to return defeated " were left both angry and disappointed . As one person who works in the media noted , in metropolitan Taipei , " The leisure industry was pushing its leisure facilities down people 's throats all day long . Media packaging made for holiday crowds of historic dimensions on government-sponsored educational package tours and at private amusement parks , new department stores and even the Hollywood-transplanted Warner Village movie theater complex . "  
" I keep mulling over this thought : Has this natural , simple , non-calculating character of the common man been lost under the capitalist system with its private ownership of property ? When these three people begin to specialize , they will become more adept at running the restaurant and become more calculating . Will the three of them be as happy then as they are now ? "  
But the long-term problems caused by recreational facilities are not going to go away . These private facilities , in fact , existed long before the park was established . Many of them , such as Sun Moon Ranch , are known far and wide . They break the law in various ways , including using national land , building illegal structures , and operating without proper permits .  
They helped Chang retrace his first heartthrob , who he has never forgotten , and also his middle school military instructor , who devoted great efforts to guiding him . He is thrilled at the idea of expressing gratitude through TV , saying it is 100 times more effective than contacting these people in private . " I can let the whole world know how grateful I am to them ! "  
By paying for each procedure carried out , NHI is encouraging the medical community to emphasize quantity rather than quality of treatment . It is also encouraging doctors to go into easier fields which pay well . For this reason , dermatology , pediatrics and physical rehabilitation have become hot areas to work in , and doctors are leaving hospitals to set up their own private clinics . On the other hand , more difficult areas of medicine such as surgery are suffering from a shortage of doctors .  
In the view of scholars of folk culture , the lion museum , with its rich collection of artifacts but its thus far somewhat inadequate " software " such as explanatory materials , guides and research activities , apart from reflecting the purchasing power of private collectors , is also indicative of the unending stream of mainland Chinese antiques flowing into Taiwan .  
Lee could hardly have told us much of anything new in his memoirs , for he had already devoted a tremendous effort during 30 years in office to the task of recounting the events that preceded the founding of the republic . Furthermore , Singapore has been deeply influenced by its long years under British rule . The Singaporean government maintains copious records concerning all its domestic and foreign affairs . Political statements over the years have drawn upon a large body of diplomatic documents , parliamentary reports , private letters , and government proclamations .  
These private art museums or memorial museums on the one hand afford centralized management and exhibition of these senior artists ' works , and privately held works of art might be donated to foundations as public cultural assets open to the public . In another sense , they bring greater diversity to art appreciation , spreading and expanding viewing opportunities beyond the select few major public art museums .  
Consequently , private museums established after this law came into effect have been treated precisely the same as large public museums in terms of facilities and organizational requirements : minimum structural support capacities , obstruction-free spaces , or such public safety issues as fire safety are all scrutinized against the standards governing large museums .  
In the analysis of Chiang Tsu-ning , head of the Secretariat of the Grand Justices , most of the private petitions raised over the years have revolved around basic constitutional rights . In earlier years , petitions concerning property rights and the right to equality before the law dominated , while in recent years such issues as human rights , gender equality and the right to liberty have come to the fore .  
Two important pieces of legislation were passed in regard to educating the populace . The " Citizens ' Education Law " was modified to encourage private individuals to engage in private education . The principle of " nine years of continuous compulsory education " was revised to state that " curricula shall center around students ' all-round mental and physical development and emphasize continuity . "  
On January 18th , Premier Vincent Siew returned home from Central America . Besides fulfilling his trip 's main purpose of cementing international friendships , Premier Siew also observed the results of using investment and trade as the central plank of a pragmatic foreign policy , and resolutely pushed for private enterprises to participate in popular diplomacy .  
He recalls how in the 1960s , when Taiwan and mainland China were engaged in a propaganda battle on the airwaves , and listening to mainland broadcasts was forbidden in Taiwan , the government encouraged the establishment of private radio stations . The number of radio stations quickly grew to over 80 , and there was an enormous demand for programs . Father Bourret produced classical music programs , five-minute stories , and short radio dramas , all of which he made available to radio stations free of charge .  
Whether for reasons of courtesy or safety , the idea that there are times when a mobile phone should be turned off is not very widespread in Taiwan . Given the difficulty of forcing people to turn off their phones , the MOTC will soon begin accepting applications from the private sector to install mobile-phone signal disrupters . This will stop the phones from functioning in areas where their use is restricted , thus resolving the problem of their use in public venues . Other controversies still exist .  
Now that the Sanxingdui exhibit has brought over a huge bronze statue of a man and many other exotic items , another blockbuster exhibit from the mainland has been scheduled for October . The autumn event will feature the superbly preserved silk paintings found at the Mawangdui site in Hunan Province as well as the stunning jade pieces discovered in Guangzhou at the royal tomb of the Nanyue kingdom . Going in the other direction , a private Taiwanese collection ( Ku Yue Ko ) was put on exhibit four years ago at the Palace Museum in Beijing .  
Museum director Chin Hsiao-yi has announced that another major exhibit , on the culture of the Han dynasty , will travel to Taiwan in late 1999 . Relics to be displayed include selected items from the museum 's own collection , items from the famed sites of Mawangdui and the royal tomb of the Nanyue kingdom , and other items to be borrowed from various private collectors in Taiwan . This exhibit will give a clear feel for the vast sweep of Han culture . ( photo by Pu Hua-chih )  
Hu Tsu-ching , an associate professor of political science at Soochow University , warns that there are several problems that must be addressed : The Kosovo government-in-exile is mired in internal strife , and it must be decided which " Kosovo " to assist . Ways must be found to ensure that the aid provides practical help to the refugees , and is not diverted into private pockets . With regard to the proposed training program in Taiwan , there are problems of language , health clearance , and so on .  
Amidst the hasty passage of the amendments , a provision allowing private gambling , long supported by a certain group of legislators , was attached to and passed along with the regulations . This rider reads : " For the purposes of staging internationally recognized events , application may be made to the competent authority for approval of special issuance of public welfare lottery tickets . "  
To make matters worse , the government has also been downsizing . The result is that virtually everyone-whether from large multinational firms or small enterprises , white-collar or blue-collar workers , senior specialists or low skilled laborers , from private firms or from the civil service ( long reputed to be the safest of careers ) - now lives under the shadow of an unexpected change in career path .  
On Xuanzong 's private chuiwan course , the grass is trimmed neat and smooth , and the four large greens bear a total of ten holes which , just as on a modern golf course , are all marked by flagpoles bearing different-colored pennants .  
Many scholar-officials also formed communities out of their own extended families by establishing clan congregations , updating genealogies , and setting up private schools to educate promising youngsters . These new forms of local organization helped society to remain orderly and civilized , and fostered an overall mood of culture and enlightenment . Rule by the learned  
Ho Pi-chen , chief executive officer of TWRF , strongly contests the contention of the Japanese government that the comfort women were engaged in private prostitution . In talking with former comfort women from many different countries , Ho has learned : " Most of these women were transported to the front on naval vessels . The comfort stations were built by the military , and the military determined how they were to be run . When the women got sick , they were attended to by military doctors .  
If elected , I will change the obsolete bureaucratism in the central government , and undertake complete reinvention of the government . I will create a clean , honest , and capable government , one that adheres to the concept of " government by partnership , " so that whatever the local governments can do , the central government should not get involved in ; and whatever the private sector can do , the central government should also not get involved .  
Currently , around a dozen public and private universities in Taiwan , including NTU , National Chiaotung University , National Sun Yat-sen University , Da-Yeh Institute of Technology , and Yuan-Ze Institute of Technology , offer advanced degree programs for executive management personnel . What is it that makes graduate programs in management so popular among the working population ? Liao Ching-jong , director of the NTUST College of Management , relates that new entrants into the professional ranks concentrate on accumulating professional know-how , while seasoned middle - and top-level executives seek an edge in management .  
Many Taiwan business people saw the establishment of formal diplomatic relations as a green light for investment in Palau . The foreign ministry delegation that visited Palau in March included private sector firms involved in tourism , textiles , electronics , and fishing , who went to investigate the investment environment .  
Given that education was run by and for government bureaucrats , those who studied did so only in order to further their ambitions and become officials . They cared little for knowledge or morality , or for the intrinsic value of learning . Philosophers realized that education and teaching materials lacked vitality and in fact limited people 's development in various ways . In order to escape the rigid and lifeless official education system , private education began to flourish .  
Under Zhu Xi , who had a knack for " management , " private academies grew in size and became increasingly widespread . Especially worthy of note was the Bailudong Academy in Jiangxi . The latter , a famous institution nestled amidst mountains and rivers as idyllic as a painting , had fallen into decline in the Northern Song period .  
In the future , when everything is connected , information technology will be an inescapable part of daily life . Your personal information will be included in various government or private databanks , to be monitored and processed by those who control these databanks . At the same time , each individual can build a little private Internet of their own , and put everything about themselves in for ease of management .  
For true flower lovers , the shy orchids of the wild are just as precious as the oversized local or exotic orchids grown in private gardens .  
In addition , having seen the constant human resource conflicts that resulted from joint ventures between Taiwanese capital and Vietnamese private or public enterprises , the government now allows foreign ventures to wholly own their local affiliates .  
The " one priority " was arts education . The " two legs to walk on " was a reference to the importance of state-run professional opera troupes and the encouragement of private theater troupes . And the talk about " three items of equal importance " meant that traditional opera , contemporary opera , and newly composed works dealing with historical subjects were all equally deserving of attention .  
Thus , while the first shots fired for financial reform may look good , those on the inside can not help but worry that the government will quickly run out of ammunition . Yet there would still remain more than 300 other community financial institutions which have been running at a loss for a considerable time , not to mention the state-run and private banks of a much larger scale whose bad debts are shockingly high . The govern-ment 's ability to reform the financial system is going to face some pretty ruthless tests .  
" If you divide the financial sector up into state-run banks , private local banks , and foreign banks , the most at-risk group is that made up of the large state-run banks , which currently have the largest market share , " says Schive Chi , who knows what he 's talking about after years of experience in banking . The style of foreign banks is to make quick decisions based on comprehensive data , wielding a flexible array of products that keep up with the market .  
While in Beijing , the PW stayed in corporate apartment suites that combined all the amenities of a large hotel with a cozy , homey ambiance . While all the performers had private rooms , the apartments also featured communal living and dining rooms with large tables around which they could gather for piping-hot meals .  
Lee Shan-ren of the Taiwan Agriculture Strategy Coalition , remembers a ' 70s television program entitled Provisional Government Mailbox which specialized in answering problems encountered by farmers . " Technological developments in Taiwan 's agriculture have never ceased to move forward , " says Lee . With its myriad technological breakthroughs , agricultural testing institutions , experimental farms , fishery testing institutions , and private enterprises , Taiwan is one of the best in the research and development of new agricultural strains .  
Since 1991 more than 100 new public and private high schools ( including comprehensive high schools ) have been founded , so now there are more than 270 such institutions . Meanwhile , the ratio of students entering academic vs . vocational tracks has been adjusted to 45:55 . This means that today more than 40% of kids can keep their university dream alive after junior high school .  
David Hong states that most of the researchers at TIER have MA degrees , and their salaries are paid in accordance with Ministry of Education regulations , based on the degree held by the employee . But this is a lot less money than they could make in the private sector , so talented people go into corporate life , which naturally affects the success of think tanks at fulfilling their role or accumulating a pool of human resources . The rising number of think tanks has had negative as well as positive effects .  
Vice President Lu stressed that this initiative was undertaken in support of President Chen 's " go south " policy , aimed at opening up new horizons for Taiwanese business investment in Southeast Asia . Further , she expressed her gratitude to Indonesia 's ruling and opposition parties and to members of its private sector for extending their hand of friendship and courageously embracing Taiwan 's expressions of goodwill in defiance of a powerful country 's bullying bluster .  
Amidst the concurrence of rising rice wine prices , initial licensing of private distilling operations , and bootleg poisonings , sales of standard rice wine-the former " red label , " now Daoxiang 40 proof ( i.e . 20% alcohol content ) - fell from 25 million dozen bottles two years ago to 400,000 last year .  
Efforts to cut back on plastic waste shifted into a higher gear on January 1 with a measure restricting the use of plastic bags and plastic ( including expanded polystyrene , i.e . " styrofoam " ) disposable eating utensils . This marks the second phase of implementation of a policy that was first introduced on a more limited scale last July , when the government clamped down on the use of such items by government agencies , membership supermarkets for military personnel , and public and private schools .  
In terms of literary value , Wang Dan 's essays do not come up to the same level as his poetry . But for the ordinary reader , in contrast to the more obscure poems the essays seem to offer a more accessible point of entry for understanding the soul of the exile . This is despite the fact that it is quite obvious that Wang carefully works to preserve his private space .  
It is a great pity , but as the number of graduation credits required to graduate from the vocational system has declined over the years , and with no rules indicating the minimum number of credits to be earned from practical work , related classes have come under pressure . As a result , many private schools have chosen to cut subjects that involve physical work or extra financing , which ensures students are given fewer and fewer opportunities to familiarize themselves with actual physical operations .  
However , external criticism focused on how the Ministry of Finance turned the eighth seat over to representation by the Executive Yuan Development Fund . If the shares held by the Executive Yuan Development Fund are sold off under the announced privatization policy , the government will lose its board majority . If there is a change of government after the presidential elections next year , the huge operational power of Mega Holdings will revert to private shareholders and chairman Cheng Shen-chi 's position will become unassailable .  
Maybe drawing large crowds with deliberately staged events is a necessary measure to develop the tourism industry . But what if they are " full of sound and fury , but lacking in soul " ( in the words of Wang Chen-hua , director of a private school ) . Thus , for example , Pinghsi 's Sky Lanterns originally expressed respect for deities and spirits , but who can tell that these days , when any otherworldly atmosphere is smothered by the raging sounds of the pop bands doing outdoor shows during the event ?  
In addition to private entrepreneurs abandoning their hide-bound attitudes and moving forward hand in hand to develop the market , the Executive Yuan 's plan to double the number of foreign tourists was already on track last year with an estimated investment over the next six years of almost NT $ 80 billion and a yearly target for visitors to Taiwan in 2003 and beyond of three million , up from 2.6 million of previous years .  
In response to these claims , on July 10 the e-paper of President Chen Shui-bian stated that Taiwan has always had a low-tuition policy , with the best schools often being the least expensive . To help narrow the gap between tuition at heavily subsidized public universities as opposed to tuition-dependent private ones , the government subsidizes up to 20% of routine expenses at private universities , which is very rarely done anywhere else in the world .  
Making his home in Tainan , Shen set up a private academy and practiced medicine . With other literary enthusiasts , he also formed the Tungyin Society , the writings of which were filled with the nostalgia , grief , and resentment of men of standing forced into exile .  
In reality , neglected sites need not be publicly owned spaces , and they need not be limited to separate and distinct buildings . Idle spaces can be found everywhere . Their scope includes a single empty building , a sidewalk , a row of houses , or an abandoned or wild piece of land . " So long as spaces are n't managed well and do n't function well , then public and private spaces can both be included , " says Lin Po-nian , publisher of Space Magazine .  
This has been especially noteworthy since the former state-run telephone company became Chung Hwa Telecom and began operating as a private enterprise , driving competition in the broadband Internet access market . This market has become very competitive , with operators offering special deals and unlimited access , thereby greatly contributing to the increase in e-commerce activity .  
He cited examples such as Vienna , where a referendum was held to stop a downtown university from cutting down six trees , and Hawaii , the first place in the US to legislate to protect its urban foliage by passing a law that required permission to cut or move any tree over eight feet tall , whether in a private garden or a public park .  
Post-secondary education is the best way to break down barriers between social groups and achieve social equity . Taiwan , however , is faced with a problem : her relatively inexpensive public schools have only enough slots to accept approximately 30% of her high school graduates , but most children of salaried and manual workers and of lower - and middle-income families go on to study at the more expensive private schools which tend to have fewer resources , and offer lower quality educations .  
In line with the harsh predictions concerning " dejobbing " set forth in the book Jobshift : How to Prosper in a Workplace without Jobs , regular full-time , lifelong jobs with fixed objectives are quickly and quietly disappearing . After being laid off , many individuals are setting up their own private offices . Some do well ; most find themselves vulnerable . Left with no choice , they become security guards , sell insurance , do what they can to earn a couple extra bucks .

Partnerships that link the public and private sectors ; external , national and local institutions ; and public organizations with nongovernmental organizations and community groups are essential for sustainable human settlement development .  
Inequitable distribution of resources , irrational duplication and overlapping of functions , limited authority at the local level , and uncoordinated efforts between public , private , voluntary and nongovernmental organizations still dominate the urban scene .  
Major groups , such as women , the private sector , indigenous peoples , and others represented through a wide array of nongovernmental organizations , are critical to ensuring broad public participation in sustainable development .

This new framework of solidarity would break with the almost exclusive , dependence on financial inflows from abroad by better exploiting the potential of trade , private investment and access to technology and reforming international financial institutions so as to better integrate them with other parts of the United Nations system and make them better suited to take care of the needs of poor countries in economic and social development .  
At the same time , the legal regime develops apace , as experts learn simultaneously to apply multiple sets of norms from such diverse areas as commercial law , civil law , environmental law , international economic law , the law of the sea , public and private international law and mining law .  
The New Partnerships Initiative ( NPI ) announced by the Vice-President at the Social Summit emphasizes work at the local level to build sustainable institutional capacity in three areas non-governmental organization empowerment across sectors , small - business partnerships and democratic local governance as well as efforts at the national level to ensure a supportive policy , regulatory and resource environment for private and community action .  
My delegation would like to express its conviction that the establishment of such a forum or of other independent national or international bodies , whether public or private , should be made proof against egoistic interests , cliquishness , and the belief that success and efficiency can be the exclusive possession of any party .  
Through these actions it aims to accelerate the implementation of the Nairobi Forward-Looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women and the removal of all obstacles to women 's active participation in all spheres of public and private life through a full and equal share in economic , social , cultural and political decision-making .  
By this I mean , for example , earmarking for the armed forces imposts on exports of raw materials such as oil or preferential treatment for businesses controlled or owned by the armed forces , which may also be stockholders in major public and private companies .  
In her opening statement , the Secretary-General of the Fourth World Conference on Women stressed that the preparatory process at the national and regional levels had proceeded successfully owing to the strong involvement of Governments , international , political , financial and development organizations , the private sector , academic and research institutions , donors and , especially , non-governmental organizations .  
Such improvement should be based on technical cooperation activities , partnerships among the public , private and community sectors and participation in the decision-making process by community groups and special interest groups such as women , indigenous people , the elderly and the disabled .  
Developing local strategies for improving the quality of life and the environment , integrating decisions on land use and land management , investing in the public and private sectors and mobilizing human and material resources , thereby promoting employment generation that is environmentally sound and protective of human health .  
Institutionalize a participatory approach to sustainable urban development , based on a continuous dialogue between the actors involved in urban development ( the public sector , private sector and communities ) , especially women and indigenous people ;  
In addition , international efforts , such as the Urban Management Programme , in cooperation with multilateral and bilateral agencies , should continue to assist the developing countries in their efforts to develop a participatory structure by mobilizing the human resources of the private sector , non-governmental organizations and the poor , particularly women and the disadvantaged .  
Governments , with the participation of the private sector , non-governmental organizations , local community groups , indigenous people , women , local government units and the public at large , should act to maintain and expand the existing vegetative cover wherever ecologically , socially and economically feasible , through technical cooperation and other forms of support .  
Governments at the appropriate level , with the cooperation of the relevant United Nations bodies and regional , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , the private sector and financial institutions , and taking into consideration indigenous people and their communities , as well as social and economic factors , should :  
Such regional cooperative mechanisms could be facilitated through public / private partnerships and provide support to Governments , industry , non-governmental educational institutions and other domestic and international organizations , and by strengthening global professional networks ;  
The aim is twofold : to maximize the impact of development cooperation by taking advantage of an effective division of labour and of the specific areas of competence of the various partners ( governmental , non-governmental , private sector , multilateral , bilateral ) ; and to ensure a greater level of national and local participation in and ownership of population and development programmes .  
Each of these from the most powerful to the least , from the leaders of Mozambique 's political parties to the poorest citizen walking to a ballot box in the countryside , from senior officials in this grand building to the youngest private in a blue helmet who guarded a lonely road-crossing in the bush all can be proud of what their work together has accomplished .  
Develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes while ensuring their effective utilization ;  
Undertake to explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction in excessive military expenditures including global military expenditures and arms trade , investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development ;  
Developing innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes and creating a supportive environment for the mobilization of resources by civil society , including beneficiary contributions and individual voluntary contributions , for social development .  
Developing economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes while ensuring their effective utilization ;  
However , can market forces ( a ) set an agricultural research agenda that though increasingly dominated by private commercial interests is oriented towards developing sustainable technologies , and ( b ) exert demand pressure for organic products so as to promote a significant shift towards more environment-friendly production practices ?  
This implies the need for the development of creative partnerships among nations and between the public and private sectors , by means of which nations and institutions can establish collaborative ventures for technology transfer ; technology can then be acquired and adapted through conventional programmes , such as training , information exchange and access to patent information .  
Ms . CARTWRIGHT , while noting with satisfaction the contribution of education policy to cutting the number of unwanted pregnancies and abortions , expressed dismay at hearing that domestic violence had only recently ceased being considered a private matter and that children had not been educated about it .  
Increased public and private investment in agricultural infrastructure , including irrigation and drainage , rural energy , transport and markets will be required ; in this connection , a long-term plan should be developed to reclaim the 10-million square kilometres in Africa lost to tsetse fly infestation .  
The criteria ( attached as annex II ) reflect the following top sustainable human development priorities for UNDP cooperation with Bangladesh : relevance to country programme objectives ; institutional and social sustainability ; environmental sensitivity ; targeting of the chronically poor ; affirmative action for women ; public management ; participation of beneficiaries and private organizations ; and national execution .  
Among the African countries in the franc zone , it has experienced the longest period of political instability - nearly 30 years of recurrent civil wars and border conflicts - thus its socio-economic infrastructure is rudimentary and concentrated in the capital ; the administrative capacity is very weak , and the private sector has little structure and is dominated by informal and black market activities .  
Calls upon all States to encourage the broad-based participation of local authorities and all relevant actors , including the scientific community , industry , trade unions , non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the national , regional and international preparatory process and to encourage a wide exchange of information and experience in this respect , in particular on the programmes of work and activities of national committees ;  
Recognizing the important role that Governments and public administrations can play in addressing new responsibilities arising from the pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in all countries , including , inter alia , developing basic infrastructural facilities , promoting social development , combating socio-economic disparities and poverty , preparing , as appropriate , conditions for the private sector and protecting the environment ,  
Governments , non-governmental organizations and private-sector enterprises should take special measures to increase the proportion of women involved in economic decision-making , including studies on the incidence of women in such positions in the public and private sectors , the promotion of training programmes , analysis of alternative policies to provide women with careers leading to economic decision-making , and the adjustment of national legislation .  
Such actions affecting private property or public utilities designed to meet the needs of the civilian population involve a high degree of risk for civilians and can not be justified as legitimate military operations .  
With regard to governance issues , national institutions and professionals from the public and private sectors , grass-roots organizations and political parties have been actively involved in discussions , round-table meetings and national conferences on governance issues , constitutional and legal reforms , etc . alongside high calibre international experts and consultants .  
Improved and innovative institutional , legal and financial arrangements relating to private sector collaboration , university-industry linkage , strategic business alliances and venture capital have been extensively developed to address the emerging issues relating to new biotechnology .  
Recognizing the high costs of research in biotechnology , several existing agricultural research institutes have strengthened or initiated new biotechnology programmes to address the common elements of research and development as well as the training needs of developing countries in many areas outlined under programme area E , with support from financial institutions , foundations and , to a lesser extent , the private business sector .  
The private sector needs to be actively encouraged to contribute to efforts to work towards sustainable development through the development and use of environmentally sound biotechnologies that balance social , environmental and economic objectives and the dissemination of reliable and accurate information to the public .  
Through various national , regional and global level expert consultations and conferences that involve the public and private sectors and non-governmental organizations , FAO has been increasing the awareness of the challenges and opportunities of modern biotechnologies at various levels .  
" The Committee has been informed that there have been difficulties concerning unpaid bills for goods and services rendered by private persons and organizations to certain missions accredited to the United Nations and certain individual diplomats attached to those missions , and suggests that the Secretariat and others concerned work together to solve these outstanding difficulties . "  
Under the heading " strengthening support for families " , proposed actions would be arranged according to the principal actors concerned : national Governments ; regional or local governments ; the private sector ; non-governmental organizations at different levels ; research and academic institutions ; the media .  
To support private pollution abatement investment , Governments in OECD countries , economies in transition and developing countries have used a wide range of policy instruments , which may be divided into three main categories : directed credit programmes , financial incentives , co-financing arrangements and venture capital funds .  
The survey states , for example , that bilateral and multilateral aid agencies , international organizations , private foundations , universities and commercial companies and national Governments are involved in the financing of international biotechnology initiatives for developing countries .  
It would be desirable for the Commission to discuss more deeply the current and prospective role of the private sector in this regard , develop policy options for enlarging its role and explore the potential of related innovative mechanisms such as co-financing and venture capital funds , in particular for leveraging ODA and public expenditures on sustainable development .  
In her opening statement , the Secretary-General of the Fourth World Conference on Women stressed that the preparatory process at the national and regional levels had proceeded successfully owing to the strong involvement of Governments , international political , financial and development organizations , the private sector , academic and research institutions , donors and , especially , non-governmental organizations .  
To this end , Governments , the international community and civil society , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , are called upon to take strategic action in the following critical areas of concern [ with full respect for religious and ethical values , cultural backgrounds and philosophical convictions in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms ] : [ - The persistent and increasing burden of poverty on women ;  
To encourage Governments , relevant international organizations and the private sector to undertake further work with regard to the application of economic instruments , including tax reforms and the phasing out of environmentally unfriendly economic practices , in accordance with the conditions , needs and priorities of each country and giving full consideration to their potential environmental , economic and social impacts .  
It aims to accelerate the implementation of the Nairobi Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women and the removal of all obstacles to women 's active participation in all spheres of public and private life through a full and equal share in economic , social , cultural and political decision-making .  
On average , women represent a mere 10 per cent of all elected legislators world wide and in most national and international administrative structures , both public and private , they remain underrepresented .  
Industrialization , which was essential for diversifying the production base and generating employment opportunities , especially for a rapidly growing urban population , required adopting measures to create an environment conducive to private investment , both domestic and foreign ;  
It was noted that industrialization , which was essential for diversifying the production base and generating employment opportunities , especially for a rapidly growing urban population , required the adoption of measures to create an environment conducive to private investment ; ( i ) The importance of reversing environmental degradation and addressing its negative implications for long-term development was stressed .  
The structural reforms undertaken in the banking sector centred on privatizing State-owned banks , reducing barriers to entry for both domestic and foreign private banks , liberalizing the types of activities that banks could undertake and , concomitantly , improving the prudential regulation of financial institutions .  
One favourable consequence of the relative openness of the financial sector has been an acceleration of foreign private capital inflows , with the developing countries of the ESCAP region becoming the largest recipient of private capital flows among all developing countries world wide .  
Work under this subprogramme will be aimed at advancing consultations on the effects of adjustment policies , external openness and improved linkages with international markets on agricultural industries ; analysing the impact of increased participation by the agricultural sector in international markets on the public and private sectors ; and analysing recent experience in the agricultural land market , with special reference to the effects on promotion of small rural holdings .  
The major objective of the subprogramme is to meet the needs of Member States for information and policy-oriented analysis on selected issues related to private sector development and the enhancement of the efficiency and effectiveness of public enterprises through the promotion of market-oriented approaches , including the interactions between the international economic environment and national policy actions .  
In the Seychelles , the national human resource development programme has as its objective increasing labour productivity through the creation of an enabling environment and incentives to the private sector and through reforms leading to greater capacity and increased efficiency in the public sector .  
Services on economic reforms in the least developed countries ; economic and financial management in Pacific island developing countries ; demographic issues in the Pacific island developing countries ; institutional capability-building , including private sector development for the promotion of industrial investment and technology transfer ; and promotion of sustainable development in small island developing States ; ( b ) Group training , including seminars and workshops .  
The harmonization of the viewpoints of developing countries at the conceptual level on specific issues pertaining to international economic cooperation ; these would include not merely issues at the macro level , but also at the sectoral level involving meetings of experts from developing countries , and more especially practitioners in the disciplines concerned from both the public and the private sector ;  
Open : in its conception , preparation and convening , the Summit involved all nations as well as a large number of public and private institutions and organizations , placing particular emphasis on the poor , weak and vulnerable , not only to address their problems but also to give them a voice in local , national and international forums . 
In modern management , it has been clearly demonstrated that private and public organizations that achieve excellence do not do so through a detailed , formal restructuring but , rather , inter alia , by developing the capacity to identify an agenda of key decisions , networking , involving staff , making innovations , enhancing flexibility , implementing efficient image-creation policies , improving relations with the media and developing leadership aptitudes to cope with complexity .  
As a result , the same activity can be performed in different countries by a public corporation or by the private sector ; it can be considered as a public utility or public service subject to extensive public regulation or , on the contrary , left to pure market economy , only subject ( for example ) to the law of competition and public order .  
One delegation offered three principles to expand net income from the private sector in developing countries : the income generated should be additional to the general resources country programme allocation ; the strategic importance of the decentralized operations of the regional support centres in Rio de Janeiro and Singapore should be maintained ; and there should continue to be investments from FDP .  
In particular , better understanding is beginning to emerge of linkages between the supply process on the one hand ( population , education , health ) , and the diverse and dynamic activity of fluctuating demand for human resources ( in public and private sector employing establishments , as well as self-employment and a growing variety of less formal ways of making a living ) on the other .  
It has actively involved local , regional and national education authorities , teachers , parents , students , potential employers , non-governmental organizations and regional public and private institutions / organizations that can assist in the designing and testing of the new curriculum .  
In paragraph 12 ( g ) , making economic growth and the interaction of market forces more conducive to social development requires " ensuring substantial public and private investment in human resource development and in capacity-building in health and education , as well as in empowerment and participation , especially for people living in poverty or suffering from social exclusion " .  
Follow-up initiatives should be effectively linked ( a ) across social sectors , and with other key government sectors such as finance , trade , and industry / commerce ; ( b ) between governmental and non-governmental and private agencies and organizations ; and ( c ) reflective of local and community needs through a deeply decentralized functional pattern of operation .  
Political will , a flexible and gradual approach , a favourable economic environment , the involvement of the private sector and relevant sectors of civil society , appropriate institutional and physical infrastructure as well as creative networking were among the factors contributing to such success .  
Today , it is impossible to deny the existence of private entities and public bodies which , under a legal cover , conduct clandestine criminal operations as a parallel activity by hiring people who , in exchange for payment , agree to participate in the commission of unconscionable and illegal acts .  
At the same time , national legislation must be very harsh on State services such as intelligence or security services , or authorities with repressive proclivities , or private totalitarian-minded associations which , resorting to markets where mercenaries are available , recruit individuals for the purpose of establishing praetorian guards , death squads or operational groups devoted to political repression or to the assassination of political , religious or other adversaries .  
Similarly foreigners who joined the armed forces of a State as regular and permanent members and received material compensation similar to that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in those armed forces , and who are not motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain or material compensation , should not be classified as mercenaries .  
National legislation should be very harsh on State services , such as intelligence or security services , or authorities with repressive proclivities or private totalitarian-minded associations which , resorting to markets where mercenaries are available , recruit individuals for the purpose of establishing praetorian guards , death squads or operational groups devoted to political repression or the assassination of political or religious adversaries .  
As always , it is the entire package of adjustment measures , plus adequate debt relief , official financial support and a buoyancy in an open world economy that builds confidence in the private sector and charges up dynamic development processes .  The external debt situation of the transition economies is thus not covered in this report .  
To this end , we shall establish , based on the successful public / private sector Caribbean Coalition on Tourism Marketing Programme for North America , broad-based regional marketing programmes and joint representation in the major markets , including the intra-Caribbean market , on a sustainable basis , and develop , not later than the end of 1995 , a financing arrangement to sustain this initiative .  
The SPF secretariat encourages enterprise sector participation in regional industrial development activities through various measures such as ongoing regular and consultation visits to public and private enterprises , liaison with national chambers of commerce and industry , training seminars and workshops , and provision of technical assistance facilities ( a marketing support fund scheme was set up to provide assistance to new exporters , for example ) .  
Other steps included close cooperation to ensure that all the group 's financial sector operations were carried out in the context of a sound reform strategy ; explicit support by the group to privatization , through the provision of advisory services to Governments and the provision of finance for public enterprise restructuring and investments in privatized firms ; and the intensification of the group 's research on private sector issues .  
Through its collaboration with the regional agricultural credit associations , FAO encourages financial institutions to revise their approaches and restructure their operations to better serve private sector enterprises and to enable them to act as contacts for new , emerging grassroots ' financial intermediaries at the national level .  
The work deals with comparative experiences in the privatization of water supply , focusing on private sector participation in urban water utility operations in industrialized , developing and transitional countries , an important area of intergovernmental policy discussions , including those relevant to Habitat II .  
A special effort was made to bring to the Conference experts from industry , public and private , and to emphasize the practical issues and options of the conversion process .  The subjects covered included the nuclear industry , military machines , shipbuilding , electronics , aeronautical and aerospace industries , information , intellectual property and international cooperation .  
It aims at training senior managers of Chinese military enterprises for conversion to production of civilian goods for the domestic and world markets , and facilitating joint ventures by bringing together major domestic and international investors from the private sector in the most attractive and committed Chinese enterprises .  
In general , the United Nations system should be able to help Governments define the role and scope of the public , mixed and private sectors and to suggest options in the modalities of interaction in accordance with the realities in each country , especially at the local and municipal levels , by means of specific technical assistance , dissemination and exchange of country experiences and research on the conditions for successful replication .  
Establish , consistent with data protection legislation , databases on women and their qualification for use in appointing women to senior decision-making and advisory positions , for dissemination to Governments , regional and international organizations and private enterprise , political parties and other relevant bodies .  
Implementation is primarily the responsibility of Governments , but is also dependent on a wide range of institutions in the public , private and non-governmental sectors at the community , national , subregional / regional and international levels . specifically devoted to women 's advancement globally . 
Implementation of the Platform for Action by national , subregional / regional and international institutions , both public and private , would be facilitated by transparency , by increased linkages between networks and organizations and by a consistent flow of information among all concerned .  
On average , women represent a mere 10 per cent of all elected legislators world wide and in most national and international administrative structures , both public and private , they remain underrepresented .  
To this end , Governments , the international community and civil society , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , are called upon to take strategic action in the following critical areas of concern [ with full respect for religious and ethical values , cultural backgrounds and philosophical convictions and in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms ] :  
Undertake to explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures , trade in arms and investment in arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to permit the possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development , in particular for the advancement of women ;  
Academic institutions and professional associations have a major role to play in accumulating theoretical knowledge on organized transnational crime and in disseminating this knowledge , in close cooperation with governmental agencies and the education system , as well as in concert with the media , non-governmental organizations and the private sector .  
Thus , contemporary United States domestic law on federal , state and local levels provides strong protections against racial discrimination in all fields of public endeavour and in many areas of private life .  
Thus , contemporary United States domestic law on federal , state and local levels provides strong protections against racial discrimination in all fields of public endeavour and in many areas of private life .  
Policy makers in some developing countries have thus begun to focus on the disparate characteristics of different types of private financial inflows and many now question the wisdom of early and complete liberalization of the capital account in international transactions .  Meanwhile , in some of the developed countries , the prospective role of development assistance itself is being re-examined .  
A related concern is that the foreign debt difficulties of developing countries - debt owed to both private and official creditors - have for the most part not yet been resolved in a durable manner more than a decade after the debt crisis burst onto the international political stage .  
Some countries , such as Morocco , South Africa , Tunisia , Uganda and Zimbabwe , have seen an increased inflow of private capital ; in 1994 , for example , South Africa recorded the first net capital inflow since 1984 , comprising mainly commercial bank loans and public and private international bond issues . 
NULLFor most of the post-war era , it has been taken for granted that the domestic savings of developing countries need to be supplemented with foreign savings to boost investment adequately and that it is not practical to expect private international financing to do the job : some projects that are developmentally important are just not bankable or practical areas for direct foreign investment .  
Many audits identified such problems as private cheques ( even vendors ' cheques ) that were being encashed by the cashiers out of funds in their custody , reconciliations of cash not being performed on a regular basis , old reconciling items not being cleared , cash advances remaining uncleared for long periods and improperly credited cash receipt vouchers .  
NULLThe objective of this undertaking was to draw policy recommendations from an in-depth review of the existing financial systems in African countries , including the current traditional systems and practices of capital formation at the local level , with a view to improving financial systems in those countries through the adoption of practical and realistic measures focused specifically on development of the private sector . 
NULLPursuant to General Assembly resolution 36 / 151 , voluntary contributions to the Fund from Governments , non-governmental organizations and private individuals are to be distributed through established channels of assistance , as humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals whose human rights have been severely violated as a result of torture and to relatives of such victims .  
NULLAs emphasized in previous reports , one of the circumstances leading to abuses against women is the practically unlimited powers granted to members of the Popular Police Forces and the People 's Committees " in the preservation of the moral health of the society " .  Article 5 , chapter I of Constitutional Decree No .  1993 concerning private and public life states as follows :  
Uganda intended to continue to work with its bilateral and multilateral development partners on innovative ways of mobilizing private productive capital and , to that end , had taken a number of domestic administrative and policy measures .  
Turning to the report on the sources of finance for development at mid-decade ( A / 50 / 397 ) , he noted that the marked increases in private resource flows to Asia and Latin America , which had far exceeded official flows , reflected successful economic reforms and strengthened political confidence in those regions .  
By confiscating the property of expelled Serbs in Krajina , the Government of the Republic of Croatia has violated the universal and sacred right of the inviolability of private property .  Considering that it has carried out this act guided exclusively by national criteria , this represents a glaring example of national , racial and religious discrimination and hatred .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
The main focus of the country programmes , as determined during the missions , will be on the strategic management of industrial development , human resources development , quality control and standardization , the environment , private sector development , with emphasis on small and medium industries , and the implications of the Uruguay Round agreements for the industrialization of Africa .  
Zambia adopted market liberalization and private sector development as an integral part of its economic reform programme , in moving away from its past socialist development strategy , which had been dominated by a rigid , inefficient centralized state sector .  
Also stresses the urgent need for creditor countries , private banks and lending institutions to expand their efforts to address the commercial debt of debt-distressed developing countries , and to extend appropriate new financial support , as well as provide additional and innovative measures , to enable these countries to achieve sustained economic growth and development ;  
The FS initiated partnerships with international , Federal , State , and private organizations for ecosystem assessment , leading to greater use of satellite data and increased understanding of global ecological processes .  
Stresses the necessity for the international community , especially the developed countries , to create a favourable international environment to reduce volatility in private capital flows to developing countries and to enhance their growth-promoting role through , inter alia , the expansion of productive capacities in developing countries , to support their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
The policy agenda agreed at the meeting had a strong accent on the following areas : ( a ) a greater external orientation of the least developed countries ' economies ; ( b ) development of a dynamic private enterprise sector ; ( c ) human resources development ; ( d ) eradication of poverty ; and ( e ) a renewed commitment to provide external support .  
The growth of a dynamic private enterprise sector should be underpinned by an appropriate economic , fiscal and legal framework with the following essential features : stable and predictable policies ; tax , monetary and trade policies that ensure adequate incentives for investment ; and a legal system which protects property rights and commercial contracts .  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities such as triangular funding arrangements and private sector funding ;  
Thanks to free enterprise , a number of popular daily and weekly newspapers enjoyed mass circulation and dozens of private radio stations and some independent television companies were now in operation .  
The United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , which was the core of the system of operational activities , had provided assistance in such crucial areas as national capacity-building in management , governance and democratization , private sector development and economic reforms , human resources , the social sector and the development of environmentally sound energy sources .  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
that the international community should continue to give strong support to the efforts of the developing countries to solve their grave economic and social problems as well as to promote a favourable climate for private financial flows through the creation of a favourable international economic environment ,  
concern also that a significant number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets ,  
developing countries , an active private sector , including the informal sector - whose linkages with the formal sector should be strengthened - and small and medium-sized enterprises provided the principal means to generate productive employment .  
the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access ;  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , particularly in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
The immediate effects of the beginning of the war in 1991 were as follows : the tourist market was depressed as a result of the lack of security ; many hotels and private accommodations were occupied by displaced persons and refugees ; commercial and communication links were immediately cut from the north ; and routes inland towards Bosnia and Herzegovina were blocked . 
Invites creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions , within their prerogatives , to consider continuing the initiatives and efforts to address the commercial debt problems of the least developed countries and the requests for continued mobilization of resources through the Debt-reduction Facility of the International Development Association in order to help eligible least developed countries reduce their commercial debt ;

Notes with appreciation the contribution of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in formulating international measures to deal with the special problems of the land-locked developing countries , and urges the Conference , inter alia , to keep under constant review the evolution of transit-transport infrastructure facilities , institutions and services , monitor the implementation of agreed measures , collaborate in all relevant initiatives , including those of the private sector and non-governmental organizations , and serve as a focal point on cross-regional issues of interest to land-locked developing countries ;

the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access ,  
Faced with the growing threat and multifaceted problem of drug abuse , Governments have come to realize the urgent need to develop and implement a comprehensive set of responses , coordinated to achieve the maximum impact and relying on the active involvement of all government agencies and numerous bodies and institutions , including in the private sector , that play a role in drug control . 
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to include in his report to the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole estimates of the projected resource requirements from all sources , public and private , domestic and international , needed for the full implementation of the New Agenda , the amount expected to be mobilized and proposals to address any resource gaps , taking into account the specific economic and development situations of African countries ;  
Reiterates the call for formulating or strengthening by 1996 comprehensive cross-sectoral strategies for implementing the outcome of the Summit and national strategies for social development , including government action , actions by States in cooperation with other Governments , international , regional and subregional organizations , and actions taken in partnership and cooperation with actors of civil society , the private sector and cooperatives , with specific responsibilities to be undertaken by each actor and with agreed priorities and time-frames ;  
Modernizing public administration in order to establish clear parameters for a modern , innovative civil service must include among its priorities the updating of the private sector and enhancing the ability to compete in foreign markets , while taking into account the economic and social balance required and ensuring sustainable development and employment .  
The 1990s have been a decade of political and economic upheaval throughout the world , and there has been an increasing tendency towards democratization and the participation of non-governmental actors in development , with a particularly strong emphasis on the need for good governance and for sound financial and economic policies at the national level and a greater reliance on market forces and on the private sector as basic requirements of development .  
In August 1985 , a major shift took place in our economic policy that included , among other measures , a reform and simplification of the taxation system , a drastic reduction in the fiscal deficit , price deregulation , a reordering of the public enterprise sector and a greater openness to private investment , both foreign and domestic .  
It also involves injecting new capital from the private sector , either domestic or foreign , into national public enterprises through an innovative , efficient capitalization and administration plan , in collaboration with strategic private partners .  
Streamlining governmental machinery , increasing its productivity and reducing costs , improving economic and financial management , promoting the interaction between the private and public sectors , and stimulating the participation of the various actors in this process have been at the forefront of recent efforts for public administration reforms in Austria .  
The transition from a centrally planned economy and a centralized public administration with the State directly involved in the production of goods and services , to a fully developed public and private sector is not easy to achieve ; it takes time and is expensive .  
The lessons learned so far have proved that without supportive and predictable administrative and legal structures at all levels , and without access to public services particularly to a justice system the private sector and citizens would live in a state of uncertainty and insecurity , hindering the development of their full potential .  
This set of realities has led Algeria , committed as it is to a vast process of economic reform , to formulate and implement a development strategy which , while subjecting the economy to the laws of the marketplace , will ensure the necessary balance between the various State functions , tying the powers of the public authorities in the coordination of economic activity to the desire to preserve to the greatest extent possible a patrimony that has been built up through the colossal efforts of our national community , while encouraging free enterprise and private initiative .  
The immediate consequences of this were the destruction of approximately one seventh of the population , the majority of whom were in the productive labour force ; the destruction of infrastructure and equipment , both public and private ; the collapse of institutions , including the civil service , judiciary and local administration , to mention but a few ; a severe setback in economic activity , particularly agriculture and industrial activities ; the exodus of between 1-million and 2-million people to neighbouring countries as refugees ;  
They include the elimination of automatic direct access to the civil service for all of those leaving training institutions ; the opening up of training institutions to the private sector , as well as to foreign students , especially those from the subregion , provided they pay for their training ; revision of the institutions ' current rules to permit them to generate their own resources and to allow for self-management ; and revitalizing the work of improving the various institutions , work in which the potential users will be able to participate .  
In a democratic country , public administration which is effective and enlightened because it is refocused on its essential tasks can contribute powerfully to a country 's economic development not only by coordinating the efforts of public and private enterprise , but also by attracting worthwhile investment .  
Indeed , the need for fundamental review in the role of public administration and development has become urgent because countries have to meet the complex developmental challenges of dealing with the impact of increasing globalization and the role of non-governmental organizations and the private sector , while focusing on the primary objectives of eliminating poverty and promoting social justice and economic growth .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
The Committee identified as major factors and difficulties in implementing the Convention : the weak State machinery to effectively maintain the peace process ; the difficult process of national reconciliation ; the breakdown of public infrastructure and private support systems ; the large number of Rwandan refugees and internally displaced persons ; the great number of militias and some civilians who are still armed ; and the shattered economy and extreme poverty .  
In the past four years the economy recorded an average growth rate of 8.2 per cent , resulting in increased employment opportunities and significantly rising living standards in the country , primarily in urban areas , where private enterprises are flourishing , and in fertile rural areas , where farmers have better incentive to grow and market their produce .  
The agreements of the Uruguay Round concluded in 1994 , the rapid redefinition of economic groupings in the developed countries , and the ever more important role of private capital in the world economy , have created a new international environment in which the interests of Africa do not seem to have been taken into account , or in which they are even threatened or compromised . 
This has been done to achieve balance and stability in the economy as a whole and to activate the role of the private sector on the basis of a market economy and free competition , while taking into account the importance of improving basic essential social services , building a modern State and improving the standard of living of citizens .  
That is why in many African countries today Governments continue with determination to carry out bold and difficult reforms , reflected , inter alia , in the improved and more rational use of public funds , in the opening of our economies to international trade and in the creation of conditions conducive to private enterprise and to the transparent management of public affairs with , most importantly , all sectors of society participating in the work of national development , in the interests of all .  
As expected , the series of global conferences held recently under the auspices of the United Nations , which involved not only Governments but also non-governmental organizations , civil society , the media and the private sector , have raised awareness of and built consensus around a number of overarching issues concerning economic growth and sustainable development .  
In light of the vital role played by non-governmental organizations and the private sector in children 's advocacy , raising public and political awareness , mobilizing resources and fostering more active and systemic involvement should be encouraged at all levels , from developing and implementing strategies for the second half-decade to monitoring and assessing their progress .  
Finally , sound monetary and fiscal policies implemented by a government which is transparent and accountable will also help to provide the confidence needed to attract private sector investment that is critical to growth and job creation . 
Also proclaimed is the critical importance of the cooperation , support and contributions of the international community , the United Nations , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society including private citizens for social development .  
On the home front , supporting the private and informal sectors , promotion of self-employment , provision of credit facilities to the unemployed , encouraging the creation of volunteer organizations including grass-roots financial organizations , investment in training and education programmes , optimal use of resources such as land and water , expansion of labour-intensive economic activities and a focus on the service sector are among the necessary first steps .  
The definitive solution to the problem of the external debt , of ownership and of a considerable improvement in national , foreign and private investment , in the framework of a sound and responsible macroeconomic policy favouring internal savings and contributing to improving the standard of living of the Nicaraguan people , must be our goal .  
While in the beginning of this partnership large amounts had to be contributed towards emergency measures , today the extensive bilateral development cooperation focuses mainly on the consolidation of structural adaptation processes , the rehabilitation of social infrastructures , the promotion of private enterprises ( including vocational training ) , agricultural development , and the protection of the environment and natural resources .  
Success in reforms , promotion of the private sector and direct foreign investment , increased activity in the democratic process and the strengthening of civilian society are essential elements of an Agenda for Development , and to a large extent depend on the support of the international community , in terms of resources and political will .  
This commitment is reflected in the vital and multifaceted relations that we have with African Governments both at the bilateral level and through a range of multilateral agencies , and which take the form of the continuing engagement of Canadian non-governmental organizations throughout the continent , and growing number of partnerships in the private sector . 
If we agree that long-term , sustained growth and sustainable development depend on the private sector and on attracting foreign direct investment , then we must identify a true incentive for investment , since Africa , despite its conducive climate , is still unable to attract foreign direct investment .  
In order to achieve the major objectives of the New Agenda and the target growth rate of 6 per cent , the international community must accelerate its support to African countries in order to sustain the momentum leading to recovery and sustainable development in areas such as the further alleviation of the burden of external debt , the attraction of foreign private investment , increased official development assistance , trade facilitation and market access , and development assistance for capacity-building .  
For example , even though calls for the promotion of the private sector , increased industrial development and foreign direct investment , and the reduction of external debt in African countries are regularly made in various forums , harsh marketplace reality shows that portfolio equity investment remains virtually absent , and that less than 5 per cent of global foreign direct investment is targeted to African countries .  
Even though it is important to reaffirm a strong commitment of the private sector , donor Governments , agencies and non-governmental organizations to genuine partnership for the accelerated industrial growth of Africa , a critical step must be made to design policies based on the real needs of individual African economies , as development will take place in Africa only when its peoples have democratic control over their own policies .  
Each nation is responsible for itself and must create , through rigorous public management and compliance with its legislative rulings , optimum conditions for freeing private initiative , a factor in economic and commercial progress .  
The presentation of Uruguay 's initial report ( CRC / C / 3 / Add . 37 ) at the latest session of the Committee on the Rights of the Child had provided an opportunity for a constructive dialogue which had demonstrated the priority now accorded to children by the Government of Uruguay in its political programme to promote public and private activities carried out with the financial aid of the international community . 
Requests improved annual reporting on financial flows , including allocations / expenditures , based on consistent criteria and related to the costed elements of the Programme of Action , including a clear account of levels and trends of funding by source ( bilateral , multilateral ( both core and non-core ) and private funds , domestic allocations and the like ) ;  
Reaffirms the need for ensuring an effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners and the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Calls upon the international community to seek to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including , as mutually agreed , on concessional and grant terms ;

Themes found in both the guidelines and the common advocacy statement include putting people first ; promoting sustainable human development ; reducing gender inequality and inequity ; fostering accountability and transparency ; developing common indicators that are critical to the monitoring of programme impact ; strengthening country-level collaboration ; enhancing national capacity-building ; and facilitating dialogue between and among the United Nations resident coordinator system , Governments , non-governmental organizations , the private sector and civil society . 
As industrialization proceeds in the dynamic developing economies and middle-income developing countries , rising standards of living and rapid urbanization will contribute to strong growth in electricity demand and petroleum consumption will rise from an increase in private motor transport .  
The Constitution contained provisions entitling women to remedial and affirmative action , with a view to enabling them to participate in political , economic and social life and gain access to positions in public and private institutions on an equal footing with men .  
In view of those difficulties , the Government was developing a policy that combined campaigns to eradicate stereotypes in several areas , ranging from the sharing of domestic responsibilities to the role of the media , with the establishment of affirmative action programmes in the public and private sectors .  
Stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Recognizing that the international community should continue to give strong support to the efforts of the developing countries to solve their grave economic and social problems as well as to promote a favourable climate for private financial flows through the creation of a favourable international economic environment ,  
Expressing concern also that a significant number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets ,  
Invites creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions , within their prerogatives , to consider continuing the initiatives and efforts to address the commercial debt problems of the least developed countries and the requests for continued mobilization of resources through the Debt-reduction Facility of the International Development Association in order to help eligible least developed countries reduce their commercial debt ;  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access ,  
Notes with appreciation the contribution of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in formulating international measures to deal with the special problems of the land-locked developing countries , and urges the Conference , inter alia , to keep under constant review the evolution of transit transport infrastructure facilities , institutions and services , monitor the implementation of agreed measures , collaborate in all relevant initiatives , including those of the private sector and non-governmental organizations , and serve as a focal point on cross-regional issues of interest to land-locked developing countries ;  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
He has published several books and numerous articles on the law of nationality , private international law , in the strict sense , and international civil procedural law in Venezuelan and foreign journals .  
It was recognized that , while private capital flows to developing countries could make an important contribution to growth and development , many of those inflows were in the form of portfolio investment rather than direct investment in productive capacity , and their distribution among developing countries was uneven , with countries needing capital most being unable to attract them .  
However , the progress made towards establishing the institutional and physical infrastructure for the active involvement of the public and private sector in the economy , though notable , fell short of expectations , which appeared to have been overly optimistic .  
Although the structural causes of the problems have often to be dealt with at the national and sometimes the international level , progress will depend to a large degree on local authorities , civic engagement and the forging of partnerships at all levels of government with the private sector , the cooperative sector , non-governmental and community-based organizations , workers and employers and civil society at large . 
In Habitat II , Governments at all levels , the community and the private sector considered how the achievement of the two principal goals of " Adequate shelter for all " and " Sustainable human settlements development in an urbanizing world " can be furthered at the local level through an enabling process in which individuals , families and their communities play a central role .  
The sooner communities , local governments , partnerships among the public , and private and community sectors join efforts to create comprehensive , bold and innovative strategies for shelter and human settlements , the better the prospects will be for the safety , health and well-being of people and the brighter the outlook for solutions to global environment and social problems .  
Establish and implement consultative mechanisms among the governmental authorities that are responsible for economic , environmental , social , human settlements and shelter policies , and the organization of civil society and the private sector so as to coordinate the shelter sector in a coherent manner , which should include identifying the market and precise criteria for allocations , subsidies and other forms of assistance ;  
Adopt an enabling legal and regulatory framework based on an enhanced knowledge , understanding and acceptance of existing practices and land delivery mechanisms so as to stimulate partnerships with the private business and community sectors , specifying recognized types of land tenure and prescribing procedures for the regularization of tenure , where needed ;  
To provide opportunities for productive employment and private investment , Governments at the appropriate levels , including local authorities , in consultation with workers ' and employers ' organizations , chambers of commerce , industry , trade , consumer organizations , professional associations , and the financial sector , including the cooperative sector , and in the context of comprehensive urban planning , should :  
The registration of aircraft , that has been provided for - as far as civil aircraft are concerned - in the 1944 Chicago Convention , and the registration of space objects that has been provided for in the 1975 Registration Convention which provides for any object launched into outer space ; both instruments establish different ways of , and requirements for registration ; Liability , which in the case of an aircraft is based on international treaties and partly on national law and is attributable to private persons .  
This requires , as appropriate , establishing policies , laws and regulations for both public and private activities , encouraging responsible private activities in all fields , facilitating community groups ' participation , adopting transparent procedures , encouraging public-spirited leadership and public-private partnerships , and helping people to understand and exercise their rights and responsibilities through open and effective participatory processes , universal education and information dissemination .  NULL  
Partnerships among countries and among all actors within countries from public , private , voluntary , and community-based organizations , the cooperative sector , non-governmental organizations , and individuals are essential to the achievement of sustainable human settlements development and the provision of adequate shelter for all and basic services .  
Chapter 7 of Agenda 21 developed the concept of an " enabling approach " in the human settlements sector , whereby a partnership among the public , private and community sectors sought to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and the rural poor .  
Where appropriate , re-direct public resources to encourage community-based management of services and infrastructure and promote the participation of the private sector and local residents , including people living in poverty , women , people with disabilities , indigenous people and members of disadvantaged groups , in the identification of public service needs , spatial planning and the design , provision and maintenance of urban infrastructure and open and green spaces .  
To promote social integration , Governments at the appropriate level , including local authorities , recognizing the importance of volunteer contributions and in close cooperation with non-governmental organizations , community-based organizations , the cooperative sector and public and private foundations , should :  
We commit ourselves to the strategy of enabling all key actors in the public , private and community sectors to play an effective role - at national , state / provincial , metropolitan , and local levels - in human settlements and shelter development .  
We commit ourselves to strengthening existing financial mechanisms and , where appropriate , developing new mechanisms for financing the implementation of the Habitat Agenda , which will mobilize increased sources of finance - public , private , multilateral , and bilateral - at the international , regional , national and local levels , and will promote the efficient , effective and accountable allocation and management of resources .  
Stimulating national and local economies , through enabling competitive and sustainable economic development that will attract public and international financial resources and private investments , generate employment and increase revenues , providing a stronger financial base to support shelter and human settlements development ;  
In a manner consistent with national legislation , seek to increase the ability of local authorities , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to link directly with global capital markets , in accordance with prudential safeguards in those markets , in order to finance their shelter and infrastructure programmes and to establish international and local mechanisms and instruments to facilitate risk sharing and credit enhancement for investing agencies - local , regional and national ;  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , and bilateral - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support sustainable human settlements development .  
Encouraging multilateral development institutions and donors to support nations in their effort to pursue enabling strategies through which national and local governments , communities and the private and cooperative sectors can form partnerships to participate in shelter and sustainable human settlements development activities ;  
Inviting multilateral and bilateral donors to support countries , particularly developing countries , in their efforts to pursue enabling strategies through which governments , local authorities , communities , and the private and cooperative sectors can form partnerships to participate in the provision of adequate shelter , including social housing and sustainable human settlements development activities ;  
Developing economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investments , and seeking innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements development programmes , while ensuring effective utilization of those resources ;  
Strengthening financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes , and strengthening cooperation among Governments at all levels , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises , and international institutions , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to low-income individuals , women , and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups for shelter and human settlements development ;  
Assisting countries , particularly developing countries , in implementing effective and equitable pricing mechanisms for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements , infrastructure and services in order to induce greater flows of private , domestic and global funds , while ensuring transparent and targeted subsidies for people living in poverty ;  
Developing innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for human settlements development and creating a supportive environment for the mobilization of resources by civil society , including beneficiary and individual voluntary contributions ;  
The task of pursuing the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , in the face of increasing global economic interaction , necessitates international cooperation of public and private institutions operating in the areas of human settlement development , whereby resources , information and capacities are pooled for a more effective response to human settlements problems . 156 bis .  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Fixed satellite communications had given noticeable support to the growth of global , regional , national and local networks for government institutions and private enterprises in their daily operations .  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Requests improved annual reporting on financial flows including allocations / expenditures based on consistent criteria , relating to the costed elements of the Programme of Action , including a clear account of levels and trends of funding by source ( bilateral , multilateral ( both core and non-core ) , private , domestic allocations , etc . ) ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to include in his report to the Ad Hoc Committee estimates of the projected resource requirements from all sources , public and private , domestic and international , needed for the full implementation of the New Agenda , the amount expected to be mobilized and proposals for filling any resource gaps , taking into account the specific economic and development situation of African countries ;  
Also reiterates the call for formulating or strengthening by 1996 comprehensive cross-sectoral strategies for implementing the outcome of the Summit and national strategies for social development , including government action , actions by States in cooperation with other Governments and international , regional and subregional organizations , and actions taken in partnership and cooperation with actors of civil society , the private sector and cooperatives , with specific responsibilities to be undertaken by each actor and with agreed priorities and time-frames ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 7 ] / including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
The principles considered were not limited to traditional relations of public international law but were in fact also relevant to private international law ( conflict of laws with regard to transnational relations between individuals and various kinds of organizations , whether incorporated or not ) and international administrative law ( with regard to relations between individuals or organizations and public authorities ) .  
The most updated theory of international aviation law states than an aircraft designed for " civilian " air transport belonging to a private airline and operated by a civilian crew may in a particular situation be considered to be " State aircraft " if it performs a military , customs or police function . . .  Other aircraft , besides those involved in military , customs or police services , could also be considered " State aircraft " because the enumeration in the Convention is not preclusive .  
The active involvement of a wide variety of major groups , including national and international non-governmental organizations , the media , corporations and firms in the private sector , the scientific community , educational organizations and indigenous communities , is now sought on a more consistent basis .  
With strong support from the interim secretariat , bilateral donors and United Nations agencies , national awareness seminars are widespread and are doing a good job of educating key national actors , in both the public and private sectors , about the significance of the Convention .  
In the interest of current government efforts to meet the complex development challenges of dealing with the impact of increasing globalization and the expanding role of the market and private sector and of eliminating poverty and promoting social justice , protecting the environment and supporting participatory democracy , the need for a fundamental review of the role of public administration in development is urgent and apparent now more than ever .  
By responding to the changing needs of developing countries in strengthening their administrative , financial and information systems for better development management , it is anticipated that better working relationships can be created at the country level between the public and private sector .  
The services feature advice and assistance to adjust the role of Governments to ensuring adequate competition , promoting new investment , achieving quality standards , meeting environmental and social requirements and enabling more active participation of the private sector in the industrialization process , including policy formulation and institutional support .  
While Governments , in the new context of the growing importance of the market and the private sector , have a diminished productive role in economic development , it is important to note that all Governments will retain responsibility for providing a regulatory framework for the effective operation of a competitive market system . 
Public administration will continue to fulfil critical functions in development , supporting measures for economic growth , protecting the environment , determining the relationship between the public and the private sector , reducing poverty and illiteracy and other social development activities , thereby achieving the goals of sustainable development .  
Tasks like facilitating public administration by effectively and creatively utilizing human resources ; building government processes and institutions to provide a peaceful resolution of conflict ; the need to shift non-core functions of government to the private sector ; to maintain the vitality of technical cooperation while changing the mechanisms of delivery to incorporate additional technological advances ; and to perform those tasks successfully while balancing severe resource constraints .  
The United Nations will assist Governments in creating and strengthening national capacities in fiscal policy analysis and economic management and in designing strategies aimed at creating and improving a proper environment and regulatory framework for capital flows for productive investments , promoting private sector development and increasing transparency and accountability . 
Because it is not always easy in Tajikistan to distinguish between political violence , violent crime and violence arising from private disagreements , UNMOT personnel located at team sites endeavour , in the exercise of their good offices , to resolve minor incidents at the local level while keeping their superior at headquarters informed . 
Improved access to private capital will be a key to success in providing EST opportunities for and improving the environmental performance of SMEs . Such companies have difficulties in remaining competitive in the rapidly expanding international marketplace .  
A significant increase in private sector investment for environmental protection also occurred in the newly industrialized developing countries , while in economies in transition a marked increase is expected in the future , in particular in economies with a rapid rate of privatization of industries .  
ITU had been instrumental in the establishment of the World Telecommunication Organization ( WorldTel ) , a cooperative body financed by private investors from industrialized countries which assisted developing countries in providing access to telecommunication facilities for a large segment of their population through the introduction of cost-effective technologies and the creation of a liberal economic environment .  
That could include the development of model legislation dealing with matters such as the exercise of jurisdiction over stateless vessels on the high seas ; providing legal authority for stopping , boarding and searching vessels in accordance with article 17 of the 1988 Convention ; and the collection , translation and distribution of relevant legislation , of bilateral and multilateral agreements , and of national and international memoranda of understanding between States , agencies or other entities such as private companies .  
Fundamental to this expanded inflow has been the increased confidence generated within the private sector , including the banking and insurance sectors , as a result of the willingness of country administrations to demonstrate a continued responsiveness to private investor concerns in the area of policy development , in the development and enhancement of stable and transparent mining and investment codes , and in the development of supportive administrative frameworks .  
Directly tied into this process has been the continued dissemination of individual country information through the very successful investment seminars and round-table discussions which have enabled private companies , financial institutions and technical advisers to gain a better understanding of various countries and their risk factors , and to develop good working relationships with private and government officials and the multilateral and bilateral aid institutions , all with a view towards creating a sustainable economic and environmentally sound base of operations on which to build within the various countries .  
Rather than the initial very simple structure of a pure equity investment by an individual foreign investor where risk was self insured , a number of joint venture investments have concluded and have been structured to include a mix of equity and non-recourse project debt , with insurance provided by either private or agency insurers .  
The private sector is slowly responding through increased financial investment , the development of primary and ancillary industries and businesses around mining , the implementation of education and training programmes for local workforces , the transfer of technology and the deepening of institutions required to sustain growth .  
As a result of the efforts within Ghana to devise frameworks supportive of private investment , including vigorous adjustments in socio-economic policy in concert with the IMF and the IFC , the underlying economy has shown improvement , and the Government has received tangible economic benefit for subsequent redistribution . 
In certain of the more advanced developing countries , the early introduction of radical reforms into mineral development policies and the associated fiscal and regulatory environments aimed at attracting private funds into the mining sector and at securing foreign expertise to improve the management and efficiency of State-owned , controlled and operated companies , are slowly starting to show benefits with respect to impact on the socio-economic area .  
In addition , as project funding in emerging markets requires a multi-disciplined approach , including the cooperation and coordination of foreign investors , commercial banks , multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies , the multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies have supplied much needed risk mitigation through co - and re-insurance , through lending of structured finance and through provision of senior loan guarantees which have enabled private investors and local joint venture partners to invest in projects in various jurisdictions . 
Provide funding for research on and assistance in the development and implementation of appropriate mineral resource , investment , legal , fiscal , environmental and other related policy and procedural frameworks to improve the enabling environment in order to attract and secure long-term private investment ;  
Reforms are slowly taking hold , and in the countries where the reforms are most advanced , perceptible improvements in the business environments are noticeable , and the private sector is responding through increased direct investment in the minerals sector with a corresponding multiplier effect into the economy , i.e . with job creation , the development of local small - and medium-sized enterprises and capacity building in physical , social and economic infrastructure .  
The key elements of the plan included an agreed ratio of IPTF to Federation police in the various areas ; the issuance of special identity cards for Federation police authorized and cleared by IPTF ; a change in the composition of the Federation police in each suburb to reflect the ethnic mix of the population according to the 1991 census ; IPTF authorization of Federation police check-points ; and requests in advance for searches of houses or private property .  
In all countries of the ESCAP region , the private sector is viewed as a key instrument for achieving economic goals in a world of rapidly increasing global competition as it is considered to be more efficient , flexible and productive than the public sector in undertaking a large variety of investment , production , distribution and service-related activities .  
However , the success of the policies followed depends on the underlying preconditions for private sector development , including stable and credible political conditions , law and order , and the continuity of policies which in themselves must be credible , consistent and transparent , as well as stable macroeconomic conditions .  
With the increasing relevance of competition policy in managing a competitive economy based on the private sector , a pressing need emerges for each country in the region to legislate viable laws governing the potential abuses of market power .  
The Committee recommended that the report include an evaluation of the importance of small-scale mining in the economies of developing countries and the economies in transition , as well as an analysis of new approaches and developments , focusing on the roles of local communities , the private sector , foreign capital and joint ventures , and also highlighting recent results obtained in specific areas of activity .  NULLThe present report is part of a continuing assessment of the field of small-scale mining by the Committee on Natural Resources .  
Among the partners in such cooperation are governments , governmental agencies , United Nations entities , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , national and local professional and scientific associations , academic institutions , private enterprises and individuals .  The present report takes into consideration the results of discussions held at the fourth session of the Commission .  
Take note of the progress report , submitted by UNCTAD , of the analytical study on the relationship of environmental protection to international competitiveness , job creation and development , and invite UNCTAD to elaborate on the study , with the contributions of Governments , regional economic integration organizations , the private sector , non-governmental organizations and other relevant regional and international organizations , and to submit the results to the Commission at its fifth session , in 1997 .

The overall objective of programme 3 , Outer space affairs , is to promote international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space by assisting and collaborating with Member States , in particular developing countries , organizations within the United Nations system , national and international space-related organizations and the private sector in the areas of space science and technology with emphasis on the application of space technology for sustainable development .  
A second objective will be to increase awareness of the changing nature , volume and direction of international financial flows , propose ways and means to enhance and stabilize both official and private finance , monitor changes in the external debt situation and identify innovative approaches and strategies to resolve the difficulties of countries with debt-servicing problems ;  
In addition , in the face of the increasing integration and globalization of the world economy , Governments as well as the private sector and non-governmental organizations at the national and local levels will increasingly require policy advice , technical information and direct operational support in implementing Agenda 21 and the Habitat agenda at the urban and local levels .  
To strengthen the capacity of Governments at the national and local levels as well as of the private sector to manage the rapidly growing demand for infrastructure and services in urban and rural settlements in an economically efficient and environmentally and socially sustainable manner ;  
The capacity of African societies and economies for real and sustained growth are being increasingly realized , as most economic policies are now focused on the creation of an enabling environment for the private sector and efficient operation of the market economy .  
In particular , the private enterprise sector , which is the key agent of development , is not well developed in most African countries , and its growth is constrained by shortages of capital and of entrepreneurial , managerial , technical and marketing skills .  
Since private capital flows are becoming a major source of financing for developing countries , African countries that seem to be involved in a process of adjusting their financial structures and liberalizing their economies are likely to attract foreign resources , both for portfolio , and more particularly , direct investment .  Creation of domestic capital markets , as complementary measures to the process of economic liberalization and privatization , is essential if the countries need to broaden and improve the savings / investment process .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
The political and professional debate has in recent years focused , and is likely to continue to focus , on a number of major questions : the relationship between a high level of social provision and individual incentives to work and national competitiveness ; the extent to which individual and family responsibility might be undermined by social provision ; the relative efficiency of public and private provision and of various mixes of the two ; how to divide responsibility among different levels of government ; and how to keep costs in check .  
Strengthening and improving financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes and strengthening cooperation among Governments , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises and international agencies , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to small entrepreneurs , small farmers and other low-income self-employed workers , with particular efforts to ensure the availability of such services to women .  
To that end , the co-sponsors invited individuals from specific governmental agencies and private industries to attend and , in order to receive the full benefit of the programme , the co-sponsors also requested that each participating organization or company wishing to attend the Conference should send both the chief operating officer or the equivalent and the senior technical officer .  
26 Mechanisms used for accessing the resources and expertise of FLC included sharing information , exchanging personnel , finding technical assistance , using unique federal laboratory facilities and capabilities , licensing patents and technical know-how , acquiring software , performing cooperative research and development , using cooperative research and development agreements directly with private companies and other entities , working cooperatively with NASA , forming consortia and using technology developed under government contracts .  
Developments in public administration have been influenced in recent years by fundamental changes , including technological advances , global economic interdependence , aggravation of social problems and the growing importance of the private sector .  
To assist Governments , at their request , in strengthening their capacity for policy development , administrative restructuring , civil service reform , human resources development and public administration training ; improving performance in the public sector ; increasing public / private sector interaction ; managing development programmes ; and enhancing government legal capacity ;  
Also calls upon the international community to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including ( , as mutually agreed , ) on concessional and grant terms ;  
Reaffirms the need for ensuring an effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , and major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
I should like to inform you that United States warplanes operating from bases in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are continuing to violate the airspace of the Republic of Iraq and are engaging in acts of reconnaissance , breaking the sound barrier and dropping heat flares over public and private property in the north and south of Iraq , causing damage and spreading alarm among the civilian population .  
In its decision 96 / 15 , entitled " Allocation of resources to country programmes of the United Nations Population Fund " , the Executive Board reaffirmed that , in order to achieve the goals of the International Conference on Population and Development , there was a need for adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels as well as of new and additional resources to developing countries from all sources , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources .  
As the implementation of the Habitat Agenda will require adequate funding , we must mobilize financial resources at the national and international levels , including new and additional resources from all sources - multilateral and bilateral , public and private .  In this connection , we must facilitate capacity-building and promote the transfer of appropriate technology and know-how .  
The period has seen the rise of numerous institutions - national ( governmental , academic and private ) , subregional and regional - which engage in analytical and operational activities similar to those of ECLAC .  
It adopted the Declaration 's definition of violence against women as " any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life " .  The Group agreed that economic exploitation can be a form of violence .  
The major features of the strategy are to support private sector farming activities through improved legal , regulatory and institutional frameworks , to enhance the efficiency of traditional and domestic market-oriented agriculture , to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of intensive and export-oriented agriculture and to improve access to regional and international markets .  
The Special Fund was established by the General Assembly to provide new administrative and operational machinery to spearhead the enlargement of the scope of United Nations technical assistance and , in particular , to " . . . facilitate new capital investments of all types - private and public , national and international - by creating conditions which would make such investments either feasible for more effective " ( General Assembly resolution 1219 ( XII ) on the financing of economic development , dated 14 December 1957 ) .  
However new problems have been appearing in rural areas with respect to restitution of private land ownership , transformation of agricultural cooperatives and reduced opportunities to find a city job by women coming from the province in the form of requirements for requalification and / or new professions available to provincial women , e.g . , new forms of gainful employment executable at home .  
Lastly , article 314 of the new Criminal Code imposes a penalty , in the matter of offences against the rights of workers , on persons who are guilty of serious discrimination in public or private employment against any person on the grounds of opinion , religion or belief , ethnicity , race or nationality , gender , sexual orientation , family situation , ill health , disability , avowed legal or trade union representation of workers , being related to other staff members , or use of any of the official languages of the Spanish State .  
Mainly because of the prevailing low rates of both public and private saving , lack of competitivity in international trade and some ill-adapted economic policies , African countries did not succeed in mobilizing the aggregated $ 82.5-billion that were to come from Member States to support the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development over the period from 1986 to 1991 .  
Measures to enhance socio-political stability and good governance and to secure sound macroeconomic policies that will be conducive to private foreign and domestic investment should be strongly encouraged .  
Subregional , regional and international organizations dealing with trade-related issues should stand ready to provide the required technical assistance to strengthen the efficiency of the external sectors of island developing countries , including their capacity to negotiate in international forums and with foreign partners such as private investors .  
Cooperatively structured community enterprises are an effective organizational means whereby grass-roots initiative and both public and private funds can be combined in order to revitalize disadvantaged communities without creating dependency .  
Systematic and continued involvement of all concerned parties in all stages of the work , including governmental institutions , forest owners , the private sector , local and indigenous communities , indigenous and non-indigenous forest dwellers and relevant national non-governmental organizations , will be necessary in order to help ensure overall soundness of approach , timely implementation and sustainability of efforts over time .  
Considering the current economic and financial situation worldwide , the decreasing levels of official development assistance and the concentration of private investment in countries with abundant forest resources , special attention will have to be given to the needs of the least developed countries with low forest cover .  NULLIn addressing the needs and requirements of countries with areas of low forest cover or with low forest cover overall , particularly developing countries , the Panel may wish to consider the proposals outlined below .  
Other indicators of the deepening integration of countries in transition with international capital markets are the rise in borrowing by private and partially privatized corporations and municipalities ( departing from the past practice of uniquely sovereign borrowing ) , the use of a broader range of instruments ( for example , increasing use of syndicated loans in addition to bonds ) , and further geographical and currency diversification of financial sources .  
In developing countries , however , the current flows of private investment are highly concentrated among a few countries with export potential while serious shortages of funds are experienced in countries where forestry is oriented towards domestic markets .  
This can be accomplished by educating capital markets about the investment opportunities in SFM ; by packaging and structuring these opportunities in ways that are easily understood and recognizable to private sector investors ; and by reducing risks and incremental costs specific to an emerging industry .  
It is desirable for the information systems to be Internet-based for this would allow easy access and information-sharing among multilateral agencies , countries ' institutions , non-governmental organizations and other interested parties .  The Panel may wish to invite relevant multilateral forest agencies and international organizations to review and initiate the development of improved information systems that support activities for sustainable forest management , particularly so as to facilitate private sector investment , speed up technology transfer to developing countries and improve coordination in financial assistance .  
The Panel recognized the importance of international cooperation for the management , conservation and sustainable development of forests , particularly in developing countries , in spite of the fact that it was each country 's responsibility to develop policies that would create an enabling environment for private , bilateral and multilateral investments in the forest sector .  
To take measures to promote the awareness of all parties concerned ( be they developing countries , non-governmental organizations or other public or private bodies active in this field ) , of the important role that communication plays in the development process , thus contributing to mobilizing the technical and financial resources needed for pursuing the goals and objectives of the Programme .  
In its resolution 50 / 203 , the General Assembly reaffirmed that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , would also be required . 
Mobilization of substantial new and additional resources from all sources , domestic and international , public and private , and from traditional and new sources would also be instrumental .  
New ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development , including poverty eradication , should be explored .  
Investment lending covers a considerable range of sectors ( industrial restructuring , energy and environment , roads and urban transport and the social sectors ) and aims at supporting private sector development via projects that can help remove bottlenecks , and at improving the efficiency of public sector investments .  
It adopted the Declaration 's definition of violence against women as " any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life " . d / The Group agreed that economic exploitation can be a form of violence .  
At the Social Summit , Heads of State or Government acknowledged that the primary responsibility to attain the goals set out in the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action rested with national Governments , with the support and contributions of the international community , the United Nations , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society , including private citizens .  
In its resolution 50 / 161 , the General Assembly reaffirmed the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level .  
It is patently clear - and accepted throughout the developing world - that functioning markets and private initiative are among the most efficient and powerful mechanisms to generate wealth and thus permit increased standards of living .  
Governments as enabling partners should create and strengthen effective partnerships with women , youth , the elderly , persons with disabilities , vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities , local authorities , the private sector and non-governmental organizations in each country " .  It further indicates that " national mechanisms should be established or improved , as appropriate , to coordinate actions at all relevant government levels that have an impact on human settlements and to assess this impact prior to governmental actions " .  
The 124 national reports received by the Habitat II secretariat confirm that national planning processes generally adhered to this pattern , including representatives of national ministries , public and parastatal organizations , local authorities , the scientific and academic community , professional organizations , non-governmental and community-based organizations and the private sector .  
At the same time , the possibilities of financial support from non-traditional sources of funding , which have been opened up by the new partnerships established by the Habitat secretariat with , among others , the organized private sector , private foundations and municipal and local authorities , will be actively pursued by the Centre . D . Involvement of local authorities and civil society ,  
The Government 's development efforts in the last three months have centred on encouraging passage by Parliament of two key laws related to the structural adjustment programme - civil service reform and modernization of public enterprises , maintaining the macroeconomic balance necessary to attract private investment and reactivating externally financed public investment to improve the country 's infrastructure and provide a much-needed stimulus to domestic demand .  
As indicated in Declaration No . 1 / 488 , SLORC set itself four objectives : first , the re-establishment of peace and tranquillity in the country ; second , the restoration and provision of communication and transport ; third , measures to ensure better supply of food , clothing and shelter by facilitating the operations of private enterprise and the cooperatives in these sectors ; and fourth , when the first three measures would have been accomplished , the holding of multi-party democratic elections to be held in a free and fair manner .  
The strengthening of the private sector 's role in the development process and in the creation of jobs has been accompanied by an investment promotion policy focused on a recasting of the Investment Codes into a single , better adapted and more flexible Code covering all economic sectors and the financial and fiscal reforms .  
In accordance with article 1 of the Code , these include industrial , trade and agricultural establishments and their dependencies , of whatever nature , whether public or private , religious or secular , even if they are of a professional or charitable nature ; liberal professions , craft establishments , cooperatives , civil law partnerships , unions , associations and groupings of any kind .  
While the State bears the cost of wages and supplementary social charges for no fewer than 14 days when work is suspended ( decree No . 1447 of 31 December 1987 ) , to enable public officials to celebrate a variety of religious , political and social holidays , private enterprises would find it difficult to support such charges , which place a substantial burden on production costs .  
At independence , social security coverage extended only to established civil servants and established staff of administrative public institutions , local public authorities , staff of some public enterprises and some categories of employee in the structuralized private sector ( family allowances scheme , contractual retirement plan ) .  
It spells out the functions of the public and private health facilities and establishments , which are required to provide , free of charge or in return for payment , preventive , curative , palliative , diagnostic and functional rehabilitation services with or without hospitalization .  
A large number of public and private institutions are responsible , depending on the cultural or artistic speciality in question , for ensuring academic or vocational and practical training .  
However , it is still the case that the means placed in man 's hands by science and technology , which now enable him to affect , even indirectly , the physical integrity , freedom or privacy of the individual , constitute a serious threat to human rights in any country , especially since scientific and technological progress has achieved such a degree of sophistication that individuals hardly have any truly " private " life any more and are no longer safe from genetic manipulation .  
Although it had been said that global economic growth was the result of the globalization of the economy , the international community should be fully aware that that process was limited largely to interaction among the private sectors of those countries , and that their sole objective was to make profits .  
Those programmes were beginning to bear fruit : the level of absolute poverty had been reduced while per capita income had increased ; economic growth had been sustained ; the debt service ratio had decreased in relation to exports ; and the Philippines had re-entered the private capital market in order to seek sources of external financing .  27 .  In order to promote sustainable human development to achieve real prosperity , economic growth in developing countries must reach between 5 and 9 per cent .  
The United Nations should emphasize the formulation of policies aimed at fostering a consensus on development strategy as a vital step towards the building of a new global partnership , and should develop specific programmes to assist the least developed countries - most of which had yet to benefit from increased flows of private capital - and the African countries , which were suffering from a heavy debt burden and a lack of basic infrastructure for development .  
Also reaffirms that , in order to achieve the goals of the International Conference on Population and Development , there is a need for adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels as well as of new and additional resources to developing countries from all sources , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources , and calls upon those countries in a position to do so to increase their contributions to the United Nations Population Fund ;  
In 1995-1996 , the United Nations Industrial Development Organization 's ( UNIDO ) technical cooperation programmes with the front-line States focused on , inter alia , the following : developing support strategies and formulating policies for accelerated industrial development ; providing support for developing existing industries and industrial infrastructures ; private sector development with emphasis on strengthening private sector institutions ; small and medium enterprises development ; and industrial information investment and technology promotion .  
Concerning the use of national human resources , he said that the national staff of UNDP were among its most valuable resources ; in many of the field offices , the only international staff members were the resident representatives and their deputies , while all the others were nationals , who were generally experienced in the work of UNDP programmes and projects , familiar with the culture and language , and frequently had worked for the Government , the private sector , non-governmental organizations and the mass media . 
Such education was available at all school levels , starting with municipal and private kindergartens and including both public and private schools maintained by the national minority , which received the same financial support from the State as public schools .  
Commit ourselves to working towards the greater use of solar energy through the provision of adequate technical assistance and funding , the full utilization of existing international funds , and the facilitation of increased participation by both public and private sectors .  
Tied to this factor , the modern domestic private sector is still embryonic and indigenous entrepreneurial capacity is scarce , lacking capital and managerial expertise and experience .  
Mr . CHUNG ( Republic of Korea ) said that industrialization played a vital role as a catalyst for economic and social progress and that international cooperation had a role to play in industrial development , although the process increasingly was being driven by the laws of the market and by the private sector .  
In the least developed countries and in a number of African countries where the private sector was weak , the public sector should play an active role in establishing the basic essential infrastructure , and international cooperation should focus on countries and sectors where the lack of such infrastructure was most acute .  
UNIDO played an active role in the implementation of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer , was an authority on environmentally sound industrial development and promoted direct contacts between government officials and representatives of the private sector on a global level .  
It is heartening to note that , avoiding a pitfall encountered in the past , African countries and their development partners successfully concluded their discussion and analysis of the performance of all the parties involved , even in such controversial areas as political and economic reform , promotion of the private sector , human development , regional and subregional cooperation and integration , resource flows , external debt , trade , economic diversification and capacity-building .  
It is also important to set the ways and means to achieve this by utilizing not only official development assistance but also private investment , trade , social infrastructure building , human capacity development , and all other elements which are essential to achieving those targets , as well as by devising an ideal policy mix to suit the concrete socio-economic conditions of the countries involved .  
" Recognizing the need to promote social responsibility and appropriate standards of ethics on the part of private and public corporations and individuals engaged in international commercial transactions , inter alia , through observance of the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business , and taking into account the impact of their activities on economic and social development and environmental protection ,

To denying , in countries that do not already do so and in accordance with the fundamental principles of their legal systems , the tax deductibility of bribes paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a Member State to any public official or elected representative of another country ;  
This biased attitude of the republic of Croatia is evident also in the report of Ms . Elizabeth Rehn of 14 March 1996 , which contains ( on pp . 62-86 ) numerous examples of human rights violations , killings , and mistreatment of the civilian population , destruction of private property , prevention of the return of refugees and so on effected by wilful extremists whose behaviour escapes control .  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation and follow-up of the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas ;  
Given the many areas where there is a mutual interest in government-private sector cooperation , including , for example , skills , technological and infrastructure development , environmental protection and the promotion of inter-firm backward and forward linkages , the ability of the Government and the private sector to build up a confident and effective working relationship with each other assumes a particular importance .  
However , experiences from the industrialized countries have shown that investment alone does not pay off in terms of productivity gains if not accompanied by complementary policies creating an enabling environment , as well as an adequate level of cooperation between public and private R &amp; amp ; D .

While underlining that the law was applied without religious discrimination and with respect for the rights of non-Muslims , Mr . Turabi explained that consumption of alcohol was not a crime in the southern states , while in the north it was authorized for non-Muslims in private and forbidden in public .  
The IOM budget is composed of an administrative part , funded by assessed contributions from all member States according to an agreed percentage scale and an operational part funded wholly by voluntary contributions from Governments and multilateral and private sources .  
The Heads of State again emphasize the special importance of developing and extracting the rich natural resources of their countries , in the first instance natural gas , petroleum and hydro-energy resources , and called for urgent measures to conduct joint projects for laying pipelines and electricity transmission lines to deliver energy to world markets , with the involvement in these projects of the States concerned , international financial institutions and State and private structures .  
Notes that while sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country to promote macroeconomic stability are essential elements for determining the volume and structure of private capital flows , international macroeconomic policies play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness , and should contribute to creating a favourable international economic environment ;  
" Recognizing the need to promote social responsibility and appropriate standards of ethics on the part of private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals engaged in international commercial transactions , inter alia , through observance of the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business , and taking into account the impact of their activities on economic and social development and environmental protection ,

After touching briefly on the issue of economic growth and some of the reasons for the continued slow growth of the world economy , he said that it was increasingly being recognized that private capital flows were not a viable long-term solution .  
Concerned about continuing deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers involved in Operation Lifeline Sudan and international private voluntary agencies ,  
Their major expected results are : the establishment of legal and institutional frameworks , of commercially viable reforms and instruments to foster efficient trade and transport operations ( with direct and active participation of concerned public and private agencies and operative Trade Points , and through National Trade and Transport Facilitation Committees representing all functional interests ) ; and the establishment of adequate training programmes .  
In developing countries the current flows of private investment are highly concentrated on a few countries with export potential , while serious shortages of funds are experienced in countries where forestry is oriented towards domestic markets .  
While Government and other stakeholders have been dedicating resources to the development of new financial instruments to address sustainable forestry , the huge shifts in global capital markets over the last five years suggest that the main issue for capturing private sector funding for forest management is not developing new financial instruments , but linking existing investment flows more directly to sustainability and with sustainable forest management in particular . 
In order to address these concerns and to reach the goal of economically efficient , socially balanced and ecologically sound sustainable forest management , the experts call upon the Governments , private sector and investment community , multilateral international organizations , non-governmental organizations and the voluntary sector to recognize their shared responsibility and to take urgent action as follows :  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation and follow-up of the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas , and in that process to emphasize the need to integrate the gender perspective ;  
Requests the Commission on Human Settlements to review at its sixteenth session , its working methods in order to involve in its work the representatives of local authorities or international associations of local authorities , as appropriate , and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector and non-governmental organizations , in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , taking into account the rules of procedure of the Commission on Human Settlements and the relevant provisions of Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 31 ;  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions , and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
These included macroeconomic stability , high rates of domestic saving , maintenance of sound financial intermediaries , high priority given to human resource development ( especially to high _ quality primary and secondary education ) , competitive exchange rates , export orientation , a supportive environment which rewarded entrepreneurship and allowed open and constructive dialogue between government and the private sector regarding objectives and policies , and governance which balanced the promotion of social cohesion and consensus with that of competition between individuals and companies .  
In his view , the role of Governments was to create a stable macroeconomic and political environment , to put in place a competent and effective administration , and to create a juridical framework that favoured private investment and guaranteed the maximum development of human resources .  
Consequent to the low tariff rates , imports had increased while economic development and exports had been circumscribed by , in addition to other causes , exogenous factors including the restrictive policy of other countries coupled with the sluggish and diminished flow of both private and official funds .  
The Court of Appeal further stressed that the contract had been concluded between a seller with its place of business in France and a buyer resident in Portugal , that France was a State Party to CISG whereas Portugal had neither signed nor ratified it , and that it was therefore necessary to ascertain whether CISG was applicable through the provisions of private international law ( art . 1 ( 1 ) ( b ) ) .  
Concerned about continuing deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers involved in Operation Lifeline Sudan and international private voluntary agencies ,  
The representatives of the broadcasters - both private and public - who attended the event discussed at length the increasing impact television has on decision-making by alerting world attention to international conflicts and threats to peace and security and its potential role in sharpening the focus on other major issues , including economic , social and cultural issues , and in promoting understanding among peoples .  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation and follow-up of the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas ;  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation and follow-up of the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas , and in that process to emphasize the need to integrate the gender perspective ;  
Requests the Commission on Human Settlements to review at its sixteenth session , its working methods in order to involve in its work the representatives of local authorities or international associations of local authorities , as appropriate , and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector and non-governmental organizations , in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , taking into account the rules of procedure of the Commission on Human Settlements and the relevant provisions of Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 31 of 25 July 1996 ;  
Nevertheless , the legal institution of reservations may well have to be reassessed in the light of the particular nature of human rights treaties ; this results from their specific object , which is to provide maximum protection for individuals victimized not only by their own Governments but also at the hands of private parties , from their recognition in international and regional jurisprudence as establishing non-reciprocal and objective obligations , and from the existence of treaty monitoring bodies .  
Recognizing the need to promote social responsibility and appropriate standards of ethics on the part of private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals engaged in international commercial transactions , inter alia , through observance of the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business , and taking into account the impact of their activities on economic and social development and environmental protection ,  
To take effective and concrete action to combat all forms of corruption , bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions , in particular to pursue effective enforcement of existing laws prohibiting bribery in international commercial transactions , to encourage the adoption of laws for those purposes where they do not exist , and to call upon private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals within their jurisdiction engaged in international commercial transactions to promote the objectives of this Declaration ;  
The offer , promise or giving of any payment , gift or other advantage , directly or indirectly , by any private or public corporation , including a transnational corporation , or individual from a State to any public official or elected representative of another country as undue consideration for performing or refraining from the performance of that official 's or representative 's duties in connection with an international commercial transaction ;  
The soliciting , demanding , accepting or receiving , directly or indirectly , by any public official or elected representative of a State from any private or public corporation , including a transnational corporation , or individual from another country of any payment , gift or other advantage , as undue consideration for performing or refraining from the performance of that official 's or representative 's duties in connection with an international commercial transaction ;  
To deny , in countries that do not already do so , the tax deductibility of bribes paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a State to any public official or elected representative of another country , and to that end , to examine their respective modalities for doing so ;  
Notes that while sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country to promote macroeconomic stability are essential elements for determining the volume and structure of private capital flows , international macroeconomic policies play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness , and should contribute to creating a favourable international economic environment ;  
During that event , more than 140 leading media figures from around the globe , representing more than 50 countries , had discussed the growing significance of television in the changing contemporary world , the opportunities offered by the current technological revolution in communications , which vastly increased the possibilities of cultural exchange , the role of both private and public broadcasters in providing information on global events and the strengthening of the partnership between the United Nations system and the international media .  
During the Forum , broadcasters from both the public and private sectors had supported the idea of establishing an annual World Television Day , to be celebrated each 21 November by global exchanges of television programmes focusing in particular on such issues as peace and security , economic and social development and the enhancement of cultural exchanges .  
Encouraged national authorities to consider the need to enhance capacities in all relevant sectors , including [ public , private ] [ the public and private sectors , indigenous peoples , local communities ] and non-governmental sectors , [ effectively and in a coordinated manner , ] taking into account the role played by each of the interested parties in the [ sustainable development ] [ management , conservation and sustainable development of all types ] of forests , in order to achieve country-led design and implementation of NFPs .  
The Panel recommended that indigenous people , forest owners , forest dwellers and local communities should be enabled to play a [ key ] role in [ defining ] participatory [ approaches to forest and land-use management ] [ approaches to sustainable forest management and land-use planning ] [ with the involvement of ] [ together with ] all interested relevant parties from both public and private sectors , and with greater focus on resource management , land-use systems and conflict resolution . 
The Panel recognized that there is a need to promote new and innovative forms of finance and [ combine ] [ complement ] [ facilitate ] all forms of finance , at the public , private , international , domestic and local levels and to combine them with existing ones , as well as to ensure the predictability and continuity of flow of financial resources .  
Invited [ [ UNDP and the World Bank to take the lead ] [ the Bretton Woods institutions ] , together with other ] relevant international organizations , to further explore [ innovative ways to use existing financial mechanisms more effectively and ] [ possibilities ] to generate additional forest-specific public and private financial resources at [ the domestic as well as at ] the international level .  
BAKER ( Israel ) shared the view expressed by the Commission as to the difficulty of distinguishing between codification and progressive development of international law , especially in an era in which the development of international law took place in specialized spheres through the activities of various institutions , the regionalization of the handling of specific issues and an increase in law-making bodies , whether private or official , formal or informal .  
The special session of the General Assembly for the purpose of an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 would have a major impact on environmental conservation and preservation and required the support of both the developed and the developing countries , the United Nations system and civil society , especially non-governmental organizations and the private sector . 
Topics that should be included in the discussions of the special session of the General Assembly included : international cooperation in the area of finance and technology ; consideration of the crucial role of the private sector with a view to proposing initiatives for stimulating private investment in sustainable development projects ; relationship between production and energy consumption and the interaction between energy and atmosphere ; international discussions on forests ; the challenge of urbanization ; and the strengthened role of the Commission on Sustainable Development as a political forum .  
Stresses the need for all countries to develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
Endorses Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 48 of 26 July 1996 on new and innovative ideas for generating funds , in which , inter alia , the Council decided that funds generated by new and innovative ideas should not substitute for official development assistance , that they should be distinct from funding the regular budget and the peacekeeping budget of the United Nations , and should be part of global partnership and interdependence and that the role of private investment in financing development should be stressed ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 5 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
In its deliberations , the Commission noted the interest that BOT and other forms of private participation in public infrastructure projects had raised in many States , in particular in developing countries , as the successful implementation of such projects would enable States to achieve significant savings in public expenditure and to re-allocate resources that otherwise would have been invested in infrastructure in order to meet more pressing social needs .  
These actors include international and regional intergovernmental organizations ; individual States ; parliamentarians ; non-governmental organizations from the local to the global levels ; and private actors such as legal professionals , the media , academics , private institutions and civic associations , including ethnic , cultural and religious groups .  
This will not only require a society of States committed to democratic principles and processes ; it will also demand an enlarged international civil society deeply involved in democratic institutions , whether State , inter-State or supra-State , private or quasi-private ; committed to democratic practices , procedures and political pluralism ; and composed of peoples ingrained with those habits of openness , fairness and tolerance that have been associated with democracy since ancient times . 
Moreover , " international relations " - not relations among nations but relations among sovereign States - are increasingly shaped not only by the States themselves but also by an expanding array of non-State actors on the " international " scene , ranging all the way from individual persons to civic associations , non-governmental organizations , local authorities , private multinational business , academia , the media , parliamentarians and regional and international intergovernmental organizations .  
A development agent and a positive factor for social integration within and among States , the private business sector - especially transnational business - must be recognized as an integral player in international organization and more closely involved in international decision-making .  
The same can be said of the pioneering efforts under way towards linking international organizations , both governmental and non-governmental , with national and private multinational banks in order to provide the funds and services which small and medium-sized entrepreneurs in transitional and developing countries require for sustainable development activities .  
Among the issues that remain to be solved are the privatization of parts of the public rental housing stock , meeting the cost of renovation of private homes in mixed-ownership buildings , the future role of private rental housing , strengthening of market-type financial institutions in the housing sector and the introduction of legal and financial elements of real estate renting .  
To address the situation , the Government is planning a number of measures , which include a review of the distribution of responsibilities in housing affairs in the public sector ; limiting public agencies ' construction activities to essential needs ; developing a viable approach to improving the housing conditions of low income citizens ; and mobilizing private capital into housing . 
The Government 's overall objectives for housing have been set out in a White Paper entitled " Our Future Homes " ( 1995 ) and these include increasing the number of owner-occupied homes , reducing significantly the population of homes lying vacant and transforming the remaining large-scale , poor quality public estates through public and private sector partnership . 
The White Paper also sets out the role of the central Government in providing the right conditions for public and private investment through management of the overall economy and local authorities will be encouraged to take a strategic enabling approach in respect of all housing tenures and a reduced role as landlords .  
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
The State has the overall responsibility in various areas , including , inter alia , social , economic and environmental policy formulation , and for creating an enabling environment for the private sector ; the State should encourage effective participation by the private sector and major groups in activities which complement and reinforce national objectives .  
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development will be undertaken .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods , the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework . 
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to this Agenda .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
To transform the Gambia into a financial centre , a tourist paradise , a trading export-oriented agricultural and manufacturing nation , thriving on free market policies and a vibrant private sector , sustained by a well-educated , trained , skilled , healthy , self-reliant and enterprising population , and guaranteeing a well-balanced ecosystem and a decent standard of living for one and all , under a system of government based on the consent of the citizenry .  
Governance is effective only where three key elements the State , the private sector and civil society function in partnership in creating the political , economic and social conditions which are conducive to ensuring sustainable human development .  
It highlights the dynamics of the market system and the effective coordination among basic economic actors in the framework of the system , with the State as the guiding and organizing power , the private sector as the prime catalyst of the capital market and the civil sector as the receiving body which is passively or positively influenced by the programmes .  
This is not to mention bolstering the role of institutions and charitable organizations , notably the Zayed charitable organization and the Red Crescent , as well as other organizations , aimed at helping them achieve their humanitarian objectives for the purpose of mobilizing local efforts in the public and private sectors , and meeting appeals to meet human needs and emergency demands in parts of the world that have been affected or are impoverished .  
In another context , and at the level of the private sector , Egyptian businessmen have not held back initiating a number of economic projects with their Palestinian counterparts designed to enhance the efficiency of the Palestinian economy and save it from the consequences of the destructive closures imposed on it at random by Israel .  
Central importance should be assigned to employment in the formulation and implementation of economic and social policies , with the understanding that the public sector , private sector , cooperatives and civil society have a shared interest in and responsibility for employment , and that the achievement of full employment should be a permanent goal for all of them .  
The Commission calls upon Governments and the international community to seek to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and to use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including on concessional and grant terms .  
UNHCR notes that involvement of local rather than international non-governmental organizations is likely to provide a closer link with the private sector at the country level and with institutions of civil society , such as voluntary agencies , human rights groups , cultural and academic associations , churches and other religious bodies , and refugee community groups .  
With regard to measures adopted for ethnic minorities and other social groups , these are designed , inter alia , to guarantee to indigenous and tribal peoples and to ethnic minorities especially favourable treatment as regards access to educational facilities and employment in the public or private sector .  
Under international humanitarian law applicable in international armed conflicts , in particular article 123 of the Third and article 140 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 , this Geneva-based organization is the principal agency authorized to collect all the information it can obtain through official or private channels concerning prisoners of war and protected civilians .  
States should enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , that will ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
About one quarter of the Governments , including 33 per cent of the developed and 21 per cent of the developing countries , have produced national directories of public and private organizations concerned with ageing and / or services and opportunities for the aged . 
Until waste management authorities overcome these institutional shortcomings and develop a more flexible management structure , responsive to the needs of public , private and community sectors , isolated schemes will remain good examples of " best practice demonstrations " and will not be incorporated into the overall waste management system .  
Among the challenges faced by Turkey in achieving women 's equality , the representative identified the disparities in status and opportunities for urban middle-class and rural women ; violence against women in the private domain ; a strengthening of the contribution of the media to the advancement of women , including through an increase in the number of female professionals in this area ; and the revision of educational materials , which continued to portray women in their traditional roles as mothers and wives .  
Bridging the data gap will require a strategy of more widespread participation in data collection and assessment , bringing together Governments , scientists , non-governmental organizations , the private sector ( including industry ) , local authorities , and even the general public in coherent efforts to document key issues and trends as a basis for management decisions at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
Law 70 / 95 has a wide and generalized range of application , since it is applicable , with no distinction , to any computerized filing system or data bank , both private and public , owned by either a physical or legal person ( art .  1 ) .  
Anyone who without just cause reveals the contents of the documents mentioned in the preceding article ( whether public or private ) , which have been brought to his knowledge by the means defined therein or by other unlawful means , shall be punished by a term of three months ' ordinary imprisonment to three years ' rigorous imprisonment .  
The World Bank has estimated that electric power delivered to end-users equals only about 40 per cent of installed capacity in developing countries , compared to over 80 per cent of installed capacity in developed countries . 19 Establishing the principle of full ( or nearly full ) cost-recovery would permit much greater recourse to foreign financing as bond financing for either public or private national enterprises operating on fully commercial principles within an adequate regulatory environment . 
According to ICC , the private sector 's priorities for the next phase include increasing use of multilateral arrangements to resolve transboundary environmental issues ( instead of unilateral approaches ) ; incentive-based approaches , such as joint implementation ; greater involvement of business and industry in multilateral agreements and organizations through innovative consultative mechanisms ; and a more prominent role for international environmental technical and management standards and voluntary codes , as complements to regulatory frameworks .  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas , and in that process to emphasize the need to integrate the gender perspective ;  
Replace the existing text with the following : 3 .  To re-examining , with a view to denying it in countries which do not already do so , the tax deductibility of bribes , paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a member State to any public official of another country , in accordance with the basic principles of its legal order ;  
In this connection , the Parsi minority is one of the most active and prosperous in India , both in the economic field as well as in terms of private school establishments , and also one of those that attaches the greatest importance to maintaining itself as a specific and distinct ethnic and religious community .  
Theft of and illicit trafficking in motor vehicles had become another activity of organized crime that employed methods such as corruption of public officials and bribery in the private sector , thereby undermining both democratic and economic institutions .  
However , the ever-growing demand on the United Nations human rights programme to engage in such areas as confidence _ building measures , technical cooperation , education , monitoring , etc . makes it indispensable to establish an adequate and reliable mix of regular budget resources and voluntary contributions from Governments and private entities .  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
Stresses the need for all countries to develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
Endorses Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 48 of 26 July 1996 on new and innovative ideas for generating funds , in which , inter alia , the Council decided that funds generated by new and innovative ideas should not substitute for official development assistance , that they should be distinct from funding the regular budget and the peacekeeping budget of the United Nations , and should be part of global partnership and interdependence and that the role of private investment in financing development should be stressed ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 5 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
This programme is designed to enhance effective and efficient management capacities for the public and private sectors in the context of a market economy and a democratic society ; and initiate a programme of support to the Palestinian Authority in the area of governance and public administration with the overall aim of strengthening and improving its institutional capacity .  
They include : a Swedish firm with a successful record of restructuring private companies , which helped in the design and start-up of the overall change process , and whose former chief executive officer continues to advise UNDP 2001 ; a Canadian expert on change management ; an American expert on public sector change ; and a leading information technology management group from the United States .  
Concerned about continuing deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers involved in Operation Lifeline Sudan and with international private voluntary agencies ,  
The new technologies may be destroying more jobs than they create ; there is a great risk that they will in fact widen the gap between rich and poor ; and the huge capital investments required to strengthen national capabilities to produce and use ICTs may divert both public and private resources from other activities which could have greater development impact .  
Another proposal was that a definition should be based on the elements of a certificate contained in the note by the Secretariat , which referred to the certificate as being an electronic record that listed a public key together with the name of the certificate subscriber as the subject of the certificate , and confirmed that the prospective signer identified in the certificate held the corresponding private key ( A / CN . 9 / WG.IV / WP . 71 , para .  36 ) .  
It was generally felt that it would be of little avail for the purpose of protecting the end-users to require the certification authority to follow adequate procedures for establishing the accuracy of the information , or properly identifying the holders of private keys , and at the same time to allow the certification authority to avoid liability by issuing certificates that fell below the minimum level of information required to be contained in a certificate .  
Despite the concomitant increase in private capital flows , which have been concentrated in a relatively few countries , ODA remains an essential element for sustainable development , especially in least developed and other vulnerable countries , and the commitments for new and additional resources should therefore be met .  
That new capital is envisaged to come from a redirection of private capital from mature markets to markets with new absorptive capacity created for sustainable development ; from the removal of existing subsidies ; from domestic savings ; from debt-relief ; and from public monies , including increased ODA . Efforts should be made to provide the necessary flexibility to allow those reallocations to take place naturally in response to incentives . 
While some requested an improvement in quality in public rather than private schools , maintaining free public education at the primary level , others favoured a more liberal policy environment with competition between the private and public sector .  
It reiterated the need for external support through ODA and the provision of new and additional financial resources , and emphasized the need to mobilize new , innovative and additional forms of finance at the public , private , international , domestic and local levels .  
Altogether , the new directions report contains 20 major recommendations that touch on other issues such as the formulation of national TCDC policies , the strengthening of national TCDC focal points , the reorientation of capacity and needs matching exercises , the promotion of " triangular cooperation " , the establishment of improved linkages with the private sector and non-governmental organizations , and the identification of new funding arrangements for TCDC , including the formulation of subject-specific TCDC " products " that could attract special funding on the basis of their intrinsic importance .  
Commenting on the secretariat report ( TD / B / COM . 1 / 2 ) , he was of the view that it did not analyse sufficiently the existing global economic environment which , in many respects , was inimical to development , given persistent debt burdens , declining ODA , uneven private investment flows , and overly cautious deflationary policies of developed countries .  
Early implementation of key public investments would result not only in increased aggregate demand , employment and incomes , but in a recovery of private investment - an essential factor for a more sustained , self-reliant economic growth and significantly improved security .  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development _ oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and highly _ indebted countries ,  
In addition , these factors illustrate the need to exploit the potentially mutually supportive role of the public and private sectors and the importance of the current work under GATS on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications .  12 .  Trade in the health service sector also demonstrates the extremely vulnerable position of poorer , especially least developed countries , which on the one hand suffer from a " brain drain " and on the other do not have access to advanced technologies .  
Multilateral and bilateral donors , Governments and the private sector should increase support to non-governmental organizations , particularly to women 's organizations , in playing an active role in advocacy for the implementation of Agenda 21 at the international and national levels , particularly in supporting national policies and programmes for sustainable development in the developing countries .  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti _ discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Their economic and social achievements have raised their international credit standing to such a degree that it induces very substantial private investment and financial flows .  
Also , more effective use will be made of policy seminars , conferences and training workshops addressed to specific development issues , bringing together senior national policy makers and representatives of civil society and the private sector and facilitating a shared understanding of the development challenges that African countries face and the policy options that are available .  
The entities within the United Nations system have an important role to play in developing a reference framework for the energy-related activities of the United Nations system based on a common understanding of a sustainable energy future , and thereby providing synergies to the activities . 3 Such a framework would promote a balanced and mutually reinforcing approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of sustainable energy development and foster partnerships for sustainable energy development with relevant actors outside the United Nations system , particularly with non-United Nations intergovernmental organizations dealing with energy and the private sector . 
Serve as a mobilizer of ideas and a catalyst for action to identify and promote new policy options at the national , subregional and regional levels for the removal of constraints on the economic and social development efforts of these countries , with emphasis on the adoption of measures for increased mobilization of domestic and foreign resources , trade and private sector development , public sector reform , and provision of economic advice , on request , to Governments with limited internal capacity .  
While the international law of human rights is , indeed , addressed to the behaviour of States and deals with acts or omissions of government officials 18 / or their agents , modern developments of international humanitarian law , 19 / recent authoritative pronouncements such as indicated in the introductory section of this working paper , 20 / and a respectable body of theory 21 / tend to embrace elements leading to some modification of the traditional position that private individuals or groups are not capable of violating human rights .  
All these elements should , in fact , be sought out and thoroughly explored in order to assess objectively whether ( and , eventually , to what extent ) international human rights law is moving beyond the traditional dichotomy of individual versus State , beyond the duty of States to respect and ensure the observance of human rights , and towards the creation of obligations applicable also to private individuals and other non _ State actors , including liberation movements and terrorist organizations .  
In any event , the conditions under which social services are provided must be determined by the State and reflect the rights of citizens , not simply be the result of a private contractual relation between individuals and private firms .  30 .  The State must reclaim the central role in the formulation of public policies , which it sometimes has lost to the private sector and international financial institutions .  
The European Union proposed that the objective would be to focus on strengthening partnership for development and finding new balances in development cooperation ( for instance between multilateral and bilateral cooperation ; between the role of Governments , private sector and civil society ; between capacity building and other forms of cooperation ) by analysing and drawing lessons from changes in the international and national contexts which are relevant for development cooperation .  
The planning and implementation of national reconstruction and development have continued during the period under review in accordance with the national objectives and following the strategic options taken by the Government a few years ago : development of basic infrastructure and public services infrastructure ; creation and strengthening of legal frameworks , in particular for private sector development ; and rehabilitation and development of institutional frameworks .  
The follow _ up process has engaged the national authorities at the highest level through a number of initiatives towards friendly countries and international institutions as well as the private sector ; these have involved traditional western and Arab donors , but also countries such as Brazil , the Republic of Korea , Malaysia , and Eastern European countries . 
The need for such volunteer effort is greater today than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse or HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of society , given the concern of the international community for the eradication of poverty and given the contemporary trend for civil society , in partnership with Governments and the private sector , to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process .  
Convinced that the need for volunteer effort is greater than ever , in light of the adverse impact of such global problems as environmental degradation , poverty , drug abuse and HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of societies , and of the trend for civil society , in partnership with government and the private sector , to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process ,  
The vulnerability of the Palestinian economy to the interaction of such factors has been compounded by a range of inherent weaknesses coupled with the absence of an adequate regulatory and institutional framework at the public and private sector levels .  
Some progress has been made by the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) since 1995 with regard to drafting essential legal instruments governing economic activity in areas such as private investment , enterprise activity , banking , public finance , industrial zones , standards and safety , civil service and intellectual property .  
These include weak domestic employment capacity , uneven sectoral growth , weak intersectoral articulation , severe marketing bottlenecks , poorly coordinated and fragmented new investments in both public and private ventures and structural imbalances among macroeconomic aggregates .  
The study deals with : a review of major recent developments affecting private investment , including the regulatory framework , policy environment , trade and financial regimes and their recent performance ; an examination of the main supportive capacities and services important for private investment ; analysis of the scale , composition and impact of private investment in the economy ; and , prospects and policy options relevant to the future direction and magnitude of private investment in the Palestinian territory .  
These include the existence of a properly functioning banking system with the ability to mobilize an adequate level of domestic savings ; a legal system that protects private property ; the existence of company laws that allow multiple ownership as a precondition for share ownership by the public ; and the freedom of foreign investors to own domestic assets in clearly specified sectors of the economy .  
The idea was also raised that building up a domestic institutional investor base could help provide additional local private demand for marketable securities .  
As they moved along the path of reform , their objectives became more complex and ambitious , shifting from the limited concerns of macroeconomic imbalances and stabilization to the promotion of development by a plethora of market-oriented reforms , including the improvement of economic efficiency , curbing of public sector intervention , encouragement of the private sector and liberalization of the external trade sector .  
For example , consider the launching of programmes by Governments , United Nations agencies and other international organizations , and major groups , on which consensus was developed by IPF ; consider appropriate mechanisms for the mobilization of institutional , human and financial resources and capacity-building ; and encourage the development of voluntary codes of conduct for the private sector ;  
Consider the feasibility of establishing an international fund to support activities for sustainable forest management ; and explore innovative ways both to use existing financial mechanisms more effectively and to generate new and additional public and private financial resources ;  
Whenever health supplies received under resolution 986 ( 1995 ) are sold through private sector pharmacies , equitable distribution requires uniform and transparent pricing that is not excessive in comparison with fees levied in public pharmacies , valid medical prescription and guarantees that the use of private sector pharmacies does not unduly disadvantage those who can not afford to purchase the drugs they require .  
The Expert Meeting welcomed the initiative of the UNCTAD secretariat in arranging for the participation of a substantial number of actors from the business community in its deliberations , and encouraged UNCTAD to continue to involve private sector representatives in its future dialogues and to facilitate contacts and promote interaction among business people .  1 .  The Expert Meeting observed that the growth of international food trade had been high , at almost 7 per cent a year during the previous 10 years , not much lower than that of trade in manufactured goods .  
About 30 needs assessment / diagnostic missions , on request , on programme design and project formulation on governance ; civil service reform ; human resource management and development ; information technology for public management ; local governance ; decentralization ; post-conflict rehabilitation ; budgeting and budgetary systems ; mobilization of internal and external resources ; financial management capacities ; tax reforms and tax administration ; the role of the State and private sector in development ; and the peace-development link ; ( ii ) Seminars and workshops . 
To establish conditions that help the private sector to be competitive in the emerging global economy , the Governments of new or restored democracies should provide a predictable legal framework , control of corruption , high quality public service and a supportive environment .  
Attention is drawn to the definition of violence against women contained in article 1 of the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women ( General Assembly resolution 48 / 104 ) : [ A ] ny act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm and suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life .  
One State19 reported that legislative amendments had been made to allow for proper control over foreign entertainers , while another20 noted that women migrant workers in the private sector were provided with the same rights as male migrant workers , as well as additional benefits , such as maternity leave and child protection .  
Encourages relevant United Nations funds and programmes and specialized agencies , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to support local , national and international programmes and projects for the Year and also encourages them , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , as well as international financial institutions , to ensure that the concerns and contributions of older persons are integrated into their development programmes ;  
There has been a sizeable expansion of private flows of financial resources from developed to a limited number of developing countries and , in a number of countries , efforts have been made in support of domestic resource mobilization , including the increasing use of economic instruments to promote sustainable development .  
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , official development assistance remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
The creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
The effort of the international community should be aimed at encouraging the emergence of pluralist political forces supported by a civil society that is aware of its basic rights and on a private sector that is both dynamic and entrepreneurial .  
At the national level , there are three major types of private actors involved in capital market operations : security exchanges ( the parallel and the over-the-counter markets ) ; domestic custody , settlement and clearing institutions ; and listed companies and brokers .  
As indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on sources for the financing of development ( see A / 52 / 399 ) , there has been a shift in the composition of financial flows to developing countries from public to private sector sources , with the latter now accounting for an overwhelming share of the total ( albeit not for all individual countries ) .  This situation is unlikely to be reversed in the foreseeable future .  
In addition to the services provided at the primary level , UNRWA aims , in principle , at providing essential in-patient medical services to the refugee population at its own facilities , at local contracted hospitals or through partial reimbursement of costs incurred by refugees for treatment at government or private hospitals .  
The Special Representative notes that in the past , senior officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran have attempted to distinguish between the act of private worship , which is permitted , and more public acts such as teaching , forming assemblies and working with the administration of the Baha'i community , which were forbidden on the grounds that those were hostile and conspiratorial acts that were criminal in nature .  
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies in each country for promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
The State has the overall responsibility in various areas , including social , economic and environmental policy formulation , and for creating an enabling environment for the private sector ; the State should encourage effective participation by the private sector and major groups in activities that complement and reinforce national objectives .  
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , will be undertaken so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods and the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework . 
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to the Agenda .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
At that time , the restructuring process was fully under way in both the private and public sectors , with the addition of new technologies and production , distribution and marketing processes , a significant increase in productivity resulting from the stability and with a change in the previous economy 's suffocating rules of the game , such as the cheapening of capital goods and the disappearance of inflation as an instantaneous means of relaxing labour costs .  
Within the context of increased financial flows to developing countries and the continuing surge in foreign direct investment , equity and bonds , he noted with optimism the rapid turnaround in private sector financial flows to Mexico and Argentina after the crisis of 1995 and the modest private sector flows to Africa .  
Development called for the private sector to act as the engine of sustained economic growth , in partnership with the public sector , which played a crucial role in basic infrastructure and services and in establishing and maintaining sound macroeconomic policies , protecting human rights and the environment and creating a conducive legal environment for private investment and entrepreneurship .  
The role of private capital should be considered in a comprehensive and objective manner , bearing in mind that while it represented a positive aspect at the global level , many developing countries , especially African and least developed countries , had failed to benefit sufficiently from it .  
In order for developing countries to be able to attract private capital flows , they must maintain good governance , sound macroeconomic policies and close , cooperative working relations with international financial organizations .  
The articles in the four publications covered a wide spectrum of issues , including the critical role of the informal sector in the development of indigenous industrial capabilities ; the development of international competitiveness ; the private sector and entrepreneurship development ; privatization in Africa ; the Uruguay Round Agreements and implications for African industry ; and the current status of African metallurgy industries and prospects for the year 2000 .  
Further , implementation strategies advocated were not adopted at the country level , the nascent African private sector was not fully prepared to assume the new responsibilities in the industrial investment process and financial support , including term lending , from both domestic and foreign sources was not readily available for industrial projects .  
The speaker said that significant changes would be required in order to increase the flow of FDI to a meaningful size in areas such as governance , development of an enabling policy environment and sustained policy reforms , and an improved partnership between the public and private sectors .  
The results had been reduced government expenditure , improved economic administration , a stabilized Yemeni rial , promotion of private sector activities , enactment of transparent investment and trade policies , agricultural privatization , giving priority to technical education and starting the implementation of a social security system .  
While there was no simple solution to pursuing development goals in an increasingly competitive and globalized world and even though economic growth was not automatic , notable strides had been made by those who embraced credible macro-economic settings ; those who addressed the social dimension of development in tandem with the pursuit of economic growth ; those who fostered domestic private sector development ; and those who pursued representative , open and accountable governance .  
The needs of the audiovisual library may be included in the annual circular note of the Secretary-General requesting financial assistance for different components of the Programme as one of the items for which States , their institutions or private individuals may wish to make voluntary contributions in monetary terms or in kind ( tapes , equipment , etc . ) .  
There might , however , be specific situations in which the adoption of a separate competition policy would be accorded a lower priority : in some economies , particularly small economies , competition from imports and from foreign firms might be sufficient to minimize the possibilities for restrictive business practices by private firms , while in other economies , lack of resources and human resources for effective implementation of competition law might limit the ability to adopt a competition policy , at least in the immediate future .  
A regional network and national networks of institutions concerned with decentralization will be created in at least 12 countries ; an open information system in the Internet connected to a UNDP global Management Development and Governance Division programme called MAGNET will support the networks and will provide access to a wide range of actors ( local governments , NGOs and private sector organizations ) .  
The objective in this thematic area is to provide Arab societies with additional capacity for pro-poor strategy , policy and programme development and implementation by increasing their ability to effectively formulate pro-poor policies and programmes and enhancing the performance of institutions ( public , private , civil society ) that deal with services for social development and especially for poverty eradication .  
The objective of programming in this area is to increase understanding of the socio-economic determinants of the HIV epidemic at a policy level , among Governments , and in the private sector and civil society , resulting in policies and programmes to promote an improved and effective response to the epidemic .  
He underscored the importance of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries and said that additional resources were needed in support of such cooperation from the United Nations system , international financial institutions and other public and private sources .  
Although the commercial private sector and non-profit civil society provided a volume of investment and development activities which dwarfed the financial flows channelled through the United Nations , the vast majority of speakers in the plenary meetings of the General Assembly as well as in the Second Committee had reinforced the central role of the United Nations in development cooperation .  
Joint ventures , often utilizing extrabudgetary funds , have been organized with influential media organizations , leaders of civil society , intellectual and educational groups , the business community , appropriate private enterprises and relevant governmental institutions .  
Calls upon all countries to develop economic policies that promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 7 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Among the cross-cutting development constraints hampering the private sector were an ineffective or shallow financial sector ; lack of a legal and regulatory system ; weak infrastructure ; obsolete technology , poor on - and off-farm storage facilities , high taxation , and generally inadequate support services ; an inadequate policy framework ; an inefficient and overly dominant public enterprise sector ; misdirected development assistance ; high transaction costs ; and lack of trust in the interaction between the Government and the private sector .  
The Commission considers that the work undertaken by the UNCTAD secretariat in demonstrating to international private investors that micro finance represents an important potential market for investment , and UNCTADs efforts in creating and enhancing awareness among member States of the enabling environment for micro finance institutions , should be pursued in close cooperation with the competent bodies of the United Nations and other international organizations in this field , including existing national initiatives .  
Expressing its concern that a number of developing countries , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , have become more vulnerable to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate of private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
The main objective of the Symposium was to provide an opportunity for representatives of space industry and the private sector to interact with international space scientists , space technology experts and policy makers from developing and developed countries and to explore possibilities for increased scientific and technical cooperation .  
Stressing , given the fact that much of the most advanced environmentally sound technology is developed and held by the private sector , that the creation of an enabling environment on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private-sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries , as affirmed by the General Assembly in paragraph 90 of the annex to its resolution S / 19-2 of 28 June 1997 ,  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access , and recognizing the need for African countries to use both human and financial resources more effectively in the process of industrialization ,  
Requests the United Nations Industrial Development Organization , the Economic Commission for Africa and other relevant United Nations organizations , in accordance with their agreed mandates , work programmes and priorities , to work closely with Governments and the private sector in Africa at the national , regional and international levels to foster industrial production and development ;  
Recognizing the sovereign right of each State to decide on the development of its private and public sectors , taking into account the comparative advantages of each sector , bearing in mind the economic , social and cultural diversity in the world ,  
It emphasizes promoting healthy habits in schools ; rekindling the commitment of local governmental units , non-governmental organizations , and the private and public sectors to make lodging facilities , food establishments and marketplaces more sanitary and healthful ; and promoting healthy workplaces , non-polluting vehicles and clean and sanitary streets .  
It was reported that , unlike traditional publicly funded projects , in which the Government was responsible for the entire implementation of the project , including for obtaining financing and guaranteeing its repayment , in the case of privately financed infrastructure projects the Government engaged a private entity to develop , maintain and operate an infrastructure facility in exchange for the right to charge a price , either to the public or to the Government , for the use of the facility or the services or goods it generated .  
In its deliberations , the Commission noted the interest that various forms of private participation in public infrastructure projects had raised in many States , in particular in developing countries , as the successful implementation of such projects would enable States to achieve significant savings in public expenditure and to reallocate the resources that otherwise would have been invested in infrastructure in order to meet more pressing social needs .  
Invites Governments to consider , where appropriate , including in their delegations to future sessions of the Commission on Human Settlements , in accordance with the specific conditions of each country , representatives of local authorities and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector , non-governmental organizations and research organizations in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Barbados is improving living conditions by revitalizing the main town centres , developing systems of physical planning and coastal management , and promoting partnerships between the public and private sector , disposing of waste and extending water resources .  
Among the issues that remain to be solved are the privatization of parts of the public rental housing stock , meeting the cost of renovation of private homes in mixed-ownership buildings , the future role of private rental housing , strengthening of market-type financial institutions in the housing sector and the introduction of legal and financial elements of real estate renting .  
Modalities for cooperation between the public and private sectors are being developed and the construction industry is reorganizing itself to meet the changing demands of large and complex redevelopment projects , involving mixed uses and integrated infrastructure and finance mechanisms . 
To address the situation , the Government is planning a number of measures , which include reviewing the distribution of responsibilities in housing affairs in the public sector ; limiting public agencies ' construction activities to essential needs ; developing a viable approach to improving the housing conditions of low income citizens ; and mobilizing private capital into housing . 
The Government 's overall objectives for housing have been set out in a White Paper , entitled " Our future homes " ( 1995 ) and these include increasing the number of owner-occupied homes , reducing significantly the population of homes lying vacant and transforming the remaining large-scale , poor quality public estates through public and private sector partnership . 
The White Paper also sets out the role of the central Government in providing the right conditions for public and private investment through management of the overall economy , and local authorities will be encouraged to take a strategic enabling approach in respect of all housing tenures and a reduced role as landlords .  
The key elements for attaining sustainable economic development are a sound policy framework that encourages stable growth , a vigorous private sector , the strengthening of institutional and legal foundations and , last but not least , good-governance and anti-corruption measures .  
We must mobilize the dynamic private sector , together with bilateral and multilateral official development assistance to secure sustainable growth and poverty reduction in developing countries .  
In the area of macroeconomic policy , we have proceeded to liberalize the trade and exchange regimes to foster enhanced competitiveness ; streamline the incentive framework ; privatize State-owned enterprises to promote increasing levels of private investment ; promote entrepreneurial activity through , among other measures , a venture capital regime ; and to modernize and strengthen intellectual property legislation to encourage investment and the transfer of technology .  
There is absolutely no doubt that increased international assistance and initiatives for debt relief or cancellation , increased official development assistance to meet agreed targets , private capital flows , increased foreign direct investment , and improved terms of trade would play a catalytic role in Africa 's efforts to achieve economic development .  
In addition , even though the Government is divesting itself of some of its holdings and encouraging greater private investment in vital services and commodities , there are some areas , particularly those surrounding technology , in which the Government has to remain directly involved and catalytic ; it will continue with its practice of seeking consensus on determining key industries and activities crucial and critical for development . 
Like other members , I noted with particular interest that President Clinton first at the Waldorf Astoria hotel on the evening of 21 September , then the following day in this Hall forcefully and germanely stressed the need for the United Nations to ensure that the globalization of the economy does not create deep disparities between rich and poor and that it establishes innovative partnerships between the private sector , non-governmental organizations and international financial institutions .  
The objectives are the following : the continuation and consolidation of the process of democratizing political and social life ; the increased participation of the citizens in political , economic and social life and in making decisions that concern them ; the establishment of sound rules of government ; the promotion of the private sector ; the development of human resources ; and the restoration and safeguarding of environmental equilibrium and of the ecosystem , with special attention being paid to environmental problems related to human activities .  
A growing number of countries on our continent , including my own country , Ethiopia , have taken decisive measures to liberalize their economies , to cut Government spending , to institute sound macroeconomic policies and to enhance the role of the private sector and civil society .  
In this regard , our objectives are to correct the economic , financial and structural imbalances ; to achieve steadiness and stability in the economy as a whole ; to activate the role of the private sector in the competitive free-market economy ; to achieve sustainable development ; to foster stable environments so as to attract foreign investments ; to upgrade the basic necessary services of society ; and to build the new State and improve the standards of living of all citizens .  
As it was agreed that for most developing countries official development assistance is still a main source of external development financing and can not generally be replaced by private capital inflows , I should like to urge the donor community to intensify efforts to reverse the declining trend in official development assistance as we experience it today .  
The Commission , which at its thirty-fifth session considered the question of employment and sustainable livelihoods , reached certain agreed conclusions that have as their goal productive employment ; decreasing unemployment through improved social services , such as education and health care ; giving loans to the private sector in both urban and rural areas ; and improving information and guidance services .  
The international economic system must be overhauled to enhance the trade prospects of the poor countries and to facilitate their access to science and technology , technical assistance and increased financial flows , both private and official .  
We share the views of the representative of the Getty Information Institute on the need to rely on some standardized , basic method of exchanging information on stolen cultural property and on the importance of having precise information about such property , as well as the conclusion that only through closer cooperation between private organizations and the public sector , at both the national and the international level , will we be able to curb this illicit traffic . 
The level of private capital flows to emerging markets is likely to increase further in the future , in part due to increasing pressure on pension funds and other institutional investors to diversify their investments and to the efforts of many developing countries to attract additional foreign investment .  
In the face of the increasing power of private global actors to determine the distribution of income and production and the content of economic and social policies , outside the political process , it is important to broaden participation in decision-making and to strengthen political accountability by means of increased transparency of decision-making in existing regional and international institutions . 
In their efforts to attract foreign private investment , many Governments are fearful of the consequences of raising direct taxes ; in the short term at least , low rates of taxation or tax relief seem an obvious and quick way of attracting capital .  
Volatile financial flows not only pose threats to the solvency of national financial institutions , whether public or private but also have the potential to destabilize the international financial system , given the increasingly integrated nature of world capital markets .  
When resources of the central government are insufficient to meet the needs for public services and infrastructure , local authorities and non-governmental organizations can play an important role in raising resources , providing services , strengthening rural / urban linkages , stimulating private investment , and implementing national policies .  
In the face of the economic slowdown in Western Europe , and thus the slower growth of exports to the main foreign markets of these countries , aggregate demand was boosted by strong private consumption , made possible by rising real wages , and increased investment .  
However , the political will to promote these fundamental changes is still not evident , and most of the effort remains on technical fixes related to more efficient vehicles and not on a major shift from private to public transport systems .  
Clearing arrears and establishing a sustainable debt-servicing position create an opportunity which , combined with structural adjustment and official financial support , can promote foreign and private investment and , thus , economic growth .  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Cooperation and corporate responsibility of the private sector in acknowledging and addressing public concerns over unintended consequences of technological applications , including biotechnology , are essential for the success of economic and financial policies of Governments , including the implementation of transparent EIAs on proposed projects .  * The report was prepared by the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , as task manger for chapter 15 of Agenda 21 , in accordance with arrangements agreed to by the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development ( IACSD ) .  
Accordingly , the need to safeguard private investment through strong intellectual property regimes must be compensated by workable arrangements that ensure equitable sharing of socio-economic benefits with the developing world .  
In following up its implementation at the national level , the establishment of a participatory mechanism facilitating effective and constructive interaction between the private and public institutions ( industry associations , United Nations and other international bodies , non-governmental organizations etc . ) aimed at considering controversial issues and resolving conflicts of interest will be useful .  Such mechanism may have a profound effect in assuring public confidence and providing useful inputs , inter alia , to the Commission on Sustainable Development , the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and other international forums .  
Governments as enabling partners should create and strengthen effective partnerships with women , youth , the elderly , persons with disabilities , vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities , local authorities , the private sector and non-governmental organizations in each country .  
Nevertheless , the conclusions and recommendations of international experts have regularly emphasized that while private flows are a necessary condition for sustainable development they are not sufficient , because first , most of the poorest countries do not obtain substantial amounts of private capital , and second , sustainable development requires some types of social and environmental investments that do not attract private capital .  
Developing countries are concerned that private capital flows are concentrated in a few developing countries ( 12 countries accounted for about 80 per cent of total private flows and three quarters of FDI in developing countries during the first half of the 1990s ) , mostly middle-income countries in Asia ( which accounted for about two thirds of the expansion of total private flows ) and Latin America that have adopted outward-looking strategies and sound macroeconomic policies .  
If undertaken on the basis of an integrated and participatory approach - with the Governments as the formulators and enforcers of economic and legal policies , non-governmental organizations and the scientific community as the environmental agencies that know the most about the resilience and carrying capacity of the Earth , and the private sector as the prime mover for technological development , transfer and diffusion - TNAs can contribute to policy integration by making both public and private decision makers more aware of the environmental consequences of their actions .  
Public-private partnerships are being implemented that try to link the advantages of private sector companies - access to finance and technology , managerial efficiency , entrepreneurial experiences and engineering expertise , the capacity for producing technological innovations - with the social responsibility , environmental awareness-raising , scientific research and job generation functions of local or national Governments .  
Although no concrete data are available , there is overall recognition that the level of technology and technology-related investments from public and private sources in developed countries directed to developing countries has not , in general , been realized as envisaged at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development .  
The predominant role of the private sector in the transfer and diffusion of ESTs and , more importantly , its leading function in the transition to cleaner production , have increased the private sector 's responsibility for ensuring that technology-related investments and industrial and business operations are consistent with community requirements for sustainable lifestyles and environmental protection .  
Commenting on the secretariat report ( TD / B / COM . 1 / 2 ) , he was of the view that it did not analyse sufficiently the existing global economic environment which , in many respects , was inimical to development , given persistent debt burdens , declining ODA , uneven private investment flows , and overly cautious deflationary policies of developed countries .  
Security at the office in Kigali was lax in the extreme ; private security officers did not check identifications ; they were observed sleeping at their posts and were not supervised by international staff on nights and weekends ; pass procedures were so poor as to be non-existent ; the front desk and front gate were observed unattended , with the gate and front door wide open .  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
These include not only technological progress , but also political , social and structural changes around the world and their impact on the liberalization of telecommunication services , the introduction of non-GSO satellite systems for commercial communications , growing market orientation , the change in the way this widening market is shared between private and public service providers and the general globalization and commercialization of communication systems .  
What is required fundamentally is a different perspective that integrates the micro and macro , bridges the public and private domains ( especially the productive and reproductive spheres ) and empowers different sectors of society , including both women and men to be effective in environmental decision-making .  
In connection with item 3 of the provisional agenda , and in accordance with paragraph 4 of its agreed conclusions on enterprise development strategy ( see annex I ) , the Commission decided to convene an expert meeting on The respective roles of government and the private sector , including NGOs , and the interactions between them in creating a coherent policy framework and setting up effective support measures and structures for the development of SMEs and micro-enterprises , in particular those in least developed countries .  
This role was manifested at two levels : at the macro level in terms of creating an enabling environment , good macroeconomic policies , a sound legal , regulatory and tax framework and political stability ; and at the micro level inter alia through providing appropriate support measures and structures and investing in capacity _ building , including in the areas of education , training and health .  It could create an environment in which the private sector knew what was happening .  
However , while macroeconomic stabilization was a necessary but not sufficient condition for enterprise development , structural adjustment and liberalization measures had produced encouraging positive results such as the emergence of an enterprise culture and increased entrepreneurial activities to take advantage of the enlarged economic opportunities for the private sector arising from such measures .  
Its President 's statement to the Special Rapporteur , the documentation he turned over and his account of the company 's background in the countries where it has concluded specialized service contracts offer an alternate way of looking at things in which military sciences are likely to be taken out of the State context and to move into the private sector where they offer skilled professional services in a free and global market .  
Even though it is more complete than article 47 of Additional Protocol I , it does not differ much from that text as far as the definition of a mercenary is concerned and it lends itself to different and perhaps contradictory interpretations , when it is States themselves that , on the initiative of their Governments , hire private firms to perform services connected with public order and security . 
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Recognizing the need to promote social responsibility and appropriate standards of ethics on the part of private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals engaged in international commercial transactions , inter alia , through observance of the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business , and taking into account the impact of their activities on economic and social development and environmental protection ,  
To take effective and concrete action to combat all forms of corruption , bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions , in particular to pursue effective enforcement of existing laws prohibiting bribery in international commercial transactions , to encourage the adoption of laws for those purposes where they do not exist , and to call upon private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals within their jurisdiction engaged in international commercial transactions to promote the objectives of the present Declaration ;  
To deny , in countries that do not already do so , the tax deductibility of bribes paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a State to any public official or elected representative of another country and , to that end , to examine their respective modalities for doing so ;  
Despite abject poverty in the slums surrounding the cities , living conditions are still considered preferable to those in rural areas , particularly with regard to access to water and the availability of basic services , such as health and education , as well as access to markets , which provides opportunities in the private sector .  
That included all violent acts against female victims that resulted in , or could result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , as well as threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivations of liberty , whether occurring in public or private life .  
Encourages relevant United Nations funds and programmes and the specialized agencies , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to support local , national , and international programmes and projects for the Year , and also encourages them , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , as well as the international financial institutions , to ensure that the concerns and contributions of older persons are integrated into their development programmes ;  
Central importance should be assigned to employment in the formulation and implementation of economic and social policies , with the understanding that the public sector , the private sector , cooperatives and the civil society have a shared interest in and responsibility for employment , and that the achievement of full employment should be a permanent goal for all of them .  
Although increased private flows have led to investments in industry and technology in some developing countries and economies in transition , many other developing countries have been left behind , slowing the process of technological change in those countries and limiting their ability to meet their commitments under Agenda 21 and other international agreements .  
Therefore , at both the national and international levels , further work should be undertaken on the design of appropriate policies for attracting private foreign capital , in particular foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , reducing its volatility , and enhancing its contribution to sustainable development , for example by promoting innovative schemes , such as co-financing and " green " credit lines and investment funds .  
Multilateral and bilateral donors , Governments and the private sector should increase support to non-governmental organizations , particularly to women 's organizations , in playing an active role in advocacy for the implementation of Agenda 21 at the international and national levels , particularly in supporting national policies and programmes for sustainable development in the developing countries .  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti _ discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Governments have moved to accord high priority to child survival and health ; the work of non-governmental organizations and of the private sector has expanded ; community participation has increased , and families have been empowered by gaining greater knowledge and skills about utilizing low-cost , easily available life-saving technologies for their children ; bilateral and multilateral agencies have mobilized greater resources for child survival and health interventions ; and immunization , nutrition and reproductive health programmes have expanded .  
Invites Governments to consider , where appropriate , including in their delegations to future sessions of the Commission , in accordance with the specific conditions of each country , representatives of local authorities and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector , non-governmental organizations and research organizations , in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Another school of thought , while recognizing the responsibility of the State to protect those living in its territory , held that the international community should also hold private individuals who perpetrated violence accountable , under the Protocols additional to the Geneva Conventions , especially Protocol II , and that ethical and legal position had been gaining ground . 
Recognizing the sovereign right of each State to decide on the development of its private and public sectors , taking into account the comparative advantages of each sector , bearing in mind the economic , social and cultural diversity in the world ,  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access , and recognizing the need for African countries to use both human and financial resources more effectively in the process of industrialization ,  
Requests the United Nations Industrial Development Organization , the Economic Commission for Africa and other relevant United Nations organizations , in accordance with their agreed mandates , work programmes and priorities , to work closely with Governments and the private sector in Africa at the national , regional and international levels to foster industrial production and development ;  
It also needs to be emphasized that , unlike the western European countries in the late 1940s and 1950s which benefited from Marshall aid and other official support for financing their current account deficits over a number of years and thus sustaining growth and reconstruction , the transition economies are largely dependent on private financial flows which are much more nervous and fickle than official commitments .  
The stated goals of the Centre are " to assist Governments in policy and strategy formulation to improve the living conditions of people in their communities by expanding access to adequate shelter , infrastructure and services for all . . . and to strengthen the capacity of national Governments and local authorities to mobilize public and private resources and to improve urban environmental conditions and productivity " .  
In fact , the team did not come across any system to assess organizational performance in Habitat 's two basic goals , namely , that of assisting Governments in policy and strategy formulation to improve the living conditions of people in their communities and that of strengthening the capacity of national Governments and local authorities to mobilize public and private resources to improve urban environmental conditions and productivity .  
While the private sector is the " engine of development " , the Government has to lay and maintain the " tracks " that is , create and maintain the legal and regulatory environment for private ownership and fair competition , correct appropriately for market failures , protect the disadvantaged and maintain economic stability , law and order .  
The paper is divided into four main sections , which deal respectively with increasing opportunities in the private sector , the business-enabling environment , promotion of competition and social regulation , and a final section which briefly touches on the role of the international community with regard to the foregoing .  
Where there is insufficient competition , the government may divide the work ( e.g . geographically ) between outside contractors and inside workforces , as is done for instance by the city of Bogota , Colombia , where solid waste collection is shared between public and private agencies , with a private firm made responsible for monitoring the operations of all the agencies . 2 Continued government provision of at least part of the service provides in-house knowledge of costs and technology changes and thereby some protection against inflated contracts ; 
There are a number of situations in which partnership between public and private sector institutions is the most efficient and effective mechanism , due to the presence of mutually reinforcing goals - which in the final analysis converge towards an equitable and sustainable economic development of the country - and to the complementarity of capacities and roles .  
Through these novel modalities , the advantages of the private sector - dynamism , access to finance , knowledge of technologies , managerial efficiency , entrepreneurial spirit - are combined with the social responsibility , network of contacts , environmental awareness , local knowledge , and job generation concerns of the public sector . 
Typically , the EMPRETEC business support centres established in each country are active coalitions of public institutions , private business associations , national and foreign companies , and multilateral organizations , led by National Executive Committees comprising high-level public officials , entrepreneurs ' representatives and prominent business leaders from local and multinational companies operating in the country .  
The twelfth Meeting of Experts on Public Administration and Finance ( see A / 50 / 525-E / 1995 / 122 ) recommended that the United Nations Programme help governments define the role and scope of the public , mixed and private sectors and to suggest options in the modalities of interaction in accordance with the practical realities in each country , especially at the local and municipal levels , by means of specific technical assistance , dissemination and exchange of country experience and research on the conditions for successful replication .  
The documents were distributed in provisional form , starting in early 1995 , and comments were invited and received through an extensive review process involving experts from governments , sister UN agencies , development banks , selected centres of excellence , NGOs , the private sector , and eminent persons , among others .  
Such violations shall include , but not be limited to , murder , ill _ treatment or deportation to slave labour or for any other purpose of civilian population of or in occupied territory , murder or ill _ treatment of prisoners of war or persons on the seas , killing of hostages , plunder of public or private property , wanton destruction of cities , towns or villages , or devastation not justified by military necessity ;  
In the case of UNDP , non-core resources are constituted by funds contributed by governmental or private sources and intended for specific purposes , i.e . , identified projects or programmes , or assistance within geographic or thematic areas .  
In the mid-1990s , private flows have been exceeding official sources : ODA has shrunk to an all time low of 0.27 per cent of GNP , and a growing portion is going to meet humanitarian needs ( rising from US $ 1-billion in 1990 to US $ 3-billion in 1993 , peaking in 1994 ) and debt relief .  
Eight workshops on enhancing policy analysis capacity in African public services ; developing standards and indicators for better civil service performance ; strengthening the leadership and the managerial and technical capacities of local government ; formulation of policies and measures to foster small enterprises and micro-enterprises ; and investment promotion centres and private sector development in Africa ; ( i ) Advisory services .  
The Ministerial Council reaffirmed its absolute and unwavering belief in Iraq 's obligation to comply with all the relevant Security Council resolutions , in particular those pertaining to the release of Kuwaiti and third-country prisoners and detainees ; cooperate fully with the Special Commission in its investigation of Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction ; return all public and private property to Kuwait ; continue to comply fully with the compensation mechanism ; and refrain from all hostile or provocative acts directed against Kuwait and neighbouring States , pursuant to resolution 949 ( 1994 ) .  
The Council may urge that structural reforms aimed at establishing a competitive domestic financial system , privatization and / or restructuring of public enterprises continue to be implemented in order to enhance the efficient allocation of resources and support private sector development ; such reforms are also expected to boost domestic savings and investment and thereby contribute to higher economic growth .  
Among the contributing factors to this surge in private flows are the high growth rates experienced by many developing countries , the spread of market reforms and , in particular , the deregulation of private capital flows , the liberalization of world trade , the rise of global institutional investors and the accelerating capitalization of emerging markets and their integration into world financial markets .  
While Governments may have assisted in making globalization possible by reducing legal and administrative barriers to flows between countries and regions , the main actors in the process have been mostly private enterprises , largely based in developed countries , although , in recent years , enterprises from newly industrialized countries have become active in other developing countries .  
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
The State has the overall responsibility in various areas , including , inter alia , social , economic and environmental policy formulation , and for creating an enabling environment for the private sector ; the State should encourage effective participation by the private sector and major groups in activities which complement and reinforce national objectives .  
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development will be undertaken .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods , the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework . 
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to this Agenda .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
The importance of the national professional project personnel as the major source of expertise for technical cooperation projects has increased steadily in recent years because of their crucial advantages in transferring national private sector expertise to public institutions , using national talent that could be lost through the brain-drain and cultural compatibility with national work environment .  
The Task Force is focusing on country-level follow-up , and at its most recent meeting , the Chairperson emphasized that special attention should be focused on developing partnerships with non-governmental organizations , the private sector and civil society in assisting countries in achieving the goals agreed to at the recent United Nations global conferences .  
Among the challenges faced by Turkey in achieving women 's equality , the representative identified the disparities in status and opportunities for urban middle-class and rural women ; violence against women in the private domain ; a strengthening of the contribution of the media to the advancement of women , including through an increase in the number of female professionals in this area ; and the revision of educational materials , which continued to portray women in their traditional roles as mothers and wives .  
While it is not for the Government itself to build or finance the housing units required to satisfy all of the demand in the country , it should make every effort to ensure that a fair share of the resources available is utilized for making low _ cost housing available to the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sectors of society , and enabling the private sector to contribute to that endeavour .  
Governments should focus on being enabling partners and facilitators by creating and strengthening effective partnerships with a broad spectrum of national and grass-roots groups including local authorities , the private sector , non-governmental organizations , women 's and youth groups and the scientific and academic communities .  
There has been a sizeable expansion of private flows of financial resources from developed to a limited number of developing countries and , in a number of countries , efforts have been made in support of domestic resource mobilization , including the increasing use of economic instruments to promote sustainable development .  
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , ODA remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
The creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
It was agreed at Rio that the developed countries were to bring the level of their official development assistance to the nominal level of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and that sufficient resources were to be mobilized by each country and by the international community , including both the public and private sectors , for the survival of our planet Earth .  
Except for two years since Rio , Zambia has been unable to register positive growth in its gross domestic product , despite my Government \ x { e5b8 } very determined effort to put in place comprehensive reform measures in the private and public sectors .  
Regarding the national plan , I must stress that it was developed through a participatory approach involving international donors , public administrations , academic and scientific research institutions , the private sector , local communities , non-governmental organizations and professional organizations .  
The sustainable management of natural resources , the combatting of pollution and environmental degradation , the development of human resources through the implementation of a population policy , education and health , regional integration , the creation of productive jobs in rural areas and through the development of the private sector in order to eradicate poverty all these represent the strategic framework which will make it possible to ensure human sustainable development in our country .  
Therefore , Member States , the developed nations in particular , international development organizations and the private sector must fulfil the commitments they undertook in Rio , especially in terms of the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the provision of financial and technical resources , with a view to creating an equitable , fair and just international economic and social environment that would ensure the incorporation of the efforts of the developing countries into the implementation of the overall strategies of sustainable development and environmental protection .  
This part of the study , which deals solely with economic , social and cultural rights , concerns all current or recent violations of those rights and of so _ called collective rights such as the right to development and the right to a healthy environment , irrespective of their perpetrators , whether States or their agents , groups of States , national or international private organizations or individuals or groups acting outside the competence of the State .  
Measures adopted for ethnic minorities and other social groups , are designed , inter alia , to guarantee to indigenous and tribal peoples and to ethnic minorities especially favourable treatment as regards access to educational facilities and employment in the public or private sector .  
Convinced that the need for volunteer effort is greater than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse and HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of societies , and the contemporary trend for civil society _ in partnership with Government and the private sector _ to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process ,  
Noting that the appointment of a special rapporteur had now become advisable , Ms . Palley drew the attention of the working group to five issues : the legality of privatization under international human rights law ; the extent of delegation of duties possible under privatization ; the question of whether United Nations standards must be further developed ; the minimum safeguards required ; the most appropriate human rights monitoring method for private prisons .  
This section analyses provisions on financial transfers and mechanisms in recent MEAs ( in particular provisions on " compliance assistance " contained in the Montreal Protocol , the CBD and the FCCC ) , as well as other ways of generating new public and private financial resources to assist developing countries in promoting sustainable development and more particularly in tackling global environmental problems .  
Clear examples and opportunities exist for providing benefits to source countries as well as indigenous and local communities in terms of health improvement , resource management capacity , and sustainable use of natural resources .  The key to its success will be in the ability to provide near - and long-term benefits that effect changes in the behaviour of individuals , communities and private companies , as well as in natural resource policies of both developed and developing country governments .  
Where developing countries have been watchful of the cost of incentives and applied them within an outward-oriented approach , microeconomic measures addressing specific supply constraints have helped build supply capabilities which the private sector could not have accomplished as rapidly by itself . \ x { ffff } seq level0 \ * arabic \ x { ffff } 24 \ x { ffff } .  
The Programme believed that the international capital markets and the private sector played a vital role in the promotion of sustainable energy concepts , since total private sector investments in energy far outweighed all flows of official development assistance to the sector .  
Furthermore , irrational phenomena still existed in the world economic system which were hampering the development efforts of developing countries , including the stagnation of international cooperation in such areas as finance , debt , trade and the transfer of technology ; the protectionism still practised by some of the major developed countries in international trade and economic activities ; and the emphasis placed by those countries on the role of private capital and market mechanisms , while minimizing the responsibility of their Governments to meet their commitments with regard to official development assistance .  
A common vision had developed that sound financial and economic policies , including development of human resources and respect for human rights , good governance , individual initiative and the private sector , were critical to creating an environment conducive to economic growth , environmental sustainability and social equity .  
For the first time , more than half the gross domestic product had been generated by the private sector , and more favourable conditions for national and foreign investors had been created through the ongoing privatization process , the completion of the first phase of financial stabilization , the gradual liberalization of domestic and foreign trade and the introduction of a new national currency .  
Even though participants in the Conference had included the main representatives of the public , private and community sectors involved in the development of human settlements , the appeal which had been made at the Conference could not bear fruit without assistance and cooperation at the national level and , in particular , without the solidarity and effective and timely delivery of international contributions .  
As indicated in paragraphs 7 to 10 of that report , over the past few years , increasingly large amounts of private capital had moved from developed countries to a number of developing countries in Asia , Latin America and the Middle East ; while such inflows had generally promoted economic growth , they had sometimes generated inflationary pressures and , in some instances , sudden capital outflows as a result of a loss of confidence by investors .  
The situation was particularly difficult for the developing countries since the liberalization of their foreign transactions made them increasingly vulnerable to the unpredictable fluctuations of private capital flows in the international financial markets .  
Despite the decisive role of domestic policy in respect of the influx of private capital , it was essential to take measures at the international level to ensure the effectiveness of domestic reforms ; in that respect it should be recalled that , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 50 / 91 , cooperation and coordination must be broadened among interested countries and the Bretton Woods institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries .  
Although Nicaragua had been able to make progress in solving the problem of the external debt , through the cooperation of the international community and friendly countries , such as the Russian Federation , which had recently announced the cancellation of the debt balance , the external debt was still a very heavy burden which impeded economic growth and inhibited public and private investment .  
The Platform for Action adopted at the Conference was established as a powerful tool for the empowerment of women , aimed at removing all the obstacles to womens active participation in public and private life by promoting their full and equal participation in economic , social , cultural and political decision-making processes .  
For example , financial contributions to relevant multilateral institutions and programmes were often not reported , many national communications provided limited detail on bilateral programmes related to the implementation of the Convention , and there was little discussion of transfer of technology through the private sector . 
Experts identified five main areas of potential policy incoherence : between macroeconomic policy and microeconomic policy ; between public and private sector bodies involved in SME support services ; between the federal and local levels ; between implementation and design ; and between internal and external policies .  
Three main types of credit funds have been established in the Russian Federation , namely ( i ) those co-financed by national and international private investors , ( ii ) federally funded schemes and ( iii ) micro-credit schemes .  
There might , however , be specific situations in which the adoption of a separate competition policy would be accorded a lower priority : in some economies , particularly small economies , competition from imports and from foreign firms might be sufficient to minimize the possibilities for restrictive business practices by private firms , while in other economies , lack of resources and human resources for effective implementation of competition law might limit the ability to adopt a competition policy , at least in the immediate future .  
It must be mentioned , however , that even when Trade Points have not been prevented from operating in the private sector , they sometimes had to face an unfriendly environment : since one of the most immediate practical impacts of Trade Points is to diminish the importance of intermediaries by bringing local enterprises a step closer to their markets and their customers and suppliers , Trade Points sometimes had to face direct or indirect opposition from such intermediaries ; this opposition should not be expected to diminish in the future .  
The international conferences of the 1990s recognized the crucial role of the private sector , together with other actors of civil society , in achieving goals of economic , social and environmentally sound development .  
To achieve successful sales of public enterprises to the private sector , it is necessary to have a strong legislative framework , a high degree of capital market development and , in many cases , sufficient persons with the capacity and integrity to develop an effective regulatory system .  
The major issues addressed included providing an enabling environment for conversion at both national and local levels ; the role of public and private sectors ; conversion of military bases and defence industries to export processing zones ; tourism development in former military bases and defence complexes ; civilian manufacturing , prospects for small and medium-sized enterprise development ; and continuity of social infrastructure services .  
After years of living under centrally planned regimes where the private sector hardly existed as in the countries of eastern and central Europe and the former Soviet Union most fledgling entrepreneurs lacked financial and business experience and the facilities were not available for them to start operating .  
When the provision of such vital services as telecommunications , electricity supply , railways , freight transport , fuel distribution and so forth are acquired by private owners , whether through the acquisition of a State monopoly by a single large private corporation or through a widely distributed share ownership , it is appropriate that the Government set up an independent and effective regulatory body to look after consumer interests and wider national and environmental concerns .  
Any balanced approach to development must take into account current economic , political and technological realities , especially the increasing influence of the private sector , which played a catalytic role in Malaysias economic growth .  
The drug dimension was incorporated with UNDCP assistance into mainstream national health , education , social welfare , critical poverty and rural development programmes , by elaborating new drug-control partnerships with sectoral ministries , relevant United Nations organizations , international financial institutions , non-governmental organizations , private industry and other partners .  
Further indicators include a net increase in the following : the number of coca-farming families assisted by national agencies and committed to the elimination of their coca crops ; geographic coverage and number of hectares devoted to alternative development ; the use of central , regional and local entities for alternative development planning and implementation ; private investment in alternative development activities ; the donor base and the value of alternative development activities coordinated by agencies .  
Yet the attainment of a proper mix of distributive and redistributive policies is important , because private initiative , although crucial , is not sufficient for the achievement of an equitable and prosperous society .  
It also emphasized the need to introduce a wide range of policy , legal , regulatory and institutional reforms which provide the private sector with a more favourable and competitive business environment .  
They should pursue sound macroeconomic policies , strive to increase domestic savings and investment , strengthen institutional , legal , regulatory and supervisory capacities and improve economic management in the public and private sectors .  
Assistance to Governments , at their request , in creating an enabling institutional and legislative environment for the effective contribution of public and private utilities to the provision of water supply and sanitation to urban and rural communities .  
The Special Rapporteur was also informed of the existence of commercial sexual exploitation of children , through loosely organized networks , in rich , private houses known as Mbwa kali , which refers to the Beware of fierce dog signs posted outside the gates .  
These institutions succeeded where traditional public programmes failed , and she supported UNCTADs initiative aimed at creating an essential direct link between private investors and micro finance institutions in developing countries . 
The project focuses on the nature of the private investment decisions of southern European manufacturing firms required to incorporate technological change in the transition to sustained and competitive growth in the single European market .  
Partnerships between the public and private sectors , which are becoming common in many developing countries , ensure that essential skills and theory acquired through formal education are complemented by enterprise-based practical training .  
Although his Government had been successful in attracting private capital through a policy of privatization and facilitating foreign investment , financial flows to developing countries were determined largely by the major industrialized States .  
At the national level , over the past 10 years , his Government had substantially increased domestic resources for development financing , but it continued to need external resources , both private and official , in order to sustain current growth rates .  
Thirdly , the real capacity of the private sector to provide resources that were predictable , continuous , assured , universal , neutral and commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries had to be ascertained .  
Furthermore , the distribution of private financial flows to the developing countries had remained highly uneven , so that the rapid growth of foreign direct investment did not represent a growing benefit for all the developing countries .  
The Government 's annual budget , however , contained no direct allocations to medical or pharmaceutical research , which was funded by various public and private agencies .  
Its objective is twofold : ( a ) to assess how to enhance national capacities to manage private capital , both domestic and foreign , in least developed countries and ( b ) to search for feasible ways and means of facilitating private investment in support of SHD .  
This is the concern of everyone , ranging from the communities where such diseases are endemic to the public , private and voluntary sectors at national and international level .  
A well developed financial sector is critical in stimulating private domestic savings and investment in Africa to achieve sustained economic growth and development .  
Still other cooperative mechanisms , such as the WMO World Weather Watch programme , support the coordination of global scientific activity for prompt and accurate weather information and other services for public , private and commercial use .  
However , to mobilize private investors , a legislative and regulatory framework will have to be established that is stable , predictable and transparent , making it possible for rational economic decisions to be taken .  
During the first half of the year , the region was receiving substantial private credit inflows on a net basis , continuing a trend that had started in 1996 owing to low international interest rates and improving growth prospects .  
It includes citizen initiative and participation , the sharing of responsibility between the central State authorities and autonomous State or private bodies , incentives to creativity and responses based very clearly on the specific needs of vulnerable groups .  
The second stage would focus on major structural transformations of the national economy by promoting domestic production , thereby creating further opportunities for private business and favourable conditions for sustainable economic growth .  
It was also essential to promote an enabling international economic environment which ensured a minimum of stability to counter adverse effects arising from sudden movements in private capital flows .  
The Committee decided that in the future it would meet in private half an hour before starting consideration of a country report , in order to pinpoint the main problems to be addressed during public discussion .  
By supporting democratically accountable local governments , UNCDF has demonstrated that civil society can be empowered and the local private sector stimulated to participate in poverty reduction .  
The least developed countries had received only a tiny portion of foreign direct investment in developing countries , which underscored the need to mobilize private capital for the least developed countries at a time when ODA continued to decline .  
Despite the increasing role of private capital in development , official development assistance still played a critical and catalytic role in facilitating the development of the least developed countries .  
A critical element is the availability of public resources to finance and support publicly provided services and to stimulate and complement private and voluntary provision , as appropriate , and their more effective and efficient use to meet stated objectives .  
Regretting that the financial markets have exhibited extreme volatility , which has resulted in higher interest rate spreads and a sharp decline in private capital flows to developing countries , leading to a significant slowdown in economic activity ,  
Sound macroeconomic policies and a legal and economic framework that enhanced the growth of a dynamic private sector were seen as essential in improving countries capacity to trade .  
The Bretton Woods institutions play a central role in supporting the national authorities in public policymaking and in private sector development ; the World Bank is a major financing source , active in all key sectors of the recovery programme .  
In its preliminary conclusions and recommendations , the paper stated that human rights education , with special emphasis on racial discrimination , should not be confined to public and private schools and universities .  
Full-scale effort to reform regulatory , procedural and managerial systems at a regional or subregional level requires effective institutional support arrangements and trained manpower at both the government and private sector levels .  
The gap between the official and unofficial exchange rates continued to widen , discouraging domestic production and leading to a situation whereby foreign currency is used side by side with the national one , in both official and private transactions .  
The high level of unhedged private external debt made the option of devaluing the baht a painful choice that was avoided until foreign exchange reserves had been nearly exhausted in defending the exchange rate .  
It also emphasized the need to introduce a wide range of policy , legal , regulatory and institutional reforms which would provide the private sector with a more favourable and competitive business environment .  
At the same time , higher and specialized secondary medical teaching institutions , both State-owned and private , are being certified and accredited by an ad hoc commission established by joint order of the Ministries of Health and Education .  
Regretting that the financial markets have exhibited extreme volatility , which has resulted in higher interest rate spreads and a sharp decline in private capital flows to developing countries , leading to a significant slowdown in economic activity ,  
It is the task of the national statistical system to make available to government , the public and the private sector relevant and reliable statistical information for economic , social , cultural and environmental developments in a country ;  
A sound financial sector , good governance , broad-based social investments , respect for human rights , and transparency in both the public and private sector were factors at the national level conducive to economic and social growth and development .  
Before the crisis , economic orthodoxy had held that a current account deficit was acceptable and sustainable if it stemmed from investment as opposed to consumption and if it was a result of private sector activities .  
Under green aid , we would utilize official development assistance and private financial resources to cope with the issues of energy and global warming and promote cooperation with developing countries through the development of human resources .  
In the ensuing discussion , delegations focused on the following key issues : the biennial support budget ; the level of the operational reserve ; funds from private foundations ; the national execution modality ; and unpaid contributions .  
As reported in this year 's Trade and Development Report , there is ample evidence to show that Africa 's external debt burden is in fact having a severe adverse effect on both public and private investment and renewed growth .  
The development process requires a united vision if it is to be sustainable , and it requires joint responsibility on the part of the public and the private sectors to ensure continuity combined with the political stability that strengthens democratic governance .  
Recognizing that the implementation of the Platform for Action rests primarily at the national level , that Governments , non-governmental organizations and public and private institutions should be involved in the implementation process and that national mechanisms also have an essential role in this regard , and bearing in mind that enhanced national efforts and international cooperation are essential for the effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and the Platform for Action ,  
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
The current financial crisis , caused by massive inflows of private capital and their sudden reversal , had , however , forced the Committee to view the implications of private capital flows into developing countries from a completely different perspective .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
Additional information is needed on approaches that can be used to devise markets for forest products , and the role of the public and private sector in assuring that new or expanded markets are consistent with the social , economic and ecological components of sustainable forest management .  
Such issues as trade , market access and transparency , and economic , environmental and social policies which directly or indirectly affect the forest sector , as well as governance and corruption , private investment , financial resources and transfer of technology , need to be addressed in an integrated manner to achieve efficiency and effective results . 
Whatever the outcome on public funding arrangements , the essential role of the private sector in the productive , entrepreneurial aspects of sustainable forest management needs to be recognized , reinforced and promoted .  
This would be accomplished by capitalizing on existing and potential public and private-sector financial resources , primarily at the global level , with a specific view to leveraging higher levels of private sector finance .  
Financing of technology transfer and accompanying know-how and capacity-building through official development assistance ; multilateral technical assistance , public and private partnerships , joint ventures and foreign direct investments ;  
For that purpose , the Guide helps identify areas of law that are typically most relevant to private capital investment in public infrastructure projects and discusses the content of those laws which would be conducive to attracting private capital , national and foreign .  
Among the general factors are significant technological innovations ; high indebtedness and stringent budget constraints limiting the public sectors ability to meet increasing infrastructure needs ; the expansion of international and local capital markets , with a consequent improvement in access to private funding ; and an increasing number of successful international experiences with private participation and competition in infrastructure .  
With the withdrawal of the State from direct provision of housing or housing subsidies to the poor and the deregulation of the rental market , the poor are exploited by private property owners , often paying over half of their meagre income on rent .  
Based on past experience and the changes brought about by the rapid globalization of the economy , there had been a growing convergence of policies that encouraged investment in human resources and government responsibility in creating a dynamic domestic framework in which the private sector could play its role as the driving force of industrial development .  
Obviously , however , development of the private sector was impossible without support at the public level , which should include , inter alia , demonopolization , the introduction of tax incentives , a sound legal environment and the promotion of domestic and foreign investment .  
Discussions around financial resources in IPF and IFF have also included such issues as effective private sector involvement ; integration with national policies and priorities and effective coordination ; the application of economic instruments and tax policies ; the mobilization of national financial resources ; and the possibility of finding a mechanism to raise funds to establish a forest fund dedicated to support activities aimed at sustainable forest management .  
The Court has handed down two decisions on the matter : in one , it upheld the Departments power to refuse to renew private companies licences to deal in arms and ammunition but established that it could not restrict transactions covered by such licences prior to their cancellation ; in the other , it declared unconstitutional a Department directive restricting the purchase of ammunition .  
Therefore , private investors , national and foreign , bringing new or advanced technology into the host country or developing original solutions will need to be assured that their intellectual property rights will be protected and that they will be able to enforce those rights against infringements .  
An illegal act which violates human rights and which is initially not directly imputable to the State ( for example , because it is the act of a private person or because the person responsible has not been identified ) can lead to international responsibility of the State , not because of the act itself but because of the lack of due diligence to prevent the violation or to respond to it as required by the Convention .  
The Department of Social Affairs had also tried to reduce poverty by providing financial assistance to private institutions , food assistance to primary school children and children of poor families , financial and technical assistance to groups of poor families and other social welfare recipients undertaking economic activities , and by providing assistance to the children of the unemployed .  
UNIDO harnesses the joint forces of government and the private sector to foster competitive industrial production , develop international industrial partnerships and promote socially equitable and environmentally friendly industrial development .  UNIDO is the only worldwide organization dealing with industry from a development perspective .  
While other agencies had long faced problems in choosing legitimate or representative partners in the private sector , those partners were usually non-profit bodies , whereas working on operational projects with profit-seeking partners was clearly more problematic ; association with the United Nations could be interpreted as giving an unfair commercial advantage over its competitors , national and international . 
By the Governments decision , the National Council for Womens Affairs , headed by a Cabinet member , the Minister for Health and Social Welfare , was established at the end of 1996 , and its operational by-laws were accordingly adopted . the Council is made up of MPs , officials of ministries concerned , representatives of womens non-governmental organizations , voluntary movements , mass organizations , owners of private companies , business and cooperative entities . 
In particular , fast and balanced growth was urgently needed in the heavily indebted countries of sub-Saharan Africa , where the future of innumerable families was literally mortgaged in order to service loans from bilateral institutions , private banks and international organizations .  
The programme is aimed at families living on municipal , State _ owned or private land , involving negotiations between landowners , the community and the municipal government , or families who have been relocated , through the new organized settlements programme , to the above _ mentioned land because they had previously been living in high-risk areas , on rights of way , in ecological or archeological reserves or on private property .  
The programme is aimed at poor families living in minimal housing conditions and in high-risk areas , on rights of way , in ecological or archaeological reserves or on private property , persons over 18 years of age , and persons who belong to a family unit with an income of less than two monthly minimum wages when they can prove that the family has no assets and have expressed a desire to purchase a plot . 
at the national level , there are cases of discrimination against unmarried female pupils and teachers who , because of pregnancy , are expelled from private religious schools or , exceptionally , from State educational institutions on the ground that they may have a bad influence on other pupils .  
The global seed trade is dominated by large private industry giants whose vast economic power and commercial control over plant germplasm is beginning to overshadow the role of the public sector in plant breeding and other agricultural research in many countries .  
In some developing countries , a combination of weak or nonexistent policies on the one hand and the efforts of private firms on the other has already stimulated a shift from food production for subsistence for local communities to large-scale production of few crops and varieties for national and international markets , resulting in a loss of diversity .  
More generally , small island developing States believe that the potential for greater resource mobilization can be enhanced by more effective coordination on a number of fronts : at the national and regional levels , including a strengthened regional mechanism ; among donors , through more creative interaction with the private sector and NGOs ; and through the strengthening of focal points within the United Nations system , including the small island developing States Unit .  
With regard to the volatility of financial flows , he said that while the amount of those flows to the developing countries had increased from $ 100-billion in 1990 to over $ 250-billion in 1996 , they were composed almost entirely of private capital and were concentrated in a limited number of developing countries .  
Global financial integration had helped to generate a massive expansion of private capital flows to some developing countries , but also posed enormous challenges to national financial and banking systems in terms of ensuring the sustainability of those flows .  
In order to prepare for the high-level consideration of the topic of financing for development , it was important to focus on a number of key elements : States should begin with the mobilization of domestic resources , review the allocation of national expenditures and their fiscal priorities , look into the private sector and review their legal and administrative structures for rapid growth .  
The declining trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) and the increasingly frequent imposition of conditions of an economic and financial or a political , legal or humanitarian nature had forced many developing countries to resort to private capital flows , which had been concentrated in a small number of countries and had proved unstable and crisis-prone .  
The cantons were required to provide victims with access to independent public or private counselling centres whose task it was to offer medical , psychological , social , material and legal support and to give information on victim assistance .  
Hospitals , schools , factories , refugee accommodation centres , private houses and farms , food depots , landmarks of priceless cultural and spiritual value , industrial facilities , and public utility services , such as water supply systems , power plants and Post , Telephone and Telegraph communication centres , have been destroyed or severely damaged .  
More effective use will be made of policy seminars , conferences , and training workshops addressed to specific development issues , bringing together senior national policy makers and representatives of civil society and the private sector and facilitating a shared understanding of the development challenges that African countries face and the policy options that are available .  
Through information exchange with donors , regional groups , national committees , Governments and the corporate sector , ensuring that priorities of Governments are met by the UNEP programme of work and individual projects ; and organization of innovative fund raising from previously inadequately tapped sources , such as the private sector .  
Concerned States will be assisted to secure adequate financial and technical assistance and support for their alternative development programmes , particularly from the international financial institutions , non-governmental organizations , relevant United Nations organizations and the private sector .  
In view of the crisis with regard to private capital flows and the further decline in official development assistance ( ODA ) since 1997 , it will be necessary to again demonstrate that ODA is a main source of external funding for developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , and that the fulfilment of all financial commitments of Agenda 21 must be an integral part of the ODA reform discussion .  
As far as financing for the implementation of Agenda 21 from countries own public and private sectors is concerned , it may be useful to focus the discussion at the eighth session on the particular problems of developing countries in the current economic situation and continue the discussion held at previous sessions on new policy approaches in both developed and developing countries .  
While coherent and well-focused government efforts remain an integral element of social development framework , involvement of civil society and private sector proves to be highly beneficial for attaining both specific social targets and equitable development . 
The executive heads of organizations in the United Nations system outlined the elements of a shared strategy and committed themselves to the concerted effort by all agencies towards poverty eradication and also to playing a supportive and catalytic role in mobilizing the energies and resources of all development actors Governments , the private sector , civil society , donors and above all the poor themselves in the campaign against poverty .  
Crucial requirements are well known and include improving the access to and quality of primary , secondary , technical and vocational education ; improving marketing arrangements for primary commodities ; land reform ; mobilization of domestic saving for infrastructure including small scale , local public works and for private investment ; and attracting foreign direct investment under conditions that ensure benefits to the receiving countries .  
The goal of the partnership , which consists of Governments , UNAIDS co-sponsoring agencies , bilateral organizations , non-governmental organizations and the private sector , is to mobilize Governments and organizations of civil society to redirect and expand national and international political , programme and financial commitments and action to address the epidemic and its impact on life and the potential for socio-economic development in Africa .  
Sudden inflows and equally sudden outflows of foreign capital create considerable difficulties for the management of domestic monetary policy ; 27 the resulting uncertainty and higher risks implied by financial volatility lead to caution on the part of Governments ( which tend to set interest rates higher than they might otherwise have been ) and of private business ( faced with increased costs of capital and increased uncertainty over future demand ) .  
As the fallout from the initial financial crisis in Thailand enters its third year , weak international trade and the negligible improvement in private financial inflows mean that most developing and transition economies continue to face a tight external payments constraint .  
Requests the High Commissioner to set up a voluntary fund designed specifically to cover all aspects of the preparatory process for the Conference and the participation of non _ governmental organizations , especially from developing countries , and requests all Governments , international organizations , non _ governmental organizations and private individuals to contribute to this Fund ;

In his seventh report , in response to various suggestions for dealing with the question of liability by giving greater weight to domestic or private law remedies , Barboza proposed that civil liability should be primary and State liability should be residual . 82 In this regard , State liability would only replace civil liability if the private person who is liable can not fully compensate the harm or if that person can not be identified or located . 
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .  
The proposed Convention would be built on the following main pillars : the creation of free trade zones , building on existing regional groups to facilitate the liberalization process , and the granting of special and differential treatment for the least developed ACP countries to facilitate their integration into the multilateral trading system , reinforce their institutional capacity and create a favourable policy framework to attract foreign investment and develop a dynamic private sector .  
In fulfilling its role as a catalyst of change , EBRD encourages co-financing and foreign direct investment from the private and public sectors , helps to mobilize domestic capital and provides technical cooperation in relevant areas .  
The general human rights climate has also been worsened by the accompanying wave of protests and demonstrations , some of them violent and destructive of private property , and by the heightened sense of insecurity springing from an increase in threats and acts of intimidation , and by the spates of armed crime , acts of violence and assassinations or attempted assassinations , some of them possibly politically motivated .  
The wording as it stood was unfortunate as it included no mention of compensation for expropriation , which in France was determined , after the administrative phase of the expropriation procedure had been carried out , in special court proceedings and subject to constitutional constraints whereby the judge was the guarantor of respect for private property rights .

Globalization , diversification of forms of migration , the declining role of State leadership in migration , decrease of State _ organized migration as compared to spontaneous migration , increase in temporary migration , growth of private recruitment agencies , increase in irregular migration , trade in human beings and - what is very important - feminization of migration have substantially changed the context of contemporary migration .  
The pursuit of sound , growth-oriented macroeconomic policies , moreover , needs to be complemented by a general social , legal and political environment conducive to the efficient functioning of markets and , in particular , to the development of the private sector , whose investment decisions are at the centre of growth .  
UNCTADs work should therefore be guided by a dual effort at integration and collaboration : integration of its analytical , normative and technical cooperation work , and collaboration with other development-related international organizations , as well as with civil society and the private business sector .

Furthermore , participants in the conference considered that the current and future international trade agenda , such as the upcoming negotiations on trade in services , was of crucial importance for the partnership between the public and private sectors in both originating and destination countries .  
The Commission had subsequently identified four areas for future analytical work and expert meetings : ( a ) the respective roles of government and the private sector and the interactions between them in SME development ; ( b ) inter-firm cooperation ; ( c ) SME clustering and networking ; and ( d ) the provision of sustainable financial and non-financial services for SME development .  
Uncertainty about future developments in the international economy has grown in the aftermath of the global financial crisis , which demonstrated the volatility of international private capital flows and its damaging effects on levels of economic activity and peoples livelihoods in developing countries .  
The former , with inconvertible local currencies and relatively low foreign private capital inflows , proved less vulnerable to the effects of the crisis .  
In this regard , it stressed that the current forms of cooperation involving the public and private sectors of developing countries should be built upon and expanded , and also stressed the importance of identifying barriers and restrictions to the transfer of publicly and privately owned technologies .

The new approach stresses the need for better integrated ( or comprehensive ) technical cooperation programmes , regular dialogue with key stakeholders in the countries , especially those in the private sector , and stronger partnership among United Nations agencies and donor agencies to promote private sector-led industrial development and good corporate governance through interactive policy formulation and implementation .  
Further , additional financial resources will be decentralized to country offices to provide greater flexibility in providing short advisory services to member States and to facilitate regular public and private sector policy dialogue .

UNCTAD should do analytical work and provide a forum for exchanges of experiences at intergovernmental and at expert level on the formulation of policies favourable to the development of the private sector at local , national and regional levels .  
Analytical work should be carried out on the establishment of a legal and regulatory framework conducive to the development of the private sector and favourable to FDI and to domestic investment and the development of local expertise as well as regional networks .  
A comprehensive approach was needed in addressing Africa 's structural constraints , including its weak infrastructure and high transport costs , which continued to undermine the expected gains from economic reforms , making it difficult to attract adequate foreign private investment .  
Norwegian support of private sector development in developing countries was aimed at increasing income for individuals , providing jobs for poor groups , and raising tax revenues so as to create the necessary economic base for a rise in domestic investment .  
She emphasized that the Conference would involve a comprehensive and extensive preparatory process at the country level which should involve ministerial departments and representatives of civil society , the private sector and local government .  
There were four principal means of financing infrastructure development : ( i ) development finance institutions ; ( ii ) the private sector ; ( iii ) government ; and ( iv ) private-public partnerships ( PPPs ) and community private-public partnerships ( CPPPs ) , which incorporate joint projects between the private and the public sector , with just a portion of the financing provided by the public sector .  
The Asian financial crisis has accelerated initiatives to improve the timeliness and quality of information concerning key macroeconomic variables as well as the financial reporting of banks and non-financial firms . 8 These are viewed as essential for better decision-taking by private lenders and investors , greater market discipline over policy makers , more effective policy surveillance by multilateral financial institutions , and strengthened financial regulation and supervision . 
The failure of IMF surveillance in preventing international financial crises reflects , in part , belated , and so far only partial , adaptation of existing procedures to the problems posed by the large autonomous private capital flows ; but perhaps more fundamentally that failure is due to the unbalanced nature of these procedures , which give too little recognition to the disproportionately large global impact of monetary policies in a small minority of OECD countries .  
Encourages the Secretary-General to make efforts to promote public awareness activities in all Member States , with the support of international , regional and national institutions , both public and private , regarding the strategic importance of the Global Renewable Energy Education and Training Programme 1996-2005 in attaining the objective of sustainable development ;  
His Government was convinced that development required , at the national level , the development of sound economic policy , respect for the rule of law , promotion of the private sector , accountability and transparency in public affairs .  
Conditions which might assist developing countries in addressing poverty issues at the macroeconomic , institutional and policy levels were , respectively , globalization ; the awareness-building role of civil society and the role of the private sector , particularly in creating jobs and spurring rapid economic growth ; and the achievement of a balance between the economic and financial aspects of development and social , cultural and institutional concerns .  
The problem needed to be addressed nationally , by supporting the private and informal sectors , promoting self-employment , providing credit facilities to the unemployed , encouraging the creation of volunteer organizations and investing in training programmes ; internationally , by dismantling trade barriers , ensuring adequate capital flows to developing nations , encouraging technology transfer , alleviating the debt burden and sharing experiences .  
One view was that the application of chapter V should only supplement the substantive law provisions of the draft Convention and thus apply only to the transactions falling within the ambit of the draft Convention as defined in chapter I . In support of that view , it was stated that , from a legislative policy point of view , it would not be appropriate to attempt , in essence , to prepare a mini private international law convention within a substantive law convention . 
In addition , it was pointed out that draft article 27 could be deleted , since it addressed the contractual aspects of assignment , namely a matter which was not the main focus of the draft Convention and might already be sufficiently regulated by private international law ( even though the principle of freedom of choice of the applicable law might not be common to all legal systems ) .  
It had also urged Governments and the private sector to increase their support for developing an adequate science and technology capacity through appropriate education and research programmes as an indispensable foundation for economic , social , cultural and environmentally sound development .  
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources , will also be required ;  
Further recognizing the continuing need for the international community to extend technical and other support , including , inter alia , enhanced official development assistance , investment guarantees , debt-for-industrial-development swaps and enhanced market access to enable the continent to leverage domestic and international resources and investment to take advantage of the increasing role of the private sector ,  
Mr . Rao ( Observer for the World Intellectual Property Organization ( WIPO ) ) said that the objectives of the Decade were close to the nature and functions of WIPO , which was not only the international secretariat for existing treaty bodies relating to intellectual property but was also unique in that it provided direct access to private innovators and industry for the registration of patents , trademarks and industrial designs for the purpose of international recognition .  
Welcoming the efforts of the United Nations system to facilitate the active and constructive involvement of the private sector in the development process , and recognizing the importance of the global compact on human rights , labour , environment , proposed by the Secretary-General on 31 January 1999 at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum held in Davos , Switzerland ,  
Encourages multilateral institutions , Governments and the private sector , including corporations engaged in international activities , to strengthen partnerships to advance sustainable development through , inter alia , supporting the stable functioning of the international finance and trade system and investment flows ;  
Mr . Leiro ( Norway ) said that the assumption that globalization benefited everyone had yet to be proven ; the gap between rich and poor was growing both within and between nations and many poor countries attracted minimal foreign investment , lacked a dynamic private sector and were often deprived of the benefits of increased export earnings by heavy debt burdens and limited market access . 
Given the difficult financial situations faced by many Member States , however , he called on UNRWA to explore creative measures to alleviate its financial difficulties through alternative sources of income such as contributions from the private sector and expanded joint programmes with international organizations .  
Stressing the importance of the provision of adequate financial resources for the development of developing countries , including through public and private financial flows , international trade , official development assistance and debt relief , and that the comprehensive and integrated consideration of these issues should constitute a very important element of the dialogue and collaboration between the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions ,  
Deeply concerned at the continuing decline in official development assistance , which is a significant external source of financing for development and an important support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Mindful of the need that the benefits of the increasing integration of global markets should be extended to all nations and peoples , in particular to the developing countries , especially the least developed among them , that in spite of the important role of private capital flows for promoting economic development they are not evenly distributed , and that for the majority of developing countries they are unavailable or inadequate ,  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
The above law is applicable both to the public and private sectors , and , apart from defining the concept of indirect discrimination , it establishes that discriminatory practices occur when there is a considerable disproportion between the number of male and female workers .  
In spite of having a generic application , once the decree is applied , to both self-employed workers as well as to dependent ones , in both the public and private sectors , it will ensure the adoption of complementary legislation for certain groups of workers sensitive to specific risks , namely pregnant women .  
To intensify the growing involvement and cooperation between entities , public and private , at both local and regional levels , to best explore the available resources , aiming for an easier professional re-integration of women in regular jobs , and / or in income generating work and increasing their participation in local and regional development ;  
There were several reported attempts to disrupt the activities of emerging or newly constituted groups , the most egregious example of which was the disruption by pro-Aristide demonstrators of a rally , on 28 May 1999 , organized by the private sector and supported by a wide spectrum of civil society organizations and political parties to protest mounting insecurity and what they termed anarchy .  
The Government , in cooperation with the private sector , had also sought to provide shelter and rehabilitative services to girls who had been sexually abused , and a national plan of action against the commercial sexual exploitation of children was being developed .  
Such low-income countries find considerable difficulty in attracting private foreign investment or loans from commercial banks , while loans from the international financial institutions have generally been concentrated in the larger countries .  
First were matters relating to the macroeconomic management of the world economy : institution of more effective macroeconomic coordination and of improved monitoring and surveillance of international financial flows , arrangements for quicker response to crises , and ending of a system where the private sector was too readily rescued from the risks attendant on its own imprudence .  
In their discussions with the Special Rapporteur , government officials , private individuals and members of non-governmental organizations generally agreed that there had been a gradual change in the attitude of some of the government actors , from the federal to the municipal level , who were now more inclined towards improving the overall human rights performance of public institutions and agencies .  
The Special Rapporteur notes that the civil society , including NGOs , the media and private individuals , has often been instrumental in pressing the competent authorities to launch inquiries into incidents of extrajudicial killings or to reopen investigations into cases already considered closed .  
Calls upon the international community to consider supporting the creation of special economic zones and development corridors in the Community , with the active participation of the private sector , while recognizing the responsibilities and the ongoing efforts of the countries concerned to create the necessary environment , including the appropriate legal and economic framework for such activities ;  
Notes with appreciation that some affected developing countries and one region have adopted their national and regional action programmes , and therefore calls upon the international community to contribute to the implementation of those programmes through , inter alia , the conclusion of partnership agreements , relevant bilateral and multilateral cooperation programmes that are available to implement the Convention and contributions from non-governmental organizations and the private sector ;  
The EU stresses its concern at the use of diamonds , gold and other resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to fund military operations in the region , and calls on all the parties to ensure that all commercial dealings of this nature are legal under the relevant domestic and international law , transparent , consistent with States ' arrangements with the international financing institutions , and benefit the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and not private individuals .  
Calls upon all Governments and all relevant United Nations organizations and multilateral and regional financial institutions to consider increasing allocations of financial resources for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries , and to strengthen funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Calls upon the international community to consider supporting the creation of special economic zones and development corridors in the Community , with the active participation of the private sector , while recognizing the responsibilities and the ongoing efforts of the countries concerned to create the necessary environment , including the appropriate legal and economic framework for such activities ;  
Encourages Governments , multilateral institutions and the private sector , including corporations engaged in international business activities , to strengthen partnerships to advance sustainable development through , inter alia , supporting the stable functioning of the international finance and trade system and investment flows , particularly in support of the development efforts of developing countries , as well as countries with economies in transition ;  
Urges the private sector , including corporations engaged in international business activities , to conduct orderly and fair business practices while adhering to and promoting the principles of honesty , transparency and accountability in international commercial transactions with a view to contributing to efforts to create an enabling environment for business and investment ;  
Notes with appreciation that some affected developing countries and one region have adopted their national and regional action programmes , and therefore calls upon the international community to contribute to the implementation of those programmes through , inter alia , the conclusion of partnership agreements , relevant bilateral and multilateral cooperation programmes that are available to implement the Convention and contributions from non-governmental organizations and the private sector ;  
Encourages the Secretary-General to make efforts to promote public awareness activities in all Member States , with the support of international , regional and national institutions , both public and private , regarding the strategic importance of the Global Renewable Energy Education and Training Programme 1996-2005 in attaining the objective of sustainable development ;  
The establishment or maintenance of private educational institutions , if the object of the institutions is not to secure the exclusion of any group but to provide educational facilities in addition to those provided by the public authorities , if the institutions are conducted in accordance with that object , and if the education provided conforms with such standards as may be laid down or approved by the competent authorities , in particular for education of the same level .  
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular least developed countries to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Underlines the importance that sovereign risk assessments made by private sector agencies be based on objective and transparent parameters , and in this regard invites the relevant national , regional and international regulatory bodies to contribute to the development of appropriate standards to ensure that risk-assessment agencies provide complete and accurate information on a timely and regular basis ;  
Global financial integration had helped generate strong private capital flows to some developing countries , but had also posed enormous challenges to national financial and banking systems in terms of ensuring the sustainability of those flows .  
Therefore , private investors , national and foreign , bringing new or advanced technology into the host country or developing original solutions will need to be assured that their intellectual property rights will be protected and that they will be able to enforce those rights against infringements , which may require the enactment of criminal law provisions designed to combat infringements of intellectual property rights .  
For this reason , countries with a well established tradition of private participation in infrastructure projects have developed a series of control mechanisms and remedies to protect government contractors against arbitrary or improper acts by public authorities , such as access to impartial dispute settlement bodies and full compensation schemes for governmental wrongdoing .  
It should be remembered that the national legislation of most countries established regimes of absolute liability for the cases covered by the draft articles , in other words for acts which were lawful but dangerous , which were tolerated because they had beneficial effects for society as a whole , even if they could in fact cause damage to private persons .  
Stressing the importance of the provision of adequate financial resources for the development of developing countries , including through public and private financial flows , international trade , official development assistance and debt relief , and that the comprehensive and integrated consideration of these issues should constitute a very important element of the dialogue and collaboration between the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions ,

Encourages multilateral institutions , Governments and the private sector , including corporations engaged in international activities , to strengthen partnerships to advance sustainable development through , inter alia , supporting the stable functioning of the international finance and trade system and investment flows ;  
Encourages Governments , multilateral institutions and the private sector , including corporations engaged in international business activities , to strengthen partnerships so as to advance sustainable development through , inter alia , supporting the stable functioning of the international finance and trade system and investment flows , particularly in support of the development efforts of developing countries , as well as countries with economies in transition ;  
Urges the private sector , including corporations engaged in international business activities , to conduct orderly and fair business practices while adhering to and promoting the principles of honesty , transparency and accountability in international commercial transactions , with a view to contributing to efforts to create an enabling environment for business and investment ;  
The total cost of crime to communities ( in terms of criminal justice , lost property , shattered lives and private security ) , measured as a proportion of gross domestic product , is several times greater in developing countries than in developed countries .  
According to the information received by the Special Rapporteur and the observations he has made during his various missions , mercenary activities continue to be carried on both through traditional means of recruitment and hiring and in new forms , including recruitment by private companies offering military security services , which take part in armed conflicts in specific countries by virtue of contracts signed with Governments .  
Significantly , the Genocide Convention makes individuals liable to prosecution whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers , public officials or private individuals and it envisages the establishment of international mechanisms to enforce individual criminal responsibility for major human rights violations .  
Internal enabling environment : policy framework incentives for domestic private savings , equitable tax systems ( development and enforcement of ) , macroeconomic policies , disincentives to corruption ; good governance ; transparency ; effective regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector ; banking infrastructure , pension funds ; corporate governance ; internationally accepted accounting standards , and a sound legal system ( land and property rights ) ;  
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) : need to spread FDI more widely and to diversify private capital flows in order to reduce country sector concentration , strengthened contribution of FDI for domestic capacity-building and national development goals , role of South-South flows , reasons for marginalization of countries with a sound investment environment ;  
Use of ODA for reinforcing developing countries potential for better access to global markets , and poverty eradication , leveraging larger levels of domestic or foreign private capital ;  
Need to tackle , where appropriate , bilateral , official , multilateral and private debt ( criteria for assessing extent of debt relief ) ; special issues of least developed countries Africa heavily indebted poor countries ; debt relief to provide lasting exit from debt problems , forgiving aid-related bilateral debt for least developed countries , need to improve creditworthiness , and the reduction of spreads in new lending ) ;  
The Report estimates that developing countries have lost four times as much due to the protectionism of developed countries as they have received through private capital inflows a key negative equation considering that trade earnings are much needed incomes to back production and employment , while capital inflows are monies to be repaid with interest .  
While international assistance and debt relief are clearly important , their positive effects depend on sound national efforts towards economic and structural reform and good governance , under which the private sector and civil society are able to play productive roles .  
Adopted in 1997 , after broad discussions with decentralized communities , civil society , the private sector and donors , this programme aims to improve the living conditions of the poorest population by increasing the income of the poor through the promotion of micro-enterprises and income-generating activities ; improving provision to meet basic social needs ; and establishing a permanent follow-up system on household living conditions .  
Mr . Savimbi is still interested in continuing his destabilizating process of preventing the smooth running of democratic institutions ; destroying cities , towns , villages , infrastructure and public and private assets ; and mercilessly killing civilians , thereby condemning all the people of Angola to misery , disease and famine .  
Today , as we look back , we can see that what we have achieved in Mongolia over the past decade in building the institutions of democracy , promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms , unleashing private initiative and developing our external relations has constituted a major advance towards a self-governing democratic society , a private-sector-led economy and a closer association with the rest of the international community .  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .  
In this regard , I am making an earnest appeal to donor States , multilateral institutions and the private sector to support Zambia and other developing States in their efforts to eradicate poverty by direct investment and cancellation of debt , and by ensuring that structural adjustment programmes are humane and responsive to social and environmental concerns .  
Notwithstanding historical and cultural traditions , by which elderly people have always been greatly respected , the improvement of their standard of living requires ongoing political efforts to mobilize and utilize available resources in the context of families , communities , civil organizations and the private sector .  
Taking into account the dependency of small island developing States on conventional energy sources , there is a need for mobilization of resources from all sources , including from the private sector , for the provision of technical , financial and technological assistance , as appropriate , to small island developing States , to encourage energy efficiency , and to accelerate and maximize the development and utilization of environmentally sound renewable energy sources .  
Particular attention will be required to coordinate eco-tourism ventures at the regional level , and to facilitate the sharing of information and experiences and the integration of the private sector within official development assistance supported eco-tourism projects .  
Encourages non-governmental organizations , private funding institutions and individual donors to organize and support assistance programmes and missions tailored to the needs of areas where psychological psychiatric problems are prevalent among the population , in particular among poor urban and rural women , with a view to providing not only primary treatment but also training for family members and or other persons who may take over the care of the afflicted persons ;  
Invites concerned non-governmental organizations , funding sources and the private sector , in coordination with national authorities concerned , to support and develop a programme that will bring a wide range of expertise and proven interventions , including alternative community-based services , to the training of local community workers , teachers and primary health care staff and to provide appropriate interventions for stress-related disorders to girls and women in crisis ;  
Engage industries and economic sectors , in both public and private sectors , and all other major groups at the national and international levels , as appropriate , in activities relating to sustainable consumption and production with the objective of developing optimal strategies and or programmes , including targets and timetables , at the appropriate levels for more sustainable consumption and production , including cleaner production and affordable eco-efficiency .  
Governments at all levels , the private sector and other major groups as defined in Agenda 21 are urged to cooperate in developing waste collection systems and disposal facilities , and developing programmes for prevention , minimization and recycling of waste , to safeguard and improve the quality of life in human settlements and coastal regions in all countries , especially in developing countries .  
Innovative and new approaches for financing development of sustainable energy , including renewable sources of energy is required and essential while continuing to pursue efforts to increase official development assistance , ensure continued replenishment of the Global Environmental Facility and encourage domestic and foreign private investments .  
The promotion of educational and information programmes designed to enhance awareness and understanding of economic , social and cultural rights , both within the population at large and among particular groups such as the public service , the judiciary , the private sector and the labour movement ;  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .  
In moving towards a world in which the benefits of scientific and technological change are spread more widely across society , public and private institutions will increasingly be called upon to motivate and interact with a larger and more diverse number of actors than in the past , for the process of innovation is interactive and system-wide .  
The services provided are the usual postal services for private or official delegation mailings , including parcel post , air mail , registered and insured mail , international and domestic money orders , information about postage rates and regulations concerning entry or dispatch of parcels to and from various countries .  
Calls upon all countries to develop economic policies that promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , 6 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and the Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Accordingly , Moroccos health policy addresses five main concerns : a ) more effective mobilization and use of resources ; b ) the building of a new relationship between the public and private sectors regarding health matters ; c ) streamlined management and regulation of the overall health care system ; d ) improved services with control of spending ; and e ) participation by local communities .  
These consultative bodies , comprising representatives of all the social partners concerned ( local communities , cultural associations and unions , private and banking sector , personalities from the arts and literature , etc . ) , constitute a genuine forum for debating cultural policy and determining the direction and priorities of cultural actions . 
In order to ensure the creation of the necessary framework conducive to foreign investment and to private sector participation in maritime transport , it is essential to harmonize regulatory instruments at least at the regional level , and to exploit existing opportunities for cooperation which could enable both local and foreign operators to access maritime markets more easily and ensure the competitiveness of small island developing States operators .  
The European Union firmly supported that project , which combined elements of public and private law and reflected in a balanced way the different existing legal systems .  
This Council includes representatives of diverse educational constituencies , formal and informal , public and private , higher and secondary , and primary .  
Hiring private companies providing security and military assistance and advice is no substitute for maintaining a collective regional security system and genuinely professional national armed forces and security forces loyal to the democratic legal order.It is a false solution . 
In the previous report he submitted to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ fourth session ( E CN . 4-1998-31 ) , the Special Rapporteur dealt fully with private companies operating in the international market offering security services and military assistance and advice , normally matters reserved for the State and for which the State must assume responsibility .  
Specifically , it is neither lawful nor advisable , no matter how often short _ term or emergency reasons are invoked , to entrust a country ' s security and the speedy settlement of armed conflicts to private companies which hire mercenaries to achieve those objectives and will earn substantial economic profits for their participation .  
The Guidelines follow three broad and interconnected approaches , namely ( a ) improvement of governmental capacity for acknowledging the Governments responsibility for multisectoral coordination ; ( b ) widespread reform of laws and legal support services with a focus on the status of women , children and vulnerable groups ; and ( c ) support for increased private sector and community participation in the response to HIV AIDS .  
Guideline 5 encourages States to enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws to protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors ; ensure privacy and confidentiality ; ensure ethics in research involving human subjects ; and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies when the laws are breached .  
Therefore , the public sector can play a catalytic role by helping to promote stable and profitable housing finance systems , the introduction of new products that satisfactorily meet demand , the introduction and adoption of banking regulations and , most of all , by promoting a housing policy model that takes the long-term view and that is based on a partnership between the public and private sectors .  
The resumption of dialogue with the international financial institutions and with private and official bilateral partners could enable these objectives to be met through the sound macroeconomic policies to which the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is committed .  
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular least developed countries , to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Regretting that the current crisis in financial markets , characterized , inter alia , by massive and sudden outflows of capital from the affected countries and the sharp decline in private capital flows to developing countries and some economies in transition , has resulted in higher interest rate spreads , leading to a significant slowdown in economic activity ,  
Also stresses the need to strengthen international and national financial systems through a more effective national , regional and international surveillance of both the public and private sectors , based upon the improvement of the availability and transparency of information , as well as the strengthening of the role of the International Monetary Fund in this regard , and the collaboration of the World Bank with technical assistance and capacity-building in this matter ;  
Calls upon the international community to pursue national and international efforts , at the intergovernmental and inter-agency levels , to contribute to minimizing the excessive volatility of global financial flows and to distribute in a more equitable manner the costs of systemic adjustments between the public and private sectors ;  
Building adequate manpower with the requisite level of skill for effective integrated island management ; small island developing States should assess their training needs and develop a training programme , involving the private sector , non-governmental organizations and Governments ; training should not be limited to technical experts ; it should include local communities , for example , fishermen , tourist hotel operators , managers of industries located in coastal regions and farmers ;  
The framework law should include provisions on its purpose ; the targets or goals to be achieved and the time _ frame to be set for the achievement of those targets ; the means by which the purpose could be achieved described in broad terms , in particular the intended collaboration with civil society and the private sector and with international organizations ; institutional responsibility for the process ; and the national mechanisms for its monitoring .  
Moreover , the increasing participation of local communities in tourism development has encouraged modern structures of public administration as well as the sharing of joint responsibilities between public institutions and the private sector .  
As the Special Rapporteur has pointed out , rape as the ultimate violent and degrading act of sexual violence , constitutes an intrusion into the most private and intimate parts of a womans body , as well as an assault on the core of her self . 11 While rape commonly occurs as a manifestation of extreme sexual violence against individual women , rape is increasingly used as a weapon of war , political repression , or ethnic cleansing . 
Besides being sometimes needed to satisfy national constitutional and other requirements , the enactment of express legislative authorization may be an important measure to foster the confidence of potential investors , national or foreign , in a national policy to promote private sector investment in infrastructure .  
Development of sustainable local services and national and international support measures including financial and non-financial services , human resource development , access to information and an assessment of access to technologies , to improve and promote the role and capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries within the framework of a dialogue between the private and the public sector .  
They included the complementary roles played by a number of agents at the macro , meso and micro levels , and the need to create constructive linkages between the public and private sectors .  
To try to make this topic the private domain of the nuclear Powers thus excluding the vast majority of States from the multilateral negotiations necessary in order to attain nuclear disarmament in a time-bound framework and under strict international control would only delay further the legitimate aspirations of mankind to live in a nuclear-weapon-free world .  
Noting also , in this context , the increasing significance of official development assistance as an external resource for many developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , in the light of reduced private flows , and further that the overall declining trend in official development assistance is a cause for concern ,  
This can be achieved through direct government policies , joint ventures with local private initiatives , and foreign investment from regional and international public and private banks .  
The circulation of press organs is not authorized , permission is not given for the functioning of new non _ governmental human rights organizations , which have been waiting for years to be recognized , the movements of the population within the country are controlled by military checkpoints , there is oppressive supervision of all private activity and in practice political dissent is viewed almost as a crime , particularly by the peripheral authorities of the mainland region .  
States Parties shall consider collecting and exchanging information with respect to registered legal persons and the physical persons involved in their creation , direction and funding , with a view to preventing the penetration of organized crime in the public and legitimate private sector .  
In 1995 , a Rural Division was created within the National Office for Womens Affairs to ensure that the Ministry of Agriculture and its affiliated offices , decentralized agencies and other public and private entities associated with rural womens issues incorporate measures and actions guaranteeing equal opportunity for rural women into their planning and regular activities .  
The promotion of educational and information programmes designed to enhance awareness and understanding of economic , social and cultural rights both within the population at large and among particular groups such as the public service , the judiciary , the private sector and the labour movement ;  
The aim of the Union continues to be to promote , coordinate and develop at the international level the role of the notary as a technical and legal expert who ensures impartiality in private contractual relations , with the ultimate aim of forestalling and preventing controversies and conflicts .  
an increased commitment by Governments at the national and local levels , and their partners in civil society , to guide public and private investments for the provision of adequate shelter , basic infrastructure and services ;  
At the start of the millennium , the growing concerns in the region for the environmental dimension of development will centre on the increasing demand for natural resources , the dominant role of the private sector in the development of such resources and the management of service concessions , the problems caused by pollution and land use and the need to comply with multilateral agreements on the environment , particularly under Agenda 21 , and international agreements on specific issues .  
Other users will include public and private agencies and bodies responsible for the design , execution and administration of programmes , policies and projects dealing with population-related issues and national , regional and local bureaux concerned with economic and social development .  
Other users will be business associations , labour organizations and technical and professional institutions connected with production sectors , universities , research centres , regional and subregional integration bodies and other public and private entities that require comparable information on the countries of the region , including experts working with UNDP and other United Nations bodies responsible for drafting reports and implementing technical cooperation projects .  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development _ oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily _ indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
Where BDS are strategically important but not yet adapted to local needs , joint efforts by public and private institutions have proven effective institutional responses .  
There are also few successful examples of DFIs that have proven able to operate profitably with SMEs - among these , the Corporaci \ n Andina de Fomento ( CAF ) , a private multilateral financial institution which promotes sustainable development and regional integration by attracting capital resources for the provision of multiple financial services to the public and private sectors of the shareholding countries . 
The key elements of the infrastructure are the databases and developing databases for different purposes and users ( private , public , scientific and government ) is the major task to be accomplished in a systematic development of infrastructure .  
Operations approved in 1999 reflect the planned shift in emphasis from emergency reconstruction to ensuring the sustainability of economic institutions and sound macroeconomic management , as well as the medium - to longer-term viability of policies aimed at stimulating private investment , banking reform and privatization .  
While the active contribution of national authorities and the United Nations system was vital for a successful implementation of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action and the New Directions Strategy , the involvement of the private sector and of non-governmental organizations was indispensable in fostering a viable business sector in the developing countries .  
Governments , with the increased participation of the United Nations system , civil society , donors and the private sector , are urged to pursue the research and development of new , safe , low-cost and effective family-planning and contraceptive methods , for both men and women , including female-controlled methods that both protect against sexually transmitted diseases , including HIV AIDS , and prevent unwanted pregnancy .  
The private sector may assist the efforts of Governments , but it can not substitute for the Governments responsibility to ensure and provide quality , full , safe , accessible , affordable and convenient health services , including reproductive health , family planning and sexual health services .  
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources , will also be required ;  
UNISPACE III had been the first global conference of the United Nations in which industry and civil society had participated as full partners of governments , reflecting the increasing economic use of outer space and the rapidly growing importance of private companies in that area as well as the heightened interest of citizens in matters relating to outer space .  
The Conference had taken stock of developments in space science and applications , explored new areas of cooperation , considered the changing economic and political environment which offered new opportunities for international cooperation and studied the constraints and issues faced by developing countries in building national capacities to benefit from space technology as well as ways to involve the private sector more closely in the process .  
Calls upon all Governments , and all relevant United Nations organizations , and multilateral and regional financial institutions to consider increasing allocations of financial resources for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries , and to strengthen funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Consideration of development financing should include the topics of ODA , primary commodity export profits and external debt , which should be addressed through genuine economic cooperation on the basis of international partnership and solidarity and of private capital flows , including foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , for financing trade and innovative sources of funding .  
Without a shared sense of social responsibility and urgency , little progress would be achieved ; on the other hand , the considerable financial , technological and information resources of the private sector , if applied with a sense of social responsibility , could contribute to the cause of human rights .  
Among the general factors are significant technological innovations ; high indebtedness and stringent budget constraints limiting the public sectors ability to meet increasing infrastructure needs ; the expansion of international and local capital markets , with a consequent improvement in access to private funding ; and an increasing number of successful international experiences with private participation and competition in infrastructure .  
For that purpose , the Guide helps identify areas of law that are typically most relevant to private capital investment in public infrastructure projects and discusses the content of those laws which would be conducive to attracting private capital , national and foreign.The Guide is not intended to provide advice on drafting agreements for the execution of privately financed infrastructure projects .  
In cases where public ownership and control is desired , direct private financing as well as infrastructure operation under commercial principles may be achieved by establishing a separate legal entity controlled by the Government to own and operate the project .  
Where the facility is operated pursuant to a governmental licence , private ownership of physical assets ( e.g . a telecommunication network ) is often separable from the licence to provide the service to the public ( e.g . long-distance telephone services ) , in that the licence can be withdrawn by the competent public authority under certain circumstances .  
In addition to loans and guarantees extended by commercial banks and national or multilateral public financial institutions , in a number of cases public funds have been combined with private capital for financing new projects.Such public funds may originate from government income or sovereign borrowing .  
While rules of private international law often allow considerable freedom to choose the law governing commercial contracts , that freedom is in some countries restricted for contracts and legal relationships that are not qualified as commercial , such as , for instance , certain contracts entered into by public authorities of the host country ( for example , guarantees and assurances by the Government , power purchase or fuel supply commitments by a public authority ) or contracts with consumers .  
Market liberalization has led to spectacular , if not always consistent , growth , but it has also led to greater inequality and polarization within and among societies ; some regions have been mostly overlooked by private capital , and in all regions the swift withdrawal of investor confidence can lead to economic collapse and social distress .  
The extent to which an effective mix of public and private contributions can provide optimal development and equitable well-being is also subject to forces of the global economy and the support of the international community .  
Achieving an efficient system of services may require innovative modes of provision that entail an adequate mix of public , private and non-profit participation and mobilizing new resources from the supply side ; basic social services should be financed through taxation , not user fees , which , in many cases , never revert to the facilities for which they were intended ;  
The drop in aid contributions , especially the continuing decline in the share of net official development assistance in the gross domestic product of donor countries , had led to increased reliance on private loans on the international capital market .  
Corruption in both the public sector and the private sector , regardless of the level at which it occurs , can jeopardize free trade , distort competitiveness and undermine the stability upon which the free market system is based . 12 Companies may resort to bribery as a means of bypassing existing trade barriers or reducing national tariffs and expediting international trade .  
It is a paradox that some rich countries have such lax laws that they provide safe havens and encourage private banks to launder illicit funds looted by corrupt persons from poor countries by facilitating the establishment of secret accounts .  
As we are aware , the financial situation of the continent is characterized by an enormous external debt , stagnant national savings , as well as declining official development assistance and weak private capital flows .  
This draft resolution points out that stable and accountable governance is essential for economic development , and it recognizes the importance of private capital , particularly foreign direct investment , in development financing .  
Since most answers to environmental problems financial , technological and managerial lay with the private sector , the traditional focus on the intergovernmental process was no longer sufficient .  
For many developing countries , in particular countries that are unable to attract sufficient external private capital resources , it is essential that Governments undertake greater efforts to promote the mobilization of domestic sources of capital .  
The precise death toll from political violence in 1999 , and particularly the large scale and systematic destruction of private and public property after the results of the popular consultations were announced on 4 September , remains unknown .

It is essential to focus on creating an economic environment at the global and the national level that is conducive to longterm investment in productive capacity by both indigenous and foreign private investors .  
Governments call upon United Nations organizations , NGOs , the private sector and relevant civil society organizations to show strong political will and commitment to human development and direct investments to these critical areas .  
A third part is the increasingly large and unpredictable private capital flows across national boundaries that have substantially reduced the leverage of Governments , particularly of developing countries , in controlling their economic fate .  
The decrease in official development assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , must be reversed , especially when it was not compensated for by major flows of private capital .  
To promote the mobilization of domestic financial resources and to establish the basis for an enabling environment through , inter alia , a sound macroeconomic framework , a dynamic private sector , improved governance , and participatory development ;  
In an encouraging trend , rising awareness in the corporate sector of the need to address social development concerns is leading to enhanced cooperation between public and private sectors .  
Governments need to develop a suitable legal and institutional environment to facilitate active partnerships with the private sector in a manner that ensures the provision of services to the urban and rural poor .  
Forest valuation should reflect the social , cultural , economic and ecological context and consider values that are important to local and / or indigenous communities , private forest owners , gender aspects , and distributional impacts .  
How societies , through individual and collective efforts , both public and private , will respond to the challenges posed by these developments will also be crucial in shaping the future .

It was imperative that all governmental , public and private organizations concerned with human , social and economic development recognized community safety as a fundamental right , and that they integrated crime prevention into their mandates and activities .  
Reference should be made , for instance , to how the legal and institutional frameworks are geared to supporting or hindering private domestic and foreign investments .  
Enabling policies and programmes at the national and local level are to be implemented that assist the efforts of the private and nongovernmental sectors , and the selfhelp efforts of poor residents in urban and rural areas , to improve shelter conditions .  
With the increased flow of private capital for energy financing to the developing countries , the multilateral institutions have focused more on technical , policy and institutional assistance than on direct lending in the liberalized energy market .  
An institutional focal point at the national level , with its counterparts at decentralized levels , enables a country to evolve a coherent and coordinated approach with the involvement of relevant entities in the public and private sectors , and with NGOs .  
Effective and meaningful collaborative efforts are required , involving Governments , multilateral development institutions , bilateral donors , the private sector , civil society and other relevant stakeholders , to enhance the developmental impact of ICT .  
In the light of low and unstable export earnings , limited access to private financial flows , small domestic savings and the serious debt problems experienced by these countries , ODA remains a critical source of their development finance .  
It was imperative that all governmental , public and private organizations concerned with human , social and economic development recognize community safety as a fundamental right and that they integrate crime prevention into their mandates and activities .  
A major concrete aim is to mobilize additional governmental and private resources , including professional knowledge , and financial and human resources , to address key rights issues for children and women .  
In order to enhance efficiency and to establish a collaborative relationship for social development between the public and private sectors , bold structural adjustments and regulatory reforms have been implemented .  
With regard to public and private resources , we are currently developing a mixed welfareState model that gives public support in the form of financial relief and special subsidies and the like to private institutions providing social services .  
First , rapidly rising income would allow domestic savings to rise , thereby increasing the amount of total investable resources ; and secondly , sustained growth would attract private capital as a substitute for official financing .  
The level and share of gross capital formation have grown in recent years , reflecting the unabated boom in private residential construction activity since 1994 .  
According to WHO , publicly funded medical care is approximately one third to one fourth the size of private medical care in terms of financing , clearly indicating wide inequality of access to adequate health care , both preventive and curative . 
In this regard , it recommended that creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions be encouraged to consider continuing the initiative and efforts to address commercial debt of heavily indebted African countries .  
Since the 1980s , as part of the continuing freemarket reform of the regions economies , universal social service coverage had been cut back , the role of the public sector reduced and participation by the private sector encouraged .  
The United States representative noted that rapid growth in international private investment , lending and trade meant that private capital flows now exceeded ODA as the foremost source of external capital available to developing countries generally . 
It was therefore urgent that LDCs and the international community be encouraged to foster private entrepreneurship , create a domestic environment conducive to foreign investment and expand trade internally , regionally and to the world at large .  
Past experience had shown that developing countries which pursued policies encouraging private investment , trade , and entrepreneurship , along with appropriate social investment , had achieved remarkable economic growth in a short span of time .  
The majority of developing countries were unable to attract external private capital ; their share in world trade had continued to decline , contributing to low levels of development and inadequate infrastructure .  
Lastly , he stressed the importance of moving beyond the NorthSouth divide and developing partnerships with key nongovernmental actors in globalization , including international economic institutions , the private sector and civil society .  
Flows of private capital to certain developing countries must not be counted as contributions towards sustainable development , as the main driving force behind them was the profit motive , and not the wellbeing of future generations .  
Despite the modest growth achieved by many heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPCs ) , debt restructuring continued to pose problems , and those countries remained exposed to the adverse developments in commodity prices , interest rates and private capital flows .  
Regarding commercial debt of LDCs , orderly and equitable workout procedures should be established , with explicit responsibilities of creditors and debtors and clearly defined roles for the public and private sectors .  
The Minister defined the key objective of the Government as fighting poverty and improving the living conditions of the population by developing strong partnerships with the private sector , civil society and the donor community .  
This requires an environment conducive to private savings , the consolidation of public finances , efficient and effective mechanisms for the allocation of public expenditure , and adequate room for private initiative in short , sound macroeconomic policies .  
The view was expressed that there is the need for developing countries to successfully manage the flows of foreign private capital at the national level in order to prevent financial distresses or crises while maximizing their benefits .  
Although global ODA flows have been declining and they have become small relative to private flows of capital , it was reported that aid to the Pacific island developing countries has been maintained and will be required for some decades to come .

While commending the spirit of international solidarity and partnership among States , civil society and the private sector manifested at the first meeting of the Global Ministerial Environment Forum , he stressed the need for a strong , financially secure institutional architecture , through which the worlds States and their peoples could develop a coherent international environmental policy .  
Requests the Executive Director to organize the first intergovernmental review meeting on the status of the implementation of the Global Programme of Action in November 2001 with participation of Governments , international governmental and non-governmental organizations , international and regional financing institutions , private sector and other stakeholders and major groups , paying due attention to the use of innovative financial mechanisms for implementing the Global Programme of Action and to promote the involvement of Governments , the private sector , international financial institutions and the civic society in addressing this issue ;

We wish therefore to join the Secretary-General in calling for a culture of protection in our time , based on the elements he mentions in his report ( S / 2001 / 331 ) : strengthened criminal justice systems ; regional approaches to the protection of refugees and to monitoring humanitarian situations that could endanger peace ; greater guarantees of access by humanitarian organizations to the victims of conflict ; and greater participation by civil society , including the media and the private sector , in efforts to create a broad network for the protection of civilians .  
It was also agreed that , in view of the concerns expressed about whether the draft convention should include private international law rules dealing with priority issues with respect to types of asset that were not receivables and about which the appropriate applicable law should be , and the issues identified for further refinement , the proposed text should be retained within square brackets .

Governments , relevant United Nations agencies , Bretton Woods institutions and civil society organizations ( including unions , the private sector , mass media and universities ) should all be actively involved in identifying the most effective ways to achieve sustainable social outcomes for children .  
Accordingly , the European Union had decided to support the reforms undertaken in UNIDO since the adoption of the Business Plan at the 1997 General Conference , involving , inter alia , implementation of integrated programmes in the beneficiary countries , strengthening its field offices , and the coordination effort undertaken to enhance cohesion between United Nations agencies as well as coherent action at local level by public and private agents involved in joint projects .  
Its contribution would , however , be more effective if the international economic environment was more propitious , with better distribution of foreign direct investment and private financial flows , market access , a lasting solution to the debt problem and enhanced levels of development finance .  
In conclusion , she expressed satisfaction about the increased convergence amongst different development actors in the private and public sectors , and stated that this was a highly desirable starting point in efforts to improve the situation of the LDCs in the coming decade .  
It was therefore urgent that LDCs and the international community be encouraged to foster private entrepreneurship , create a domestic environment conducive to foreign investment and expand trade internally , regionally and to the world at large .  
Past experience had shown that developing countries which pursued policies encouraging private investment , trade , and entrepreneurship , along with appropriate social investment , had achieved remarkable economic growth in a short span of time .  
The European Union considered that there was a need for parallel action on all fronts : the fight against poverty , suppression of trafficking , prosecution of those responsible , education and training , and rehabilitation of child victims ; and that all parties concerned must be mobilized , that international cooperation must be strengthened by multilateral , regional and bilateral arrangements as necessary , and that the private sector ( tourism industry , Internet exploiters ) must be mobilized .  
Ensuring adequate and affordable access to energy for present and future generations , in an environmentally sound , socially acceptable and economically viable way will require considerable efforts and substantial investments , including from the private sector .  
He drew attention to the fact that Saudi Arabia had submitted requests for membership in the Committee on several occasions and on 24 May 2000 had addressed to the Committee a memorandum on that subject in which it had outlined its expertise and activities with regard to outer space and the measures it had taken to encourage private sector participation in such activities at the national , regional and international levels . 
Not only are private capital flows , including foreign direct investment , increasingly concentrated in a small number of emerging markets , but also a part of such flows is too unstable to constitute a reliable source of development finance .  
Some delegations stated that ODA could play a catalytic and complementary role in relation to private sector resource flows in achieving development objectives , including by assisting developing countries in strengthening their civil , political , economic and financial institutions .  
An international observatory should be established to monitor racially discriminatory attitudes and acts , individual or collective , private or public , including by non-State actors , charged with the following tasks :  
International and regional forums will be established and expanded to bring together legal and technical experts in computer and telecommunications issues , from both the public and private sectors , to develop materials in support of the fight against transnational computer-related crime .  
A coherent SME policy framework is an essential component of a private sector development strategy where the primary objective is to create productive employment and foster equitable development .  
Those delegations were of the view that it would be inappropriate for the Subcommittee to give detailed consideration to matters falling within the field of private law and consequently attention should be focused exclusively on the compatibility with existing international space law of the draft Unidroit convention and preliminary draft protocol thereto on matters specific to space property .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
Critical factors to stimulate productive capacity include : stable macro-economic conditions , a conducive legal and regulatory framework , adequate institutional , physical and social infrastructure and a vibrant private sector .  
Its activities included raising awareness among families and communities of the rights of the child ; publicizing the relevant laws and instruments , such as the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child ; promoting the creation of nurseries , day-care centres , orphanages and welcoming centres ; supporting private initiatives for training and supervision during early childhood ; and taking charge of juvenile delinquents by re-educating them when they were in specialized institutions or in prison and by helping them with subsequent reintegration .  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
Urges States , international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome , so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care , research and treatment of the population in the affected countries ;  
As summarized by the joint statement of the Co-Chairmen at the conclusion of the second substantive session of the Committee , it is obvious that international private flows can make important contributions to development , and that foreign direct investment can be an effective instrument to help fill the savings / investment gap in many developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
Two main challenges in this respect , both for developing and developed countries , are to generally encourage greater flows of beneficial private investment into developing countries and countries with economies in transition ( volume ) , especially through the development and continuous amelioration of new and innovative financial instruments , and to direct these private financial flows to developing countries and countries with economies in transition , regions or sectors that do not yet benefit from such flows or are particularly dependent on external assistance ( distribution ) .  
Ending corruption is fundamental for mobilizing domestic resources , and increased direct and indirect measures are required , including increased transparency , in both government and private sector activities .  Fighting corruption is one of the main priorities of the development agenda and this has been a strong message from a wide spectrum of countries .  
An integrated approach to development , including consistency in policy-making , drawing upon synergies of different policy areas and comparative advantages of different actors , leading to an effective mobilization of financing for development from both public and private sources , is crucial for achieving the international development targets .  
As stressed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the opening meeting of the second session of the Committee , if the agreed objectives are to be attained , a large-scale , concerted effort must be made by the many different actors involved , including both rich and poor , the public and the private sectors , civil society , international institutions , and commercial and voluntary entities .  
All countries must realize that the mobilization of domestic resources for development calls for a supportive environment in which sound macroeconomic policies are applied ( stabilization of public finance , control of inflation , use of effective and efficient mechanisms for the distribution of public expenditure ) and favourable conditions in which the private sector can grow .  
Other essential factors in promoting the mobilization of domestic resources for development are political stability , good governance and the rule of law , a sound and transparent legal system , guarantees for private investors , transparency in public administration , markets and companies , respect for contract law and private property , efforts to combat corruption at the national and international levels , the participation of citizens and civil society in public life , and equal access to resources for women and men .  
Recognition of the particular problems faced by small island developing States relating to their remoteness from major markets , modest natural resource and export bases , narrow skills bases , heavy reliance on costly imports , limited access to private capital , and vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental degradation .  
The role of the private sector in the implementation of the UNFF plan of action could be twofold : first , as an important implementing agent of specific IPF / IFF proposals for action that are specifically addressed to the private sector ; and second , as a crucial financing source to complement national and international public funds .  
However , IFF recognized that private sector investment should not be considered a substitute for international public funding , including ODA . 11 In addition , the IPF / IFF process recognized the important , but differentiated , contributions of the public and private sectors , while stressing the role of Governments in fostering an enabling policy environment . 
Other relevant and interested international and regional organizations , institutions and instruments that are not members of CPF , including non-governmental organizations , private sector entities and other major groups , will be invited to contribute to specific activities of CPF , for example , certain projects , programmes , expert meetings and other activities , where their competencies would enrich the thematic work of CPF in the implementation of IPF / IFF proposals for action .  
Policy level : UNFF could call upon Governments to provide guidance to the governing bodies of the CPF members , as well as send specific calls to governing bodies , inter alia , to encourage CPF to increase joint programming ; and to continue to seek political support , as well as to have regular contacts with non-governmental organizations , private sector entities and other major groups ; Operational level : UNFF could call upon CPF to support its work at three operational levels by :  
However , the distinction between the validity of the contract creating or evidencing the security right and the validity of the security right as a property right is not universally prevalent , with some legal regimes extending the liberal validating rules of private international law applicable to the formal validity of contracts to the formal validity of the security right as a property right .  
The Hague Conference on Private International Law has recently undertaken the preparation of a fast track convention designed to create uniformity in the relevant conflicts rules and the European Unions draft directive on collateral also endorses a mix of substantive rules and rules of private international law .  
Affirms that the term violence against women means any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life , and including domestic violence , crimes committed in the name of honour , crimes committed in the name of passion , traditional practices harmful to women , including female genital mutilation , and forced marriages ;  
As reported in document DP / 2001 / CRP . 5 , one of the strategies to achieve a higher level of audit coverage has been to encourage government counterparts to use local private audit firms where there is insufficient or limited capacity in the office of the national Auditor General to meet the audit deadline .  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
Urges States , international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome , so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care , research and treatment of the population in the affected countries ;  
The view was expressed that the increasing involvement of private industry in space activities required some clarification of specific terms within the legal instruments governing outer space activities in order to strengthen their application .  
Those delegations were of the view that it would be inappropriate for the Subcommittee to give detailed consideration to matters falling within the field of private law and consequently attention should be focused exclusively on the compatibility with existing international space law of the draft Unidroit convention and preliminary draft protocol thereto on matters specific to space property .  
It is important to ensure sustained availability and flexibility in the deployment and efficient use of adequate resources for technical assistance for capacity-building , through enhanced convergence of efforts of concerned United Nations system agencies , in partnership with key financial actors , public and private .  
How can the international community support national efforts to tap civil society and private sector resources to contribute to the provision of infrastructure and social services , so that public resources can be concentrated in other areas where there can be no substitute for government activity ?  
How to strengthen public-private partnerships , including through ODA leverage and the support of the international and regional financial institutions , to finance critical infrastructure projects and other priority development areas for developing countries and countries with economies in transition , not only by sharing risk with the private sector but also by improving awareness of business opportunities in these countries ?  
As regards the particular issue under consideration , the Working Group agreed , however , that the place of conclusion of a contract , as traditionally understood in private international law , might not provide sufficient basis for a workable solution in an electronic environment and that other , more modern concepts , such as the notion of centre of gravity of a contract or other related notions , might also be considered .  
Urge States in their national efforts , and in cooperation with regional and international financial institutions , to promote the use of public investment and encourage private investment in order to eradicate poverty , particularly in those areas in which indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities predominantly live ;  
Urge States to foster the creation , growth and expansion of minority-owned businesses by increasing access to capital through , inter alia , community development banks , work with the private sector to create jobs , help retain existing jobs and stimulate industrial and commercial growth in economically distressed areas ;

In terms of regular resources from private sector , UNICEF has consolidated a unique network of national committees in industrialized countries ( raising one third of UNICEFs resources ) and has developed alliances with important corporations , foundations and non-governmental organizations .  Those efforts resulted in a net income of US $ 165-million , which combined with the US $ 343-million from Governments and US $ 55 million from other income makes the total of US $ 563-million in core funding for 2001 .  
The report addressed the following areas : mobilizing domestic financial resources for development ; mobilizing international resources for development : foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and other private flows ; trade ; increasing international financial cooperation for development through , inter alia , ODA ; debt ; and addressing systemic issues : enhancing the coherence and consistency of the international monetary , financial and trading systems in support of development .  
The resolution establishes a consultative committee composed of experts from public , joint and private sectors and of civil society and from research centres involved with scientific and technological development in member countries .  
Taking into account that the Special Unit for TCDC is understaffed and underfunded , it must be selective in its activities , which should include : improving knowledge of all TCDC programmes worldwide ; highlighting and exchanging successful and unsuccessful development experiments ; increasing research cooperation ; developing knowledge platforms in priority areas , including increasing the usefulness of WIDE ; developing new criteria for the selection of initiatives to be supported ; and increasing the participation of new actors , e.g . , the private sector , social sector , and foundations .  
The associations rejected this measure , arguing that the National Association does not represent them and that the frequencies assigned belong to the State radio TGW , so that transferring their use to private individuals would use up the nationwide frequencies in State hands and render the current legislative process meaningless . 
However , efforts to develop agricultural , livestock , fishery and forestry production as well as Guineas rural sector , have been plagued by several obstacles , such as poor rural infrastructure and facilities , the low technical level and poor management of farms and institutional weaknesses of State services , the private sector as well as of farmers organizations .  
These include the statements in the executive summary , conclusions and recommendations of the report that private firms are engaged because the United Nations agencies are short of resources ; or that firms from countries that have sound managerial principles are not used as often as others ; or that organizations appear to choose firms from certain countries because of the perception that such firms are more knowledgeable .  
Successful implementation of the objectives , policies , commitments and measures contained in the Programme of Action will require , at the national level among other things , that these be supported by good governance through transparent , accountable , and efficient institutions and practices within the Government , the private sector and civil society .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
Critical factors to stimulate productive capacity include : stable macro-economic conditions , a conducive legal and regulatory framework , adequate institutional , physical and social infrastructure and a vibrant private sector .  
Equally , it requires the definition of a clear and consistent set of public objectives , sound macroeconomic policies , efficient management of public revenue and expenditure , better allocation of resources and incentives to prevent capital flight and to encourage private savings and tax reforms , and a solid framework to implement stabilization or economic reform programmes .  
Long-term foreign private capital flows have a complementary and catalytic role to play in building domestic supply capacity as they lead to tangible and intangible benefits , including export growth , technology and skills transfer , employment generation and poverty eradication .  
The LDC Governments should undertake this task within their respective national development framework and poverty eradication strategy , including , where they exist , PRSPs , CCAs and UNDAF , and with the involvement of civil society , including the private sector , on the basis of a broad-based inclusive dialogue .  The development partners should support agreed objectives and policies designed by LDCs on the basis of the Programme of Action and existing national development and cooperation frameworks .  
With the highest rates of infection occurring in the age group of those between 24 and 54 years old , the productive capacity of the country is being diminished simultaneously with greater demands on our meagre financial resources , both private and public , for increased spending on care and facilities for the victims and to mitigate the devastating social and economic consequences of the disease .  
They further express their confidence that the results of the twenty-sixth special session of the General Assembly will include a comprehensive approach for a worldwide frontal attack on that pandemic , and recognize that prevention , care , support , and treatment are essential aspects that require international financing and cooperation from States , international organizations , and the private sector above all , the pharmaceutical industry .  
Urge the international community , particularly donor countries , civil society , as well as the private sector to complement effectively national programmes to support programmes for children orphaned or made vulnerable by HIV / AIDS in affected regions , in countries at high risk and to direct special assistance to sub-Saharan Africa ;  
We look forward to strong leadership by Governments , and concerted efforts with full and active participation of the United Nations , the entire multilateral system , civil society , the business community and private sector ;  
Under the CDI Americas initiative , the Inter-American Development Bank is committed to establishing partnerships with international , national and local public and private organizations according to the specific needs of the countries .  
Urges States , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to take steps to improve access to public information on health and environmental issues by all people , including those affected by racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ; identify and address the adverse effects of government policies and programmes on the human health and environment in targeted areas ; and promote compliance with and enforcement of all health and environmental laws , including in areas inhabited by racial or ethnic minorities , indigenous peoples , or low-income populations ;  
Urges / invites Governments , the private sector and international [ financial ] institutions , [ particularly / including the World Bank and regional development banks ] , to promote participation by persons belonging to / members of all groups , including [ minority groups ] individuals and groups affected by or vulnerable to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , in economic , cultural and social decision-making at all stages and levels [ in the development and implementation of poverty alleviation strategies , development projects , and trade and market assistance programmes ] ;  
In order to achieve economic development , the Government intended to apply strict fiscal and budgetary measures , holding inflation at about 3 per cent , enhancing the competitiveness of the domestic economy and improving the business environment so as to promote the development of the private sector .  
It has also commissioned four case studies on recent developments of transit transport systems in South-East Asia , South Asia , Latin America and southern and eastern Africa , as well as a study entitled Infrastructure development in landlocked and transit developing countries : foreign aid , private investment and the transport cost burden on landlocked developing countries .  
Each regional commission is expected to select five eminent persons from its region from a cross-section of stakeholders , including experts from Governments , research institutions and the private sector , in their personal capacities , with a view to developing ideas for concrete initiatives from regional and subregional perspectives within the framework and in support of the substantive agenda of the Conference .  
We are convinced that the United Nations system is uniquely placed to play a key role in supporting Africas efforts and to help create a momentum for a productive and mutually beneficial partnership between Africa and the international community and civil society , including the private sector .  
Recognizing also the need to integrate and coordinate the endeavours of all the parties concerned with the development of scientific and technological capabilities , including bodies from the public , joint and private sectors and the institutions of civil society , to employ technological innovation in order to promote the productivity and competitiveness of the production and services sectors in member countries of the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia ,  
The framework law should include provisions on its purpose ; the targets or goals to be achieved and the time frame to be set for the achievement of those targets ; the means by which the purpose could be achieved described in broad terms , in particular the intended collaboration with civil society and the private sector and with international organizations ; institutional responsibility for the process ; and the national mechanisms for its monitoring , as well as possible recourse procedures .  
The Ministers noted with appreciation enhanced CEI cooperation in the fields of promoting sustainable social , economic and ecological development , infrastructure and private sector investment , SME development , transborder and interregional cooperation ( such as the enhanced Szeged Process ) , human resource development , cultural as well as scientific and technological cooperation ( such as the Italian-Slovenian transfrontier television project ) , including in the field of geodesy , combating organized crime , protection of minorities , womens entrepreneurship and youth affairs .  
Such a response must be inclusive and participatory and must be based on the complete convergence of the efforts of all relevant actors : Governments , multilateral and regional institutions , the private sector and civil society .  
In that connection they pointed out that States had an obligation to exercise control so as to prohibit security firms from participating in armed conflicts , creating private armies , engaging in illicit arms trafficking , being involved in the illegal extraction of natural resources and , in that context , employing mercenaries .  
With greater support from the General Assembly and the Commission , the Special Rapporteur will thus be enabled to continue to investigate such phenomena as the role of mercenaries in internal or international armed conflicts affecting the right of peoples to self-determination and at the same time to consider other phenomena in which mercenaries have a criminal involvement , such as illicit trafficking , terrorism and the formation of mercenary teams by private security companies , which use them to intervene in the internal affairs of States with which the companies sign contracts .  
That being so , although at one time the definition was considered to be a first step , the current tendency is to describe it as partial , inadequate , applying only to international conflicts and inapplicable to new approaches such as the one involving the criminal responsibility of artificial persons ( private security firms ) that hire and employ mercenaries who violate human rights .  
In view of the suggestions that emerged from the first expert meeting and the text of Commission on Human Rights resolution 2001 / 3 , it is recommended that the Special Rapporteur should continue to study mercenary activities as a means of impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination but should also take into account other situations in which mercenaries are involved , including illicit trafficking , terrorism , the use of mercenaries by private security companies to intervene in the internal affairs of States and organized crime .  
The enabling environments component of the framework focuses on government actions , such as fair trade policies , removal of technical , legal and administrative barriers to technology transfer , sound economic policy , regulatory frameworks and transparency , all of which create an environment conducive to private and public sector technology transfer .  
In light of the additional financial resources urgently required to enable countries to achieve the poverty reduction goal as well as the other Millennium development goals , the General Assembly may wish to urge Governments to continue to implement policies to enhance domestic financial resources further and to promote foreign direct investment and other private capital flows , and to put them to efficient use .  
The Council also held the fourth special high-level meeting with the Bretton Woods institutions on two themes : development financing , in particular poverty eradication , ODA and debt ; and a move forward to a development-friendly international financial system : public and private responsibility in the prevention of financial crisis .  
Within individual countries , whether developed or developing , globalization is by no means reflected in a more equitable distribution of income , but rather aggravates existing economic injustice , insofar as it favours the concentration of capital and wealth in the hands of private interests , while opening the way for exclusion , especially as lay-offs increase .  
The members of these Councils included representatives of teachers , parents , students and government authorities at the municipal , departmental and national levels and , where appropriate , representatives of indigenous organizations , the private sector , universities and other sectors of civil society connected with educational development .  
Governments , donors , non-governmental organizations and the private sector should develop specific assistance programmes and advisory services for the development of the economic skills of rural women in banking , modern trading and financial procedures , matching the requirements of the market economy .  
The Meeting had presented a unique opportunity for public and private actors and trade negotiators and practitioners from both developed and developing countries , as well as WTO members and non-members alike , to express their views and concerns in an international forum .  
In such a culture , Governments would live up to their responsibilities , armed groups would respect the recognized rules of international humanitarian law , the private sector would be conscious of the impact of its engagement in crisis areas , and Member States and international organizations would display the necessary commitment to ensuring decisive and rapid action in the face of crisis .  
I urge Member States to adopt and enforce executive and legislative measures to prevent private sector actors within their jurisdiction from engaging in commercial activities with parties to armed conflict that might result in or contribute to systematic violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
The forms of conflict most prevalent in the world today are internal communal violence , ethnic cleansing , terrorism , private wars financed by the international trade in diamonds or oil and involve a proliferation of armed groups .  
I urge Member States to adopt and enforce executive and legislative measures to prevent private sector actors within their jurisdiction from engaging in commercial activities with parties to armed conflict that might result in or contribute to systematic violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
It appears that an effective and viable strategy for private sector involvement in financial crises in emerging markets would be to combine voluntary mechanisms designed to facilitate debt restructuring with internationally sanctioned temporary standstills to be used when needed .  
While it was recognized that the primary responsibility for development in least developed countries rested with the least developed countries themselves , the Brussels Declaration acknowledged that their efforts needed to be given concrete and substantial international support from Governments and international organizations in a spirit of shared responsibility through genuine partnerships , inter alia , with the civil society and the private sector .  
The Programme of Action acknowledged that successful implementation of the objectives , policies , commitments and measures contained in the Programme of Action would require , at the national level , among other things , that these be supported by good governance through transparent , accountable , and efficient institutions and practices within the Government , the private sector and civil society .  
As regards physical infrastructure , development partners committed to supporting infrastructure development , both through public investment and by facilitating private investment , and particularly for the creation of essential infrastructure to facilitate the functioning of liberalized domestic and regional markets .  
The least developed countries committed to increasing public and private investments in agriculture and programmes for rural economic and social infrastructure , increasing the access of the poor , particularly women , to support services and production resources , and encouraging structural adaptations in production , processing and marketing systems .  
Development partners agreed to support least developed countries efforts to increase public and private investment , and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on favourable terms , and provide technical support for geologic mapping and compilation of basic data on local mineral potential , product adaptation and market studies for small - and medium-scale mines , as well as acquisition of new technologies .  
As regards FDI and other private external flows , the Programme of Action recognizes that a stable economic , legal and institutional framework is crucial in order to attract foreign investment and to promote sustainable development through investment .  
The promotion of a conducive macroeconomic environment , good governance and democracy , as well as strengthening structural aspects of the economy and improved institutional and human capacities , was regarded as important also in the context of attracting FDI and other private external flows .  
Urges States and encourages the private sector to promote the development by the media , including the print and electronic media , including the Internet and advertising , taking into account their independence , through their relevant associations and organizations at the national , regional and international levels , of a voluntary ethical code of conduct and self-regulatory measures , in order : ( a ) To combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and do away with stereotypes ;  
Decides to extend an invitation to participate in the Social Forum to non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council and other non-governmental organizations outside Geneva and particularly newly emerging actors in the South , such as smaller groups , grass-roots organizations , voluntary , youth associations , community organizations , trade unions and associations of workers , representatives of the private sector , United Nations agencies , the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , the regional economic commissions , international financial institutions and development agencies ;  
Decides to extend an invitation to participate in the Social Forum to non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council and other non-governmental organizations outside Geneva and particularly newly emerging actors in the South , such as smaller groups , grass-roots organizations , voluntary , youth associations , community organizations , trade unions and associations of workers , representatives of the private sector , United Nations agencies , the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , the regional economic commissions , international financial institutions and development agencies ;  
In paragraph 19 of its resolution 55 / 186 , the General Assembly requested the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) to provide information on the work it has undertaken to support the promotion of long-term private financial flows , especially foreign direct investment , inter alia , through enhanced technical cooperation , to all developing countries as well as economies in transition , in particular the least developed countries and other developing countries with special difficulties in attracting private financial flows .  
Furthermore , it was reported that the relevant authorities were revising labour legislation governing the private sector with a view to producing model legislation conducive to the implementation of a policy of economic and social development .  
Urges States and encourages the private sector to promote the development by the media , including the print and electronic media , including the Internet and advertising , taking into account their independence , through their relevant associations and organizations at the national , regional and international levels , of a voluntary ethical code of conduct and self-regulatory measures , in order : ( a ) To combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and do away with stereotypes ;  
Any future international information security regime should provide for a harmonized ban on the collection , storage , use or dissemination of information about a persons private life without his or her agreement and on restrictions to public access to information , except where sanctioned in law .  The globalization of the information area has blurred the traditional concepts of geographical , State and administrative boundaries or areas of jurisdiction that normally delimit national security .  
Encourages the international donor community , relevant United Nations bodies and the private sector to provide support , including financial and technical support , for data collection and greater empirical research by Member States , particularly developing countries , and the relevant bodies of the United Nations system on the causes and patterns of migration , including on irregular migration and trafficking , as well as its social , economic and demographic impacts , and for documenting and disseminating information on successful migration management programmes ;  
He laid out the following five areas which Japan attached maximum priority in providing its assistance : ( i ) poverty reduction and social development ; ( ii ) human resources development and capacity-building for policy formulation and implementation ; ( iii ) fostering the LDCs private sector ; ( iv ) democratization ; and , ( v ) reduction of debt-burden .  
Faced with dwindling ODA , as indicated in paragraph 17 above , and bearing in mind the need to bridge the infrastructure gap ( illustrated in table 3 ) , landlocked developing countries , in keeping with global trends , have been increasingly attracted by new modes of partnership between the public and the private sectors in the development of public infrastructure , such as contracting out or management contracts , private financing of public facilities , leasing , joint ventures , build-operate-transfer ( BOT ) schemes and privatization or capitalization .  
At the national level , three distinct but complementary institutional structures are emerging to reflect the expanding role of the private sector as the main provider of transport and related commercial services .  
First , as the public sector retreats from commercial services , allowing the private sector to take the leading role , the public sector is assuming the role of regulator to ensure fair competition among service providers , protecting the consumer against monopoly abuse and enforcing quality and safety standards to protect the consumer .  
The international community should continue to support policy , legislative , regulatory and institutional reforms at the national and regional levels , establishing autonomous accountable transport authorities , strengthening private sector associations and promoting modalities for fostering effective dialogue between the public and private sectors .  
The Money Matters Institutes mission is to foster dialogue among leaders of financial services , international institutions and policy makers in developing countries to encourage the most realistic role for private capital in financing sustainable development , and to generate the requisite supporting data about emerging economies so as to facilitate this purpose .  
The panellists suggested that less reliance on private capital flows should be a common goal for all developing countries , because of ( i ) the volatility of such flows , ( ii ) the likelihood that financial flows to developing countries would decline in reaction to the less optimistic outlook for the global economy and to the falling profitability of FDI in major recipient countries , and ( iii ) the lack of meaningful international financial reforms .  
The expected American military action on Afghanistan , backed by the support of the allied States , was launched on the seventh of this month as a response to the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington last month , which shook the whole world with the heavy losses of the lives of innocent people , and the extensive destruction of a number of public and private properties it caused in the United States of America . 
High rates of unemployment , in particular among young people , the non-functioning of the national safety net system , scarce opportunities for private investment , declining domestic production and other financial , cultural and criminal factors have contributed to political instability .  
We must make good use of the forthcoming Review Conference to take more effective measures to address the remaining two core issues : strict control of private ownership and prevention of the transfer of small arms to non-state actors .  We continue to believe that the Conference on Disarmament is the single multilateral negotiating forum for all relevant disarmament matters .  
The forthcoming International Conference on Financing for Development would be addressing the inequities inherent in the global economy and would bring together for the first time the United Nations , the Bretton Woods institutions , the private sector and civil society to consider how to reform the current financial system and find means of increasing cooperation to stimulate financial flows to the developing countries . 
His delegation sincerely hoped that the International Conference on Financing for Development would be able to address in a more meaningful way the marginalization of developing countries with a view to changing the decision-making processes , adjusting the terms of trade , rescheduling the external debt and mobilizing public and private capital flows at national and international levels .  
It had been encouraging to see the positive response of the private sector , non-governmental organizations and civil society to forging a partnership with the United Nations system in order to advance the global efforts to bridge the digital divide .  69 .  His own Government had adopted a comprehensive approach to the promotion of science and technology .  
Austria congratulated the Commission secretariat on organizing a Colloquium on Privately Financed Infrastructure in Vienna in July and endorsed the initiative to establish a Working Group to draft a core model law , because a legislative and regulatory framework for infrastructure projects would send a reassuring signal to all potential private investors and might help to attract private investment for infrastructure projects in developing States .  
The European Union also wished to stress that the victims of HIV / AIDS should receive adequate social protection ; that minimum standards should be set for social protection tailored to individual countries ; and that it unreservedly supported the Secretary-Generals Global Compact as an instrument for promoting the responsibility of the private sector for social development and social protection .  
It was therefore the role of the International Conference on Financing for Development to provide developing countries with realistic advice enabling them to reformulate domestic policies and review regulatory constraints that were currently hampering the growth of the private sector and discouraging foreign investment .  
It was important to cooperate to find common solutions that would make it possible to reduce the vulnerability of the economies of the developing countries which was linked to the instability of external resources and inequitable access to private capital markets and to strengthen the world financial system so that it would serve the interests of all and lead to the attainment of the development goals established by the international community .  
The mobilization of additional resources , both domestic and foreign , was essential in order to achieve higher levels of growth and more effective poverty eradication ; private capital flows , and the promotion of trade , which would generate foreign capital , particularly in countries which had not been able to attract international financial flows , were equally important .  
While the primary responsibility for development in the least developed countries rested with those countries themselves , their efforts must be supplemented by concrete and substantial support from the international community , in a spirit of shared responsibility and genuine partnership which included civil society and the private sector .  
Given the deepening interdependence arising from globalization , holistic and participatory solutions should be sought and partnerships among the major stakeholders , donors , recipients and the public and private sector should be strengthened , in line with the initiative of the Secretary-General on the Global Compact .  
In addition to these personal aids , the State also runs a scheme of building aids , which are intended for public contractors ( such as the low cost housing fund , the national society for low cost housing and the communes ) or private contractors ( such as non-profit making companies contributing to broader subsidized housing programmes ) .  
I take heart from the new alliances I saw taking shape in Durban : the role that parliamentarians can play was highlighted by the Inter-Parliamentary Union ; the national human rights commissions sent us a powerful expression of their determination to play their part ; the treaty bodies and the special mechanisms of the Commission on Human Rights played an active part ; the vital role of the media and the private sector in combating racism was emphasized .  
Affirm that effective and meaningful public participation of civil society , including international and national non-governmental organizations and the private sector , is an essential component of successful and sustainable social and economic development and an important element for the promotion of human rights ;  
Recognize the primary role to be played by the private sector in the exercise of economic , social and cultural rights , and call for joint action with Governments and civil society ;  
It is recommended that the executive , judicial and legislative branches , together with the private sector and civil society , act together to promote the exercise of economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development ;  
Highlights of the work of the Legal Subcommittee had included its discussion of a new agenda item entitled Consideration of the draft convention of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law ( UNIDROIT ) on international interests in mobile equipment and the preliminary draft protocol thereto on matters specific to space property , a timely issue because of the increased participation of private entities in space activities . 
His delegation welcomed the efforts of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law ( UNIDROIT ) with regard to a draft convention on international interests in mobile equipment and the preliminary draft protocol thereto on matters specific to space property ; given the growth in commercial use of outer space and the increasing role played by the private sector , further work was necessary to develop legal instruments and regulations to deal with matters such as financing , mortgages and guarantees . 
Encourages the international community , the United Nations system , the private sector and civil society to provide the necessary financial resources to assist national Governments in their efforts to meet the development targets and benchmarks agreed upon in the World Summit for Social Development , the Fourth World Conference on Women , the International Conference on Population and Development , the twenty-third and twenty-fourth special sessions of the General Assembly and other relevant United Nations conferences and summits ;  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations , in close cooperation with , and with the full involvement of , the secretariat of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , as appropriate , to provide substantive and organizational support , within existing resources of the budget for the biennium 2002-2003 and by voluntary contributions , for the international ministerial meeting , and that , in this context , the necessary preparations should be undertaken at the subregional and regional levels , as appropriate , with the involvement of all major stakeholders , including the private sector ;

Sixty scientific academies of the InterAcademy Panel on International Issues ( IAP ) in May 2000,5 stressed that scientific , technological and health capabilities can produce substantial progress over the next two decades towards a sustainable human future and that this progress will demand a threefold effort by the scientific and technological community : to promote the use of existing knowledge more widely and effectively ; to generate new knowledge and beneficial technologies ; and to work with Governments , international organizations and the private sector to promote a worldwide transition to sustainability .  
Over the next five years , the scientific and technological community is committed to significantly enhancing the active participation of scientists and engineers within : national sustainable development commissions ; all levels of government , as advisers to heads of State , heads of international agencies , parliaments etc . ; and private sector boards of directors . 
As a leading international body in the area of economic and social issues , the Council contributed to the mobilizing , along with States , of the heads of the financial institutions and of the specialized agencies , the private sector , non-governmental organizations and all the other development partners , in support of the new African initiative , now called the New Partnership for Africas Development .  
Space activities in Ukraine in the year 2000 were directed at meeting the countrys obligations under international programmes and projects , implementing the priority projects of the national space programme for 1998 to 2002 , improving the effectiveness of the work of the national space sector through restructuring and marketing , introducing advanced space technologies to an increasing extent , enhancing competitiveness and the conditions for private initiative , and collaborating with international financial , scientific , technological and other organizations on a large scale .  
Concerning finance , the Ministers had highlighted the importance of meeting the targets for official development assistance , the need to encourage private sector participation in the promotion of sustainable development through appropriate incentives , ensuring that additional funds were available to the Global Environment Facility , the need for debt relief for highly indebted poor countries , and ensuring market access in developed countries for the exports of developing countries .  
The Committee therefore requested that the Government provide information on the manner in which direct or indirect gender bias is removed from the wage systems established pursuant to the Wages Act and on the methods used by private sector employers in establishing wage rates in enterprises , institutions or other organizations in accordance with differences in tasks and conditions of work ( see sect . 9 of the Wages Act ) .
