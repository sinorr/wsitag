The desert around Qinghai Lake is increasing at an average of 10.12 square kilometers annually .  Dunes , in particular , on the western bank of the lake came into being over the last decade and have become an area with the fastest desertification .  The wetland 's ecological system has been damaged with the biological diversity decreasing .  
Chen Jianwen , the researcher responsible for this research explained that X-ray computerized tomography ( CT ) is usually used in clinical medicine to determine the pathology of a biological tissue .  Nonetheless , compared with a normal tissue , the difference of absorbing the X-ray by an initial cancerous tissue is extremely small , making it impossible to reflect the absorption on an image .  Thus , it is very difficult to diagnose an initial stage cancer .  
Caohai is in the area controlled by the subtropical monsoon .  Caohai basin has high elevation and low latitude with an average yearly temperature of 11.6 degrees Celsius and an average yearly sunshine of 1,801 hours .  It has become a " paradise for migratory birds " and an ideal summer resort for its mild winter and cool summer , combined with many advantages such as abundant water flow , fertile land , densely-knitted swamps , and rich biological resources .  
We will further strengthen our four major pillar industries of the processing industry of agricultural and sideline products , the energy industry , the metallurgical industry , and the chemical industry ; speed up the development of our four dominant industries of rare earth , biological technology , information , and heavy-duty vehicles ; take the ideological emancipation as the guide , and uphold the principle that " development is the last word " ;  
In the fields of electronic information , new materials , biological engineering , integration of light , machines , and electricity [ guang ji dian yi ti hua , 0342-2623-7193-0001-7555-0553 ] , new energy sources , and environmental protection , the high-tech zones are more and more becoming important bases for the development of China 's high-tech industries and have played a active role in promoting industrial restructuring and in leading forward sustained economic development .  
Wang Yusheng said : Among all the biological events on earth , the most striking and most sensational events of biological extinction are actually not frightening and are very normal as far as the natural process of biological succession is concerned , because the new superseding the old is a general law of organic evolution .  
In order to develop the capacity for protection against nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , an anti-chemical warfare corps school was set up 50 years ago to train anti-chemical warfare cadres for the armed forces .  This raised the curtain of the building of the anti-chemical warfare corps in New China . In the past 50 years , our armed forces have organized troops with a relatively high quality to deal with nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .  
Serial equipment and complete sets of equipment for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons in field operation can dash about in toxic and contaminated areas under all circumstances .  This has provided a firm material basis for increasing the capacity of our armed forces for protection against nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .  
With the efforts made in the past years , a system for training a new type of anti-chemical-warfare capable personnel has been formed in our armed forces .  At present , major combat equipment , including tanks , airplanes and vessels can better resist nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , and both the armed forces and the civilian basically have complete sets of equipment for protection against such weapons .  
The equipment for the mass defense of military units is in the main complete with quality reaching a good standard .  The preventive capability by specialized anti-chemical warfare units and the overall preventive capability of the Army , the Navy , the Air Force and the Second Artillery Corps have all been significantly improved .  The military units ' fighting capability under the threat of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons has been significantly strengthened .  
At present , our military units have composite decontamination equipment , multifunctional and rapid decontamination equipment , and one-man decontamination equipment , thus forming a complete equipment system .  Such a system , which is comprehensive in function and in technical means , can do a good job in decontaminating the pollution caused by nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons .  Our military units can enter an area contaminated by nuclear and chemical pollution to carry out decontamination work .  
Pilotless combat planes can complete various missions without the limitations set by the human body , such as approaching close to forward positions , carrying ground tracking sensors , synthetic aperture radar sensors , moving target indicators , and so on , or else doing on-the-spot monitoring of chemical and biological substances .  
The first possibility that Bush considered was to established ship-based interceptors , because the technology of ship-based interception is relatively realistic and mature , and in addition such interceptors can enable the United States to detect incoming enemy missiles earlier , and the fragments of the intercepted missiles ( including any chemical or biological warheads ) will fall on the country that launches them instead of on the United States .  
On 20 April 2000 , Japan 's House of Representatives approved " Amendment to the Law on Formation of Defense Agency " and decided to set up several new research posts in the Defense Agency , including those for research on nuclear weapons , biological weapons research , and other special weapons as well .  It also decided to set up a research forum for nonmilitary experts on medical science and military science .  
Third , thanks to the close cooperation between the key techniques developed during the implementation of the " 863 " Project and the industrial circle , China has created products with its own intellectual property rights in such hot point fields of international high-tech competition as biological engineering medicine , communications equipment , high-performance computers , Chinese information processing platform , artificial crystal , photoelectron material and apparatuses .  
The operational concept of " full dimensional protection " which was proposed by the US military in 1996 calls for the establishment of both offensive and defensive measures to deal with information warfare , guided missiles , and nuclear , biological , and chemical weapons of mass destruction .  
These officials believe that the new US administration has two " nails in the eye and thorns in the flesh " : The first is what Americans say is Iraq 's concealed underground biological and chemical weapons stores , and the second is the nuclear command centers which , they say , Russia is hurrying to build , hidden deep in the mountains .  
A kind-hearted girl unexpectedly hurt people with a knife , a loving father went as far as laying his murderous hands on his beloved son , and a student of good standing in both character and academic performance went as far as waving a sharp sword against his biological father . . .  
Compared to ordinary fighters , the unmanned Stealth fighter is more suited to carrying out highly difficult missions , such as long-range surprise attacks on enemy targets with dense air defenses , sneak attacks on enemy biological and chemical weapon bases , and interception of cruise missiles , and so on .  
During the visit , Jiang Zemin listened in detail to the account given by President Wang Dazhong . With great interest , Jiang saw the digital television launching and receiving system and the special chips used for the system with China 's own intellectual property rights , the 500-meter-long high temperature superconductor material , biological material , and other products .  He also asked about the scientific research network for China 's education , application of low temperature heat reactors , and optical communications .  
The article notes that while the United States indeed faces certain new threats in the " new strategic environment " that has appeared after the Cold War , the main threat the United States faces today is not intercontinental ballistic missiles , but terrorism , such as the ignition of chemical , biological , or nuclear weapons that terrorists have smuggled into US ports . 
By the end of May 2001 , the park had invested an accumulated total of over 8 billion yuan on the construction of its infrastructure , had used $ 4.2-billion of foreign capital , carried out construction on an area of 12 square km , completed the construction of high-level infrastructure , initially set up groups of advanced and high-tech industries with the electronics , information , precision machines , biological pharmaceutics and new materials industries as their core , and established a new management structure and operation mechanism .  
The two parties will cooperate in protecting and improving the environment , in preventing cross-border pollution , in the fair and rational use of biological resources in waters in the border area and in the north Pacific and border river courses , and will work together to protect rare plants and animals and the natural ecological system in the border areas , and cooperate in preventing natural disasters and major accidents arising from technical causes and in eliminating their consequences .  
We should develop industries with distinctive local characteristics , placing our focus on the development of tourism , Tibetan medicine , biological industry and green foodstuffs industry with special plateau features , processing industry of farm products and animal by-products , national handicraft industry , mining industry , and construction and building material industry ; take large strides in improving the development speed , scale , and efficiency of these industries ; and turn them into new economic growth areas .  
Protecting and improving the environmental conditions , making fair and rational use of waters in the border region and biological resources in the north Pacific and in border river courses , and protecting plants and animals and preventing natural disasters in the border regions - - all these are new fields in which the two countries can cooperate .  
During night flights , head winds are strong , temperatures are high , the biological clock is in disorder , physical conditions change greatly , a wrong impression of apparent distance happens easily , and pilots need to use multiple levels of skills .  Considering these technical problems and difficulties , this squadron has paid attention to the scientific basis of technical preparations and the safety of flight training .  
Many large-scale military exercises have shown the newest achievements that China 's military has obtained from the traditional " three attacks and three defenses " - - attacking tanks , planes , and airborne troops , and defending against nuclear , chemical , and biological attacks - - to the " new three attacks and three defenses " of attacking stealth aircraft , cruise missiles , and helicopter gun ships , and defending against precision strikes , electronic jamming , and reconnaissance and surveillance .  
On this occasion , on the issue of biological weapons , the Bush Administration uses the excuse that the stipulations of the draft agreement of the protocol , regarding verification and inspection , might threaten US commercial and military secrets , leading to the adoption of an opposition standpoint , in total disregard for the appeals and great efforts of the international community ; this has once again demonstrated that the Bush Administration is determined to obstinately cling to its course and disregard the opposition of the international community .  
Second , we should actively promote the research of high technologies of strategic significance , and launch major and important engineering projects using new and high technologies .  To bring about a leap forward in the development of productive forces in our country , we should keep abreast of the new development trend of the world 's high technologies and related industries ; intensify our strategic studies of high technologies in such key fields as information technology , biological technology , new material technology , advanced manufacturing and automation technology , and marine technology ;  
and resolve a number of problems currently facing our economic development , including an irrational industrial structure , a low industrialization level of new and high technologies , and poor market competitiveness .  We should stress launching a batch of engineering projects using new and high technologies , which include high-performance computers , photoelectronic materials and apparatus , the design and manufacturing of submicroscopic and deep-submicroscopic integrated circuits , biological technologies and their industrialization , biochips , and agro-biological projects .  
Li Tieying pointed out : The western regions have rich hydropower , mineral , and biological resources and numerous sites of human civilization and natural scenery .  Many industries have established a good foundation in the regions .  
In doing the anti-drought work , we must make overall plans , take all factors into consideration , bring about temporary as well as permanent solutions to the problem , and give comprehensive treatment by combining engineering measures with biological measures and management measures , combining capital construction of water conservancy works with construction of ecological environment , and combining rational development with strict protection and scientific utilization in a bid to properly manage , protect , and utilize the limited water resources .  
The two sides are committed to a world free from nuclear , biological or chemical weapons .  They stressed that the international regime for eliminating and prohibiting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction should be permanently and indiscriminately applicable to all regions and countries with no exception .  
And at the same time both sides took note of the legitimate rights of any country for peaceful uses of nuclear energy , chemical and biological technology in a transparent manner under the supervision of the relevant international organizations .  
She made a successful maiden flight half a year ago ; though unmanned , she created favorable conditions , through various biological and man-carrying tests , for the final realization of a manned space flight .  
As for the orientation of industrial development , according to relevant sources , in the next five years , China will focus efforts on developing high-efficiency and high-quality agriculture and quickening the development of high and new technology industries , including the information industry , biological engineering , new energy sources , and new materials .  The traditional industries will be equipped with high technology .  The manufacturing and machine-building industries will be regenerated , and tertiary industry will also be developed actively .  
Thanks to this " three attacks and three defenses " training , all military units generally acquired the skills of attacking tanks , aircraft , and paratroopers and the skills of defending against nuclear attack , chemical warfare , and biological weapons .  At the same time , People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] training has developed by leaps and bounds as a result .  
To further intensify scientific and technological cooperation , the Chinese Government and the Japanese Government have decided to cooperatively develop a new round of 89 scientific and technological projects in the biological , nuclear energy , agricultural , medical , resources , and environmental protection fields .  
Wan Xueyuan said the " transmission of oil from the west to the east " would be a symbolic project in China 's development of the western region in the 21st century .  Meanwhile , the booming special industries in the western region , which include the rare earth industry in Inner Mongolia , the development of herbal and biological medicine in the western provinces , and tomato and safflower processing in Xinjiang , all badly need intellectual support .  
Second , we must help minority nationality areas in the country 's western region change their traditional way of thinking on the issue of economic development , adopt the principle of " establishing finite targets , and making advances in some fields while retreating from others , " make a full use of the advantages of the country 's western region in having a biological diversity and a nationality diversity , and build up an industrial structure and systems that enjoy distinguishing local features .  
We shall give greater support to the faster and better development of the central area of this province with Xian at the center , and turn this area into a core base for the great development of the western part of the country .  Northern Shaanxi will be developed into our country 's major sample zone for the sustainable development of energy sources and the building of the ecological environment .  The southern part of Shaanxi will be developed into a diversified economic zone for developing biological resources , tourist resources , and water resources .  
The licensing control on strategic commodities aims at ensuring Hong Kong 's continued access to high - technology goods and up-to-date technology which are essential for maintaining Hong Kong 's status as a regional centre of finance , trade , banking and telecommunication , and preventing Hong Kong from being used as a conduit for the proliferation of strategically - sensitive goods , arms , munitions or chemical / biological / nuclear weapons .  
( a ) An individual 's vulnerability to the development of emotional problems is affected by a variety of biological , psychological and socioeconomic factors , such as coexisting physical illness , a negative way of thinking in face of adversities or lack of social support .  
Despite this , the " neither large nor small " numbers of cases of these illnesses still leave people a little non-plussed when they see them . The threats to life and health from modern industrial society come from stress and environmental pollution - - cancer , heart disease , asthma , infertility , and other " diseases of modern civilization " caused by chemical or biological agents . Have n't these acute communicable illnesses transmitted by bacteria or viruses already been eradicated ?  
Aside from the direct economic loss to the human race of the trees as a source of timber , many people believe that if large numbers of Taiwan red pine exit Taiwan 's biological stage , it would be overoptimistic to think that in many areas of rugged terrain where native pines now grow , the original vegetation could be restored by voluntary tree planting campaigns .  
According to one recent report , a mallard flying south caught sight of the domesticated white Peking ducks on the pond of a duck farm in Kenting . Its biological cycle was suddenly thrown out of kilter , and it settled down there and stayed into spring , unwilling to leave .  
They can not only be used as a research tool in biological , medical and pharmaceutical research and development , and as a clinical diagnostic tool for doing health checks , testing for infectious pathogens , screening blood and so on , but they can also find uses in such areas as defense applications , police forensic work , environmental testing and food testing .  
But after the crabs branched off as a separate family , they diversified into a dizzying variety of different species . The bulk of the Crab Museum 's collection is made up of more than 700 crab species from Taiwan . However , the exhibits , which fill 36 large upright display cabinets , are not arranged by biological families and genera . Instead they are divided into interesting themes such as poisonous crabs , camouflage experts , outsize crabs , and the tastiest crabs to eat .  
But just as with other natural resources , the greatest microbiological riches are concentrated in developing countries , and these poor countries do not have the means to screen their own resources and develop useful biological agents . But the major pharmaceutical companies of Europe and North America have long been gathering rich pickings from these countries , by collecting large quantities of soil , humus and plant samples to use in the search for new drugs . This has brought them substantial profits , but in the past the countries owning the resources benefited little .  
NTU 's innovative multifunctional protein chip reader uses mature optical and semiconductor technology in which Taiwanese industry is well versed , and does not require the use of a fluorescence microscope . By shining infrared light onto a biochip at wavelengths of 800 to 2000 nanometers , the reader illuminates the biological molecules of all the probes on the chip and interprets them by detecting the reflected signals .  
In The Archaeology of Knowledge , French scholar Michel Foucault observes that as medicine has developed from diagnosis by visual inspection , auscultation and palpation to the use of the microscope and biological tests , its information system has been modified ; and how beside the physician there have appeared masses of data , instruments and analytical techniques which of course he uses , but which modify his position as an observing subject in relation to the patient .  
The reason is simple : " Because plants do not grow for us to eat them . " The cell structure of most biological materials is very durable , and not easily broken down . Therefore it is difficult for the matter inside to be released , much less absorbed into the human body .  
The risk of not having a place in the global disease warning network is reflected in Resolution 107 passed by the WHO Executive Board in 2001 , which reads in part : " The need for international cooperation on epidemic alert and response is greater today than ever before due to increased population movements , growth in international trade and biological products , changes in methods of food processing , and social and environmental changes . "  
However , even more worrying is the potential proliferation of nuclear , chemical , biological and ballistic missiles - the danger of their falling into the wrong hands .  
As agreed , separate expert groups in the chemical , biological , ballistic missile and nuclear areas met to pursue the objectives outlined above .  
In short , then , contemporary racism is a kind of anachronistic biological and cultural fundamentalism , given that the current trend of human societies is towards racial mixing and globalization . 
It had a crash programme to build a nuclear weapon in 1990-1991 ; it had weaponized live biological agents , including the deadly botulin and anthrax organisms , weapons never before used in warfare ; it produced a far greater quantity of chemical weapons , in more diverse forms , than it had previously admitted ; and it deliberately kept these documents hidden from the United Nations Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) , even as it was claiming that all information had been handed over .  
Civil and external wars could occur in regions where the possession of advanced weaponry , such as medium-range missiles with chemical , biological or even nuclear warheads , by ambitious and threatened regimes becomes a potentially lethal prospect . 
We had to identify which specialized areas or sporting disciplines to develop , bearing in mind , inter alia , young people 's traditions , Peru 's diverse climatic zones ranging from the high sierra to the tropical coast and the Amazon forest and , of course , the biological characteristics of Peru 's inhabitants .  
Fisheries by-catch and discards of by-catch are an increasing global economic , environmental and political concern , as States and relevant international organizations and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements attempt to rebuild depleted stocks , maintain biological diversity , protect endangered species and ensure maximum sustainable use of fishery resources .  
Apart from the obligations to prevent proliferation derived from the existing disarmament agreements , the European Union considers the measures taken on export controls to be useful instruments in the efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , their object being to stem proliferation without detriment to transfers of material , equipment and technology for peaceful purposes in the nuclear , chemical , biological and space-research fields .  
In the light of the special characteristics of biological weapons and the complexity of verification , it is imperative to discuss and formulate necessary definitions and objective criteria , including lists of bacteriological ( biological ) agents and toxins , so as to clearly differentiate the prohibited activities from those allowed .  Only on this basis can there be a meaningful exploration of effective and practicable verification measures .  
Calls upon all States in the Middle East to take practical steps in appropriate forums aimed at making progress towards , inter alia , the establishment of an effectively verifiable Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction , nuclear , chemical and biological , and their delivery systems , and to refrain from taking any measures that preclude the achievement of this objective .  
" Deeply concerned about the alarmingly high rate of loss of biological diversity , and determined to spare no effort for the conservation of the biological diversity and the sustainable use of its components , as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , " .  
Recognize and foster the traditional methods and the knowledge of indigenous people and their communities , emphasizing the particular role of women , relevant to the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of biological resources , and ensure the opportunity for the participation of those groups in the economic and commercial benefits derived from the use of such traditional methods and knowledge ;  
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity , and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reiterating the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of its components , as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources ,  
Productive use of such biological products as fuelwood , timber , fish , animal skins , musk , ivory , medicinal plants , honey , beeswax , fibres , gums , resins , rattans , construction materials , ornamentals , animals sold as game meat , fodder , mushrooms , fruits and dyes , can have a major impact on national economies .  14 .  Such values can be remarkably high .  
The objectives and activities contained in chapter 15 of Agenda 21 represent , therefore , a formidable challenge to Governments and relevant United Nations bodies , major groups and non-governmental organizations , among others , to improve the conservation of biological diversity and promote the sustainable use of biological resources , as well as to support the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant agreements in a coordinated and integrated manner .  
In the statement , the Conference noted that the Convention on Biological Diversity was the primary international legal instrument for advancing the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of genetic resources .  
It decided to establish an open-ended ad hoc group of experts to consider without undue delay the need for and modalities of a protocol , containing appropriate procedures to be followed in the field of the safe transfer , handling and use of any living modified organism resulting from biotechnology that might have an adverse effect on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
The international scientific community , in cooperation with Governments , entities within the United Nations system , and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , need to make efforts to develop economic tools for determining the costs and benefits of the conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use of biological resources , and their distribution at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
Call upon multilateral organizations and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to cooperate with Governments in developing a coordinating mechanism to ensure the effective implementation of existing conventions and agreements on biological diversity and the rational use of limited resources ;  
The main priorities of the programme on natural resources address issues relating to knowledge , the utilization and conservation of biological resources and diversity , the assessment of standing vegetation and its present and potential contribution to agricultural productivity , and the establishment of sustainable farming systems .  
The Joint FAO / ECE Working Party on Relations between Agriculture and the Environment currently examines various aspects and national practices related to biological diversity and landscape protection as part of its work-plan element entitled Economic , legal , technological and regulatory measures for the promotion of environmentally sustainable agriculture and production of healthy food " .  
The primary objective of the country studies programme initiated by UNEP is to assist national Governments to identify , in the light of social , economic , environmental and other objectives , the basic needs and levels of effective conservation , including the rational use of national biological resources and the necessary supportive measures and costs to meet those needs , as well as the benefits associated with the implementation of those measures .  
Other areas in which some progress has been made include the consideration of biological diversity ; the reservation of more primary forests ; the use of multi-purpose native species ; less regimented planting and management regimes for landscape and other environmental purposes ; the clear inclusion of forestry concerns into national sustainable development strategies ; and broadening end-use objectives beyond timber production to ecosystem management to sustain multiple benefits .  
The Convention on Biological Diversity is the primary international legal instrument for advancing the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of genetic resources , while recognizing the important role of other conventions to the objectives of the Convention .  
Supported by a relatively strong foundation in science and technology and a critical mass of skilled human resources in the field of biological sciences , many countries , especially those in Central and Eastern Europe , can , with appropriate and timely support from the international community , move forward rapidly in biotechnology development and its safe applications .  
Programmes dealing with biosafety have expanded beyond the scientific sector to include the concerns of workers exposed to biological agents in the workplace ( ILO ) , farmers ( FAO ) and the general public , while programmes on marine agricultural and industrial biotechnology call for closer cooperation among FAO , ILO , the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) , UNEP , UNIDO , WHO and the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) .  
To encourage environmentally sustainable agricultural practices while moving away from overdependence on agrochemicals , UNEP , in collaboration with FAO , UNESCO and other relevant organizations , supported the regional Microbial Resources Centres ( MIRCENs ) in Cairo , Nairobi , Dakar , and Porto Alegre in demonstrating on a pilot scale the use of biological nitrogen fixation ( BNF ) for enhancing soil fertility and increasing legume production at the small-farm level .  
Bioremediation of polluted groundwater , technologies for containing pollution , biological methods of treating pollution in the unsaturated zone above groundwaters contaminated by past industrial and military activities , and the treatment of extracted contaminated soil are among the topics of the regional ECE Seminar on the Prevention and Control of Groundwater Pollution to be held in September 1995 .  
The Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes ( Helsinki , 1992 ) contains binding obligations to parties to apply best available technologies for the treatment of industrial waste water containing hazardous substances , to apply at least biological treatment or equivalent processes for treating municipal waste water , and to carry out research on the development of new technologies and environmentally sound disposal practices .  
Further areas of concern related to biological weapons , new types of weapons of mass destruction , radiological weapons , limitation and reduction of conventional weapons and international arms transfers , the prevention of an arms race in outer space , curbing the naval arms race , naval armaments and disarmament , and reduction of military budgets .  
Acts of inhumanity , cruelty or barbarity directed against the life , dignity or physical or mental integrity of persons [ , in particular wilful killing , torture , mutilation , biological experiments , taking of hostages , compelling a protected person to serve in the forces of a hostile Power , unjustifiable delay in the repatriation of prisoners of war after the cessation of active hostilities , deportation or transfer of the civilian population and collective punishment ] ;  
The Working Group recognized that the Convention on Biological Diversity , which has now entered into force , will be the principal mechanism for advancing the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and provides an excellent basis for coordinating relevant instruments .  
Needless to say that these allegations are mainly propagated by a Government which has been the primary supporter and sponsor of Israel 's State-sponsored terrorism , of its aggressive policies , and of its production of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , and has also backed despotic Governments which have not experienced parliamentarianism , consultation and elections in their political life even for a single day .  
Negative effects of the sanctions are foreseen in the increased number of diseased and dead and , especially , through their delayed effect on the mental and physical development of schoolchildren and adolescents , leaving a lasting mark on the biological integrity of the population .  
Military doctrines of the States in the region should be exclusively defensive and in all respects adapted to the international agreements on restricted use of military force and non-use of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons ;  
Following on the plenary meeting , in a meeting devoted to Iraq 's biological weapons programme , Iraq for the first time disclosed a much more extensive programme than that contained in its full , final and complete disclosure of early August 1995 , admitting weaponization immediately prior to the outbreak of the Gulf war , including the filling of biological warfare agents into 166 bombs and 25 Al Hussein missile warheads .  
Strongly support United Nations , regional and national efforts on arms control , limitation and disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , in all aspects , and other weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons and other forms of particularly excessively injurious or indiscriminate weapons , in pursuit of our common commitment to a world free of all these weapons ;

special concern , in this regard , has been the need to determine the full extent of Iraq 's programmes and to seek verification of Iraq 's claims to have destroyed all proscribed weapons , in particular its stocks of agent VX and its precursors , operational missile systems , all of its biological warfare agent and all of the aerial bombs and missile warheads that Iraq states it filled with various chemical and biological agents in the period immediately preceding the Gulf War .  
The wealth of the Caspian Sea , its unique biological and mineral structure and fragile ecological system call for a comprehensive and balanced approach , free from short-term profit or political advantage .  
Faced with the threat to mankind posed by the rise in sea levels , global warming , creeping desertification and the disappearance of biological diversity , Benin attaches the utmost importance to implementation of all the agreements reached in Rio and , here , renews its commitment to doing all it can to ensure the success of the special session of the General Assembly planned for June 1997 to strengthen implementation of the decisions and recommendations of the Earth Summit contained in Agenda 21 .  
Given the persistence of such environmental problems as the lack of drinking water , threats to biological diversity , the depletion of the ozone layer , the warming of the atmosphere , the diminishing soil productivity , desertification and diminishing food security , Governments of both industrialized and developing countries must take joint , concerted action .  
Humanity can be sheltered from the tragedy of massively destructive wars only through the full and complete elimination of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons under effective international control .  
During this time , Member States that have participated in the deliberations have spoken on a wide range of issues surrounding that continent , especially its role and influence on the atmosphere , oceans , biological conditions of the entire global system and the fragility of its environment , which is vulnerable to the impact of human activities .  
An ever-increasing awareness that the ocean is a basic governing force for life on this planet , particularly for small island countries , and that better understanding of its physical and biological mechanisms , including their interaction with atmospheric processes , is essential to decision-making aiming at sustainable development ; 
The objective of programme element I . 3 is to make proposals that will encourage countries - in a manner consistent with the provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity - to consider ways and means whereby the traditional forest-related knowledge , innovations and practices of forest-dwellers and indigenous and local communities can be effectively protected with a view to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , and the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices can be shared fairly and equitably . 
The Convention on Biological Diversity addresses specifically the need to respect , preserve and maintain the knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , as well as the need to protect and encourage customary use of biological resources in accordance with traditional cultural practices .  
The Panel may also receive substantive inputs from the Convention following the third meeting of the Conference of the Parties on , inter alia , the underlying causes of biological diversity loss in forest ecosystems , components and dynamics of biological diversity , and ways and means for the effective protection and use of traditional forest-related knowledge , innovations and practices of forest-dwellers , indigenous and local communities , as well as fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from such knowledge , innovation and practices .  
The Convention on Biological Diversity addresses specifically the need to respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , as well as the need to protect and encourage customary use of biological resources in accordance with traditional cultural practices .  
More detailed analysis is required for assessing the applicability and reliability of valuation in the key situations in which valuation is important that are probably more central to the concerns of the Panel such as ( i ) utilization or conservation of primary , unmanaged or any other types of forests , ( ii ) establishment of reserves for biological diversity , ( iii ) carbon sequestration and ( iv ) international watersheds , among others ; 
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reiterating the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , and the sustainable use of its components , as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources ,  
Harvesting of priority products , especially in developed countries , was frequently combined with the provision of selected environmental services ( notably maintenance of the biological resource base , including the wildlife and the conservation of soil and water ) and , with efforts to enhance recreation and aesthetic values of forests and woodlands for an increasingly urbanized human population .  
The internationally accepted definition of a protected area is given as an area of land and / or sea that is especially dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity , as well as of natural and associated cultural resources , and that is managed through legal or other effective means .  
The Initiative has been designed as an integrated programme intended to increase the capabilities of developing countries to compete in the emerging market for biological resources while also reducing transaction costs , increasing demand for biochemical resources , and enhancing conservation incentives .  
As a comprehensive decision , the legal status must include the regulation of questions of navigation , the use of biological and mineral resources , and ecology , including the rise in the sea level and the definition of the jurisdictional limits of the littoral States .  
They recognize each other 's right to carry out activities with a view to exploiting the mineral and biological resources of the Caspian Sea and shall exchange concrete proposals on the development of mutually advantageous cooperation in accordance with an agreed programme , including geophysical and geological survey activities and the exploitation of hydrocarbon deposits , bearing in mind the experience and capabilities of the Parties .  
The conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources should be integrated into national forest programmes ;  
" Respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge , innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices " ( art . ) ;  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
It is to be hoped that the scientifically advanced nations will effectively control the use of scientific progress by their nationals or public authorities and prevent any use detrimental to the natural wealth and the human , genetic and biological resources of the less developed nations or to the individual freedom and privacy of their citizens , especially with respect to trade in and management of waste materials .  
The Commission came to the unequivocal conclusion that Iraq had in fact produced biological weapons , that its biological programme was offensive in nature , that Al Hakam had been constructed as a dedicated biological warfare agent research and production facility and had been operational before January 1991 , and that additional sites , including Muthanna , a known chemical weapons establishment , were involved in the programme .  
The destruction of large chemical weapons stocks and of the sprawling biological weapons facility at Al Hakam , the neutralization of wide-ranging and diverse missile capabilities as well as the creation of a unique and effective monitoring and verification system are tangible examples of accomplishments over five and a half years .  
The GEF provides new and additional grants and funding to meet the incremental costs of measures to achieve global environmental benefits in four focal areas : ( a ) the protection of biological diversity , ( b ) the reduction of greenhouse gases , ( c ) the protection of international waters , and ( d ) the protection of the ozone layer .  
The legal status of the Caspian Sea must be based on the generally recognized rules and principles of international law and the international treaty practice of States situated on the shores of similar bodies of water and include the regulation of questions of navigation , the use of biological and mineral resources , the ecology , including changes in the sea level , etc . , and the definition of the jurisdictional limits of the littoral States on the basis of respect for their sovereign rights over their respective parts and sectors of the Caspian Sea .  
The Parties recognize each other 's rights and the rights of each of the littoral States to carry out activities connected with the exploitation of the mineral and biological resources in their respective parts and sectors of the Caspian Sea , and they will exchange concrete proposals on the development of mutually advantageous cooperation , including geophysical and geological survey activities and the exploitation of hydrocarbon deposits , bearing in mind the experience and capabilities of the Parties .  
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , the provision of financial resources , technology transfer , respect for each country 's intellectual property rights , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , in particular for the developing countries ,  
Recalling the long-standing determination of the international community to achieve the effective prohibition of the development , production , stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons as well as the continuing support for measures to uphold the authority of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating , Poisonous or Other Gasses , and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare , signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 , [ 1 ] / as expressed by consensus in many previous resolutions ,  
SBSTTA has recommended that this expert group should concentrate on determining the following areas where the Biodiversity Convention can have the greatest effect : integrated marine and coastal area management , marine and coastal protected areas , sustainable use of coastal and marine living resources , mariculture and alien species . 193 Other items of particular note discussed by SBSTTA included the economic valuation of biological diversity and its components , in particular in relation to access to genetic resources ( art . 15 of the Convention ) .  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;

Recalling the long-standing determination of the international community to achieve the effective prohibition of the development , production , stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons as well as the continuing support for measures to uphold the authority of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating , Poisonous or Other Gases , and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare , signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 , [ 49 ] as expressed by consensus in many previous resolutions ,  
CHAVES ( Costa Rica ) , speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China , said that desertification and drought were global problems caused by the interaction of topographical , biological , cultural , political , social and economic factors . 
Although the sciences of biology and law seem far apart and unrelated , being regarded as two distinct cultures , in actual fact the concerns of law are closely interlinked with those of biology , particularly after the tremendous achievements made by biological science in the modification , removal and replacement of human genes and the positive or negative improvement of offspring .  
To this end , every State must take the requisite legislative measures to ensure that the law intervenes by placing restrictions and controls on the biological sciences so that these restrictions and controls can help to curb scientific progress that has an adverse effect on human values and creates legal and ethical problems .  
" Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , the provision of financial resources , technology transfer , respect for each country 's intellectual property rights , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , in particular for the developing countries ,  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
Much attention is still given to timber and forest cover , whereas other goods and services provided by forests such as fuelwood , [ the sustainable use , conservation and equitable sharing of benefits of ] biological diversity , soil and water conservation protection functions , carbon sequestration and other social , cultural and economic aspects are rarely covered and will need more attention .  
The Panel recognized the importance of the [ global ] services provided by forests relating to , for example , biological diversity and climate [ change ] [ regulation ] , and the potential for developing mechanisms to translate these values into [ financial support ] [ monetary terms ] to encourage forest [ owners ] [ dwellers , indigenous populations and local communities ] to [ conserve and ] sustainably manage forests .  
These should fully recognize the ecological , social , cultural and [ religious ] [ spiritual ] values of forests [ and pay particular attention to global dimensions of climate change and the sustainable use , conservation and equitable sharing of the benefits of biological diversity . ]  
Criteria and indicators for application at the national level should be [ simple , ] [ practical , ] scientifically based and cost effective and reflect , inter alia , economic , social , biological and ecological circumstances . 
In view of the special features of biological weapons and the complicated technical factors involved , efforts should be made to realistically formulate relevant definitions , criteria and lists ; clearly delineate activities prohibited and permitted under the Convention ; and , on this basis , explore effective and feasible verification measures , together with measures aimed at preventing abuse , protecting commercial secrets and reducing unnecessary interference in normal scientific research and industrial activities .  
Similarly , the continued existence of stocks of prohibited fissile material for the production of prohibited nuclear weapons and of the illicit traffic in weapons of mass destruction , particularly biological and chemical weapons , remains a source of deep concern and threatens the stability and security of countries and entire regions .  
The highest priority for the international community , therefore , should continue to remain the ultimate and complete elimination of nuclear weapons as was laid down in the Final Document of SSOD I . The agenda should also include measures on the elimination of the other weapons of mass destruction , in particular chemical and biological weapons , through the full implementation of relevant disarmament treaties . 
In themselves such weapons threaten an imbalance in nature , and many of the biological agents that can be used as weapons are capable of frustrating all the efforts made in previous decades to eradicate diseases that are highly contagious and extremely dangerous to human health worldwide .  
At its third session , held in Argentina in November 1996 , the Conference of Parties to the Convention decided on a future programme of work for terrestrial biological diversity , and requested the Executive Secretary of the Convention secretariat to develop , in consultation and with the assistance of the Panel , or any successor arrangement , a focused work programme on forest biodiversity that would place an emphasis on research .  FAO has a forest genetic resources programme that has been developed over the past three decades .  
Recalling the long-standing determination of the international community to achieve the effective prohibition of the development , production , stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons as well as the continuing support for measures to uphold the authority of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating , Poisonous or Other Gases , and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare , signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 , [ 48 ] as expressed by consensus in many previous resolutions ,  
For many of today 's major environment and development concerns , the sciences ( including the social and human sciences ) are essential in detecting and analysing the problem , in identifying solutions and in ensuring scientifically sound action .  This has been particularly evident for the ozone depletion issue , and increasingly also for other issues such as climate change , erosion of biological diversity and water and coastal pollution .  
Some other issues that will require increased research activities in the future are related to ( a ) the pathways of man-made chemicals , in particular toxic chemicals , in ecosystems , agro-ecosystems and the global biosphere and the possible undesirable biological effects in humans and animals subsisting often far away from the source point ; and ( b ) interdisciplinary research on re-emerging tropical and subtropical diseases conditioned by particular environments and vectors .  1 Report of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , vol .  
The objectives of the work programme are , first , to promote the positive effects and mitigate the negative impacts of agricultural practices on biological diversity in agro-ecosystems and their interface with other ecosystems ; second , to promote the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources of actual or potential value for food and agriculture ; and third , to promote the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources .  
Following the momentum set at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , but going even further , the CBD as a process is open to " participants " and is not confined to Governments . 21 The Convention 's rules of procedure define participants in a broad manner which essentially encompasses all of the major groups identified in section III of Agenda 21 , so long as they can demonstrate that they are qualified in fields relating to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity . 
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
The Commission recognized that particular attention should be focused on the holistic approach towards environmental and developmental functions of forests ; sustainable forest management ; conservation of biological diversity ; conservation of soil and water resources ; restoration ; forest products and services ; and participation of major groups , particularly indigenous people and local communities .  
It noted the statement annexed to decision II / 9 of the Conference of the Parties to that Convention , and accepted that the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from research and development and from the commercial utilization of biological resources fell , inter alia , within the purview of the Convention .  
Much attention is still given to timber and forest cover , whereas other goods and services provided by forests , such as fuelwood , the sustainable use and conservation and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits of biological diversity , soil and water protection functions , and carbon sequestration and sinks , as well as other social , cultural and economic aspects , are rarely covered and need to be considered .  
The Panel recognized the importance of the services provided by forests , including those relating to biological diversity and global climate regulation , and the potential for developing mechanisms to translate those values into monetary terms to encourage forest owners , forest dwellers , indigenous populations and local communities to conserve forests and manage them sustainably .  
During the last two years only , the inspections have led to the unmasking of : a complete biological weapons development and production programme ; highly sophisticated and advanced work on the extremely lethal chemical warfare nerve agent VX ; and the multifaceted domestic development and production of Scud-type missile engines under Iraq 's project 1728 .  
Acknowledging that biological resources could also be region-specific or shared by more than one member country , and acknowledging also the difficulties in securing fully effective enforcement of regulations of transfer , particularly because very small quantities of genetic material are sufficient for research and development purposes and that there is the possibility that these can cross borders undetected ,  
Recalling further its resolution 1996 / 16 , in which it requested the Secretary _ General to submit a report on information gathered on the use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel _ air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium and their consequential and cumulative effects and the danger they represent to life , physical security and other human rights ,  
Continuing the international dialogue on the issues of conservation and sustainable use of coastal and marine biodiversity and agricultural biological diversity was also very important , since both issues were essential to food security , which was the focus of the forthcoming World Food Summit ; the work being undertaken by the Intergovernmental Panel on forests was likewise crucial to that discussion .  
His Government reaffirmed its commitment to protecting the global climate and conserving biological diversity for present and future generations and felt that the international community should recognize that , to preserve the planet , global willingness to tackle the task was essential ; if action was delayed , the cost could be devastating . 
After peaceful relations and reconciliation are established among all States in the region , Israel will endeavour to establish in the Middle East _ through direct negotiations among all its members _ a zone free of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons , as well as ballistic missiles , based on mutual and effective verification .  
Indeed , Israel has been actively supporting and participating in efforts of the international community to prevent the proliferation of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles , not least through export control mechanisms , inspired by those of the Nuclear Suppliers Group ( NSG ) , the Australian Group ( AG ) , and the Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ) , of which Israel is an adherent .  
As the tensions which reflected the cold war era give way to growing global confidence and cooperation , the international community should now turn more of its attention and energies towards many as yet unresolved regional conflicts , which are characterized by unprecedented conventional arms build _ ups and , in some instances , also by the Clandestine pursuit of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons .  
With a view to promoting peace and strengthening security in the Mediterranean region , the new Government of Malta has time and time again committed itself to a foreign policy that is based on the values of democratic governance , on the upholding of fundamental human rights , on the peaceful settlement of disputes and on a policy that is in favour of disarmament and strongly opposes military aggression , and the manufacture , distribution and proliferation of all types of armaments and weapons , especially weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological .  
It stood for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , the prohibition of the development of outer space weapons , and the reduction of conventional weapons to a rational level .  
My country , Senegal , feels that , apart from the potential for destruction presented by nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , security problems are equally linked to conventional armaments in numerous conflicts and tensions raging throughout the world , especially in Africa .  
Within this framework , the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms must , if it is to be successful , be expanded to include information on other categories of armaments that are not currently covered , such as nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , in addition to advanced technology with military applications .  
The Movement observed that in his note the Secretary-General expressed the view that weapons of mass destruction continued to be of primary importance despite significant progress achieved to outlaw chemical and biological weapons and to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regimes .  
We make these appeals not as an annual ritual but because of our deep conviction that the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , will go a long way to promote international peace and security , a principal purpose for which this Organization was established .  
After the establishment , as we hope , of peace treaties between Israel and every country of the region , it will be possible to create a regional security system that would provide multilateral and shared solutions to the range of security problems in the Middle East , including a mutually and effectively verifiable Middle East free of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles .  
All of this madness has revived official and covert operations , mercenaries , spies and assassins , as ready now as in the worst days of the cold war to plot and unleash terror against human beings and even employ aggressive biological agents against our economy .  
The application of double standards in the area of non-proliferation and the employment of non-transparent and exclusive export control mechanisms in the areas of nuclear , chemical and biological technology for peaceful uses are most destructive of international confidence and security .  
That will be possible only if the Security Council shoulders its full legal and political responsibilities : to defend its resolutions without applying double standards , especially since Israel , as we all know , continues to possess weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , that pose a threat to regional and international peace and security .  
Issues of biosafety have emerged with regard to national capacity needed for the implementation of effective in situ conservation measures , through establishing and maintaining the means to regulate , manage or control risks associated with invasive species and / or the use and release of living modified organisms resulting from biotechnology and likely to have adverse environmental impacts on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
The global community has also made considerable progress in recognizing the contributions to sustainable agriculture of the conservation and sustainable use of agricultural biological diversity , as reflected , for example , in the decision of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity at its third meeting to establish a multi-year programme of activities on the sustainable use of agricultural biological diversity , aiming , inter alia , to promote the positive and mitigate the negative effects of agricultural practices on biological diversity .  
I also consider it important to note that , at its substantive session of 1995 , the Economic and Social Council approved the report of the Commission on Sustainable Development on the work of its third session , in which , in its discussion of progress in implementing Agenda 21 , the Commission recognized that mountain ecosystems and environments are of crucial importance as rich and unique centres of biological and cultural diversity , water stores and sources of minerals . 
The joint scientific research programme conducted during the 21st expedition included experiments relating to the vital functions of the human organism , microgravity , basic biological research , advanced technologies and Earth sciences .  
My Government is fully confident that , provided there is political will , tangible action addressing conventional weapons would not be beyond the scope either of the ability or the competence of a forum that has to its credit the successful negotiation of bans on whole categories of weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons .  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
The use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel-air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium , like the dumping of other toxic and dangerous chemicals and wastes in the developing countries , violates the rights to life , health , physical security and other human rights , such as economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development .  
In this context , our Government has implemented programmes for combating desertification , expanding green areas and developing biological diversity systems , and we have established research centres to develop genetic strains of flora and fauna adapted to our harsh environmental conditions .  
The reaffirmation contained in the Final Document of the Fourth Review Conference is of special importance to Cuba , in that the use by States parties , in any way and under any circumstances , of microbial or other biological agents or toxins that is not consistent with prophylactic , protective or other peaceful purposes , is effectively a violation of article I of the Convention .  
Recalling further its resolution 1996 / 16 , in which it requested the Secretary _ General to submit a report on information gathered on the use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel _ air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium and their consequential and cumulative effects and the danger they represent to life , physical security and other human rights ,  
The threats posed by weapons of mass destruction are far from being extinguished , and the consequences of miscalculation or deliberate acts can be horrific , as we know from the terrorist activities of a cult group armed with nerve gas in Japan , biological and toxin weapons in Iraq and persistent reports and risks of nuclear smuggling .  
The international collaborative exercises constitute the first phase of the international quality assurance programme , carried out by UNDCP , in which participating laboratories are requested , twice a year , to analyse unknown samples of seized material and / or biological specimens .  
We have to address as a matter of priority the three most immediate dangers identified by the Commission : the overexploitation of marine biological resources , the dumping of toxic waste and the harmful effects of global warming .  
With water a primary agent in maintaining human health and transmitting disease , the imperative remains to manage all freshwater sources to maintain chemical and biological quality within minimum acceptable standards .  
With water as a primary agent in maintaining human health and transmitting disease , there is an imperative need to manage land and freshwater sources to maintain chemical and biological quality to minimum acceptable standards .  
Natural hazards have thus been defined as extreme geophysical events , biological processes and major technological accidents , characterized by concentrated releases of energy or materials that pose a largely unexpected threat to humans .  
In that case , Iraq had refused to accede to a request by a chief inspector to be furnished with a copy of a document highly pertinent to obtaining a verifiable material balance of Iraq 's munitions filled with chemical or biological agents .  
Within this increasingly ambiguous and interdependent environment , lives progress along many planes biological , psychological , societal , political , cultural and spiritual .  
The team recommended that no further verification of Iraq 's current biological weapons full , final and complete disclosure be conducted at the senior international expert level , until Iraq commits itself to provide substantive , new information .  
No one can deny that the negative trends of these last decades of the twentieth century are slow to reverse .  These include growing poverty , the marginalization of hundreds of millions of people , the precarious state of natural resources , the degradation of biological diversity , the destruction of forests , worsening pollution , rampant desertification , and so many other examples .  
However , considering the value of these forests to local populations , it will be difficult to adequately identify quality changes , especially change in species composition and biological diversity , which is mostly induced by the common practice of selective cutting of highly valuable trees .  
A protected area may be defined as an area of land and / or sea especially dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity , and of natural and associated cultural values , and managed through legal or other effective means .  
Urged countries with low forest cover to establish or expand networks of protected areas , buffer zones and ecological corridors , where possible , in order to conserve biological diversity , particularly in unique types of forests , working in close liaison with the parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant international environmental agreements .  
As a result , a considerable proportion of the biological diversity most in need of protection has not been protected ; existing data on the worlds protected areas suggests that evergreen sclerophyllous , temperate and boreal forests are generally poorly represented .  
The selection and management of additional protected forest areas should be based on their value as representative or unique forest types ; their potential to generate information on ecological processes ; the conservation of biological diversity and ecosystem services ; and due consideration to the livelihoods of the communities depending on them .  
Encourage countries , with support from international organizations , to develop and implement polices which adequately value non-market forest benefits in economic terms ; recognize the real social and economic values of forest environmental services ; recognize native forests as a capital resource and invest accordingly in preventing their depletion ; seek to maintain overall biological diversity ; and ensure that harvests do not exceed ecologically sustainable levels ;  
Request countries , with the support of international organizations , particularly UNEP and the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) , to make a comprehensive assessment of the current status of protected forest areas , including total number , extent of each area , objectives of establishment , effectiveness of management , IUCN system equivalent category , and basic biological and social information available ; 
Article 8 ( j ) is also directly related to three other provisions of the Convention : article 10 ( c ) , dealing with customary use of biological resources ; article 17.2 , dealing with exchange of information relevant to indigenous and traditional knowledge ; and articles 18.4 and 15 , dealing with technical and scientific cooperation , including indigenous and traditional technologies and access to genetic resources , respectively .  
The Panel recognized that the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from research and development and from the commercial utilization of biological resources fell , inter alia , within the purview of the Convention .  
The Convention established , early on , a process to ensure that knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity were considered in all relevant sectoral and thematic areas in the implementation of the Convention .  
The principle of prior informed consent is also embedded in the wording of article 8 ( j ) , whereby , subject to national legislation , the wider application of the knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity should only occur with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge , innovations and practices . 
They may also take into account the application of appropriate sui generis legislation ( for which a number of models now exist ) , as well as using provisions under existing national and subnational laws governing such matters as land tenure , cultural heritage and local government , which frequently contain provisions for regional agreements and permit regimes ( governing access to indigenous / local community lands , research and collection of components of biological diversity etc . ) . 
In view of the fact that the two types of weapons of mass destruction of biological and chemical weapons have been comprehensively prohibited , there is no reason why nuclear weapons , which are of greater destructive force , should not be comprehensively banned and thoroughly destroyed .  
On fisheries and other marine living resources , participants stressed the crucial importance in much of the world of ensuring continuing sustainable supply of food from the oceans and seas ( a matter of particular moment for many communities in developing countries ) as well as the need to protect marine biological diversity .  
The GEF with its focus on additional concessional funding to meet incremental costs of projects of global benefits in the four focal areas of climate change , biological diversity , the ozone layer and international waters has a special and growing role .  
The readiness demonstrated by the Arab States to take practical steps towards the establishment of an effectively verifiable Middle East zone free from all weapons of mass destruction - nuclear , chemical and biological - and to refrain from taking any measures that preclude the achievement of this objective in accordance with paragraph 5 of the 1995 resolution on the Middle East as well as paragraph 14 of Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) should not go unnoticed .  
The proceedings of the workshop , which contain detailed presentations on past and current environmental studies related to deep seabed mining , as well as papers and discussions on the biological , chemical and physical environment of the seabed , will be published during 1999 .  
In the area of space technology it is planned , in the near future , to develop fundamental and experimental research in the area of weightlessness physics and to develop basic technologies for producing unique materials and biological preparations with properties unobtainable on Earth .  
The proceedings of the workshop , containing detailed presentations on past and current environmental studies related to deep seabed mining as well as papers and discussions on the biological , chemical and physical environment of the seabed , will be published during 1999 .  
Within this food and nutritional security plan , PAHO / WHO is promoting mechanisms to ensure the enforcement of existing legislation , as well as the technical norms of the World Trade Organization with respect to food quality , processing , biological , toxicological and nutritional protection and standards for industrial food products .  Agreements have been made with respect to the standardization of laws and support from regional ( i.e .  
Mr . Cabactulan ( Philippines ) said that more work was needed on the terms of reference for the Panel of Experts on Access and Benefit Sharing in order to ensure that the biological diversity within countries was carefully protected , while at the same time ensuring that such resources were utilized in a manner that fully respected the proprietary rights of indigenous communities and enabled the original developers in developing countries to share the benefits .  
The Caribbean region and sea possessed a number of unique features which justified according them priority attention : exceptional biological diversity , highly fragile ecosystems and heavy reliance by most of the countries of the region on the coastal land and marine environment in order to achieve sustainable development .  
In 1998 , the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity had recommended that member States should adopt a draft model legislation on access to biological resources at national level ; initiate a process of negotiation among African countries to adopt an African convention on biological diversity ; and develop a common position to safeguard their sovereign rights and the vital interests of local communities .  
In accordance with article 19 of the Convention , there was an urgent need to consider modalities for advance informed agreement outlining appropriate procedures in the field of safe transfer , handling and use of any a living modified organism resulting from biotechnology that might have adverse effects on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
Governments had expressed their determination to advance the negotiations , but the political will had been insufficient to put aside the purely economic and commercial interests and give priority to the potential risks that living modified organisms represented for health and for the conservation of the planets biological diversity .  
The State of Bahrain has put forward plans for two important projects in the field of biological diversity and integrated environmental management , with a view to obtaining financial and technical support through the Ministerial Conference of the small island developing States of the Atlantic Ocean , the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean , held in Malta in November 1998 .  
The Commission emphasizes the fundamental fact that oceans and seas constitute the major part of the planet that supports life , drive the climate and hydrological cycle , and provide the vital resources to be used to ensure well-being for present and future generations and economic prosperity , to eradicate poverty , to ensure food security and to conserve marine biological diversity and its intrinsic value for maintaining the conditions that support life on earth . 
On fisheries and other marine living resources , participants stressed the crucial importance in much of the world of ensuring continuing sustainable supply of food from the oceans and seas ( a matter of particular moment for many communities in developing countries ) as well as the need to protect marine biological diversity .  
That region has suffered from brutal and savage conflicts for many years , most recently Iraq ' s wanton and brutal invasion of Kuwait , and the continuous threat to neighbouring countries posed by the Iraqi regime ' s use of chemical and biological weapons against its own people in northern Iraq .  
The main adverse impacts of tourism on the environment are connected to pressure on natural resources , harm to wildlife and habitats ( with associated loss of biological diversity ) , the generation of pollution and wastes , and social and cultural pressures related to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
The Strategy presents an innovative , proactive and coordinated approach to halt and reverse the degradation of biological and landscape diversity values in Europe and to promote the integration of such considerations into social and economic sectors .  
It still dumps nuclear waste in the occupied Arab territories and continues its programme of developing all kinds of weapons of mass destruction , biological or chemical , because of the worlds inaction and the double standards that the great Powers apply .  
Our efforts in biological and chemical weapons , in verifying conventional arms levels and in pursuing collective security arrangements are all an essential backdrop to creating the conditions for complete nuclear disarmament .  
With water as a primary agent in maintaining both human health and transmitting disease , there is an imperative need to manage land and freshwater sources to maintain chemical and biological quality to minimum acceptable standards .  
The knowledge and wisdom of indigenous and local communities is critical to the conservation and management of much of the worlds biological diversity and natural resources and can add value to contemporary , scientific ways of thinking .  
Sanctions should be restricted to the acquisition of arms , military equipment and dual-use materials as stipulated in relevant Security Council resolutions , especially the resolutions relating to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , be they nuclear , chemical or biological , and of any other military potential that might endanger the sovereignty , safety , security and stability of neighbouring countries .  
The aim of the Recommendations for Guidance is to define the biological , chemical , geological and physical components to be measured and the procedures to be followed by the Contractor to ensure the effective protection of the marine environment from harmful effects which may arise from its activities in the Area , and to provide guidance to prospective contractors in preparing plans of work for exploration for polymetallic nodules .  
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
Aware also that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that the eradication of poverty in developing countries depends on the implementation of policies directed towards conservation and the sustainable use of biological resources ,  
Aware that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that concerns have been expressed with respect to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
To do this , we must : ( i ) maintain the integrity of ecosystems and the continued health of the planets life-support system which sustain the productivity , adaptability of renewal of all life ; ( ii ) maintain biological diversity in the variety of life on which ecological processes depend processes that provide a stream of current and future benefits to human beings ; and ( iii ) ensure sustainable population dynamics ( size of population , growth rate and distribution ) , as it often exerts pressures on the environment .  
Aware that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that concerns have been expressed with respect to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
At the national level , his Group and China supported the following recommendations made by the experts : raising awareness of the role and value of traditional knowledge and its contribution to the development process ; promoting , where appropriate , the commercialization of traditional knowledge-based products and services , involving indigenous and local communities in that endeavour , consistent with the sustainable use of biological resources ; and exploring suitable instruments , including sui generis systems for the protection of traditional knowledge .  
Moreover , the international community must take action to bolster existing mechanisms and instruments and to set out a specific timetable for the successive stages of general disarmament and for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction nuclear , chemical and biological in particular .  
The international community continues to witness an accelerated race to develop strategic nuclear reactors for military purposes and increase the range and power of ballistic missiles and rockets with nuclear , chemical and biological warheads despite the pledges of the heads of State and Government at the Millennium Summit last year for , among other things , the gradual multilateral reduction of arsenals of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction .  
We note with the deepest concern the close connections between international terrorism and the illegal movement of nuclear , chemical , biological and other deadly materials , as a paramount threat to international peace and security at the dawn of the new millennium .  
Accordingly , the political reality in our region mandates a practical step-by-step approach , culminating in a comprehensive peace and the eventual establishment of a mutually verifiable zone free of ballistic missiles and of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .  
Our close cooperation becomes urgent when it is realized that a small group of terrorists can actually possess weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , biological and chemical ones , and destroy large areas of the world and millions of innocent people with wilful abandon , senselessly and indiscriminately .  
Recognizing further the close connection between international terrorism and illicit arms-trafficking and the illegal movement of nuclear , chemical , biological and other potentially deadly materials ,  
To foster cooperation aimed at achieving the conservation and sustainable management of the regions natural ecosystems for the purpose of deepening world commitments to conserve biodiversity in situ and to work to establish sustainable development plans in those ecosystems which incorporate , at the local level , the agreements that figure in all the relevant conventions and that provide for the creation and reinforcement of protected areas and biological corridors and for the promotion of sustainable production activities . 
When the patent protects a plant , animal or other organism capable of reproduction , the holder may not prevent third parties from using that entity as an initial basis for obtaining new viable biological material and marketing the material thus obtained , except where repeated use of the patented material would be required in order to obtain such material ;  
The desert around Qinghai Lake is increasing at an average of 10.12 square kilometers annually .  Dunes , in particular , on the western bank of the lake came into being over the last decade and have become an area with the fastest desertification .  The wetland 's ecological system has been damaged with the biological diversity decreasing .  
Chen Jianwen , the researcher responsible for this research explained that X-ray computerized tomography ( CT ) is usually used in clinical medicine to determine the pathology of a biological tissue .  Nonetheless , compared with a normal tissue , the difference of absorbing the X-ray by an initial cancerous tissue is extremely small , making it impossible to reflect the absorption on an image .  Thus , it is very difficult to diagnose an initial stage cancer .  
Caohai is in the area controlled by the subtropical monsoon .  Caohai basin has high elevation and low latitude with an average yearly temperature of 11.6 degrees Celsius and an average yearly sunshine of 1,801 hours .  It has become a " paradise for migratory birds " and an ideal summer resort for its mild winter and cool summer , combined with many advantages such as abundant water flow , fertile land , densely-knitted swamps , and rich biological resources .  
We will further strengthen our four major pillar industries of the processing industry of agricultural and sideline products , the energy industry , the metallurgical industry , and the chemical industry ; speed up the development of our four dominant industries of rare earth , biological technology , information , and heavy-duty vehicles ; take the ideological emancipation as the guide , and uphold the principle that " development is the last word " ;  
In the fields of electronic information , new materials , biological engineering , integration of light , machines , and electricity [ guang ji dian yi ti hua , 0342-2623-7193-0001-7555-0553 ] , new energy sources , and environmental protection , the high-tech zones are more and more becoming important bases for the development of China 's high-tech industries and have played a active role in promoting industrial restructuring and in leading forward sustained economic development .  
Wang Yusheng said : Among all the biological events on earth , the most striking and most sensational events of biological extinction are actually not frightening and are very normal as far as the natural process of biological succession is concerned , because the new superseding the old is a general law of organic evolution .  
In order to develop the capacity for protection against nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , an anti-chemical warfare corps school was set up 50 years ago to train anti-chemical warfare cadres for the armed forces .  This raised the curtain of the building of the anti-chemical warfare corps in New China . In the past 50 years , our armed forces have organized troops with a relatively high quality to deal with nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .  
Serial equipment and complete sets of equipment for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons in field operation can dash about in toxic and contaminated areas under all circumstances .  This has provided a firm material basis for increasing the capacity of our armed forces for protection against nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .  
With the efforts made in the past years , a system for training a new type of anti-chemical-warfare capable personnel has been formed in our armed forces .  At present , major combat equipment , including tanks , airplanes and vessels can better resist nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , and both the armed forces and the civilian basically have complete sets of equipment for protection against such weapons .  
The equipment for the mass defense of military units is in the main complete with quality reaching a good standard .  The preventive capability by specialized anti-chemical warfare units and the overall preventive capability of the Army , the Navy , the Air Force and the Second Artillery Corps have all been significantly improved .  The military units ' fighting capability under the threat of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons has been significantly strengthened .  
At present , our military units have composite decontamination equipment , multifunctional and rapid decontamination equipment , and one-man decontamination equipment , thus forming a complete equipment system .  Such a system , which is comprehensive in function and in technical means , can do a good job in decontaminating the pollution caused by nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons .  Our military units can enter an area contaminated by nuclear and chemical pollution to carry out decontamination work .  
Pilotless combat planes can complete various missions without the limitations set by the human body , such as approaching close to forward positions , carrying ground tracking sensors , synthetic aperture radar sensors , moving target indicators , and so on , or else doing on-the-spot monitoring of chemical and biological substances .  
The first possibility that Bush considered was to established ship-based interceptors , because the technology of ship-based interception is relatively realistic and mature , and in addition such interceptors can enable the United States to detect incoming enemy missiles earlier , and the fragments of the intercepted missiles ( including any chemical or biological warheads ) will fall on the country that launches them instead of on the United States .  
On 20 April 2000 , Japan 's House of Representatives approved " Amendment to the Law on Formation of Defense Agency " and decided to set up several new research posts in the Defense Agency , including those for research on nuclear weapons , biological weapons research , and other special weapons as well .  It also decided to set up a research forum for nonmilitary experts on medical science and military science .  
Third , thanks to the close cooperation between the key techniques developed during the implementation of the " 863 " Project and the industrial circle , China has created products with its own intellectual property rights in such hot point fields of international high-tech competition as biological engineering medicine , communications equipment , high-performance computers , Chinese information processing platform , artificial crystal , photoelectron material and apparatuses .  
The operational concept of " full dimensional protection " which was proposed by the US military in 1996 calls for the establishment of both offensive and defensive measures to deal with information warfare , guided missiles , and nuclear , biological , and chemical weapons of mass destruction .  
These officials believe that the new US administration has two " nails in the eye and thorns in the flesh " : The first is what Americans say is Iraq 's concealed underground biological and chemical weapons stores , and the second is the nuclear command centers which , they say , Russia is hurrying to build , hidden deep in the mountains .  
A kind-hearted girl unexpectedly hurt people with a knife , a loving father went as far as laying his murderous hands on his beloved son , and a student of good standing in both character and academic performance went as far as waving a sharp sword against his biological father . . .  
Compared to ordinary fighters , the unmanned Stealth fighter is more suited to carrying out highly difficult missions , such as long-range surprise attacks on enemy targets with dense air defenses , sneak attacks on enemy biological and chemical weapon bases , and interception of cruise missiles , and so on .  
During the visit , Jiang Zemin listened in detail to the account given by President Wang Dazhong . With great interest , Jiang saw the digital television launching and receiving system and the special chips used for the system with China 's own intellectual property rights , the 500-meter-long high temperature superconductor material , biological material , and other products .  He also asked about the scientific research network for China 's education , application of low temperature heat reactors , and optical communications .  
The article notes that while the United States indeed faces certain new threats in the " new strategic environment " that has appeared after the Cold War , the main threat the United States faces today is not intercontinental ballistic missiles , but terrorism , such as the ignition of chemical , biological , or nuclear weapons that terrorists have smuggled into US ports . 
By the end of May 2001 , the park had invested an accumulated total of over 8 billion yuan on the construction of its infrastructure , had used $ 4.2-billion of foreign capital , carried out construction on an area of 12 square km , completed the construction of high-level infrastructure , initially set up groups of advanced and high-tech industries with the electronics , information , precision machines , biological pharmaceutics and new materials industries as their core , and established a new management structure and operation mechanism .  
The two parties will cooperate in protecting and improving the environment , in preventing cross-border pollution , in the fair and rational use of biological resources in waters in the border area and in the north Pacific and border river courses , and will work together to protect rare plants and animals and the natural ecological system in the border areas , and cooperate in preventing natural disasters and major accidents arising from technical causes and in eliminating their consequences .  
We should develop industries with distinctive local characteristics , placing our focus on the development of tourism , Tibetan medicine , biological industry and green foodstuffs industry with special plateau features , processing industry of farm products and animal by-products , national handicraft industry , mining industry , and construction and building material industry ; take large strides in improving the development speed , scale , and efficiency of these industries ; and turn them into new economic growth areas .  
Protecting and improving the environmental conditions , making fair and rational use of waters in the border region and biological resources in the north Pacific and in border river courses , and protecting plants and animals and preventing natural disasters in the border regions - - all these are new fields in which the two countries can cooperate .  
During night flights , head winds are strong , temperatures are high , the biological clock is in disorder , physical conditions change greatly , a wrong impression of apparent distance happens easily , and pilots need to use multiple levels of skills .  Considering these technical problems and difficulties , this squadron has paid attention to the scientific basis of technical preparations and the safety of flight training .  
Many large-scale military exercises have shown the newest achievements that China 's military has obtained from the traditional " three attacks and three defenses " - - attacking tanks , planes , and airborne troops , and defending against nuclear , chemical , and biological attacks - - to the " new three attacks and three defenses " of attacking stealth aircraft , cruise missiles , and helicopter gun ships , and defending against precision strikes , electronic jamming , and reconnaissance and surveillance .  
On this occasion , on the issue of biological weapons , the Bush Administration uses the excuse that the stipulations of the draft agreement of the protocol , regarding verification and inspection , might threaten US commercial and military secrets , leading to the adoption of an opposition standpoint , in total disregard for the appeals and great efforts of the international community ; this has once again demonstrated that the Bush Administration is determined to obstinately cling to its course and disregard the opposition of the international community .  
Second , we should actively promote the research of high technologies of strategic significance , and launch major and important engineering projects using new and high technologies .  To bring about a leap forward in the development of productive forces in our country , we should keep abreast of the new development trend of the world 's high technologies and related industries ; intensify our strategic studies of high technologies in such key fields as information technology , biological technology , new material technology , advanced manufacturing and automation technology , and marine technology ;  
and resolve a number of problems currently facing our economic development , including an irrational industrial structure , a low industrialization level of new and high technologies , and poor market competitiveness .  We should stress launching a batch of engineering projects using new and high technologies , which include high-performance computers , photoelectronic materials and apparatus , the design and manufacturing of submicroscopic and deep-submicroscopic integrated circuits , biological technologies and their industrialization , biochips , and agro-biological projects .  
Li Tieying pointed out : The western regions have rich hydropower , mineral , and biological resources and numerous sites of human civilization and natural scenery .  Many industries have established a good foundation in the regions .  
In doing the anti-drought work , we must make overall plans , take all factors into consideration , bring about temporary as well as permanent solutions to the problem , and give comprehensive treatment by combining engineering measures with biological measures and management measures , combining capital construction of water conservancy works with construction of ecological environment , and combining rational development with strict protection and scientific utilization in a bid to properly manage , protect , and utilize the limited water resources .  
The two sides are committed to a world free from nuclear , biological or chemical weapons .  They stressed that the international regime for eliminating and prohibiting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction should be permanently and indiscriminately applicable to all regions and countries with no exception .  
And at the same time both sides took note of the legitimate rights of any country for peaceful uses of nuclear energy , chemical and biological technology in a transparent manner under the supervision of the relevant international organizations .  
She made a successful maiden flight half a year ago ; though unmanned , she created favorable conditions , through various biological and man-carrying tests , for the final realization of a manned space flight .  
As for the orientation of industrial development , according to relevant sources , in the next five years , China will focus efforts on developing high-efficiency and high-quality agriculture and quickening the development of high and new technology industries , including the information industry , biological engineering , new energy sources , and new materials .  The traditional industries will be equipped with high technology .  The manufacturing and machine-building industries will be regenerated , and tertiary industry will also be developed actively .  
Thanks to this " three attacks and three defenses " training , all military units generally acquired the skills of attacking tanks , aircraft , and paratroopers and the skills of defending against nuclear attack , chemical warfare , and biological weapons .  At the same time , People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] training has developed by leaps and bounds as a result .  
To further intensify scientific and technological cooperation , the Chinese Government and the Japanese Government have decided to cooperatively develop a new round of 89 scientific and technological projects in the biological , nuclear energy , agricultural , medical , resources , and environmental protection fields .  
Wan Xueyuan said the " transmission of oil from the west to the east " would be a symbolic project in China 's development of the western region in the 21st century .  Meanwhile , the booming special industries in the western region , which include the rare earth industry in Inner Mongolia , the development of herbal and biological medicine in the western provinces , and tomato and safflower processing in Xinjiang , all badly need intellectual support .  
Second , we must help minority nationality areas in the country 's western region change their traditional way of thinking on the issue of economic development , adopt the principle of " establishing finite targets , and making advances in some fields while retreating from others , " make a full use of the advantages of the country 's western region in having a biological diversity and a nationality diversity , and build up an industrial structure and systems that enjoy distinguishing local features .  
We shall give greater support to the faster and better development of the central area of this province with Xian at the center , and turn this area into a core base for the great development of the western part of the country .  Northern Shaanxi will be developed into our country 's major sample zone for the sustainable development of energy sources and the building of the ecological environment .  The southern part of Shaanxi will be developed into a diversified economic zone for developing biological resources , tourist resources , and water resources .  
The licensing control on strategic commodities aims at ensuring Hong Kong 's continued access to high - technology goods and up-to-date technology which are essential for maintaining Hong Kong 's status as a regional centre of finance , trade , banking and telecommunication , and preventing Hong Kong from being used as a conduit for the proliferation of strategically - sensitive goods , arms , munitions or chemical / biological / nuclear weapons .  
( a ) An individual 's vulnerability to the development of emotional problems is affected by a variety of biological , psychological and socioeconomic factors , such as coexisting physical illness , a negative way of thinking in face of adversities or lack of social support .  
Despite this , the " neither large nor small " numbers of cases of these illnesses still leave people a little non-plussed when they see them . The threats to life and health from modern industrial society come from stress and environmental pollution - - cancer , heart disease , asthma , infertility , and other " diseases of modern civilization " caused by chemical or biological agents . Have n't these acute communicable illnesses transmitted by bacteria or viruses already been eradicated ?  
Aside from the direct economic loss to the human race of the trees as a source of timber , many people believe that if large numbers of Taiwan red pine exit Taiwan 's biological stage , it would be overoptimistic to think that in many areas of rugged terrain where native pines now grow , the original vegetation could be restored by voluntary tree planting campaigns .  
According to one recent report , a mallard flying south caught sight of the domesticated white Peking ducks on the pond of a duck farm in Kenting . Its biological cycle was suddenly thrown out of kilter , and it settled down there and stayed into spring , unwilling to leave .  
They can not only be used as a research tool in biological , medical and pharmaceutical research and development , and as a clinical diagnostic tool for doing health checks , testing for infectious pathogens , screening blood and so on , but they can also find uses in such areas as defense applications , police forensic work , environmental testing and food testing .  
But after the crabs branched off as a separate family , they diversified into a dizzying variety of different species . The bulk of the Crab Museum 's collection is made up of more than 700 crab species from Taiwan . However , the exhibits , which fill 36 large upright display cabinets , are not arranged by biological families and genera . Instead they are divided into interesting themes such as poisonous crabs , camouflage experts , outsize crabs , and the tastiest crabs to eat .  
But just as with other natural resources , the greatest microbiological riches are concentrated in developing countries , and these poor countries do not have the means to screen their own resources and develop useful biological agents . But the major pharmaceutical companies of Europe and North America have long been gathering rich pickings from these countries , by collecting large quantities of soil , humus and plant samples to use in the search for new drugs . This has brought them substantial profits , but in the past the countries owning the resources benefited little .  
NTU 's innovative multifunctional protein chip reader uses mature optical and semiconductor technology in which Taiwanese industry is well versed , and does not require the use of a fluorescence microscope . By shining infrared light onto a biochip at wavelengths of 800 to 2000 nanometers , the reader illuminates the biological molecules of all the probes on the chip and interprets them by detecting the reflected signals .  
In The Archaeology of Knowledge , French scholar Michel Foucault observes that as medicine has developed from diagnosis by visual inspection , auscultation and palpation to the use of the microscope and biological tests , its information system has been modified ; and how beside the physician there have appeared masses of data , instruments and analytical techniques which of course he uses , but which modify his position as an observing subject in relation to the patient .  
The reason is simple : " Because plants do not grow for us to eat them . " The cell structure of most biological materials is very durable , and not easily broken down . Therefore it is difficult for the matter inside to be released , much less absorbed into the human body .  
The risk of not having a place in the global disease warning network is reflected in Resolution 107 passed by the WHO Executive Board in 2001 , which reads in part : " The need for international cooperation on epidemic alert and response is greater today than ever before due to increased population movements , growth in international trade and biological products , changes in methods of food processing , and social and environmental changes . "  
However , even more worrying is the potential proliferation of nuclear , chemical , biological and ballistic missiles - the danger of their falling into the wrong hands .  
As agreed , separate expert groups in the chemical , biological , ballistic missile and nuclear areas met to pursue the objectives outlined above .  
In short , then , contemporary racism is a kind of anachronistic biological and cultural fundamentalism , given that the current trend of human societies is towards racial mixing and globalization . 
It had a crash programme to build a nuclear weapon in 1990-1991 ; it had weaponized live biological agents , including the deadly botulin and anthrax organisms , weapons never before used in warfare ; it produced a far greater quantity of chemical weapons , in more diverse forms , than it had previously admitted ; and it deliberately kept these documents hidden from the United Nations Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) , even as it was claiming that all information had been handed over .  
Civil and external wars could occur in regions where the possession of advanced weaponry , such as medium-range missiles with chemical , biological or even nuclear warheads , by ambitious and threatened regimes becomes a potentially lethal prospect . 
We had to identify which specialized areas or sporting disciplines to develop , bearing in mind , inter alia , young people 's traditions , Peru 's diverse climatic zones ranging from the high sierra to the tropical coast and the Amazon forest and , of course , the biological characteristics of Peru 's inhabitants .  
Fisheries by-catch and discards of by-catch are an increasing global economic , environmental and political concern , as States and relevant international organizations and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements attempt to rebuild depleted stocks , maintain biological diversity , protect endangered species and ensure maximum sustainable use of fishery resources .  
Apart from the obligations to prevent proliferation derived from the existing disarmament agreements , the European Union considers the measures taken on export controls to be useful instruments in the efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , their object being to stem proliferation without detriment to transfers of material , equipment and technology for peaceful purposes in the nuclear , chemical , biological and space-research fields .  
In the light of the special characteristics of biological weapons and the complexity of verification , it is imperative to discuss and formulate necessary definitions and objective criteria , including lists of bacteriological ( biological ) agents and toxins , so as to clearly differentiate the prohibited activities from those allowed .  Only on this basis can there be a meaningful exploration of effective and practicable verification measures .  
Calls upon all States in the Middle East to take practical steps in appropriate forums aimed at making progress towards , inter alia , the establishment of an effectively verifiable Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction , nuclear , chemical and biological , and their delivery systems , and to refrain from taking any measures that preclude the achievement of this objective .  
" Deeply concerned about the alarmingly high rate of loss of biological diversity , and determined to spare no effort for the conservation of the biological diversity and the sustainable use of its components , as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , " .  
Recognize and foster the traditional methods and the knowledge of indigenous people and their communities , emphasizing the particular role of women , relevant to the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of biological resources , and ensure the opportunity for the participation of those groups in the economic and commercial benefits derived from the use of such traditional methods and knowledge ;  
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity , and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reiterating the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of its components , as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources ,  
Productive use of such biological products as fuelwood , timber , fish , animal skins , musk , ivory , medicinal plants , honey , beeswax , fibres , gums , resins , rattans , construction materials , ornamentals , animals sold as game meat , fodder , mushrooms , fruits and dyes , can have a major impact on national economies .  14 .  Such values can be remarkably high .  
The objectives and activities contained in chapter 15 of Agenda 21 represent , therefore , a formidable challenge to Governments and relevant United Nations bodies , major groups and non-governmental organizations , among others , to improve the conservation of biological diversity and promote the sustainable use of biological resources , as well as to support the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant agreements in a coordinated and integrated manner .  
In the statement , the Conference noted that the Convention on Biological Diversity was the primary international legal instrument for advancing the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of genetic resources .  
It decided to establish an open-ended ad hoc group of experts to consider without undue delay the need for and modalities of a protocol , containing appropriate procedures to be followed in the field of the safe transfer , handling and use of any living modified organism resulting from biotechnology that might have an adverse effect on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
The international scientific community , in cooperation with Governments , entities within the United Nations system , and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , need to make efforts to develop economic tools for determining the costs and benefits of the conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use of biological resources , and their distribution at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
Call upon multilateral organizations and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to cooperate with Governments in developing a coordinating mechanism to ensure the effective implementation of existing conventions and agreements on biological diversity and the rational use of limited resources ;  
The main priorities of the programme on natural resources address issues relating to knowledge , the utilization and conservation of biological resources and diversity , the assessment of standing vegetation and its present and potential contribution to agricultural productivity , and the establishment of sustainable farming systems .  
The Joint FAO / ECE Working Party on Relations between Agriculture and the Environment currently examines various aspects and national practices related to biological diversity and landscape protection as part of its work-plan element entitled Economic , legal , technological and regulatory measures for the promotion of environmentally sustainable agriculture and production of healthy food " .  
The primary objective of the country studies programme initiated by UNEP is to assist national Governments to identify , in the light of social , economic , environmental and other objectives , the basic needs and levels of effective conservation , including the rational use of national biological resources and the necessary supportive measures and costs to meet those needs , as well as the benefits associated with the implementation of those measures .  
Other areas in which some progress has been made include the consideration of biological diversity ; the reservation of more primary forests ; the use of multi-purpose native species ; less regimented planting and management regimes for landscape and other environmental purposes ; the clear inclusion of forestry concerns into national sustainable development strategies ; and broadening end-use objectives beyond timber production to ecosystem management to sustain multiple benefits .  
The Convention on Biological Diversity is the primary international legal instrument for advancing the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of genetic resources , while recognizing the important role of other conventions to the objectives of the Convention .  
Supported by a relatively strong foundation in science and technology and a critical mass of skilled human resources in the field of biological sciences , many countries , especially those in Central and Eastern Europe , can , with appropriate and timely support from the international community , move forward rapidly in biotechnology development and its safe applications .  
Programmes dealing with biosafety have expanded beyond the scientific sector to include the concerns of workers exposed to biological agents in the workplace ( ILO ) , farmers ( FAO ) and the general public , while programmes on marine agricultural and industrial biotechnology call for closer cooperation among FAO , ILO , the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) , UNEP , UNIDO , WHO and the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) .  
To encourage environmentally sustainable agricultural practices while moving away from overdependence on agrochemicals , UNEP , in collaboration with FAO , UNESCO and other relevant organizations , supported the regional Microbial Resources Centres ( MIRCENs ) in Cairo , Nairobi , Dakar , and Porto Alegre in demonstrating on a pilot scale the use of biological nitrogen fixation ( BNF ) for enhancing soil fertility and increasing legume production at the small-farm level .  
Bioremediation of polluted groundwater , technologies for containing pollution , biological methods of treating pollution in the unsaturated zone above groundwaters contaminated by past industrial and military activities , and the treatment of extracted contaminated soil are among the topics of the regional ECE Seminar on the Prevention and Control of Groundwater Pollution to be held in September 1995 .  
The Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes ( Helsinki , 1992 ) contains binding obligations to parties to apply best available technologies for the treatment of industrial waste water containing hazardous substances , to apply at least biological treatment or equivalent processes for treating municipal waste water , and to carry out research on the development of new technologies and environmentally sound disposal practices .  
Further areas of concern related to biological weapons , new types of weapons of mass destruction , radiological weapons , limitation and reduction of conventional weapons and international arms transfers , the prevention of an arms race in outer space , curbing the naval arms race , naval armaments and disarmament , and reduction of military budgets .  
Acts of inhumanity , cruelty or barbarity directed against the life , dignity or physical or mental integrity of persons [ , in particular wilful killing , torture , mutilation , biological experiments , taking of hostages , compelling a protected person to serve in the forces of a hostile Power , unjustifiable delay in the repatriation of prisoners of war after the cessation of active hostilities , deportation or transfer of the civilian population and collective punishment ] ;  
The Working Group recognized that the Convention on Biological Diversity , which has now entered into force , will be the principal mechanism for advancing the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and provides an excellent basis for coordinating relevant instruments .  
Needless to say that these allegations are mainly propagated by a Government which has been the primary supporter and sponsor of Israel 's State-sponsored terrorism , of its aggressive policies , and of its production of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , and has also backed despotic Governments which have not experienced parliamentarianism , consultation and elections in their political life even for a single day .  
Negative effects of the sanctions are foreseen in the increased number of diseased and dead and , especially , through their delayed effect on the mental and physical development of schoolchildren and adolescents , leaving a lasting mark on the biological integrity of the population .  
Military doctrines of the States in the region should be exclusively defensive and in all respects adapted to the international agreements on restricted use of military force and non-use of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons ;  
Following on the plenary meeting , in a meeting devoted to Iraq 's biological weapons programme , Iraq for the first time disclosed a much more extensive programme than that contained in its full , final and complete disclosure of early August 1995 , admitting weaponization immediately prior to the outbreak of the Gulf war , including the filling of biological warfare agents into 166 bombs and 25 Al Hussein missile warheads .  
Strongly support United Nations , regional and national efforts on arms control , limitation and disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , in all aspects , and other weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons and other forms of particularly excessively injurious or indiscriminate weapons , in pursuit of our common commitment to a world free of all these weapons ;

special concern , in this regard , has been the need to determine the full extent of Iraq 's programmes and to seek verification of Iraq 's claims to have destroyed all proscribed weapons , in particular its stocks of agent VX and its precursors , operational missile systems , all of its biological warfare agent and all of the aerial bombs and missile warheads that Iraq states it filled with various chemical and biological agents in the period immediately preceding the Gulf War .  
The wealth of the Caspian Sea , its unique biological and mineral structure and fragile ecological system call for a comprehensive and balanced approach , free from short-term profit or political advantage .  
Faced with the threat to mankind posed by the rise in sea levels , global warming , creeping desertification and the disappearance of biological diversity , Benin attaches the utmost importance to implementation of all the agreements reached in Rio and , here , renews its commitment to doing all it can to ensure the success of the special session of the General Assembly planned for June 1997 to strengthen implementation of the decisions and recommendations of the Earth Summit contained in Agenda 21 .  
Given the persistence of such environmental problems as the lack of drinking water , threats to biological diversity , the depletion of the ozone layer , the warming of the atmosphere , the diminishing soil productivity , desertification and diminishing food security , Governments of both industrialized and developing countries must take joint , concerted action .  
Humanity can be sheltered from the tragedy of massively destructive wars only through the full and complete elimination of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons under effective international control .  
During this time , Member States that have participated in the deliberations have spoken on a wide range of issues surrounding that continent , especially its role and influence on the atmosphere , oceans , biological conditions of the entire global system and the fragility of its environment , which is vulnerable to the impact of human activities .  
An ever-increasing awareness that the ocean is a basic governing force for life on this planet , particularly for small island countries , and that better understanding of its physical and biological mechanisms , including their interaction with atmospheric processes , is essential to decision-making aiming at sustainable development ; 
The objective of programme element I . 3 is to make proposals that will encourage countries - in a manner consistent with the provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity - to consider ways and means whereby the traditional forest-related knowledge , innovations and practices of forest-dwellers and indigenous and local communities can be effectively protected with a view to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , and the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices can be shared fairly and equitably . 
The Convention on Biological Diversity addresses specifically the need to respect , preserve and maintain the knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , as well as the need to protect and encourage customary use of biological resources in accordance with traditional cultural practices .  
The Panel may also receive substantive inputs from the Convention following the third meeting of the Conference of the Parties on , inter alia , the underlying causes of biological diversity loss in forest ecosystems , components and dynamics of biological diversity , and ways and means for the effective protection and use of traditional forest-related knowledge , innovations and practices of forest-dwellers , indigenous and local communities , as well as fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from such knowledge , innovation and practices .  
The Convention on Biological Diversity addresses specifically the need to respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , as well as the need to protect and encourage customary use of biological resources in accordance with traditional cultural practices .  
More detailed analysis is required for assessing the applicability and reliability of valuation in the key situations in which valuation is important that are probably more central to the concerns of the Panel such as ( i ) utilization or conservation of primary , unmanaged or any other types of forests , ( ii ) establishment of reserves for biological diversity , ( iii ) carbon sequestration and ( iv ) international watersheds , among others ; 
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reiterating the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , and the sustainable use of its components , as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources ,  
Harvesting of priority products , especially in developed countries , was frequently combined with the provision of selected environmental services ( notably maintenance of the biological resource base , including the wildlife and the conservation of soil and water ) and , with efforts to enhance recreation and aesthetic values of forests and woodlands for an increasingly urbanized human population .  
The internationally accepted definition of a protected area is given as an area of land and / or sea that is especially dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity , as well as of natural and associated cultural resources , and that is managed through legal or other effective means .  
The Initiative has been designed as an integrated programme intended to increase the capabilities of developing countries to compete in the emerging market for biological resources while also reducing transaction costs , increasing demand for biochemical resources , and enhancing conservation incentives .  
As a comprehensive decision , the legal status must include the regulation of questions of navigation , the use of biological and mineral resources , and ecology , including the rise in the sea level and the definition of the jurisdictional limits of the littoral States .  
They recognize each other 's right to carry out activities with a view to exploiting the mineral and biological resources of the Caspian Sea and shall exchange concrete proposals on the development of mutually advantageous cooperation in accordance with an agreed programme , including geophysical and geological survey activities and the exploitation of hydrocarbon deposits , bearing in mind the experience and capabilities of the Parties .  
The conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources should be integrated into national forest programmes ;  
" Respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge , innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices " ( art . ) ;  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
It is to be hoped that the scientifically advanced nations will effectively control the use of scientific progress by their nationals or public authorities and prevent any use detrimental to the natural wealth and the human , genetic and biological resources of the less developed nations or to the individual freedom and privacy of their citizens , especially with respect to trade in and management of waste materials .  
The Commission came to the unequivocal conclusion that Iraq had in fact produced biological weapons , that its biological programme was offensive in nature , that Al Hakam had been constructed as a dedicated biological warfare agent research and production facility and had been operational before January 1991 , and that additional sites , including Muthanna , a known chemical weapons establishment , were involved in the programme .  
The destruction of large chemical weapons stocks and of the sprawling biological weapons facility at Al Hakam , the neutralization of wide-ranging and diverse missile capabilities as well as the creation of a unique and effective monitoring and verification system are tangible examples of accomplishments over five and a half years .  
The GEF provides new and additional grants and funding to meet the incremental costs of measures to achieve global environmental benefits in four focal areas : ( a ) the protection of biological diversity , ( b ) the reduction of greenhouse gases , ( c ) the protection of international waters , and ( d ) the protection of the ozone layer .  
The legal status of the Caspian Sea must be based on the generally recognized rules and principles of international law and the international treaty practice of States situated on the shores of similar bodies of water and include the regulation of questions of navigation , the use of biological and mineral resources , the ecology , including changes in the sea level , etc . , and the definition of the jurisdictional limits of the littoral States on the basis of respect for their sovereign rights over their respective parts and sectors of the Caspian Sea .  
The Parties recognize each other 's rights and the rights of each of the littoral States to carry out activities connected with the exploitation of the mineral and biological resources in their respective parts and sectors of the Caspian Sea , and they will exchange concrete proposals on the development of mutually advantageous cooperation , including geophysical and geological survey activities and the exploitation of hydrocarbon deposits , bearing in mind the experience and capabilities of the Parties .  
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , the provision of financial resources , technology transfer , respect for each country 's intellectual property rights , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , in particular for the developing countries ,  
Recalling the long-standing determination of the international community to achieve the effective prohibition of the development , production , stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons as well as the continuing support for measures to uphold the authority of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating , Poisonous or Other Gasses , and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare , signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 , [ 1 ] / as expressed by consensus in many previous resolutions ,  
SBSTTA has recommended that this expert group should concentrate on determining the following areas where the Biodiversity Convention can have the greatest effect : integrated marine and coastal area management , marine and coastal protected areas , sustainable use of coastal and marine living resources , mariculture and alien species . 193 Other items of particular note discussed by SBSTTA included the economic valuation of biological diversity and its components , in particular in relation to access to genetic resources ( art . 15 of the Convention ) .  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
Recalling the long-standing determination of the international community to achieve the effective prohibition of the development , production , stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons as well as the continuing support for measures to uphold the authority of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating , Poisonous or Other Gases , and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare , signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 , [ 49 ] as expressed by consensus in many previous resolutions ,  
CHAVES ( Costa Rica ) , speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China , said that desertification and drought were global problems caused by the interaction of topographical , biological , cultural , political , social and economic factors . 
Although the sciences of biology and law seem far apart and unrelated , being regarded as two distinct cultures , in actual fact the concerns of law are closely interlinked with those of biology , particularly after the tremendous achievements made by biological science in the modification , removal and replacement of human genes and the positive or negative improvement of offspring .  
To this end , every State must take the requisite legislative measures to ensure that the law intervenes by placing restrictions and controls on the biological sciences so that these restrictions and controls can help to curb scientific progress that has an adverse effect on human values and creates legal and ethical problems .  
" Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , the provision of financial resources , technology transfer , respect for each country 's intellectual property rights , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , in particular for the developing countries ,  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
Much attention is still given to timber and forest cover , whereas other goods and services provided by forests such as fuelwood , [ the sustainable use , conservation and equitable sharing of benefits of ] biological diversity , soil and water conservation protection functions , carbon sequestration and other social , cultural and economic aspects are rarely covered and will need more attention .  
The Panel recognized the importance of the [ global ] services provided by forests relating to , for example , biological diversity and climate [ change ] [ regulation ] , and the potential for developing mechanisms to translate these values into [ financial support ] [ monetary terms ] to encourage forest [ owners ] [ dwellers , indigenous populations and local communities ] to [ conserve and ] sustainably manage forests .  
These should fully recognize the ecological , social , cultural and [ religious ] [ spiritual ] values of forests [ and pay particular attention to global dimensions of climate change and the sustainable use , conservation and equitable sharing of the benefits of biological diversity . ]  
Criteria and indicators for application at the national level should be [ simple , ] [ practical , ] scientifically based and cost effective and reflect , inter alia , economic , social , biological and ecological circumstances . 
In view of the special features of biological weapons and the complicated technical factors involved , efforts should be made to realistically formulate relevant definitions , criteria and lists ; clearly delineate activities prohibited and permitted under the Convention ; and , on this basis , explore effective and feasible verification measures , together with measures aimed at preventing abuse , protecting commercial secrets and reducing unnecessary interference in normal scientific research and industrial activities .  
Similarly , the continued existence of stocks of prohibited fissile material for the production of prohibited nuclear weapons and of the illicit traffic in weapons of mass destruction , particularly biological and chemical weapons , remains a source of deep concern and threatens the stability and security of countries and entire regions .  
The highest priority for the international community , therefore , should continue to remain the ultimate and complete elimination of nuclear weapons as was laid down in the Final Document of SSOD I . The agenda should also include measures on the elimination of the other weapons of mass destruction , in particular chemical and biological weapons , through the full implementation of relevant disarmament treaties . 
In themselves such weapons threaten an imbalance in nature , and many of the biological agents that can be used as weapons are capable of frustrating all the efforts made in previous decades to eradicate diseases that are highly contagious and extremely dangerous to human health worldwide .  
At its third session , held in Argentina in November 1996 , the Conference of Parties to the Convention decided on a future programme of work for terrestrial biological diversity , and requested the Executive Secretary of the Convention secretariat to develop , in consultation and with the assistance of the Panel , or any successor arrangement , a focused work programme on forest biodiversity that would place an emphasis on research .  FAO has a forest genetic resources programme that has been developed over the past three decades .  
Recalling the long-standing determination of the international community to achieve the effective prohibition of the development , production , stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons as well as the continuing support for measures to uphold the authority of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating , Poisonous or Other Gases , and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare , signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 , [ 48 ] as expressed by consensus in many previous resolutions ,  
For many of today 's major environment and development concerns , the sciences ( including the social and human sciences ) are essential in detecting and analysing the problem , in identifying solutions and in ensuring scientifically sound action .  This has been particularly evident for the ozone depletion issue , and increasingly also for other issues such as climate change , erosion of biological diversity and water and coastal pollution .  
Some other issues that will require increased research activities in the future are related to ( a ) the pathways of man-made chemicals , in particular toxic chemicals , in ecosystems , agro-ecosystems and the global biosphere and the possible undesirable biological effects in humans and animals subsisting often far away from the source point ; and ( b ) interdisciplinary research on re-emerging tropical and subtropical diseases conditioned by particular environments and vectors .  1 Report of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , vol .  
The objectives of the work programme are , first , to promote the positive effects and mitigate the negative impacts of agricultural practices on biological diversity in agro-ecosystems and their interface with other ecosystems ; second , to promote the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources of actual or potential value for food and agriculture ; and third , to promote the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources .  
Following the momentum set at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , but going even further , the CBD as a process is open to " participants " and is not confined to Governments . 21 The Convention 's rules of procedure define participants in a broad manner which essentially encompasses all of the major groups identified in section III of Agenda 21 , so long as they can demonstrate that they are qualified in fields relating to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity . 
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
The Commission recognized that particular attention should be focused on the holistic approach towards environmental and developmental functions of forests ; sustainable forest management ; conservation of biological diversity ; conservation of soil and water resources ; restoration ; forest products and services ; and participation of major groups , particularly indigenous people and local communities .  
It noted the statement annexed to decision II / 9 of the Conference of the Parties to that Convention , and accepted that the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from research and development and from the commercial utilization of biological resources fell , inter alia , within the purview of the Convention .  
Much attention is still given to timber and forest cover , whereas other goods and services provided by forests , such as fuelwood , the sustainable use and conservation and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits of biological diversity , soil and water protection functions , and carbon sequestration and sinks , as well as other social , cultural and economic aspects , are rarely covered and need to be considered .  
The Panel recognized the importance of the services provided by forests , including those relating to biological diversity and global climate regulation , and the potential for developing mechanisms to translate those values into monetary terms to encourage forest owners , forest dwellers , indigenous populations and local communities to conserve forests and manage them sustainably .  
During the last two years only , the inspections have led to the unmasking of : a complete biological weapons development and production programme ; highly sophisticated and advanced work on the extremely lethal chemical warfare nerve agent VX ; and the multifaceted domestic development and production of Scud-type missile engines under Iraq 's project 1728 .  
Acknowledging that biological resources could also be region-specific or shared by more than one member country , and acknowledging also the difficulties in securing fully effective enforcement of regulations of transfer , particularly because very small quantities of genetic material are sufficient for research and development purposes and that there is the possibility that these can cross borders undetected ,  
Recalling further its resolution 1996 / 16 , in which it requested the Secretary _ General to submit a report on information gathered on the use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel _ air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium and their consequential and cumulative effects and the danger they represent to life , physical security and other human rights ,  
Continuing the international dialogue on the issues of conservation and sustainable use of coastal and marine biodiversity and agricultural biological diversity was also very important , since both issues were essential to food security , which was the focus of the forthcoming World Food Summit ; the work being undertaken by the Intergovernmental Panel on forests was likewise crucial to that discussion .  
His Government reaffirmed its commitment to protecting the global climate and conserving biological diversity for present and future generations and felt that the international community should recognize that , to preserve the planet , global willingness to tackle the task was essential ; if action was delayed , the cost could be devastating . 
After peaceful relations and reconciliation are established among all States in the region , Israel will endeavour to establish in the Middle East _ through direct negotiations among all its members _ a zone free of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons , as well as ballistic missiles , based on mutual and effective verification .  
Indeed , Israel has been actively supporting and participating in efforts of the international community to prevent the proliferation of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles , not least through export control mechanisms , inspired by those of the Nuclear Suppliers Group ( NSG ) , the Australian Group ( AG ) , and the Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ) , of which Israel is an adherent .  
As the tensions which reflected the cold war era give way to growing global confidence and cooperation , the international community should now turn more of its attention and energies towards many as yet unresolved regional conflicts , which are characterized by unprecedented conventional arms build _ ups and , in some instances , also by the Clandestine pursuit of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons .  
With a view to promoting peace and strengthening security in the Mediterranean region , the new Government of Malta has time and time again committed itself to a foreign policy that is based on the values of democratic governance , on the upholding of fundamental human rights , on the peaceful settlement of disputes and on a policy that is in favour of disarmament and strongly opposes military aggression , and the manufacture , distribution and proliferation of all types of armaments and weapons , especially weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological .  
It stood for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , the prohibition of the development of outer space weapons , and the reduction of conventional weapons to a rational level .  
My country , Senegal , feels that , apart from the potential for destruction presented by nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , security problems are equally linked to conventional armaments in numerous conflicts and tensions raging throughout the world , especially in Africa .  
Within this framework , the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms must , if it is to be successful , be expanded to include information on other categories of armaments that are not currently covered , such as nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , in addition to advanced technology with military applications .  
The Movement observed that in his note the Secretary-General expressed the view that weapons of mass destruction continued to be of primary importance despite significant progress achieved to outlaw chemical and biological weapons and to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regimes .  
We make these appeals not as an annual ritual but because of our deep conviction that the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , will go a long way to promote international peace and security , a principal purpose for which this Organization was established .  
After the establishment , as we hope , of peace treaties between Israel and every country of the region , it will be possible to create a regional security system that would provide multilateral and shared solutions to the range of security problems in the Middle East , including a mutually and effectively verifiable Middle East free of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles .  
All of this madness has revived official and covert operations , mercenaries , spies and assassins , as ready now as in the worst days of the cold war to plot and unleash terror against human beings and even employ aggressive biological agents against our economy .  
The application of double standards in the area of non-proliferation and the employment of non-transparent and exclusive export control mechanisms in the areas of nuclear , chemical and biological technology for peaceful uses are most destructive of international confidence and security .  
That will be possible only if the Security Council shoulders its full legal and political responsibilities : to defend its resolutions without applying double standards , especially since Israel , as we all know , continues to possess weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , that pose a threat to regional and international peace and security .  
Issues of biosafety have emerged with regard to national capacity needed for the implementation of effective in situ conservation measures , through establishing and maintaining the means to regulate , manage or control risks associated with invasive species and / or the use and release of living modified organisms resulting from biotechnology and likely to have adverse environmental impacts on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
The global community has also made considerable progress in recognizing the contributions to sustainable agriculture of the conservation and sustainable use of agricultural biological diversity , as reflected , for example , in the decision of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity at its third meeting to establish a multi-year programme of activities on the sustainable use of agricultural biological diversity , aiming , inter alia , to promote the positive and mitigate the negative effects of agricultural practices on biological diversity .  
I also consider it important to note that , at its substantive session of 1995 , the Economic and Social Council approved the report of the Commission on Sustainable Development on the work of its third session , in which , in its discussion of progress in implementing Agenda 21 , the Commission recognized that mountain ecosystems and environments are of crucial importance as rich and unique centres of biological and cultural diversity , water stores and sources of minerals . 
The joint scientific research programme conducted during the 21st expedition included experiments relating to the vital functions of the human organism , microgravity , basic biological research , advanced technologies and Earth sciences .  
My Government is fully confident that , provided there is political will , tangible action addressing conventional weapons would not be beyond the scope either of the ability or the competence of a forum that has to its credit the successful negotiation of bans on whole categories of weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons .  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
The use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel-air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium , like the dumping of other toxic and dangerous chemicals and wastes in the developing countries , violates the rights to life , health , physical security and other human rights , such as economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development .  
In this context , our Government has implemented programmes for combating desertification , expanding green areas and developing biological diversity systems , and we have established research centres to develop genetic strains of flora and fauna adapted to our harsh environmental conditions .  
The reaffirmation contained in the Final Document of the Fourth Review Conference is of special importance to Cuba , in that the use by States parties , in any way and under any circumstances , of microbial or other biological agents or toxins that is not consistent with prophylactic , protective or other peaceful purposes , is effectively a violation of article I of the Convention .  
Recalling further its resolution 1996 / 16 , in which it requested the Secretary _ General to submit a report on information gathered on the use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel _ air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium and their consequential and cumulative effects and the danger they represent to life , physical security and other human rights ,  
The threats posed by weapons of mass destruction are far from being extinguished , and the consequences of miscalculation or deliberate acts can be horrific , as we know from the terrorist activities of a cult group armed with nerve gas in Japan , biological and toxin weapons in Iraq and persistent reports and risks of nuclear smuggling .  
The international collaborative exercises constitute the first phase of the international quality assurance programme , carried out by UNDCP , in which participating laboratories are requested , twice a year , to analyse unknown samples of seized material and / or biological specimens .  
We have to address as a matter of priority the three most immediate dangers identified by the Commission : the overexploitation of marine biological resources , the dumping of toxic waste and the harmful effects of global warming .  
With water a primary agent in maintaining human health and transmitting disease , the imperative remains to manage all freshwater sources to maintain chemical and biological quality within minimum acceptable standards .  
With water as a primary agent in maintaining human health and transmitting disease , there is an imperative need to manage land and freshwater sources to maintain chemical and biological quality to minimum acceptable standards .  
Natural hazards have thus been defined as extreme geophysical events , biological processes and major technological accidents , characterized by concentrated releases of energy or materials that pose a largely unexpected threat to humans .  
In that case , Iraq had refused to accede to a request by a chief inspector to be furnished with a copy of a document highly pertinent to obtaining a verifiable material balance of Iraq 's munitions filled with chemical or biological agents .  
Within this increasingly ambiguous and interdependent environment , lives progress along many planes biological , psychological , societal , political , cultural and spiritual .  
The team recommended that no further verification of Iraq 's current biological weapons full , final and complete disclosure be conducted at the senior international expert level , until Iraq commits itself to provide substantive , new information .  
No one can deny that the negative trends of these last decades of the twentieth century are slow to reverse .  These include growing poverty , the marginalization of hundreds of millions of people , the precarious state of natural resources , the degradation of biological diversity , the destruction of forests , worsening pollution , rampant desertification , and so many other examples .  
However , considering the value of these forests to local populations , it will be difficult to adequately identify quality changes , especially change in species composition and biological diversity , which is mostly induced by the common practice of selective cutting of highly valuable trees .  
A protected area may be defined as an area of land and / or sea especially dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity , and of natural and associated cultural values , and managed through legal or other effective means .  
Urged countries with low forest cover to establish or expand networks of protected areas , buffer zones and ecological corridors , where possible , in order to conserve biological diversity , particularly in unique types of forests , working in close liaison with the parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant international environmental agreements .  
As a result , a considerable proportion of the biological diversity most in need of protection has not been protected ; existing data on the worlds protected areas suggests that evergreen sclerophyllous , temperate and boreal forests are generally poorly represented .  
The selection and management of additional protected forest areas should be based on their value as representative or unique forest types ; their potential to generate information on ecological processes ; the conservation of biological diversity and ecosystem services ; and due consideration to the livelihoods of the communities depending on them .  
Encourage countries , with support from international organizations , to develop and implement polices which adequately value non-market forest benefits in economic terms ; recognize the real social and economic values of forest environmental services ; recognize native forests as a capital resource and invest accordingly in preventing their depletion ; seek to maintain overall biological diversity ; and ensure that harvests do not exceed ecologically sustainable levels ;  
Request countries , with the support of international organizations , particularly UNEP and the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) , to make a comprehensive assessment of the current status of protected forest areas , including total number , extent of each area , objectives of establishment , effectiveness of management , IUCN system equivalent category , and basic biological and social information available ; 
Article 8 ( j ) is also directly related to three other provisions of the Convention : article 10 ( c ) , dealing with customary use of biological resources ; article 17.2 , dealing with exchange of information relevant to indigenous and traditional knowledge ; and articles 18.4 and 15 , dealing with technical and scientific cooperation , including indigenous and traditional technologies and access to genetic resources , respectively .  
The Panel recognized that the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from research and development and from the commercial utilization of biological resources fell , inter alia , within the purview of the Convention .  
The Convention established , early on , a process to ensure that knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity were considered in all relevant sectoral and thematic areas in the implementation of the Convention .  
The principle of prior informed consent is also embedded in the wording of article 8 ( j ) , whereby , subject to national legislation , the wider application of the knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity should only occur with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge , innovations and practices . 
They may also take into account the application of appropriate sui generis legislation ( for which a number of models now exist ) , as well as using provisions under existing national and subnational laws governing such matters as land tenure , cultural heritage and local government , which frequently contain provisions for regional agreements and permit regimes ( governing access to indigenous / local community lands , research and collection of components of biological diversity etc . ) . 
In view of the fact that the two types of weapons of mass destruction of biological and chemical weapons have been comprehensively prohibited , there is no reason why nuclear weapons , which are of greater destructive force , should not be comprehensively banned and thoroughly destroyed .  
On fisheries and other marine living resources , participants stressed the crucial importance in much of the world of ensuring continuing sustainable supply of food from the oceans and seas ( a matter of particular moment for many communities in developing countries ) as well as the need to protect marine biological diversity .  
The GEF with its focus on additional concessional funding to meet incremental costs of projects of global benefits in the four focal areas of climate change , biological diversity , the ozone layer and international waters has a special and growing role .  
The readiness demonstrated by the Arab States to take practical steps towards the establishment of an effectively verifiable Middle East zone free from all weapons of mass destruction - nuclear , chemical and biological - and to refrain from taking any measures that preclude the achievement of this objective in accordance with paragraph 5 of the 1995 resolution on the Middle East as well as paragraph 14 of Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) should not go unnoticed .  
The proceedings of the workshop , which contain detailed presentations on past and current environmental studies related to deep seabed mining , as well as papers and discussions on the biological , chemical and physical environment of the seabed , will be published during 1999 .  
In the area of space technology it is planned , in the near future , to develop fundamental and experimental research in the area of weightlessness physics and to develop basic technologies for producing unique materials and biological preparations with properties unobtainable on Earth .  
The proceedings of the workshop , containing detailed presentations on past and current environmental studies related to deep seabed mining as well as papers and discussions on the biological , chemical and physical environment of the seabed , will be published during 1999 .  
Within this food and nutritional security plan , PAHO / WHO is promoting mechanisms to ensure the enforcement of existing legislation , as well as the technical norms of the World Trade Organization with respect to food quality , processing , biological , toxicological and nutritional protection and standards for industrial food products .  Agreements have been made with respect to the standardization of laws and support from regional ( i.e .  
Mr . Cabactulan ( Philippines ) said that more work was needed on the terms of reference for the Panel of Experts on Access and Benefit Sharing in order to ensure that the biological diversity within countries was carefully protected , while at the same time ensuring that such resources were utilized in a manner that fully respected the proprietary rights of indigenous communities and enabled the original developers in developing countries to share the benefits .  
The Caribbean region and sea possessed a number of unique features which justified according them priority attention : exceptional biological diversity , highly fragile ecosystems and heavy reliance by most of the countries of the region on the coastal land and marine environment in order to achieve sustainable development .  
In 1998 , the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity had recommended that member States should adopt a draft model legislation on access to biological resources at national level ; initiate a process of negotiation among African countries to adopt an African convention on biological diversity ; and develop a common position to safeguard their sovereign rights and the vital interests of local communities .  
In accordance with article 19 of the Convention , there was an urgent need to consider modalities for advance informed agreement outlining appropriate procedures in the field of safe transfer , handling and use of any a living modified organism resulting from biotechnology that might have adverse effects on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
Governments had expressed their determination to advance the negotiations , but the political will had been insufficient to put aside the purely economic and commercial interests and give priority to the potential risks that living modified organisms represented for health and for the conservation of the planets biological diversity .  
The State of Bahrain has put forward plans for two important projects in the field of biological diversity and integrated environmental management , with a view to obtaining financial and technical support through the Ministerial Conference of the small island developing States of the Atlantic Ocean , the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean , held in Malta in November 1998 .  
The Commission emphasizes the fundamental fact that oceans and seas constitute the major part of the planet that supports life , drive the climate and hydrological cycle , and provide the vital resources to be used to ensure well-being for present and future generations and economic prosperity , to eradicate poverty , to ensure food security and to conserve marine biological diversity and its intrinsic value for maintaining the conditions that support life on earth . 
On fisheries and other marine living resources , participants stressed the crucial importance in much of the world of ensuring continuing sustainable supply of food from the oceans and seas ( a matter of particular moment for many communities in developing countries ) as well as the need to protect marine biological diversity .  
That region has suffered from brutal and savage conflicts for many years , most recently Iraq ' s wanton and brutal invasion of Kuwait , and the continuous threat to neighbouring countries posed by the Iraqi regime ' s use of chemical and biological weapons against its own people in northern Iraq .  
The main adverse impacts of tourism on the environment are connected to pressure on natural resources , harm to wildlife and habitats ( with associated loss of biological diversity ) , the generation of pollution and wastes , and social and cultural pressures related to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
The Strategy presents an innovative , proactive and coordinated approach to halt and reverse the degradation of biological and landscape diversity values in Europe and to promote the integration of such considerations into social and economic sectors .  
It still dumps nuclear waste in the occupied Arab territories and continues its programme of developing all kinds of weapons of mass destruction , biological or chemical , because of the worlds inaction and the double standards that the great Powers apply .  
Our efforts in biological and chemical weapons , in verifying conventional arms levels and in pursuing collective security arrangements are all an essential backdrop to creating the conditions for complete nuclear disarmament .  
With water as a primary agent in maintaining both human health and transmitting disease , there is an imperative need to manage land and freshwater sources to maintain chemical and biological quality to minimum acceptable standards .  
The knowledge and wisdom of indigenous and local communities is critical to the conservation and management of much of the worlds biological diversity and natural resources and can add value to contemporary , scientific ways of thinking .  
Sanctions should be restricted to the acquisition of arms , military equipment and dual-use materials as stipulated in relevant Security Council resolutions , especially the resolutions relating to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , be they nuclear , chemical or biological , and of any other military potential that might endanger the sovereignty , safety , security and stability of neighbouring countries .  
The aim of the Recommendations for Guidance is to define the biological , chemical , geological and physical components to be measured and the procedures to be followed by the Contractor to ensure the effective protection of the marine environment from harmful effects which may arise from its activities in the Area , and to provide guidance to prospective contractors in preparing plans of work for exploration for polymetallic nodules .  
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
Aware also that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that the eradication of poverty in developing countries depends on the implementation of policies directed towards conservation and the sustainable use of biological resources ,  
Aware that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that concerns have been expressed with respect to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
To do this , we must : ( i ) maintain the integrity of ecosystems and the continued health of the planets life-support system which sustain the productivity , adaptability of renewal of all life ; ( ii ) maintain biological diversity in the variety of life on which ecological processes depend processes that provide a stream of current and future benefits to human beings ; and ( iii ) ensure sustainable population dynamics ( size of population , growth rate and distribution ) , as it often exerts pressures on the environment .

At the national level , his Group and China supported the following recommendations made by the experts : raising awareness of the role and value of traditional knowledge and its contribution to the development process ; promoting , where appropriate , the commercialization of traditional knowledge-based products and services , involving indigenous and local communities in that endeavour , consistent with the sustainable use of biological resources ; and exploring suitable instruments , including sui generis systems for the protection of traditional knowledge .  
Moreover , the international community must take action to bolster existing mechanisms and instruments and to set out a specific timetable for the successive stages of general disarmament and for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction nuclear , chemical and biological in particular .  
The international community continues to witness an accelerated race to develop strategic nuclear reactors for military purposes and increase the range and power of ballistic missiles and rockets with nuclear , chemical and biological warheads despite the pledges of the heads of State and Government at the Millennium Summit last year for , among other things , the gradual multilateral reduction of arsenals of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction .  
We note with the deepest concern the close connections between international terrorism and the illegal movement of nuclear , chemical , biological and other deadly materials , as a paramount threat to international peace and security at the dawn of the new millennium .  
Accordingly , the political reality in our region mandates a practical step-by-step approach , culminating in a comprehensive peace and the eventual establishment of a mutually verifiable zone free of ballistic missiles and of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .  
Our close cooperation becomes urgent when it is realized that a small group of terrorists can actually possess weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , biological and chemical ones , and destroy large areas of the world and millions of innocent people with wilful abandon , senselessly and indiscriminately .  
Recognizing further the close connection between international terrorism and illicit arms-trafficking and the illegal movement of nuclear , chemical , biological and other potentially deadly materials ,  
To foster cooperation aimed at achieving the conservation and sustainable management of the regions natural ecosystems for the purpose of deepening world commitments to conserve biodiversity in situ and to work to establish sustainable development plans in those ecosystems which incorporate , at the local level , the agreements that figure in all the relevant conventions and that provide for the creation and reinforcement of protected areas and biological corridors and for the promotion of sustainable production activities . 
When the patent protects a plant , animal or other organism capable of reproduction , the holder may not prevent third parties from using that entity as an initial basis for obtaining new viable biological material and marketing the material thus obtained , except where repeated use of the patented material would be required in order to obtain such material ;
