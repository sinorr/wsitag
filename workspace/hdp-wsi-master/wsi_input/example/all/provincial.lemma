According to sources , to speed the process of lowering the average age of leading cadres and ensure that officials at the provincial and ministerial level will be able to smoothly enter the CPC Central Committee at the 16th party congress next year , the CPC Central Organization Department has made a decision on completing major changes in the leading bodies of all provinces and ministries by the end of this year .  
Some current provincial governors and ministers ( excluding those in special departments ) between the ages of 62 and 65 years ( the age for retirement at this level ) will be retired ahead of time by the end of this year so that their younger successors may be elected into the party central committee next year at the 16th party congress .  
At present , some incumbent provincial governors and ministers are close to the retirement age of 65 years , and may be asked to retire before the end of their current tenure .  The relevant central department decided that it should be arranged for younger cadres to take over their leading positions so that the successors may smoothly enter the new central committee at the 16th party congress to be held in October 2002 .

Reportedly , the main reason for arranging the retirement of ministers and provincial governors ahead of time was that these officials will reach or exceed the retirement age of 65 years by the time the CPC holds its 16th national congress next year , and they will no longer be able to remain in leading positions at that time .  If these people still remain in the current leading positions , they will be included in the name list of the new central committee membership , and this may prevent their successors from entering the central committee .

As for the reason that the sources of news reports reprinted by non-news units are limited to those published by news units at and above the provincial level , the primary consideration is that these news units are the principal news-publishing units in this country , and their news reports are authoritative , accurate , and timely .  
The seminar was organized by the NPC Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee . Responsible officials of relevant departments of the NPC Standing Committee ; internal and judicial organizations of provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's congresses ; and the Ministry of Civil Affairs attended the seminar .

According to people in China 's legal circles , after the Central Committee on Discipline announced last month that Xu Qiyao was investigated and punished for " bribery and extreme debauchery , " a joint task force comprised of members from the Central Committee on Discipline and Jiangsu Provincial Organization on Inspecting Discipline quickly conducted an unannounced hearing on this typical case , which marked the first time since the government in China was established , where a provincial department-level official was charged with debauchery .  
But the real , behind-the-scenes reason stemmed from the powerful backers of these two Yancheng " Party and government hands . "  Six years ago when Municipal Party Committee Secretary Xu Guojian was transferred to serve as director of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee Organization , Xu Qiyao enticed the boss of a construction company to inform against Xu Guojian for accepting a bribe of 100,000 yuan .  Consequently , this prevented the newly appointed director at long last from running for standing member of the provincial committee .  
Article 16 The scales of unemployment insurance money and unemployment insurance benefits including medical subsidy , funeral subsidy , pension , and allowances for vocational training and employment agency services shall be implemented in accordance with relevant provisions of individual provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments .  
In the process of investigation , the provincial committee for discipline , aside from confirming the facts about the huge bribes taken by Lin , has discovered that the Land Bureau and the Development Center both had adopted some serious illegal financial and economic regulations .  The establishment of a private treasury inside these institutions is very serious .  The amount in the treasury reaches several hundred million yuan in renminbi ;  
this fund is closely connected with several of the previous bureau directors .  Because of the seriousness of the charges made against Lin , and because of how widespread are the official and issues involved , with such a complicated background , the working group made up of officials from the Guangdong provincial Office of Discipline and Inspection and the censorate , with Beijing in agreement , undertook this sudden raid to arrest Lin Hui without notifying the Guangzhou municipal government .

A Beijing source has disclosed that , to make early-stage preparations for the convening of the 16th CPC National Congress , the CPC has decided to set up a group , made up of Politburo Standing Committee members Jiang Zemin , Zhu Rongji , Hu Jintao , and Wei Jianxing , to take special charge of the reelection of cadres at the provincial and ministerial level .  Earlier , Hu announced a new round of the reelection of provincial-level cadres , saying that the relevant work started in early November .

According to the source , to make arrangements for the 16th CPC National Congress , the CPC is carrying out large-scale personnel adjustments at the provincial and ministerial level .  Since the beginning of this year , the leading bodies of a dozen or so provinces and regions , including Hebei , Fujian , Henan , Sichuan , Inner Mongolia , Tibet , Jiangsu , and Shandong , have been reshuffled or adjusted .  The collective corruption and dereliction-of-duty case of senior Shenyang City officials has only expedited the process of adjusting Liaoning provincial leading body .  
Li : A report system on the family assets of leading cadres will be implemented in 2001 .

The relevant responsible persons of the provinces , autonomous regions , municipalities under direct central jurisdiction , cities with separate plans , some quasi-provincial level provincial capitals , and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps as well as responsible persons of the relevant departments of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council also attended the conference .

In his report to the fourth meeting of the Zhejiang provincial ninth people 's congress , which opened today , Zhejiang Governor Chai Songyue said quickening the pace of urbanization will be an important way to accelerate transformation of Zhejiang 's economic and social structures and coordinated development of the province 's regional economies , as well as an important measure to ensure that Zhejiang will basically realize modernization ahead of time .  
It has been recently learned from a relevant department of the Central Organization Committee under the CPC Central Committee : China has basically completed organizational restructuring at provincial level .  China 's provincial governments have reduced 74,000 personnel , and the number of provincial government organizations has been reduced from 55 to 40 .  Party and government departments have internally streamlined and cut 20 percent of their subordinate organizations on average .  
They may be settled in the original places of their spouses or the location of their marriage .  If their spouses have moved with the military units and have been registered residents for four years in Beijing , three years in Shanghai , or two years in Tianjin , Chongqing , a provincial or regional capital , or a city of a sub-provincial level or if their spouses are registered residents in any other cities , they may settle in that city .  
However , after over 20 " tigers " at the provincial and ministerial level have been knocked down , the government has also been vigorously promoting clean government and giving important posts to those officials who are honest and clean and competent in fighting corruption .  Therefore , as soon as Zhang Guoguang took up the post of acting provincial governor of Hubei Province , he vowed : Whoever does not fight corruption should step down .  
It has been learned that except for central organs and the State Council , the leading bodies of all local provincial and municipal governments across the country have already completed the session-changing process without a hitch prior to the convocation of the " two sessions . "  In the future , barring special reasons or work needs , all ministerial-level cadres will have to leave office once they reach the age limit of 65 .  
and great achievements have been made in the construction of socialist material civilization and spiritual civilization .  This is a result of the efforts that Sichuan and Yunnan provincial party committees and provincial governments have made in leading the broad ranks of cadres and masses all over the two provinces to work hard , but live plainly , and forge ahead in a pioneering and enterprising spirit .  
Han Zhubin said : Procuratorial organs at various levels consistently focused on the investigation and handling of important cases of crime committed by cadres ranking at and above the county or provincial section level and major criminal cases involving large sums of money , causing great harm , and having a high profile .  In total , they placed on file for investigation 18,086 cases of grafting and bribes taking amounting to 50,000 yuan and over .  Among them , there were 1,335 exceptionally large cases involving over 1 million yuan each .  
The General Office of the Ministry of Education the other day issued a circular among various provincial , autonomous regional , or municipal education departments , in which it discussed an explosion incident , which broke out in a teaching building of a primary school in Jiangxi a week ago , and urged education departments in all areas as well as all types of schools at all levels to immediately take action to introduce a security and prevention system in schools so as to create favorable conditions for guaranteeing young people 's healthy growth .  
It demonstrated that provincial and ministerial level officials are no longer " above being punished . "  Yet regretfully , big cases keep cropping up , becoming just as Hu Angan , an expert on national conditions , describes it , " more and more rampant , like an infectious disease . "  
The Henan Provincial Party Committee has decided to start with members of its standing committee , to start with organs under the provincial authorities , and to start with all levels of leading cadres .  Let the higher authorities set an example to their subordinates .  We must guide vast numbers of cadres , so that they would devote their energies to improving their ideological level and work capability ;  
he key to " raising the quality of procuratorial personnel " is to strengthen the development of leading bodies .  Poor-quality , indolent , and problematic leading bodies should be promptly readjusted , while leading procuratorial bodies at the provincial and municipal level should be gradually staffed by democratic party members and nonparty personages .  
In a collective interview with Chinese and foreign journalists yesterday , Bo Xilai , a deputy to the Ninth National People 's Congress and Liaoning provincial governor , said it is necessary to build an innovative , industrious , and clean government , pay real attention to solid work , and invigorate Liaoning .  
Afterwards , Wang Zhongyu heard reports from the Hebei Provincial Committee , the provincial government , the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee , and city government leaders , and fully affirmed the work of the provincial and municipal Party committees and governments , the rapid action of the military , military police , and public security police , prompt rescues , and effective measures .  Furthermore , he provided concrete requests and suggestions for the next steps in the rescue work , helping the injured , cracking the case , and protecting social stability .  
In Hebei Province , the provincial government has explicitly demanded that the collection of taxes and fees still owed by peasants from the year before be suspended temporarily .  Peasant households whose incomes dropped substantially for the year were allowed to pay less common retained funds or were exempt from paying them at all .  In places like Zhangjiakou and Chengde , which were hard hit by the drought , the amount of common retained funds collected fell 30-40 percent .  
He together with 19 Hong Kong based officers are tasked to build a very crucial bridge to link up the CPG and the provincial / municipal authorities in the Mainland with the HKSARG . I sincerely look forward to the generous support of the central leadership , State and Provincial officials to this new Office , to help it establish its work on a sound foundation . 
We have learnt from the representatives of Guangdong and Shenzhen that the authorities concerned both at the provincial and municipal levels attach great importance to the issue .  They have stepped up the coordination of control point operation and have actively implemented a series of improvement measures such as enhancing human resources management and manpower deployment at the control points , acquiring new computer equipment and installing automatic electronic licence identification system etc .  Besides , an emergency coordination unit has also been set up at the Huanggang Control Point to promptly handle emergencies there .  
After graduation from college , he engaged in journalistic , cultural and educational work . Later , he served as an executive member of the party 's Taiwan provincial office based at Chang chow , Fukien province , and was elected a member of the party 's Sixth National Congress .  
The Central Taiwan Vocational Training Center , the southern and northern Taiwan vocational training centers operated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , the Taishan vocational training center operated by the Ministry of the Interior , the first youth vocational training center run by the National Youth Commission , the northern provincial vocational training center , Taipei municipal vocational training center , eastern Taiwan vocational training center , and a vocational training center for retired servicemen .  
His first major task became road development . In order to fund the enormous task , Mayor Shu sought a loan from the provincial government . As the standard yearly appropriation for all public construction throughout the island is US $ 72,500,000 , officials of the provincial government were astounded when Mayor Shu requested five times that amount for a single city .  
When the government moved to Taiwan , a new administrative system was implemented which left Chang Hua without its provincial seat of government . The criteria for a provincial seat was either a population of half a million or a population of only 200,000 and a reputation as a cultural , economic or administrative center .  
In it , athletic trainers will be divided into three classes : county , provincial , and national . Each will have to pass a certain number of courses in physical education , injury prevention and diagnosis , general medicine , etc . , then complete a clinical internship and pass a test before being approved .  
Tali Rural Township is located between Taichung City and Chunghsing Village ( the provincial capital ) . Because recently a provincial highway has been forged through , and Taichung has already been developed exhaustively , a certain old farmer with two hectares of land here went in with someone to build houses after the zoning had been changed . He earned over NT $ 10 million in cash , and still has seven or eight apartments worth nearly NT $ 10 million each .  
Last year the Amei River , located to the east of the Hsiu-kuluan River , and which originates in the Coastal Mountain Range , flooded over because of excessive silt buildup downstream . This year , the central , provincial , and county governments are preparing to spend NT $ 100 million to deal with this tiny , lessthan-10-kilometer-long stream .  
The bloody fighting in Taiwan that broke out between native Taiwanese and newcomers from mainland China on February 28 , 1947 ( known in Taiwan as the 228 Incident ) is seen as the greatest point of friction for provincial sentiments on the island . Yet , in the city of Hualien , the well-known medical family of Chan Chi-lang , after three of its male members were killed following the incident , has still managed to come up with two daughters-in-law and one son-in-law whose origins lie in mainland Chinese provinces .  
They have been put off for more than 40 years . Though local self-government has been implemented on schedule , its only legal foundation has been the literally paperthin ( only one page long ) executive order " Main Points for Implementation of Local Self-Government by the Cities and Counties of Taiwan Province . " Even the most basic laws for provincial level government have been held up .  
Taking the Taiwan Provincial Government for example , in terms of the hiring and firing of personnel , currently the provincial governor is appointed by the central government , and changes in the directors of the departments in the provincial administration must be approved by the Executive Yuan . The " province " is actually just the agent for implementing central level policies everywhere but in the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung ( which are directly under the central government ) . Naturally , this more or less guts the powers reserved to local governments .  
Fortunately , after years of contention , the situation has slightly improved . Today it is no longer necessary to get approval from the central government for anyone below civil service level 8 . And with regard to the top officials who can make or break the administration of a city or county , the executive has more room to haggle if he or she does not approve of the individual selected by the provincial government . The more influential chiefs can even recommend candidates and ask the provincial government to formally appoint them .  
Not long ago , Taipei County executive You Ching wanted to hire Lin Yu-yi , a professor from National Normal University ( the elite teaching university ) , as director of the county Bureau of Education . The provincial government rejected him on the grounds that his qualifications were not suitable , and assigned someone else . This led to a conflict over which appointee should take office , and for a time relations between the two sides were strained .  
This is still far removed from Chen Tingnan 's ideal for a " county cabinet , " in which all top administrators come and go with the executive , need not be approved by the provincial government , and are not bound by the civil service regulations on qualifications but are seen as political appointees . But at least it 's some improvement .  
Established during the period of Japanese occupation , the Ho Cheng Group ( HCG ) is an old , well-known native Taiwanese company . In its first 50 years of operations , from the boss to the lowest level of workers , all were pure " fellow Taiwanese . " That is up until 198l , when a seemingly rather naive " mainland lad " broke the provincial circle .  
Wang Hsing-ching observes that most people are far less ready to accept an aboriginal at the head of an administration than as a councillor , provincial assembly member or other elected representative , " for such representatives only represent their minority community , but the local chief executive represents a whole county or city , including the Han Chinese as well as the ' native people . ' '  
By the 1995 fiscal year , not only had the surplus been exhausted , the government debt had reached more than NT $ 1.2 trillion . If the debts of the provincial , municipal , and local governments are added in , the country is now running at over NT $ 2 trillion in the red . This means that , on average , each of Taiwan 's 21 million people is responsible for more than NT $ 100-000 of national debt !  
For example , just prior to the major provincial and municipal elections at the end of last year , Mary Tseng , secretary-general of the Wild Bird Society of Taipei , organized their semi-annual waterfowl festival in Kuantu . The Wild Bird Society invited candidates from all three major parties to take part in the huge gathering . Of course , the harvest was bountiful - - at the event all three parties ' candidates promised once elected to build a nature preserve in Kuantu .  
When two candidates are on an equal footing based on primary considerations , secondary factors become decisive . These include provincial , ethnic and class origin . Even physical appearance is n't overlooked .  
Contrary to the common impression that expatriates have little contact with their native land , more than 80% of the respondents had been back in Taiwan within the past three years . More than half had been in Taiwan within the previous year . This suggests that they have maintained close ties with Taiwan . In terms of provincial origin , a plurality of our respondents - - more than 40% - - were second generation mainlanders ( that is , children of fathers who left mainland China before 1949 ) .  
Furthermore , too many units are in charge of historical landmarks and cultural artifacts , so that no one knows whom to follow . For example , historical landmarks are administered by the Ministry of the Interior , but antique objects inside protected historical buildings are administered by the Ministry of Education . The central , provincial , county and municipal governments all have " cultural personnel " with the same general function . The resulting mish-mash of authority and responsibility means that in the end the affair falls into the pattern of no one managing at all .  
Of late , members of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly , the highest publicly elected body at the provincial level , have been embroiled in numerous scandals involving election bribery , libel charges , financial disputes and various lawsuits . In an effort to clean itself up and drive out malevolent forces , the Assembly conducted a prayer session in honor of the " good brothers , " thereby resorting to ghosts instead of turning to the common people .  
As for the railway museum , five years ago the TRA set up a museum planning team to find suitable locations , " but all of the NT $ 5 million which we had budgeted was cut by the provincial assembly . They thought it was more appropriate for museums to be planned by cultural and educational departments , " says Chen Te-pei , spreading his hands in a gesture of frustration .  
Among constitutional disputes , while the proposal to abolish the Taiwan Provincial Government ( TPG ) was placed only on the second day of the agenda , it gained even more attention than reforming the central level system . Dissent was found , however , not among the three parties , but in the " provincial " representatives directly involved . Governor James Soong , elected by popular vote , was left in the most embarrassing position . He skipped the debate by pleading that they had to answer interpellations from provincial assemblymen .  
Since the market is now up , and many provincial assemblymen who had previously opposed the plan have changed their attitudes as a result of the proposal to freeze the provincial government 's functions , the plan is moving forward again . It 's just that the sudden influx of stock will be a blow to share prices of existing stocks , and it will be hard to return financial stocks to their former level of hundreds of dollars per share .  
The Assembly session sparked contention throughout society : It touched on major issues of the power of the president and premier , and of the existence of the provincial government . There were divisions of opinion among and within the three main political parties . Scholars engaged in heated debate , and citizens took to the streets .  
In future , a nine-member commission , nominated by the premier and named by the president , and a consultative assembly will oversee whatever activities still remain for the downsized provincial government . County and municipal level executives and assemblies will continue to be popularly elected .  
Another example is a set of pictures taken on 22 April 1979 , when President Chiang went with the then Taiwan provincial governor Lin Yang-kang and others on a tour of the remote and mountainous Wuchieh area of Nantou County . Chiang has just finished eating , and is enjoying the beautiful scenery of the mountains of central Taiwan . He is obviously in high spirits . Wearing a jacket with just a T-shirt inside , he calls out " Come on , come on !  
Tsai Jui-yueh , a quiet and cultured native of the old city of Tainan , ignored these criticisms . Resolutely maintaining her position , she headed north to Taipei the next year , and in the City Hall put on " The First Exhibition of Tsai Jui-yueh 's Creative Dance " accompanied by the official provincial orchestra . The performance was an eye-opener for the many who had never seen a dance performance before .  
At the National Development Conference , Huang was a major proponent of freezing provincial elections . Since becoming minister of the interior he has worried the provincial government by stating , " The provincial government was established by the central government , and has no status as an independent legal entity . "  
As for tax revenue , the Ministry of Finance declared that the provincial government budget will be incorporated into the overall central government budget , while provincial sales tax will become national tax , to be allocated directly by the central government to local cities and counties . Premier Siew gave assurances that the details of financial administration will be ironed out no later than December 1 .  
In now-democratic Taiwan , there are virtually no linguistic taboos . Yet in light of Taiwanese being suppressed for so long during the Japanese era and then again for decades of ROC rule , and in view of the tension between people of different ethnic groups and provincial backgrounds , language is a very sensitive issue in Taiwan . Often , after just touching on the issue of language , surveyors received such contentious responses as " There 's no need to ask any more questions , just fill in all the blanks with ' Taiwanese ' ! "  
Why could n't a gas station be set up on the island ? The provincial government discovered that the sticking point was obtaining the land . If suitable sites were n't on national government land , then they were owned by temples . But after the provincial government negotiated with the National Property Bureau and discussed the matter with local residents , the island was finally able to get its gas station .  
The gray roof tiles of the charming houses surrounded by mango trees make a quaint picture . The majority of residents in Chunghsing Village , the seat of the provincial government since its relocation in 1955 , consist of employees of the provincial government . The community benefits from excellent planning and facilities , and many civil servants here have enjoyed decades graced by the simple community lifestyle .  
Such projects included the building of the Shihmen and Tsengwen Reservoirs and the Central Cross-Island Highway . The provincial government implemented compulsory education through grade nine , encouraged development of coastal marshes and hilly districts , rezoned agricultural land , took steps to prevent excessive concentration of urban land ownership , built public housing , and developed industrial parks .

According to sources , to speed the process of lowering the average age of leading cadres and ensure that officials at the provincial and ministerial level will be able to smoothly enter the CPC Central Committee at the 16th party congress next year , the CPC Central Organization Department has made a decision on completing major changes in the leading bodies of all provinces and ministries by the end of this year .  
Some current provincial governors and ministers ( excluding those in special departments ) between the ages of 62 and 65 years ( the age for retirement at this level ) will be retired ahead of time by the end of this year so that their younger successors may be elected into the party central committee next year at the 16th party congress .  
At present , some incumbent provincial governors and ministers are close to the retirement age of 65 years , and may be asked to retire before the end of their current tenure .  The relevant central department decided that it should be arranged for younger cadres to take over their leading positions so that the successors may smoothly enter the new central committee at the 16th party congress to be held in October 2002 .

This year , the cadre changes were moved up to the provincial and ministerial level .  
Reportedly , the main reason for arranging the retirement of ministers and provincial governors ahead of time was that these officials will reach or exceed the retirement age of 65 years by the time the CPC holds its 16th national congress next year , and they will no longer be able to remain in leading positions at that time .  If these people still remain in the current leading positions , they will be included in the name list of the new central committee membership , and this may prevent their successors from entering the central committee .

Thus , the leadership changes at the ministerial and provincial governor level will be completed prior to the 16th party national congress .

It demonstrated that provincial and ministerial level officials are no longer " above being punished . "  Yet regretfully , big cases keep cropping up , becoming just as Hu Angan , an expert on national conditions , describes it , " more and more rampant , like an infectious disease . "  
The Henan Provincial Party Committee has decided to start with members of its standing committee , to start with organs under the provincial authorities , and to start with all levels of leading cadres .  Let the higher authorities set an example to their subordinates .  We must guide vast numbers of cadres , so that they would devote their energies to improving their ideological level and work capability ;  
he key to " raising the quality of procuratorial personnel " is to strengthen the development of leading bodies .  Poor-quality , indolent , and problematic leading bodies should be promptly readjusted , while leading procuratorial bodies at the provincial and municipal level should be gradually staffed by democratic party members and nonparty personages .  
In a collective interview with Chinese and foreign journalists yesterday , Bo Xilai , a deputy to the Ninth National People 's Congress and Liaoning provincial governor , said it is necessary to build an innovative , industrious , and clean government , pay real attention to solid work , and invigorate Liaoning .  
Afterwards , Wang Zhongyu heard reports from the Hebei Provincial Committee , the provincial government , the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee , and city government leaders , and fully affirmed the work of the provincial and municipal Party committees and governments , the rapid action of the military , military police , and public security police , prompt rescues , and effective measures .  Furthermore , he provided concrete requests and suggestions for the next steps in the rescue work , helping the injured , cracking the case , and protecting social stability .  
In Hebei Province , the provincial government has explicitly demanded that the collection of taxes and fees still owed by peasants from the year before be suspended temporarily .  Peasant households whose incomes dropped substantially for the year were allowed to pay less common retained funds or were exempt from paying them at all .  In places like Zhangjiakou and Chengde , which were hard hit by the drought , the amount of common retained funds collected fell 30-40 percent .  
He together with 19 Hong Kong based officers are tasked to build a very crucial bridge to link up the CPG and the provincial / municipal authorities in the Mainland with the HKSARG . I sincerely look forward to the generous support of the central leadership , State and Provincial officials to this new Office , to help it establish its work on a sound foundation . 
We have learnt from the representatives of Guangdong and Shenzhen that the authorities concerned both at the provincial and municipal levels attach great importance to the issue .  They have stepped up the coordination of control point operation and have actively implemented a series of improvement measures such as enhancing human resources management and manpower deployment at the control points , acquiring new computer equipment and installing automatic electronic licence identification system etc .  Besides , an emergency coordination unit has also been set up at the Huanggang Control Point to promptly handle emergencies there .  
After graduation from college , he engaged in journalistic , cultural and educational work . Later , he served as an executive member of the party 's Taiwan provincial office based at Chang chow , Fukien province , and was elected a member of the party 's Sixth National Congress .  
The Central Taiwan Vocational Training Center , the southern and northern Taiwan vocational training centers operated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , the Taishan vocational training center operated by the Ministry of the Interior , the first youth vocational training center run by the National Youth Commission , the northern provincial vocational training center , Taipei municipal vocational training center , eastern Taiwan vocational training center , and a vocational training center for retired servicemen .  
His first major task became road development . In order to fund the enormous task , Mayor Shu sought a loan from the provincial government . As the standard yearly appropriation for all public construction throughout the island is US $ 72,500,000 , officials of the provincial government were astounded when Mayor Shu requested five times that amount for a single city .  
When the government moved to Taiwan , a new administrative system was implemented which left Chang Hua without its provincial seat of government . The criteria for a provincial seat was either a population of half a million or a population of only 200,000 and a reputation as a cultural , economic or administrative center .  
In it , athletic trainers will be divided into three classes : county , provincial , and national . Each will have to pass a certain number of courses in physical education , injury prevention and diagnosis , general medicine , etc . , then complete a clinical internship and pass a test before being approved .  
Tali Rural Township is located between Taichung City and Chunghsing Village ( the provincial capital ) . Because recently a provincial highway has been forged through , and Taichung has already been developed exhaustively , a certain old farmer with two hectares of land here went in with someone to build houses after the zoning had been changed . He earned over NT $ 10 million in cash , and still has seven or eight apartments worth nearly NT $ 10 million each .  
Last year the Amei River , located to the east of the Hsiu-kuluan River , and which originates in the Coastal Mountain Range , flooded over because of excessive silt buildup downstream . This year , the central , provincial , and county governments are preparing to spend NT $ 100 million to deal with this tiny , lessthan-10-kilometer-long stream .  
The bloody fighting in Taiwan that broke out between native Taiwanese and newcomers from mainland China on February 28 , 1947 ( known in Taiwan as the 228 Incident ) is seen as the greatest point of friction for provincial sentiments on the island . Yet , in the city of Hualien , the well-known medical family of Chan Chi-lang , after three of its male members were killed following the incident , has still managed to come up with two daughters-in-law and one son-in-law whose origins lie in mainland Chinese provinces .  
They have been put off for more than 40 years . Though local self-government has been implemented on schedule , its only legal foundation has been the literally paperthin ( only one page long ) executive order " Main Points for Implementation of Local Self-Government by the Cities and Counties of Taiwan Province . " Even the most basic laws for provincial level government have been held up .  
Taking the Taiwan Provincial Government for example , in terms of the hiring and firing of personnel , currently the provincial governor is appointed by the central government , and changes in the directors of the departments in the provincial administration must be approved by the Executive Yuan . The " province " is actually just the agent for implementing central level policies everywhere but in the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung ( which are directly under the central government ) . Naturally , this more or less guts the powers reserved to local governments .  
Fortunately , after years of contention , the situation has slightly improved . Today it is no longer necessary to get approval from the central government for anyone below civil service level 8 . And with regard to the top officials who can make or break the administration of a city or county , the executive has more room to haggle if he or she does not approve of the individual selected by the provincial government . The more influential chiefs can even recommend candidates and ask the provincial government to formally appoint them .  
Not long ago , Taipei County executive You Ching wanted to hire Lin Yu-yi , a professor from National Normal University ( the elite teaching university ) , as director of the county Bureau of Education . The provincial government rejected him on the grounds that his qualifications were not suitable , and assigned someone else . This led to a conflict over which appointee should take office , and for a time relations between the two sides were strained .  
This is still far removed from Chen Tingnan 's ideal for a " county cabinet , " in which all top administrators come and go with the executive , need not be approved by the provincial government , and are not bound by the civil service regulations on qualifications but are seen as political appointees . But at least it 's some improvement .  
Established during the period of Japanese occupation , the Ho Cheng Group ( HCG ) is an old , well-known native Taiwanese company . In its first 50 years of operations , from the boss to the lowest level of workers , all were pure " fellow Taiwanese . " That is up until 198l , when a seemingly rather naive " mainland lad " broke the provincial circle .  
Wang Hsing-ching observes that most people are far less ready to accept an aboriginal at the head of an administration than as a councillor , provincial assembly member or other elected representative , " for such representatives only represent their minority community , but the local chief executive represents a whole county or city , including the Han Chinese as well as the ' native people . ' '  
By the 1995 fiscal year , not only had the surplus been exhausted , the government debt had reached more than NT $ 1.2 trillion . If the debts of the provincial , municipal , and local governments are added in , the country is now running at over NT $ 2 trillion in the red . This means that , on average , each of Taiwan 's 21 million people is responsible for more than NT $ 100-000 of national debt !  
For example , just prior to the major provincial and municipal elections at the end of last year , Mary Tseng , secretary-general of the Wild Bird Society of Taipei , organized their semi-annual waterfowl festival in Kuantu . The Wild Bird Society invited candidates from all three major parties to take part in the huge gathering . Of course , the harvest was bountiful - - at the event all three parties ' candidates promised once elected to build a nature preserve in Kuantu .  
When two candidates are on an equal footing based on primary considerations , secondary factors become decisive . These include provincial , ethnic and class origin . Even physical appearance is n't overlooked .  
Contrary to the common impression that expatriates have little contact with their native land , more than 80% of the respondents had been back in Taiwan within the past three years . More than half had been in Taiwan within the previous year . This suggests that they have maintained close ties with Taiwan . In terms of provincial origin , a plurality of our respondents - - more than 40% - - were second generation mainlanders ( that is , children of fathers who left mainland China before 1949 ) .  
Furthermore , too many units are in charge of historical landmarks and cultural artifacts , so that no one knows whom to follow . For example , historical landmarks are administered by the Ministry of the Interior , but antique objects inside protected historical buildings are administered by the Ministry of Education . The central , provincial , county and municipal governments all have " cultural personnel " with the same general function . The resulting mish-mash of authority and responsibility means that in the end the affair falls into the pattern of no one managing at all .  
Of late , members of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly , the highest publicly elected body at the provincial level , have been embroiled in numerous scandals involving election bribery , libel charges , financial disputes and various lawsuits . In an effort to clean itself up and drive out malevolent forces , the Assembly conducted a prayer session in honor of the " good brothers , " thereby resorting to ghosts instead of turning to the common people .  
As for the railway museum , five years ago the TRA set up a museum planning team to find suitable locations , " but all of the NT $ 5 million which we had budgeted was cut by the provincial assembly . They thought it was more appropriate for museums to be planned by cultural and educational departments , " says Chen Te-pei , spreading his hands in a gesture of frustration .  
Among constitutional disputes , while the proposal to abolish the Taiwan Provincial Government ( TPG ) was placed only on the second day of the agenda , it gained even more attention than reforming the central level system . Dissent was found , however , not among the three parties , but in the " provincial " representatives directly involved . Governor James Soong , elected by popular vote , was left in the most embarrassing position . He skipped the debate by pleading that they had to answer interpellations from provincial assemblymen .  
Since the market is now up , and many provincial assemblymen who had previously opposed the plan have changed their attitudes as a result of the proposal to freeze the provincial government 's functions , the plan is moving forward again . It 's just that the sudden influx of stock will be a blow to share prices of existing stocks , and it will be hard to return financial stocks to their former level of hundreds of dollars per share .  
The Assembly session sparked contention throughout society : It touched on major issues of the power of the president and premier , and of the existence of the provincial government . There were divisions of opinion among and within the three main political parties . Scholars engaged in heated debate , and citizens took to the streets .  
In future , a nine-member commission , nominated by the premier and named by the president , and a consultative assembly will oversee whatever activities still remain for the downsized provincial government . County and municipal level executives and assemblies will continue to be popularly elected .  
Another example is a set of pictures taken on 22 April 1979 , when President Chiang went with the then Taiwan provincial governor Lin Yang-kang and others on a tour of the remote and mountainous Wuchieh area of Nantou County . Chiang has just finished eating , and is enjoying the beautiful scenery of the mountains of central Taiwan . He is obviously in high spirits . Wearing a jacket with just a T-shirt inside , he calls out " Come on , come on !  
Tsai Jui-yueh , a quiet and cultured native of the old city of Tainan , ignored these criticisms . Resolutely maintaining her position , she headed north to Taipei the next year , and in the City Hall put on " The First Exhibition of Tsai Jui-yueh 's Creative Dance " accompanied by the official provincial orchestra . The performance was an eye-opener for the many who had never seen a dance performance before .  
At the National Development Conference , Huang was a major proponent of freezing provincial elections . Since becoming minister of the interior he has worried the provincial government by stating , " The provincial government was established by the central government , and has no status as an independent legal entity . "  
As for tax revenue , the Ministry of Finance declared that the provincial government budget will be incorporated into the overall central government budget , while provincial sales tax will become national tax , to be allocated directly by the central government to local cities and counties . Premier Siew gave assurances that the details of financial administration will be ironed out no later than December 1 .  
In now-democratic Taiwan , there are virtually no linguistic taboos . Yet in light of Taiwanese being suppressed for so long during the Japanese era and then again for decades of ROC rule , and in view of the tension between people of different ethnic groups and provincial backgrounds , language is a very sensitive issue in Taiwan . Often , after just touching on the issue of language , surveyors received such contentious responses as " There 's no need to ask any more questions , just fill in all the blanks with ' Taiwanese ' ! "  
Why could n't a gas station be set up on the island ? The provincial government discovered that the sticking point was obtaining the land . If suitable sites were n't on national government land , then they were owned by temples . But after the provincial government negotiated with the National Property Bureau and discussed the matter with local residents , the island was finally able to get its gas station .  
The gray roof tiles of the charming houses surrounded by mango trees make a quaint picture . The majority of residents in Chunghsing Village , the seat of the provincial government since its relocation in 1955 , consist of employees of the provincial government . The community benefits from excellent planning and facilities , and many civil servants here have enjoyed decades graced by the simple community lifestyle .  
Such projects included the building of the Shihmen and Tsengwen Reservoirs and the Central Cross-Island Highway . The provincial government implemented compulsory education through grade nine , encouraged development of coastal marshes and hilly districts , rezoned agricultural land , took steps to prevent excessive concentration of urban land ownership , built public housing , and developed industrial parks . All these measures were taken to create the conditions that would enable Taiwan to vault from the category of developing nation into the ranks of the newly industrialized economies .  
With regard to the organizational structure of the provincial government , Professor Cheng states that during the years when military men filled the governorship , administrative powers were highly concentrated in the hands of the central government . In 1967 , the city of Taipei came under the direct jurisdiction of the central government , whereas before it had been under the provincial government . In cities under the provincial government , the chief administrators of municipal districts , who had formerly been chosen by direct elections , also began to be appointed . The locals rule  
The next six provincial governors were all Taiwanese . During their terms in office , they put top priority on : developing local infrastructure ; providing better social services for workers engaged in agriculture , industry , and fisheries ; expanding the social safety net ; cleaning up local environments ; building planned communities ; accelerating rural development ; implementing the second phase of rural land reform ; providing full health insurance benefits for farmers ; reorganizing agricultural production ; and encouraging the use of more sophisticated agricultural technology .  
After the repeal of martial law , the provincial authority in charge of public security turned Green Island into a " reeducation center " for reforming criminals whose thinking needed changing or whose political views were problematic .  
Chiu Chung-hsien is the principal of Taipei County 's Hsiushan Elementary School , which won four first prizes for ensembles at this year 's provincial competition and one national second prize . Chiu says that because most parents do n't know which schools offer music programs , and those students without musical ability are too intimidated to sign up for the test , about one-half to one-third of those who apply are accepted . In short , it is n't that difficult to get into a program .  
Firstly , there is strong support among Taiwan 's population of 22 million people , regardless of ethnic group or provincial ancestry , for the concept of " new Taiwanese . " We share a common life and our interests fully coincide , and as we confront the latest round of threats from communist China it is vital that we rally together to protect our own national security .  
Many suggest that the causes underlying these problems date from the downsizing of the provincial government . Power over local resources has become more centralized , leading to a consequent decline in local self-rule . Compounding these problems , many of the county and city governments in areas seriously affected by the earthquake are controlled by the DPP or are not under the control of any one party , whilst many of the grass-roots level administration is in the hands of the KMT . This creates an unwieldy political environment and generates envy between central and local administrations .  
She said that she never expected that her party membership would be revoked . The astonishing cross-partisan pairings of the Soong-Chang and Hsu-Chu tickets-both presidential candidates stepping outside party ranks to launch independent campaigns and choosing running mates completely different from themselves-on the one hand shows that they are above not only party politics , but also provincial background and the issue of unification vs . independence . On the other hand , it also shows that they hoped to maximize the complementarity of their tickets to attract votes from as wide a political spectrum as possible .  
With the rise of industry in Kaohsiung , the agricultural counties of central and southern Taiwan began to lag behind , but at least there was a minimal kind of balance on the island as a whole with " two heads , one north and one south . " And to some degree the provincial government 's location in Nantou-and the resulting stream of visiting city and county bureaucrats-meant that central Taiwan was n't all that forlorn .  
The Estate is not the only structure closely connected to the history of Wufeng to be in this condition . The Wan Fo Temple , a busy religious center that was located in the mountains behind the provincial assembly building , was once the largest Buddhist monastery and temple complex in the entire rural township . Its most distinctive feature was a 20-meter tall golden statue of Baisajyagurvaiduryaprabhasa in a seated position . Though the statue itself is still intact , the remainder of the structure was eradicated by the earthquake .  
In addition , in 1999 , after the streamlining of the provincial government , city and county chronic disease control offices either were merged with other agencies or discontinued their tuberculosis operations . Medical care for TB gradually shifted from specialist hospitals to regular health care institutions . Some of the highly trained tuberculosis specialists retired , while others left their jobs , or were assigned to other positions . The old TB prevention infrastructure today no longer exists .  
But all good things must come to an end , and during the reign of Emperor Guangxu ( 1875-1895 ) , provincial governor Liu Mingchuan decided that Changhua 's port at Lukang was too silted and shallow , and gradually it fell into disuse . Liu chose to move the provincial capital to Taichung , thus laying the foundations for that city 's future growth , while Changhua , which had depended on shipping through Lukang , lost its luster .  
during the 90 minute news briefing , which was attended by nearly 100 chinese and foreign reporters , the provincial officials also answered questions on bringing vitality to large and medium sized enterprises , reforms and opening to the outside , cooperation with shanghai and educational undertakings in the province

A main point to note in that regard is that transfers might not be successful if they are not accompanied by adequate economic and financial resources at provincial and local levels . 
Moreover , as a composite of banking institutions central , republican and provincial it was responsible for carrying out common currency issue , credit and foreign exchange policy , and it had close institutional relations with Parliament .  
Angola 's renewed civil war has paralysed most provincial and urban basic social infrastructures , disrupted essential social services and triggered massive population displacements .  
To effectively plan and manage water-supply and sanitation at the national , provincial , district and community level , and to utilize funds most effectively , trained professional and technical staff must be developed within each country in sufficient numbers .  
At national and provincial levels , water supply and environmental sanitation policies will be addressed through advocacy and social mobilization , while at the county level , programmes will be implemented to increase access to adequate quantities of water , improved latrine construction and hygiene education .  
The following major levels of planning and management need to be distinguished : global , regional , national , provincial or district , local , municipal or village , and household or farm .

We commit ourselves to the strategy of enabling all key actors in the public , private and community sectors to play an effective role - at national , state / provincial , metropolitan , and local levels - in human settlements and shelter development .  
However new problems have been appearing in rural areas with respect to restitution of private land ownership , transformation of agricultural cooperatives and reduced opportunities to find a city job by women coming from the province in the form of requirements for requalification and / or new professions available to provincial women , e.g . , new forms of gainful employment executable at home .  
The human rights situation in Burundi is characterized by large-scale massacres involving both State agents and rebels ; selective murders of intellectuals , political leaders , provincial officials and Hutu merchants , as well as certain Tutsi military officers alleged to be moderates ; arbitrary arrests ; and enforced disappearances .  
Key components of administrative modernization and local government reform programmes are : the reorganization of civil service personnel administration and the delegation of authority for human resources management to the provincial governments ; the revision of civil service pay , career and incentive structures to enable the Government to recruit and retain qualified staff ; the design and implementation of an integrated public administration training system ;  
Major initiatives in the economic management , public sector reform and decentralization area included the assistance to the completion of a comprehensive national Economic Management Capacity-Building Programme ( EMP ) , adopted by the Government in mid-1995 , one component of which is targeted at aid policy and coordination ; the associated Programme Support Document ( PSD ) , which also contemplates the formulation of a sustainable human development ( SHD ) strategy ( with UNICEF ) ; and the continued support to reconstruction and development planning at the provincial and district levels .

Modelled , to the extent feasible , after the global guidelines for national plans of action , national or provincial guidelines for local plans should be particularly attentive to , and inclusive of , the strategic objectives of partnership , enablement , participation , capacity-building and networking .  
In paragraphs 45 to 47 of my report of 7 February 1997 ( S / 1997 / 115 ) , I described in detail the challenges that would be faced by the administrative component of the follow-on mission , as logistical support would have to be provided to headquarters of the follow-on mission in Luanda , to the political , police , human rights and military components in six regional headquarters , and to almost all provincial capitals and over 30 other outstations .  
In addition to the comments generally applicable to the holding of awareness days , it is noteworthy that most concerned countries are pursuing efforts to sensitize a wide audience to the issue of combating desertification , not only at the national level but at provincial and local levels as well .  
Given the vast territory of Angola and the deployment of MONUA at Luanda , six regional headquarters and 18 provincial offices , these aircraft are essential in providing support for the transport of military and civilian personnel , the transport of medium and heavy cargo from the Viana logistics base throughout the mission area and for medical and casualty evacuation purposes .  
Multilateral and bilateral assistance seems to be driving market growth at present , much as in the rest of the developing world , although provincial and municipal governments are emerging as legitimate customers for environmental service providers .  
They were decided without consultation with the provincial authorities , local populations , or international and non-governmental organizations engaged in development work in the province , and without any adequate social and environmental impact assessment studies .  
Given the vast territory of Angola and the deployment of MONUA at Luanda , six regional headquarters and 18 provincial offices , these aircraft provided air support for the transport of military and civilian personnel , medium and heavy cargo from the Viana logistics base throughout the mission area and for medical and casualty evacuation purposes .  
All the provincial departments associated with the implementation of the Copenhagen Programme of Action , national and international non-governmental organizations and the country ' s leading economists and social scientists are being invited to review our experience and evolve future strategy in the light of lessons learned both nationally and internationally .  
Policies for rural development and rural energy policies should be developed and implemented in a mutually reinforcing way and appropriate government agencies within the responsible ministry for national energy policy should be assigned specific duty for rural energy , in some cases at the local or provincial levels .  
Moreover , in the light of the federal structure of Canada and the extensive provincial jurisdiction , the absence of any expert particularly representing the largest provinces , other than Quebec , significantly limited the potential depth of the dialogue on key issues .  
The Committee is concerned that the State party did not take into account the Committees 1993 major concerns and recommendations when it adopted policies at federal , provincial and territorial levels which exacerbated poverty and homelessness among vulnerable groups during a time of strong economic growth and increasing affluence .  
The Committee recommends that federal and provincial agreements should be adjusted so as to ensure , in whatever ways are appropriate , that services such as mental health care , home care , child care and attendant care , shelters for battered women and legal aid for non-criminal matters , are available at levels that ensure the right to an adequate standard of living .  
Policies and measures reported on should be those planned , adopted and / or implemented by governments at national , state , provincial , regional and local level . 
As stated in Canadas response , the policy has economic , social , cultural and political dimensions and it informs extensive government programming at the federal , provincial and territorial levels .  
At the provincial level , the Kosovo Transitional Council continued to meet regularly to carry out its duties , and invited representatives of civil society , political parties , religious groups and national communities to participate .  
That law had not , however , been effectively enforced by the provincial governments , on account of the lack of followup mechanisms and of the considerable political , economic , social and administrative influence of major landowners within their region .  
Within a short space of time , what had hitherto been internal , national provincial border has become international in nature , with all the political , legal , and not least social and humanitarian ramifications .  
While the share of the national recurrent budget allocated to the health sector has been maintained , on average , at the same level , a lower proportion of the health budget is spent on provincial health services where the majority of the population live .  
However , the Public Information Office is also faced with a population that has a high illiteracy rate , with inexperienced , inadequate and generally poor local media and with weak or non-existent communications infrastructure outside the capital and two provincial towns .  
The national focal points and national coordinating bodies can promote additional and parallel consultations with different institutional and social categories and / or in different provincial / local areas in order to ensure their greater participation in the process .  
Improvement in the human rights training of all law-enforcement officials , including police forces , prison staff , military personnel , lawyers , judges and legislators , at both the national and provincial level , in order to prepare them to give effect in the internal legal system to the rights recognized in the human rights instruments incorporated in article 75.22 of the National Constitution .
