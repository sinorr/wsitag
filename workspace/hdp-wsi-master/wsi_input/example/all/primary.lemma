Unlike neighboring Hong Kong in 1997 , there was no public backlash in Macau on the occasion of the handover , and no exodus of emigrants . Everything seemed smooth and orderly . But the people 's primary concern was whether or not the incoming SAR administration would be capable of tackling difficult problems left behind by the Portuguese , particularly economic recession and declining public order .  
And Tan Hong-hui , head of the Lee Giong-chiu Taiwanese Language Foundation , describes the debate over Tongyong Pinyin and Hanyu Pinyin as " an effort to decide which rotten apple is preferable . " Tan 's primary concern is that an inappropriate choice of a standard romanization system could have an adverse impact on future efforts to teach Taiwanese to school children . Hanyu Pinyin is based strictly on Mandarin , and ca n't be used to represent some of the sounds in Taiwanese .  
Before Kaohsiung was founded , Tungkang was southern Taiwan 's primary commercial harbor . But World War II devastated the wealthy sections of the town . Tungkang was left a virtual ruin , and no trace of the town 's Japanese-occupation-era prosperity remains . Arriving from Pingtung or Kaohsiung , all one sees is a typical fishing village-a harbor populated by a few boats , a great deal of fishing tackle and betelnuts .  
At the thirteenth APEC forum , which aligned itself with the global response against terror , we saw PRC foreign minister Tang Jiaxuan set a dismal example when at a ministerial press conference before the final leaders ' summit he berated Taiwanese reporters and treated Taiwan 's delegates with great discourtesy . His behavior not only made a mockery of the summit 's primary theme of opposition to terrorism , violence and hatred , but also starkly reminded Taiwan 's people how far cross-strait relations still have to go .  
" If Taiwan could elect a president like former British prime minister John Major , whose highest educational attainment was graduation from primary school , perhaps only then will the perverse custom of everyone trying to advance to a higher level of education gradually disappear , " says Chou . With a shake of her head and a sigh , Chou says that the deconstruction of social values will require a great deal of time .  
At the time he finished primary school , there were still no music schools in Taiwan , so his parents , who ran a textiles company and were very supportive of his interest in music , sent him to Tokyo to study , giving no thought to the cost . They also hired well-known piano , voice and composition teachers to tutor him . With his teachers , Wen studied what were then thought of as the most elevated forms of music-Italian opera and English-language popular music .  
In April 2001 , Culturecom and mainland China 's People 's Education Press ( PEP ) , which is under the control of the PRC education ministry , announced that they were launching a joint venture to set up Renwen E-Textbook Technology Company . Their aim is to develop the mainland 's primary and secondary school textbook market , which serves a student population numbering in the hundreds of millions . PEP will be responsible for course planning and content , while Culturecom will provide support with e-book technology .  
Not far off the east coast of Taiwan the continental shelf falls away into an ocean trench thousands of meters deep , so bluefin arriving from across the Pacific have to come close inshore to find shallow waters to spawn . Their newly hatched fry are unable to hunt or swim for themselves , so they need waters that are rich in plankton and have strong currents . The North Equatorial Current and the Kuroshio Current pass by eastern Taiwan , creating an area of high primary productivity .  
AVRDC director Samson C.S . Tsou points out that in nearly 30 years in Taiwan , the center 's accomplishments include raising both the quality and yields of a wide variety of tropical vegetables , including tropical tomatoes , vegetable soybeans , and crucifers . Its staff have also worked to improve the nutritional status and incomes of people in developing countries around Asia . Taiwan has been the primary source of financial support , accounting for nearly 60% of the center 's US $ 10 million budget .  
In 1999 , the Japanese physician H . Takada isolated BPA from the umbilical cords of women giving birth at a clinic . In a previous incident , most primary and secondary schools in Nara , Japan stopped using melamine tableware after intense protests from parents , even though the manufacturer had established that the plates and bowls would not release BPA if the children did not scratch them with their cutlery .  
At that time the MOE had just launched its new " nine-year integrated curriculum , " which reset the first year of English-language study at the fifth grade effective in 2001 . In order to fill the spaces created by the expansion , the MOE sent out a call for qualified English teachers , ultimately resulting in the recruiting of 3500 trainees . However , just two years later more than 1500 teachers , nearly half of the group intended to be the color guard of the new primary English-language instruction , had fallen by the wayside .  
Public health workers , originally at the frontline of community epidemic prevention , ended up performing menial tasks like delivering lunches and emptying garbage cans . For many people , this was an incredible turn of events . A glance at the history of Taiwan 's public health system showed these workers , deployed at the grassroots level , had a vast reservoir of personal experience and had constituted the primary force in fighting epidemics .  
Unlike Hsinchu 's experimental primary and middle schools , which are under the jurisdiction of the Administrative Yuan 's National Science Council , STSIP 's public primary and middle schools are covered by the Tainan County Bureau of Education , and are ranked at the same level as all public primaries , enjoying no special privileges .  
The third and fourth generations ( born in the 1940s and 1950s ) are the " post-war baby boomers . " When they were young the country had nothing , and they were confined to small , pragmatic dreams . The main path for the children of working class families was to finish primary school and get a job in a factory . Even for those with higher education , the value of security-the " iron rice bowl " - was paramount , and becoming a civil servant was considered the best guarantee for the future .  
To break the " teaching by subject " mold that had characterized teaching at the primary and middle school levels for more than ten years , the " integrated curriculum " for grades 1 to 9 was introduced four years ago . Although it reduced ten subjects to seven major disciplines , the core subjects of mathematics , Chinese and English remained clearly delineated in the classroom .  
In mid-June , Taipei City Councilor Liu Yao-jen declared at a press conference that he had bought on the Internet personal information on 1,200 primary and middle school students at NT $ 1 a pop from a " name list seller . " All of this data , most of which was on students in the final years of primary school in Sungshan and Hsinyi districts , had been burned onto a CD-ROM , and included the names of the students and their family members , their grade , telephone number , and address .  
Before that time , all primary and junior high school teachers were trained in specialist teacher training institutions or in the education departments of a small number of regular universities . These students were all government funded , and the government was responsible for their professional placement after graduation . The students were guaranteed lifetime employment , and aside from their professional training , their education emphasized a sense of national spirit .  
the settlement of the question of population must always be closely integrated with the promotion of all round social and economic development for developing countries , the primary task is to eliminate poverty , improve education , health care , living conditions , enhance women 's status and strengthen environmental protection  
While the Working Capital Fund is the primary source of reserve capital in respect of the regular budget , its level ( $ 100-million , less amounts required to meet unforeseen expenditures ) has not been changed since 1982 .  
Together with the established posts funded from the regular budget , the continuing posts would serve as the primary resource , providing the minimum level required to sustain the Organization 's peace-keeping activities .  
The primary threat to humankind is now posed not by the possibility of the eruption of a nuclear conflict between the major Powers , but by regional crises of a national , ethnic or religious nature .  
For the developing countries , the primary concern is to achieve steady and sizeable rates of economic growth for a better standard of living for their growing population .  
The attractiveness of Africa as a location for foreign direct investment continued to be constrained by the small size of most markets , weak private sectors , poor physical infrastructure , an uneven skill level and the heavy reliance on primary exports .  
The Fund also supported a wide range of activities to further integrate family planning into primary healthcare networks , improve the quality of existing services and extend integrated MCH / FP services to poor and remote areas .  
It should maintain institutional memory and develop doctrine , standard operating procedures and operationality in this area , and have primary responsibility for substantive guidance and support of the electoral component of future peacekeeping missions .  
Capacitybuilding , training , regional and international cooperation and information exchange along with a strong coordinating body at the national level seem to have been common primary requirements by developing countries .  
ACC strongly believes that in the main , and excepting a handful of spectacular emergency cases or where special mandates have been established , the primary role of the resident coordinator as a development professional remains essential .  
It was recognized that Governments at all levels should recognize that insecure and inhuman conditions for living and working both violated human rights and were a primary cause of social conflict and violent disruptions of civil society .  
Governments at all levels should recognize that insecure and inhuman conditions for living and working both violate human rights and are a primary cause of social conflict and violent disruptions of civil society .  
Finally , the study proposes a women 's status index which would integrate maternal mortality , adult literacy and primary and secondary enrolment rate , labour force status , contraceptive use , and migrant female / male wage ratio .  
The primary concern now is how to sustain the social gains that have been realized in ecological and economic environments that are becoming increasingly hostile , thus menacing the already fragile environment of the young child .  
Assistance to human resources development totalled US $ 56 million , and included school feeding at the primary and secondary levels , technical and vocational training and institutional feeding in social centres .  
Account should be taken of such problems as extreme poverty , limited resources , dependence on primary commodities , proportional public debt , lack of basic infrastructures and insufficient administrative capacity .  
The need to develop innovative material for use at the primary and secondary school levels , within universities and in professional training , especially for the judiciary , law enforcement officials , the military , and medical and social workers ;  
The Agency 's health-care programme continued to provide comprehensive primary care , including preventive and curative medical care , maternal and child health services , family-planning services and projects to improve environmental health , in addition to secondary care in the form of hospitalization and other referral and support services .  
We hope that the current negotiations amongst the various international organizations concerned will lead to the desired coordination between monetary , financial and trade policies and thereby lead to the laying of genuine foundations for free international trade , wherein there would be no deterioration in the terms of trade or any decline in the prices of primary commodities .  
Just a few years ago , at the Rio Conference , we , the Member countries of the United Nations , established as a primary concern the need to ensure a rational balance between realizing legitimate national goals and safeguarding the well-being of future generations through the protection of the world 's natural resources .  
The debt crisis , depressed prices of primary commodities , protectionist measures , the inadequate flow of direct foreign investment and financial and technical assistance , and deteriorating terms of trade are but a few of the factors adversely affecting socio-economic performance in most of these countries .  It is with this frustrating situation in mind that we intend to continue participating in the work of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group of this Assembly on An Agenda for Development .  
Under such circumstances , the Court , fully aware of its responsibilities as an integral part of the system of peaceful settlement of international disputes established under the Charter , has displayed judicial realism and has considered itself obligated to assist in bringing the parties closer together , while not at any time departing from its primary task of applying the law .  
Despite the fact that primary education has been free and mandatory under the Constitution since the early days of the Republic , there is a sector of our young population that , because of economic and social factors leading to hunger , poverty and social disintegration , is more exposed to marginalization and crime in short , to exclusion .  
The international community 's assistance in these areas will not only offset the adverse consequences of the Uruguay Round , but also lay the ground for effective participation by Africa in the new international trade regime , through processing , manufacturing and distributing finished goods based on the continent 's primary commodities .  
In that regard , the Summit called for increased funding for foreign assistance by governmental and non-governmental donors and multilateral financial institutions to specific programmes in primary education for girls , preventive health care and political participation and encouraged developing countries to use the 20 / 20 concept in planning and funding their human development priorities .  
According to some scenarios , sustainable biomass energy systems could be the largest single contributor to global energy supply , providing from 17 per cent to 35 per cent of the total demand for primary energy in 2050 .  Such a development would not occur under " business as usual " conditions but would derive from sustainability policies and technological advances with regard to liquid , solid and gaseous fuel production from biomass .  
Awareness should be increased of the fundamental linkages between improving the status of women and demographic dynamics , particularly through women 's access to education , primary and reproductive health care programmes , economic independence and their effective , equitable participation in all levels of decision-making .  
Developing industrial and non-industrial planted forests in order to support and promote national ecologically sound afforestation and reforestation / regeneration programmes in suitable sites , including upgrading of existing planted forests of both industrial and non-industrial and commercial purpose to increase their contribution to human needs and to offset pressure on primary / old-growth forests .  
African countries , in particular , required more imaginative long-term solutions to overcome their competitive disadvantage deriving from dependency on primary exports , a weak industrial and export base and technological backwardness .  
As to the financial resources , the representative replied that the process of providing government aid would be a gradual one ; by gradually transforming the current educational system , primary education would become government aided , and university and other forms of tertiary education would be on a cost-sharing basis .  
In the statement , the Conference noted that the Convention on Biological Diversity was the primary international legal instrument for advancing the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of genetic resources .  
The primary objective of the country studies programme initiated by UNEP is to assist national Governments to identify , in the light of social , economic , environmental and other objectives , the basic needs and levels of effective conservation , including the rational use of national biological resources and the necessary supportive measures and costs to meet those needs , as well as the benefits associated with the implementation of those measures .  
Approximately 1.4-billion ha are temperate , boreal and sub-temperate forests in industrialized countries ; these are broadly stable or increasing , although there is still pressure on primary 6 / and natural stands , as well as damage from pollution and fires that reduce forest quality .  
Other areas in which some progress has been made include the consideration of biological diversity ; the reservation of more primary forests ; the use of multi-purpose native species ; less regimented planting and management regimes for landscape and other environmental purposes ; the clear inclusion of forestry concerns into national sustainable development strategies ; and broadening end-use objectives beyond timber production to ecosystem management to sustain multiple benefits .  
The Convention on Biological Diversity is the primary international legal instrument for advancing the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of genetic resources , while recognizing the important role of other conventions to the objectives of the Convention .  
At the global level , a significant number of the inhabitants of our planet continue to be chronically poor ; nearly 35 per cent of the adult population are still illiterate , two thirds of whom are women ; 30 per cent of school age children do not complete primary school ; over 40 per cent in the developing countries are without basic services .  
The most important , signed in Cotonou on 25 July 1993 , assigned to ECOMOG the primary responsibility for assisting the Liberian parties in the implementation of a detailed peace plan providing for a seven-month transitional process leading to free and fair elections .  
Mr . William Seltzer , former Director of the Statistical Division , delivered a commemorative address covering some of the primary issues considered in establishing the Statistical Commission in 1946 , the range of issues that the Commission has addressed over the years , and patterns that have emerged in the work of the Commission and of the international statistical organizations over the past 50 years , including patterns in substance , regional focus and principal matters of concern .

Although progress towards universal education and literacy has been impressive in recent times , the number of illiterate people will continue to grow and many developing countries are likely to fall short of universal primary education by the year 2000 .  Three main concerns regarding current systems of education may be expressed .  
Needless to say that these allegations are mainly propagated by a Government which has been the primary supporter and sponsor of Israel 's State-sponsored terrorism , of its aggressive policies , and of its production of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , and has also backed despotic Governments which have not experienced parliamentarianism , consultation and elections in their political life even for a single day .  
As stated in the guidelines and rules of procedure for the Seminar ( A / AC . 109 / 1107 ) , its primary objective was to review economic and social conditions in the Non-Self-Governing Territories of the Caribbean region and identify areas in which the international community could increase and enhance its participation in programmes of assistance and development and adopt a comprehensive and integrated approach to ensure the viable and sustainable development of the Territories concerned .  
The primary objectives of ECE for the biennium 1996-1997 , in response to the ongoing political and economic changes in the countries of central and eastern Europe , are the integration of these and other less developed countries in the region into the European and global economy and the consolidation of reforms .  
The Court of Appeals vacated the District Court 's decision in this respect and held that the appropriate primary standard for determining damages in such a case was the cost reasonably to be incurred by the sovereign or its designated agency to restore or rehabilitate the environment in the affected area to its pre-existing condition , or as close thereto as is feasible without grossly disproportionate expenditures .  [ 15 ] / A / CN . 4 / 443 , paras . 41 to 51 .  
Such crises may save various sources , continue for varying periods of time , and disrupt governmental performance to varying degrees , but their primary characteristic is that the existing national Government is unable to meet the immediate daily requirements of its population or to build a viable basis for sustainable development without external assistance .  
Improvement in the overall quality of both primary and secondary education will require tackling the internal inefficiencies in the existing system and improving services in keeping with the nation 's need for an educational content responsive to the changes occurring in the national market economy .  
The heavy emphasis on French language acquisition at the expense of mother tongue learning in the earlier primary grades may also be contributing to the overall low achievement levels being measured in mathematics and science skills among the majority of Djiboutian children sitting French public examinations .  
UNIDO offers a demand-oriented , integrated human resource development programme in three primary areas interlocking at three levels of support intervention : ( a ) policy advice based on analysis and assessment of requirements ; ( b ) institutional capacity-building and catalytic learning systems , including training , at subsector levels and in specialized fields ; and ( c ) communication networks to facilitate coordination and synergy of efforts .  
Its main functions include : ( a ) processing the dissemination of human rights as an effective means of guaranteeing their observance and consolidating the democratic system , ( b ) cooperating with relevant institutions to promote the teaching of human rights at the primary , secondary and university levels and in non-formal education and ( c ) promoting the alignment of domestic legislation with international agreements and treaties on human rights .  
Beginning in the 1960s , during the decolonization of Africa , the active presence of bands of mercenaries constituted a resource for the colonial interests that wished to remain in the region , hindering the process of self-determination from which new African States were emerging or giving rise to situations of destabilization and war in which the mercenary ingredient played a primary role in intensifying and internationalizing the armed conflict .  
Ensure universal and equal access to and completion of primary education by all children and eliminate the existing gap between girls and boys , as stipulated in article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child ; 10 / similarly , ensure equal access to secondary education by the year 2005 and equal access to higher education , including vocational and technical education , for all girls and boys , including the disadvantaged and gifted ;

Provide more accessible , available and affordable primary health-care services of high quality , including sexual and reproductive health care , which includes family planning information and services , and giving particular attention to maternal and emergency obstetric care , as agreed in the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development ;  
Increase budgetary allocations for primary health care and social services , with adequate support for secondary and tertiary levels , and give special attention to the reproductive and sexual health of girls and women ; priority should be given to health programmes in rural and poor urban areas ;  
The employment-generating capacity of growth can be enhanced by investing in the more labour-intensive sectors of the economy , especially agriculture ; by increasing investments in human capital , i.e . , basic education , primary health care , nutrition and population programmes ; and by reducing or removing distortions in relative factor prices that arise from a malfunctioning of the labour market or of the market for credit . 
NULLThe primary stage of financial intermediation is dominated by a combination of a large informal sector where transactions between lenders and borrowers are direct and personal , a currency-creating authority ( a central bank or a currency board ) , and a limited number of deposit-receiving and credit institutions like the commercial banks .  
For this purpose , the central bank should promote the establishment , on a volunteer basis , of a critical mass of primary dealers who must satisfy certain minimum criteria ( such as observing minimum capital standards ) to possess the financial capacity to support the government securities market , and encourage competition .  
Assistance to human resources development totalled $ 64-million , and included school feeding at the primary and secondary levels , technical and vocational training and institutional feeding in social centres .  
Both objectives fulfil a catalytic role by raising the level of consciousness among the pertinent actors , generating functional dialogue with all concerned and fostering a collaborative process involving the primary responsibility of the Government and the complementary or supplementary role of the international community .  
During the 1980s , many African countries experienced sluggish economic growth , attributable to exogenous shocks , as well as to the latent structural weakness of many of the economies and the continuing high dependence on a few primary commodities .  
The primary aim of the Special Rapporteur is to present an objective and impartial assessment of the human rights situation in all countries covered by the mandate on the basis of first-hand information gathered during her missions to the region , as well as information collected by the field operation established by the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat in the former Yugoslavia .  
In order to promote social integration , Bangladesh had set up special programmes for women , children , youth , disabled and elderly persons and minorities focusing on reducing illiteracy ( through compulsory primary education , non-formal education and adult literacy programmes and innovative schemes such as the food-for-education programme aimed at reducing the drop-out rate ) , with special emphasis placed on the education of the girl child .  
While there was a need to stress the primary responsibility of the Security Council for imposing economic and trade sanctions in order to punish anyone who threatened international peace and security , target such sanctions to those whom they were intended to punish and lift them speedily whenever conditions so warranted , practical ways and means must be found to avoid unnecessary suffering by third States which applied such sanctions .  
Governments bore the primary responsibility for formulating appropriate strategies , policies , programmes and actions to combat poverty ; the effort required sound macroeconomic policies , structural changes and the mobilization of domestic resources , inter alia , through more equitable tax regimes and a reduction in military expenditures .  
contacts made a crucial contribution to the formulation of the highly relevant group projects listed below aimed at underpinning the educational system and supporting rural community economic development , including the delivery of primary health care and other services , and facilitating internships of UNETPSA and other graduates within the civil service . 
outbreak of hostilities in 1991 interrupted critical administrative and financial reforms within the Croatian Ministry of Health as it sought to end chronic financial deficits and increase efficiency by shifting resources from curative and secondary clinical care to primary and preventive services .

Condemns in the strongest terms all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict , recognizing that the leadership in territories under the control of Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and formerly Serb-held areas of the Republic of Croatia , the commanders of Serb paramilitary forces and political and military leaders in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) bear primary responsibility for most of those violations , and that persons who commit such acts will be held personally responsible and accountable ;  
Indeed , the need for fundamental review in the role of public administration and development has become urgent because countries have to meet the complex developmental challenges of dealing with the impact of increasing globalization and the role of non-governmental organizations and the private sector , while focusing on the primary objectives of eliminating poverty and promoting social justice and economic growth .  
With respect to this and to the general follow-up of the subject , we believe that the United Nations Development Programme , which has been doing work of this kind , must continue to play a primary role in this field , helping to coordinate activities in the field at the inter-agency level and promoting complementary activities at the bilateral level , particularly in State reform in the economic and social fields and in the justice sector .  
In the development debate , globalization and the call for integration into a single global economic grid are held out as the primary or even the sole option for developing countries seeking cooperation with developed countries .  
If we were to agree that the chain connecting home , primary school , secondary school , university , and life broke down some time ago , and that it is missing its first link , without which all else is pointless and without foundation , we would invest at the very roots of human life the economic and scientific resources needed to form human beings from the start , enabling them to grow , endowed with the values that would make them citizens .  
Indeed , 72 per cent of single heads of households , most of them female , live below the official poverty line , which simply implies a lack of access or limited access to basic social services , including food , sanitation , shelter , basic education and primary health care . 
We in Japan believe that such genuine development can only be achieved on the basis of a comprehensive approach to development which would involve activities ranging over the economic and social fields , such as financial resource mobilization through official development assistance , investment and trade , and human resource mobilization through social integration of people by means of ensuring basic education , primary health care and empowerment of all groups of people in society .  
Thus while it acknowledged that individual countries bear the primary responsibility for the attainment of the goals of the conference , it also recognized that the support of the international community as a whole including of the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , bilateral donors , non-governmental organizations and all actors of civil society will be crucial if we are to realize all the objectives of the conference .  
We may recall that , although the Social Summit acknowledged that the primary responsibility to attain the goals set out in the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action rests with national Governments , it also emphasized the importance of support and contributions from the international community , the United Nations and multilateral financial institutions .  
While recognizing that primary responsibility for nuclear safety rests with national Governments , the European Union welcomes the initiatives taken by the IAEA to strengthen cooperation and mutual assistance and its continuing work in fostering a global nuclear safety culture , and recognizes its contribution to future work under the Convention on Nuclear Safety , which is a major accomplishment in this field .  
Thus , any State which is individually capable of assuming primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and whose candidature is acceptable at both the regional and global levels can become a permanent member of the Security Council through the relevant procedure .  
Inasmuch as the Security Council bears the primary responsibility for carrying out the major purpose of the United Nations , namely , the achievement and maintenance of world peace and stability , its importance is obvious .  As it has indicated on previous occasions , Japan , with the endorsement of many other countries , is prepared to discharge its responsibilities as a permanent member of the Security Council in accordance with its basic philosophy of the non-resort to the use of force prohibited by its Constitution .  
Further , it had established a family planning and education policy which allowed it , through mother and child public health services , to keep the population informed regarding every kind of health and nutritional problem , and it applied strict primary and community health care policies in villages and rural centres .

The occupation itself constituted the primary violation of the human rights of the civilian population and was the source of other violations and harsh practices by the occupying Israeli authorities , including closure and sealing of the occupied territories , land confiscation , the demolition of Palestinian homes , the detention of Palestinians , and the killing of Palestinians by military and undercover security forces .  
As far as the energy-deficient developing countries are concerned , to meet this challenge and to arrest their ever-increasing dependence on imported energy , mainly oil , it will be necessary to accelerate exploration and development of indigenous energy resources and to develop greater capacity for producing commercial primary energy : oil , natural gas , coal , hydropower and other new and renewable sources of energy .  
Nevertheless , developing countries will require substantial investments considering that their total primary energy demand will continue to grow ; and even though the demand is expected to moderate , the outlook , as mentioned above , projects that , in a couple of decades , their total primary energy consumption may account for one half or more of global consumption . 
World wide , fossil fuels have continued to be the dominant primary energy source for electricity generation , with coal accounting for the major share and likely to remain so well into the next century , although hydro and nuclear energy have made tangible progress in many countries .  
KAMAL ( Pakistan ) , speaking on agenda item 112 ( c ) , said that , while there were many types of human rights violations , the primary concern of the United Nations was the systematic violation of human rights committed by States and persons in authority and that the United Nations could influence Member States to take legislative , administrative and judicial measures to promote and protect human rights .  
More detailed analysis is required for assessing the applicability and reliability of valuation in the key situations in which valuation is important that are probably more central to the concerns of the Panel such as ( i ) utilization or conservation of primary , unmanaged or any other types of forests , ( ii ) establishment of reserves for biological diversity , ( iii ) carbon sequestration and ( iv ) international watersheds , among others ; 
According to some scenarios , sustainable biomass energy has the potential to become the largest single source of energy globally , providing from 17 per cent to 35 per cent of the total demand for primary energy in 2050 if sustainability policies are adopted and technological advances achieved in the production of liquid , solid and gaseous fuels from biomass , based on the use of fast-growing species , soil-water species relationships , new harvesting and conversion techniques or the application of genetically engineered bacteria .  
UNDP / PAPP is upgrading a cultural and educational complex in Jericho to provide 23 additional classrooms for primary and secondary girls ' schools and is engaging in an extensive school rehabilitation project to provide supplementary facilities for schools throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip , including at least 25 classrooms in primary and secondary girls ' schools .

Most of the developed countries draw on large shares of crude oil and natural gas in their primary energy consumption ; some regions have substantial contributions of nuclear energy and modern renewable sources . 
The evolution of the relative shares of each of the most important sources of energy in total global consumption , the dynamics of structural change in the global energy system , and the relative shares of different primary energy sources in global primary energy show that it took about half a century before coal was replaced by crude oil as the dominant global energy source .  
Recognizing that the prime responsibility for nuclear safety rests with national Governments , it is of primary importance to continue to enhance international collaborative efforts to promote a high level of nuclear safety world wide .  
Reducing the adult illiteracy rate - the appropriate age group to be determined in each country - to at least half its 1990 level , with an emphasis on female literacy ; achieving universal access to quality education , with particular priority being given to primary and technical education and job training , combating illiteracy , and eliminating gender disparities in access to , retention in and support for education ;

The representative of the Centre explained the primary goal and objectives of the five-year project : to help the organization better meet the current and diverse demands placed on it in matters relating to peace and security and humanitarian and human rights affairs ; to help the United Nations system to meet the new and dramatic challenges of the future ; to strengthen cooperation and coordination among the system partners ; and to help the United Nations organization to meet the calls for reform , accountability and flexibility .  
Improvement in the overall quality of both primary and secondary education will require tackling the internal inefficiencies in the existing system and improving services in keeping with the nation 's need for an educational content responsive to the changes occurring in the national market economy .  
While it is the primary responsibility of African States to bear the bulk of their development burden by tapping as a matter of priority their own financial resources , the rigid international economic environment , the domestic economic hardship and the lukewarm disposition of some creditors to adopt radical measures have constituted obstacles to the mobilization of financial resources and to the development of Africa .  
Both at the eighth ministerial meeting at Yaound and at the Bureau meeting at Brazzaville , it was felt that while the primary responsibility for resolving the political and security problems in the Central African subregion rested with the Governments and peoples of the countries concerned , concerted action at the subregional and wider levels was required to promote lasting solutions .  
It reached the understanding that , while there would be no change in the procedure , the following categories of items would generally receive favourable consideration : medical equipment ; packaging material for medical supplies and foodstuffs ; clothing ; supplies for babies and infants ; soaps ; animal feed and animals and eggs for breeding or hatching purposes ; agricultural seeds ; supplies and materials for primary and secondary education ; spare parts and materials for water treatment and sewage plants ; and storage facilities for grain and foodstuffs . 
While the United Nations system has an essential and complementary role to play in supporting Governments in their efforts to eradicate poverty , the primary responsibility for the assessment of poverty situations and for the formulation , strengthening and implementation of national poverty eradication plans and programmes lies with Governments and requires a strong political commitment at the national level .  
While it is the primary responsibility of the Government to mobilize resources for poverty eradication at the national level , the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , is recognized - as is the need to enhance the effectiveness , efficiency and impact of the activities of the United Nations system in the area of poverty eradication .  
At the Social Summit , Heads of State or Government acknowledged that the primary responsibility to attain the goals set out in the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action rested with national Governments , with the support and contributions of the international community , the United Nations , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society , including private citizens .  
By its resolution 50 / 227 of 24 May 1996 on further measures for the restructuring and revitalization of the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields , the General Assembly decided that in the case of functional commissions with the primary responsibility for the follow-up and review of the implementation of major conferences , the Council should ensure the coordination of their multi-year programmes , in accordance with the agreed conclusions adopted by the Council at its substantive session of 1995 on the coordinated follow-up of the results of major international conferences .  
Much of sub-Saharan Africa suffers from severe shortages of technical , managerial and entrepreneurial skills , acute infrastructure bottlenecks , weak institutional capabilities , severe limitations in the capacity to import , and continued dependence on exports of a few primary commodities .  
A primary responsibility of the regional commissions is to provide advisory services and to strengthen regional networks by which Member States may exchange experience and information , and harmonize national economic , social , environmental and settlement policies and strategies - in particular those that have a critical cross-border impact on , inter alia , migration , shared coastal zones , river basins and ecosystems , watersheds , and pollution and waste management .  
In addition it appears that occupational and educational counselling is available to all citizens in Greenland , that the counselling is free of charge , and that it is provided by municipal labour market offices , municipal or regional vocational guidance officers , institutions of primary and lower secondary education and institutions of vocational training .  
Tunisia 's health system has developed a policy based on primary health care , which is itself focused on mother and child care , family planning , school and university medicine , prevention of epidemic diseases , and campaigns against certain social ills , as well as on treatment of everyday illnesses and dispensing of basic medicines .  
It must be pointed out here that children and adolescents are targeted by this education-for-health programme as recipients and agents who can pass on the benefits , and health topics are increasingly incorporated in primary and secondary curricula as well as in cultural activities in schools and universities ( hygiene , nutrition , accident prevention , living with domestic animals , prevention of transmissible diseases , contraception , sexually transmitted diseases , AIDS . . . ) . 
The Council decided that , prior to the annual high-level policy dialogue , and allowing sufficient time for preparation , the Secretariat should communicate to the financial and trade institutions a report on the relevant issues to be discussed at the session , with a primary focus on the agreed theme ; and that communication should be prepared in part based on the submission of issues and questions that Member States could be invited to suggest to the Secretariat , which would then be taken into account in the preparation of the Secretariat 's report to the institutions .  
It is suggested that the focal points ' tasks should be to identify national human rights education needs and to develop a national plan of action for human rights education containing specific objectives , strategies and programmes for the enhancement of human rights education at all levels , including pre-schools , primary and secondary schools , higher education , professional schools , training programmes for public officials and non-formal learning , including general public information .  
The training packages will incorporate the methodological approach mentioned in paragraph 75 of the Plan of Action , and address the following professional groups : prison officers ; primary and secondary schoolteachers ; legal professionals ( judges and lawyers ) ; national and local non-governmental organizations ; media ; and human rights monitors .  
The World Food Summit was a fitting end to that series of conferences and a bridge into the future because it addressed the primary needs of all mankind and proposed solutions for food security and sustainable agricultural development at the global level . 
In the context of the Programme of Action for the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education and in cooperation with relevant experts and organizations , the High Commissioner for Human Rights / Centre for Human Rights has envisaged the preparation and publication of six new training manuals - for prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , legal professionals , national and local non-governmental organizations , mass media and for monitoring - and three handbooks on human rights and conflict resolution , human rights and parliament , and human rights and constitutions .  
Reaffirms that the Inter-agency Standing Committee is the primary mechanism for inter-agency decisions on system-wide policy issues relating to humanitarian assistance , for formulating a coherent and timely response to major disasters and complex emergencies and for inter-agency decisions of an operational nature , and calls on members of the Standing Committee to continue to examine as a matter of priority options and proposals to improve its functioning ;  
To strengthen and reorient health education and health services , particularly primary health care programmes , including sexual and reproductive health , and to design quality health programmes that meet the physical and mental needs of girls and that attend to the needs of young expectant and nursing mothers ;  
While the primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security lay with the United Nations , regional organizations could also make a valuable contribution to facilitating the peaceful resolution of conflicts .  However , regional initiatives , especially in developing countries , had so far been constrained by logistical and financial difficulties .  
Reaffirms that the Inter-agency Standing Committee is the primary mechanism for inter-agency decisions on system-wide policy issues relating to humanitarian assistance , for formulating a coherent and timely response to major disasters and complex emergencies and for inter-agency decisions of an operational nature , and calls on members of the Standing Committee to continue to examine as a matter of priority options and proposals to improve its functioning ;  
To make primary education compulsory and available free for all , particularly children , indicating the minimum age for enrolment in primary school , the minimum and maximum ages for compulsory education , the proportion of children enrolled , who complete primary education , as well as any relevant disaggregated data including by age , gender , region , urban / rural area , national , social and ethnic origin , service coverage and budgetary allocation ;  
While the developing countries bore the primary responsibility for finding solutions to their economic predicament , their development efforts should be based on genuine interdependence and mutual cooperation with the developed economies in the context of global partnership rather than on the old donor-recipient relationship .  
To strengthen and reorient health education and health services , in particular primary health care programmes , including sexual and reproductive health , and to design quality health programmes that meet the physical and mental needs of girls and that attend to the needs of young expectant and nursing mothers ;  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Recognizing that , while developing countries have primary responsibility for their own development , there is continuing need for the international community to give strong support to their efforts to solve their economic and social problems through , inter alia , the promotion of a favourable international economic environment ,  
In this context , he felt sure that delegations had come to the current session of the Board not to fulfil routine representational formalities but , stimulated and motivated by the in-depth and solid analytical reports prepared by the secretariat , to hold a serious dialogue on issues that were of primary concern to their policy-makers .  
These included macroeconomic stability , high rates of domestic saving , maintenance of sound financial intermediaries , high priority given to human resource development ( especially to high _ quality primary and secondary education ) , competitive exchange rates , export orientation , a supportive environment which rewarded entrepreneurship and allowed open and constructive dialogue between government and the private sector regarding objectives and policies , and governance which balanced the promotion of social cohesion and consensus with that of competition between individuals and companies .  
The programmes contained in the appeal are aimed at establishing nationwide mechanisms that respond to immediate needs , such as basic relief , mine clearance and repatriation , and other mechanisms that respond to priority needs in deprived areas in the different regions , such as the provision of safe drinking water , primary health care , urban and rural recovery .  
These organizations could help , through international and regional meetings , to sensitize countries to pressing bioethical issues , notably those raised in the primary health care context , and to foster a North-South dialogue in this area , aimed at achieving broad universal consensus on the essential principles of contemporary bioethics and their implementation in the health and related sectors ( principle 4.1 ) .  
Significant human and financial resources are being devoted by the international community to assistance in mine clearance , which is , by its nature , a long-term task ; to efficient and effective demining programmes where the primary emphasis is on the development of national mine-clearance capacities by afflicted countries ; to mine-awareness programmes ; and to the rehabilitation and reintegration into society of victims of landmines .  
Schools , universities , professional and vocational training programmes and institutions should be encouraged and assisted in developing human rights curricula and corresponding teaching and resource materials , with the help of Governments and international donors and programmes , for incorporation into formal education at the early childhood , primary , secondary , post-secondary and adult education levels .  
The survey and evaluation and the resulting preliminary report shall seek to identify with particularity , at the international , regional and national levels , inter alia , the number and types of human rights educational materials available , existing human rights educational institutes , centres and permanent focal points , national percentages of teachers trained in human rights education , the percentage of schools having adopted human rights curricula at the primary , secondary and post-secondary levels , and number and types of human rights education components in professional training and non-formal education programmes .  
Underlines that the primary responsibility for the further successful implementation of the peace process lies with the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina themselves , which during the next two years should assume increasingly a greater responsibility for the functions now undertaken or coordinated by the international community , and stresses that without compliance and active participation by all the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina in rebuilding a civil society they can not expect the international community and major donors to continue shouldering the political , military and economic burden of the implementation and reconstruction efforts ;

CARICOM countries had assumed primary responsibility , while fully conscious that the ultimate success of their efforts could only be guaranteed within a framework of international cooperation and partnership based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibility .  
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
While it is recognized that States have the primary responsibility in securing a sound and stable national political , economic and social environment for development , international support , at the request of interested Governments , and the creation of a favourable international economic environment are crucial ingredients in this effort .  
The Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America is an integral development programme that focuses on the human being as the central and primary subject of development and gives priority to economic and social growth in our countries and to the protection and conservation of the ecosystem , as is evidenced by regional efforts in the areas of biodiversity , climate change and forests .  
The international community is devoting considerable human and financial resources to assistance in mine clearing , which by its very nature is a long-term job ; to efficient mine clearance programmes in which the primary emphasis needs to be on helping the afflicted countries to develop national mine clearance capability ; to mine-awareness programmes ; and to the rehabilitation and reintegration into society of landmine victims .  
Australia 's primary goal for the Commission 's work on nuclear-weapon-free zones is an outcome in keeping with the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) decision on principles and objectives , that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones , on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned , enhances regional and global peace and security and contributes to the ultimate objective of achieving a world entirely free of nuclear weapons .  
The Task Force on Employment and Sustainable Livelihoods conducted one review in a country where poverty eradication was the primary focus in a setting of low economic growth and rapid labour force expansion ; in another country , the main concern was how to move from structural adjustment to growth with equity ; in another , the review focused on the employment aspects associated with a shift from a planned to a market-oriented economy .  
In specifically identified primary and secondary compulsory schools located in the traditional area of settlement of an ethnic group , this right is ensured for every member of the ethnic minority regardless of the number of pupils participating , and in primary and secondary compulsory schools located outside the traditional settlement area minority language instruction is provided where there is a demand , requiring a minimum number of participants which varies between four and nine .  
Since 1977 , in the light of the considerable increase in the number of children having to begin a form of education completely different from that of their country of origin and unrelated to their native language , and in the middle of the school year , special primary classes have been set up to smooth their transition and a specific teaching method developed to help them learn French quickly . 
Such a forum and other appropriate instruments might be based on a framework convention containing flexible rules whose primary objective is to create the appropriate dynamics aimed at the implementation and ongoing consolidation of an international economic environment leading to the exercise by all nations of the right to development and to genuine international peace and security .  
Moreover , the Programme of Action is committed to improving the quality of life by focusing on three interdependent goals : reductions in infant , child and maternal mortality ; expanded access to education , particularly for women and girls ; and universal access to primary health care , including reproductive health and family planning services .  
Four working groups have been constituted within the Committee to assess the state of human rights education in the following areas : primary and secondary schools ; universities and higher education ; adult education , including several professional groups ( police , armed forces , judges , teachers , social workers , etc . ) ; and activities undertaken by NGOs , associations and trade unions .  
Work has continued on the six training packages to support training activities addressed to professional and other target groups ( prison officers ; primary and secondary school teachers ; judges and lawyers ; national and local non-governmental organizations ; journalists ; human rights monitors ) undertaken by the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights and by the national committees and training centres for human rights education .  
Although the number of boys enrolled in primary school is roughly equal to that of girls , the drop-out rate among girls is so much higher that the initial benefit is lost .  Teenage pregnancies and marriages , the inadequacy of recovery structures , impoverished parents , the girls ' lack of a sense of reality , and backward prejudices towards them are among the main causes of girls ' low level of education , which is reflected in a very high illiteracy rate .  
He made it clear in his previous report to the General Assembly that those measures were beginning to have a real impact on the people in the towns , particularly the urban elite , and that they were adding to the suffering in rural areas , where people are often poor and where , owing to the violence and the civil war , regular access to , inter alia , health care , hygiene , various essential goods and primary and secondary education have become even more curtailed .  
Space telecommunications , which are the primary field of commercial applications of space , involve major economic , political , cultural , strategic and industrial stakes .  
The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the Centre for Human Rights should provide advisory services on the organization at the federal and State level of training courses for teachers in preschool , primary or basic and secondary educational establishments to make them aware of the importance of teaching the principles of tolerance and non _ discrimination based on religion and belief .  
Recognizing that , while developing countries have primary responsibility for their own development , there is continuing need for the international community to give strong support to their efforts to solve their economic and social problems through , inter alia , the promotion of a favourable international economic environment ,  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly the primary and secondary levels , including a focus on the local environment in the context of sustainable development .  
While some requested an improvement in quality in public rather than private schools , maintaining free public education at the primary level , others favoured a more liberal policy environment with competition between the private and public sector .  
In her statement , the Chairperson-Rapporteur , Ms . Erica-Irene Daes , outlined four major concerns : ( a ) the need for a recognition of the effects of dispossession of lands and habitat on the health of indigenous peoples ; ( b ) the exposure of indigenous peoples to hazardous industrial and military activities ; ( c ) the need to improve access to national health-care systems ; ( d ) the role traditional medical practices could play in national primary health-care systems and the protection of those practices .  
Application of telemedecine was seen by experts as a promising way of addressing issues such as equity , cost containment , optimizing the use expensive technology and specialized medical services , upgrading of health treatment , improving access of patients in remote areas to primary and specialized health services , and regional sharing of knowledge and cooperation .  
This action has received increased support from different donor sources ; however , additional and increased development assistance is to be directed towards the basic social services with a view to improving primary and reproductive health care , basic education , skills development and literacy in priority , to at least meet the targets set by recent international conferences . 
In view of the current situation in Haiti , so ably described today by the representative of Haiti , we can not but conclude that the primary objective of UNSMIH 's mandate has not yet been fully accomplished , and that sustained international assistance remains essential .  
Recalling that in the same resolution the Commission called upon the Sub _ Commission to focus on its primary role as an advisory body of the Commission , to facilitate efficient and effective participation of non _ governmental organizations , to devote sufficient time at its forty _ ninth session to the discussion of its working methods and to prepare specific recommendations on that issue for consideration by the Commission ,  
While everyone accepted that the primary responsibility in that regard lay at the national level , the Summit was an important and timely recognition of the multifaceted nature of food security and of the need to encourage cooperation at the international level to support the efforts of Governments .  
Because of a range of technical problems and the rate at which applications have been approved by the Security Council Committee , medical commodities have not reached Iraq in a coordinated or complementary manner , and most have been destined for hospitals and specialized facilities rather than primary health care centres .  
While it is the primary responsibility of national Governments to achieve the economic , social and environmental objectives of Agenda 21 , it is essential that international cooperation be reactivated and intensified , recognizing , inter alia , the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as set forth in Principle 7 of the Rio Declaration .  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly the primary and secondary levels , that is accessible to all and that augments both human capacity and well-being .  
For developing countries , the primary motivation is the formation and consolidation of viable economic spaces that would create dynamic trade and investment growth , develop viable , integrated and competitive productive systems to serve regional and international markets , strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination and enhance infrastructural linkages .  
In addition to the services provided at the primary level , UNRWA aims , in principle , at providing essential in-patient medical services to the refugee population at its own facilities , at local contracted hospitals or through partial reimbursement of costs incurred by refugees for treatment at government or private hospitals .  
Improvement in the overall quality of both primary and secondary education would require tackling the internal inefficiencies in the existing system and improving services in keeping with the nations need for an educational content responsive to the changes occurring in the national market economy .  
Although , in practice , compulsory education in the national system of education consists of primary education and basic middle education ( basic secondary ) , its compulsory nature has not been established expressly by law , since the Act promulgated in 1959 ( No . 680 / 59 ) provided for compulsory education up to 12 years of age and the sixth grade of primary schooling , and its provisions have not been modified since .  
Several primary needs should be met : to devise effective and coherent arrangements for information and assessment of the impact of sanctions on third States ; to ensure appropriate access by third States to the process ; to develop a method of assessing actual adverse impact ; to explore practical and innovative measures of assistance ; and to enhance coordination and cooperation among relevant institutions and organizations both within and outside the United Nations system .  
Work has continued on the six training packages to support training activities addressed to professional and other target groups , such as human rights monitors , judges and lawyers , prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , journalists , and national and local non-governmental organizations undertaken by the Office and by the national committees and training centres for human rights education .  
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies in each country for promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
While it is recognized that States have the primary responsibility for securing a sound and stable national political , economic and social environment for development , international support , at the request of interested Governments , and the creation of a favourable international economic environment are crucial ingredients in this effort .  
At the World Conference on Education for All and the World Summit for Social Development , Governments committed themselves to ensuring universal access to quality education , attaining the highest possible standards of physical and mental health and ensuring access of all to primary health care .  This should include efforts to rectify inequalities relating to social conditions , race , national origin , age or disability , and between urban and rural areas .  
Recognizing that , despite the significant progress in basic education , especially the increase in primary school enrolment coupled with a growing emphasis on the quality of education , major problems , both emerging and continuing , still persist which require even more forceful and concerted action at national and international levels to achieve the goal of education for all ,  
Education was free at all levels and compulsory at the primary level , health care was provided free to all sectors of the population without exception , special attention being paid to vulnerable groups , and young people played an important part in the development and execution of development plans . 
The Ministry of Health : The Ministry offers primary , secondary and tertiary health-care services in Jordan through main and subsidiary health centres , consisting of 506 health centres , 161 maternal and child clinics , 110 dental clinics and 15 respiratory disease clinics , as at the end of 1990 .  
The Movement observed that in his note the Secretary-General expressed the view that weapons of mass destruction continued to be of primary importance despite significant progress achieved to outlaw chemical and biological weapons and to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regimes .  
One delegation , also speaking on behalf of a large group , advanced some specific suggestions to the Task Force , among which was that the free flow of accurate and up-to-date information , taking into account the linguistic diversity of the Organization , must remain the primary function of the Department and that the dissemination of relevant information about the United Nations and its programmes should continue to be a core activity of the Department , particularly in developing countries .

Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Recognizes that business and industry , including transnational corporations , play a crucial role in the social and economic development of a country , that a stable policy regime enables and encourages business and industry to operate responsibly and efficiently and to implement longer-term policies and that the activities of business and industry are the primary contributors to increasing prosperity , which is a major goal of the development process ;  
Even though the total number of peacekeeping operations and their average size have been reduced in recent years , peacekeeping is still the key instrument available to the United Nations in discharging its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
Among its primary purposes , the Charter of the United Nations provides for the maintenance of international peace and security ; the fostering between nations of international relations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples ; international cooperation in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields ; and the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all .  
While recognizing that international cooperation and assistance are essential for the full implementation of the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , my delegation is very well aware of the primary role that Governments and civil society must play at the national level towards the fulfilment of the objectives set forth .  
While recognizing that the primary responsibility for nuclear safety rests with the respective national Governments , the European Union welcomes the entry into force of this Convention , which was concluded under IAEA auspices and which will strengthen cooperation and mutual assistance in a favourable climate for the development a global nuclear-safety culture . 
Past endeavours have also shown that the primary objective of establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones is to seek the absence of nuclear weapons from various parts of the world ; to insulate the zonal States from the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons ; to prevent horizontal as well as vertical proliferation of nuclear weapons , which could pose new and unacceptable threats to the security of States ; to contribute to the process of disarmament , especially nuclear disarmament ; and to facilitate cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy .  
Developed countries should sustain stable economic growth at home and provide increased opportunities for developing countries to expand their exports , including both manufactured products from more advanced developing countries and primary commodities from less developed countries .  
The health component of such plans should address the key objectives spelled out in chapter 6 of Agenda 21 , namely ( a ) meeting primary health care needs , particularly in rural areas , ( b ) control of communicable diseases , ( c ) protecting vulnerable groups , ( d ) meeting the urban health challenge and ( e ) reducing health risks from environmental pollution and hazards .  
A number of Governments have taken action to provide basic health services for youth ; promote good sanitation and hygiene practices among youth ; develop health education and accessible , available and affordable primary health care services ( including services related to sexual and reproductive health and relevant education in those fields , such as information about sexually transmitted diseases , such as human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) ) ; eliminate sexual abuse of young people ; and combat malnutrition among young people .  
In the context of the Programme of Action for the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education and in cooperation with relevant experts and organizations , HCHR / CHR has envisaged the preparation and publication of six new training manuals - for prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , legal professionals , national and local non-governmental organizations , mass media and for monitoring - and three handbooks on human rights and conflict resolution , human rights and parliament , and human rights and constitutions .  
Reaffirms that the Inter-Agency Standing Committee is the primary mechanism for inter-agency decisions on system-wide policy issues relating to humanitarian assistance , for formulating a coherent and timely response to major disasters and complex emergencies and for inter-agency decisions of an operational nature , and calls upon members of the Standing Committee to continue to examine , as a matter of priority , options and proposals to improve its functioning ;  
However , to combat crimes involving , in particular , illegal trafficking in hazardous and nuclear substances and endangered species , criminal law should be used as the primary tool , since penal sanctions , by criminalizing a certain behaviour with a corresponding penalty , have a greater deterrent effect .  
As the embodiment of the world community 's conscience and the sole recognized multilateral negotiating forum on disarmament , this Conference not only shoulders the primary responsibility for finding ways and means to really deal with the problem , but is also the most appropriate venue to commence the negotiations on a universal , effectively verifiable and legally binding multilateral treaty regulating the development , production , stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons and their destruction .  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
The primary objectives of the UNISPACE III Conference would be ( a ) to promote effective means of using space technology to assist in the solution of problems of regional or global significance and ( b ) to strengthen the capabilities of Member States , in particular developing countries , to use the applications of space research for economic , social and cultural development .  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly at the primary and secondary levels , including lifelong education , accessible to all , that augments both human capacity and well-being . 
WHO envisages future activities in the northern Caucasus region which are of primary importance , including projects aimed at the control of communicable diseases in the region , in particular vaccine preventable diseases , acute diarrhoeal diseases and tuberculosis , and mental health assistance .  [ 1 ] / Available for consultation in the Secretariat .  
Governments and all other actors should make special efforts to achieve the benchmarks set in the Platform for Action of universal access to basic education and completion of primary education by at least 80 per cent of primary school-age children by the year 2000 ; close the gender gap in primary - and secondary-school education by the year 2005 ; provide universal primary education in all countries before the year 2015 ; and consider providing multilateral and bilateral assistance .  
The Convention on the Rights of the Child being a point of departure to guarantee child rights ; taking into consideration the progressive character of the implementation of certain social , economic and cultural rights as recognized in article 4 of the Convention , the Government of the Kingdom of Swaziland would undertake the implementation of the right to free primary education to the maximum extent of available resources and expects to obtain the cooperation of the international community for its full satisfaction as soon as possible .  
In addition to the costed population package , the Programme of Action also calls for socio-economic development programmes designed to strengthen the primary health-care delivery system and child survival programmes , provide universal basic education , improve the status and empowerment of women , generate employment , address environmental concerns , provide social services and address poverty eradication through sustained economic growth .  
In the case of functional commissions with the primary responsibility for the follow-up and review of the implementation of a major conference , the Council was requested to ensure the coordination of their multi-year programmes , in accordance with the agreed conclusions adopted by the Council at its substantive session of 1995 on the coordinated follow-up of the results of major international conferences .  
Although the importance of education , from the primary stage to university , is widely accepted as critical for sustained development , many developing societies continue to suffer from a growing mismatch between the skills generated by the educational system and those that are needed by the productive system .  
In the past few months , UNICEF emergency interventions had been focused on ensuring protection and care of the most vulnerable children , including tracing and reunification of unaccompanied children ; provision of primary health care services and of safe water , sanitation and hygiene education , particularly in the camps for refugees and displaced people ; monitoring children 's nutritional status and supporting therapeutic feeding ; and provision of emergency supplies .  
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
While it is recognized that States have the primary responsibility in securing a sound and stable national political , economic and social environment for development , international support , at the request of interested Governments , and the creation of a favourable international economic environment are crucial ingredients in this effort .  
All of the major developing regions of the world registered significant increases in primary school enrolments , with the combined total reaching some 545-million in 1995 , representing an increase of nearly 50-million in five years , double the pace of expansion during the 1980s .  Since enrolment rates increased faster than population growth , the net enrolment ratios continued to rise in all developing regions .  
While it was true that developing countries bore the primary responsibility for solving their human settlements problems , the international community , and the developed countries in particular , should endeavour to create a favourable international environment for the development of human settlements by providing sufficient financial resources and technologies to the developing countries .  
While it is the primary responsibility of national Governments to achieve the economic , social and environmental objectives of Agenda 21 , it is essential that international cooperation be reactivated and intensified , recognizing , inter alia , the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as set forth in principle 7 of the Rio Declaration .  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly the primary and secondary levels , that is accessible to all and that augments both human capacity and well-being .  
When authorities at the national , regional or local levels faced a sufficiently high number of individuals whose primary language was a minority language , States had come to accept that they must provide a level of service appropriate to the relative number of individuals involved .  
This performance reflected the combined effects of a variety of factors : the results of most countries efforts to control severe macroeconomic imbalances in 1995 , adverse climate conditions which affected primary production , and the drop in the international prices of the main export goods .  
Successful implementation of the Platform for Action depended on the contribution of all the participants - Governments , civil society and international organizations - and while the primary responsibility for implementation lay at the national level , international cooperation was crucial , particularly with regard to fulfilling commitments to provide financial resources .

Being cognizant of the importance of focusing upon the family , which is the primary unit of any society , and on economic entities in the fight against poverty , the Government orients its activities towards changing the current inert status of poor families living below the poverty line , as mere recipients of aid .  
Therefore the primary focus of operational activities must continue to be at the country level , with national Governments assuming the main responsibility for coordinating development assistance programming , which , in turn , must be based on the national development plans and priorities of those countries .  
The primary objective of the unit will be to promote respect for human rights and compliance with minimum humanitarian standards , and to deter massive and systematic violations of human rights in the future .  
Comprehensive revised guidelines for these types of contracts have been developed and will be implemented in 1999 , bearing in mind the primary objective of achieving value for money in an efficient and expeditious manner .

It should be stressed , however , that the most efficient and effective way for a functional commission that wishes quite legitimately to contribute its own particular perspective on a multidimensional issue is to build its input on the basis of relevant analyses and policy recommendations provided by other functional commissions and other United Nations bodies , in particular those which have primary responsibility for addressing the underlying major issue , and in close consultation with them .  
These included universal access to primary education , with special attention to closing the gender gap in primary and secondary school education , wherever it exists ; universal access to primary health care ; universal access to a full range of comprehensive reproductive health-care services , including family planning , as set out in paragraph 7.6 of the Programme of Action ; reductions in infant , child and maternal morbidity and mortality ; and increased life expectancy .

Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) and geographical constraints , such as being landlocked and lacking good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .  
Africas heavy dependence on primary commodity exports ( accounting for about 80 per cent of total export earnings ) is evidence of the low level of human resource development and limited technological capability to take advantage of emerging trade and investment opportunities .  
Through renewed support for IDDA , efforts must be intensified to reduce the gap between those with knowledge and skills and those without , as well as to facilitate foreign and domestic private sector investment in the value chain of primary products and other manufacturing activities in order to address the emerging problems of the technology gap , urban unemployment and rural poverty .

The inundation of coastal areas can result in : ( a ) loss of agricultural land , a common concern because agriculture is still the primary source of income in many small island developing States , and most agricultural land lies along the coastline , increasing its vulnerability to sea level rise ; ( b ) loss of exclusive economic zone ( EEZ ) , a common concern because sea level rise will also reduce the exclusive economic zone , thereby reducing the resource base .  
Even where humanitarian objectives were not part of their primary mandates , peacekeeping operations have proved valuable , often vital , in supporting and protecting needy populations , humanitarian workers and supplies in environments where there was limited consent from the warring parties or when the security situation is simply beyond their control .  
My delegation welcomes this briefing and future briefings on this important subject , which has a direct bearing on the primary responsibility of the Council in the maintenance of international peace and security as it deals more and more with the issue of the humanitarian dimensions of conflicts around the world , especially given the new and more pernicious forms of conflict in our contemporary world .

Empirical evidence has proven that selection-oriented public assessments , even if they are not intended to require prior preparation , would inevitably hamper students ' learning experience and make primary education examination-driven .  This would in turn hinder the all-round development of students ; and  
In the past few years , the Administration has introduced a number of safety measures for school buses , which included the compulsory requirement of an adult escort for all school buses carrying primary and kindergarten pupils , the installation of public address system and warning devices at doors and emergency exit doors of school buses and school light buses , and the adoption of a brighter colour scheme for new school light buses to make them more conspicuous .

The chemically enhanced primary treatment ( CEPT ) process at Stonecutters Island removes substantial quantities of pollutants from the incoming sewage , notably about 80% of suspended solids , 70% of biochemical oxygen demand , 30% of total nitrogen , 40% of phosphorus , 60% of heavy metals and 50% of sewage indicator bacteria .  
Dr Ho pointed out that the primary objective of authorising football betting was to combat the growing problem of illegal football gambling by diverting existing demand for football betting into a regulatory channel .  
The Government will resume 29 private agricultural lots with a total area of about 10,130 square metres to facilitate the construction of a primary school and a secondary school in Sheung Shui . The proposed projects aim to meet the increasing demand for primary and secondary school places in the North District .  
The Taipei Waterworks also is working to improve the quality of the water and to elevate the water pressure . ( 8 ) Sewer Construction : The main task is to build underground sewers and to keep water flowing so that the citizens can have a more wholesome living environment . ( 9 ) Education : Taipei has many schools with high standards . There are 23 universities and colleges , 100 secondary ( high ) schools , 116 primary ( elementary ) schools and 172 kindergartens within the city .  
During the eight years after she moved with the government of the Republic of China to Taiwan , she was the principal of the primary school affiliated to the Taiwan Provincial Hsinchu Junior Teachers ' College , and set the future direction for physical and mental hygiene education for primary school children .  
She instilled a fresh , lively , open and progressive atmosphere in the primary school during her eight-year stay . When , in 1955 , the then Minister of Education , Chang Chi-yun , decided to set up a permanent Elementary School Teachers ' In-Service Education Center to raise the standard of primary school teachers , Dorothy Kao was invited to take charge of the planning work .  
Moreover , the heavy rains and intense heat of tropical areas rob the soil of its nutrients , and crop blight is always a worry . Vegetables thus made a logical choice , with tomatoes , Chinese cabbage , sweet potatoes , soybeans , and green lentils being the primary crops .  
Three years ago , Dr . Huang did a study of 800 middle and primary school students in Taipei , and discovered the percentage of overweight kids nearly double the previous survey . Between ten and eighteen percent of the different age groups were 20 percent over the standard , while between 20 and 29 percent were 10 to 20 percent overweight . "  
Zero growth in agriculture , relaxing restrictions on farmland being owned only by farmers , establishing a farmers ' superannuation scheme . . . . In the two years since taking office , Council of Agriculture Chairman Yu Yu-hsien has outlined a host of imaginative proposals as a blueprint for reform of a farming sector still languishing at the primary production stage , which have stirred considerable controversy among agronomists and the farming community .  
Among the traditional yi-chen , some which have particularly compelling singing , genuine religious significance , or functions of bonding people orbuilding healthier bodies , have been promoted in primary and middle schools . For example , the Sung Chiang chen , which stresses unity , and the Cart Drum chen , with its athletic movements , are both being passed on in a number of schools .  
The Department of Education has already planned to spend 20 percent of its budget on improving the government primary and junior schools in Taiwan Province . Apart from this we want to aid private schools to raise the average educational level .  
It is as though our image of a Korea with high foreign debts , political turmoil and wife-beating machismo has not changed for over ten years , " says Jing Ker-yi , Korea expert at the Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research . " At present Korea has incredibly overtaken us in a number of industries . This includes their high-profile automobiles and domestic appliances . It 's not very easy for people to realize , but they have made startling achievements in petrochemicals , steel , upper and mid-stream primary products and components .  
Their coach , physical education professor Wu Teng-ta tells us : " The props for drum dancing are quite simple ; cymbals are all you need for backup accompaniment . Also the movements are lively and beautifully patterned , making this kind of dance perfect for high school and primary school students learning traditional folk dances . " The students of Taitung Normal College can take elective courses in drum dancing , so that some day they may pass along the art to their own students .  
Elders Also Receive a Baptism in the New Tide : At the end of 1989 , the Kuomintang implemented a party primary system to determine nominees , which fit better with the democratic spirit . The number of seats occupied by women suddenly shot up , with fourteen women among the 101 supplementary legislators ( one of whom has since left to take a cabinet position ) .  
We do n't need to be overly concerned about this problem at present , " argues P . K . Chiang , political vice minister of Economic Affairs . Since the Six-Year Plan is public infrastructure , the primary consideration must be getting the job done right to benefit all the citizens . Other factors , like raising the level of economic and trade diplomacy , helping upgrade local firms , and so on are all subsidiary goals .  
Before 1973 the primary and secondary students began classes at the same time . Now that the parents have been through grades 1-12 under the same roof , the elementary and junior / senior high schoolers have separate daily flag ceremonies , with the national anthem resounding four times .  
Now , through the efforts of several dedicated teachers at Shuanglung primary school , Shuanglung village has set up a Bunun Cultural Development Association , and has launched a series of back-to-roots events , such as leading tribespeople on visits to the Bunun 's original home , organizing a traditional " eight-part singing " group and opening a cultural resources office .  
Li Hsiu , a Tainan native now in her late 50 ' s , still remembers that she watched films like these in primary school . " Everyone admired the heroism and courage of the Japanese soldiers , " she admits . They were also deeply impressed with the idea that the Chinese side was militarily incompetent . She remembers that when the kids played soldiers in school , the losers would often be ridiculed as " Zhi Na [ Chinese ] troops , " indicating how inept they were .  
When two candidates are on an equal footing based on primary considerations , secondary factors become decisive . These include provincial , ethnic and class origin . Even physical appearance is n't overlooked .  
The Academia Sinica is quite confident in stating that researchers of early and medieval imperial Chinese history , for instance , can regard the on-line Twenty-Five Books of History as primary sources . For researchers of late imperial China from the Song dynasty on , because there are abundant historical materials , the materials of this archive are not the only ones available , but they certainly should not be overlooked .  
Without a degree , they ca n't become teachers . And the special coaching program has been discontinued . Many weightlifting instructors at the primary level are serving in the guise of " substitute teachers . " These primary-level teams are the training ground for " fresh troops " for the national team in the future .  
What private sector publishing firms originally set their sights on was the huge primary school textbook market , which consists of over 300,000 student readers . This , plus the possibility of publishing additional reference materials and teaching aids , adds up to potentially enormous profits . It is the main reason publishers were initally jumping at the chance to get in on the textbook market .  
Professor Huang Ping-huang of the Department of Education at National Chengchi University ( NCCU ) also believes that initiative is the quality most lacking in today 's primary and middle school teachers : " They are so accustomed to eating instant noodles that they have forgotten how to cook . "  
Furthermore , the Executive Yuan clearly stated that a satellite launching system would not be developed . The primary goal of the current Satellite Project is to develop satellite and related applied technologies . The secondary goal is to promote basic and applied space research .  
COA officials emphasize that after the " Draft Revisions to the Agricultural Development Regulations " are passed , the primary task will be to do a complete survey to identify all current illegal use of agricultural land . At present , much vital farmland that is strictly prohibited for other purposes has in fact been misused . Observation of the principle of " agricultural use only for land zoned as agricultural land " must be rigorously ensured before restrictions on selling farmland are lifted .  
As of the end of 1997 , the Catholic church in Taiwan was operating 46 middle and primary schools , two universities , one technical college , 17 homes for the elderly , and seven halfway houses for troubled youth . In addition , various parishes include centers to assist aboriginal people , foreign laborers working in Taiwan ( including many Filipino Catholics ) , and those on the fringes of society .  
In truth , the primary and secondary mathematics curricula that everyone is familiar with , both in the West and here in Asia , has the same roots : the Industrial Revolution . Just like the modern curricula for languages , sciences , history , geography , art and physical education , the math curriculum has been designed to teach small numbers of the elite . Even in the 1960s , after the advent of universal education , the purpose of math education was to train scientists .  
In military affairs , after the PRC unilaterally broke off negotiations in 1995 , they initiated a series of missile tests in the Taiwan Strait . According to the ROC Ministry of Defense , in recent years the PRC has continually seen Taiwan 's new generation of military capabilities as its primary hypothetical enemy and undertaken numerous military exercises based on this premise . In addition , the national defense report just issued by the PRC emphasized repeatedly that the possibility of using armed force against Taiwan could not be excluded .  
Chou , whose primary area of research is clinical statistics , states that most of this research is limited to extractions and animal research in the Chinese medical laboratory , or consists of individual case reports . It focuses on the search for individual problems and is not widely applicable general research . " Only a very few projects can really be said to have been designed as clinical trials . And even in these cases , the design is still rough .  
Currently sex education classes-covering things like reproductive biology , sexual values , and the use of sanitary napkins and condoms-are being taught in middle and primary schools across Taiwan . Through education at the roots , children can be helped to keep themselves steady through this period of vast change , and build a sexual value system suited to the 21st century .  
" In Taiwan , AIDS is a venereal disease , " says Troy Lee . In the past , LOFAA 's primary mission was caring for AIDS victims . However , the group gradually realized that the key to AIDS prevention is education of those members of the public who are not infected with the virus . " If even sex is difficult to talk about , how can we talk about AIDS ? "  
Public facilities in the village are first-rate , including three primary schools , a junior high school , a senior high school , an employee day care center , an employee discount store , traditional fruit and vegetable markets , restaurants , athletic fields , a golf driving range , a public swimming pool , a library , a cinema , a hospital , and even a funeral home .  
The primary objective of the ROCSAT-1 mission is scientific research . The satellite carries three payloads : an ocean color imager ( which will send down images for both practical and academic use ) which was jointly designed and built by the ROC and the Japanese company NEC ; a satellite communications experiments payload ; and an ionospheric plasma and electrodynamics instrument developed in conjunction with the University of Texas at Dallas which will provide important data on factors affecting electronic communications .  
Unlike neighboring Hong Kong in 1997 , there was no public backlash in Macau on the occasion of the handover , and no exodus of emigrants . Everything seemed smooth and orderly . But the people 's primary concern was whether or not the incoming SAR administration would be capable of tackling difficult problems left behind by the Portuguese , particularly economic recession and declining public order .  
And Tan Hong-hui , head of the Lee Giong-chiu Taiwanese Language Foundation , describes the debate over Tongyong Pinyin and Hanyu Pinyin as " an effort to decide which rotten apple is preferable . " Tan 's primary concern is that an inappropriate choice of a standard romanization system could have an adverse impact on future efforts to teach Taiwanese to school children . Hanyu Pinyin is based strictly on Mandarin , and ca n't be used to represent some of the sounds in Taiwanese .  
Before Kaohsiung was founded , Tungkang was southern Taiwan 's primary commercial harbor . But World War II devastated the wealthy sections of the town . Tungkang was left a virtual ruin , and no trace of the town 's Japanese-occupation-era prosperity remains . Arriving from Pingtung or Kaohsiung , all one sees is a typical fishing village-a harbor populated by a few boats , a great deal of fishing tackle and betelnuts .  
At the thirteenth APEC forum , which aligned itself with the global response against terror , we saw PRC foreign minister Tang Jiaxuan set a dismal example when at a ministerial press conference before the final leaders ' summit he berated Taiwanese reporters and treated Taiwan 's delegates with great discourtesy . His behavior not only made a mockery of the summit 's primary theme of opposition to terrorism , violence and hatred , but also starkly reminded Taiwan 's people how far cross-strait relations still have to go .  
" If Taiwan could elect a president like former British prime minister John Major , whose highest educational attainment was graduation from primary school , perhaps only then will the perverse custom of everyone trying to advance to a higher level of education gradually disappear , " says Chou . With a shake of her head and a sigh , Chou says that the deconstruction of social values will require a great deal of time .  
At the time he finished primary school , there were still no music schools in Taiwan , so his parents , who ran a textiles company and were very supportive of his interest in music , sent him to Tokyo to study , giving no thought to the cost . They also hired well-known piano , voice and composition teachers to tutor him . With his teachers , Wen studied what were then thought of as the most elevated forms of music-Italian opera and English-language popular music .  
In April 2001 , Culturecom and mainland China 's People 's Education Press ( PEP ) , which is under the control of the PRC education ministry , announced that they were launching a joint venture to set up Renwen E-Textbook Technology Company . Their aim is to develop the mainland 's primary and secondary school textbook market , which serves a student population numbering in the hundreds of millions . PEP will be responsible for course planning and content , while Culturecom will provide support with e-book technology .  
Not far off the east coast of Taiwan the continental shelf falls away into an ocean trench thousands of meters deep , so bluefin arriving from across the Pacific have to come close inshore to find shallow waters to spawn . Their newly hatched fry are unable to hunt or swim for themselves , so they need waters that are rich in plankton and have strong currents . The North Equatorial Current and the Kuroshio Current pass by eastern Taiwan , creating an area of high primary productivity .  
AVRDC director Samson C.S . Tsou points out that in nearly 30 years in Taiwan , the center 's accomplishments include raising both the quality and yields of a wide variety of tropical vegetables , including tropical tomatoes , vegetable soybeans , and crucifers . Its staff have also worked to improve the nutritional status and incomes of people in developing countries around Asia . Taiwan has been the primary source of financial support , accounting for nearly 60% of the center 's US $ 10 million budget .  
In 1999 , the Japanese physician H . Takada isolated BPA from the umbilical cords of women giving birth at a clinic . In a previous incident , most primary and secondary schools in Nara , Japan stopped using melamine tableware after intense protests from parents , even though the manufacturer had established that the plates and bowls would not release BPA if the children did not scratch them with their cutlery .  
At that time the MOE had just launched its new " nine-year integrated curriculum , " which reset the first year of English-language study at the fifth grade effective in 2001 . In order to fill the spaces created by the expansion , the MOE sent out a call for qualified English teachers , ultimately resulting in the recruiting of 3500 trainees . However , just two years later more than 1500 teachers , nearly half of the group intended to be the color guard of the new primary English-language instruction , had fallen by the wayside .  
Public health workers , originally at the frontline of community epidemic prevention , ended up performing menial tasks like delivering lunches and emptying garbage cans . For many people , this was an incredible turn of events . A glance at the history of Taiwan 's public health system showed these workers , deployed at the grassroots level , had a vast reservoir of personal experience and had constituted the primary force in fighting epidemics .  
Unlike Hsinchu 's experimental primary and middle schools , which are under the jurisdiction of the Administrative Yuan 's National Science Council , STSIP 's public primary and middle schools are covered by the Tainan County Bureau of Education , and are ranked at the same level as all public primaries , enjoying no special privileges .  
The third and fourth generations ( born in the 1940s and 1950s ) are the " post-war baby boomers . " When they were young the country had nothing , and they were confined to small , pragmatic dreams . The main path for the children of working class families was to finish primary school and get a job in a factory . Even for those with higher education , the value of security-the " iron rice bowl " - was paramount , and becoming a civil servant was considered the best guarantee for the future .  
To break the " teaching by subject " mold that had characterized teaching at the primary and middle school levels for more than ten years , the " integrated curriculum " for grades 1 to 9 was introduced four years ago . Although it reduced ten subjects to seven major disciplines , the core subjects of mathematics , Chinese and English remained clearly delineated in the classroom .  
In mid-June , Taipei City Councilor Liu Yao-jen declared at a press conference that he had bought on the Internet personal information on 1,200 primary and middle school students at NT $ 1 a pop from a " name list seller . " All of this data , most of which was on students in the final years of primary school in Sungshan and Hsinyi districts , had been burned onto a CD-ROM , and included the names of the students and their family members , their grade , telephone number , and address .  
Before that time , all primary and junior high school teachers were trained in specialist teacher training institutions or in the education departments of a small number of regular universities . These students were all government funded , and the government was responsible for their professional placement after graduation . The students were guaranteed lifetime employment , and aside from their professional training , their education emphasized a sense of national spirit .  
the settlement of the question of population must always be closely integrated with the promotion of all round social and economic development for developing countries , the primary task is to eliminate poverty , improve education , health care , living conditions , enhance women 's status and strengthen environmental protection  
While the Working Capital Fund is the primary source of reserve capital in respect of the regular budget , its level ( $ 100-million , less amounts required to meet unforeseen expenditures ) has not been changed since 1982 .  
Together with the established posts funded from the regular budget , the continuing posts would serve as the primary resource , providing the minimum level required to sustain the Organization 's peace-keeping activities .  
The primary threat to humankind is now posed not by the possibility of the eruption of a nuclear conflict between the major Powers , but by regional crises of a national , ethnic or religious nature .  
For the developing countries , the primary concern is to achieve steady and sizeable rates of economic growth for a better standard of living for their growing population .  
The attractiveness of Africa as a location for foreign direct investment continued to be constrained by the small size of most markets , weak private sectors , poor physical infrastructure , an uneven skill level and the heavy reliance on primary exports .  
The Fund also supported a wide range of activities to further integrate family planning into primary healthcare networks , improve the quality of existing services and extend integrated MCH / FP services to poor and remote areas .  
It should maintain institutional memory and develop doctrine , standard operating procedures and operationality in this area , and have primary responsibility for substantive guidance and support of the electoral component of future peacekeeping missions .  
Capacitybuilding , training , regional and international cooperation and information exchange along with a strong coordinating body at the national level seem to have been common primary requirements by developing countries .  
ACC strongly believes that in the main , and excepting a handful of spectacular emergency cases or where special mandates have been established , the primary role of the resident coordinator as a development professional remains essential .  
It was recognized that Governments at all levels should recognize that insecure and inhuman conditions for living and working both violated human rights and were a primary cause of social conflict and violent disruptions of civil society .  
Governments at all levels should recognize that insecure and inhuman conditions for living and working both violate human rights and are a primary cause of social conflict and violent disruptions of civil society .  
Finally , the study proposes a women 's status index which would integrate maternal mortality , adult literacy and primary and secondary enrolment rate , labour force status , contraceptive use , and migrant female / male wage ratio .  
The primary concern now is how to sustain the social gains that have been realized in ecological and economic environments that are becoming increasingly hostile , thus menacing the already fragile environment of the young child .  
Assistance to human resources development totalled US $ 56 million , and included school feeding at the primary and secondary levels , technical and vocational training and institutional feeding in social centres .  
Account should be taken of such problems as extreme poverty , limited resources , dependence on primary commodities , proportional public debt , lack of basic infrastructures and insufficient administrative capacity .  
The need to develop innovative material for use at the primary and secondary school levels , within universities and in professional training , especially for the judiciary , law enforcement officials , the military , and medical and social workers ;  
The Agency 's health-care programme continued to provide comprehensive primary care , including preventive and curative medical care , maternal and child health services , family-planning services and projects to improve environmental health , in addition to secondary care in the form of hospitalization and other referral and support services .  
We hope that the current negotiations amongst the various international organizations concerned will lead to the desired coordination between monetary , financial and trade policies and thereby lead to the laying of genuine foundations for free international trade , wherein there would be no deterioration in the terms of trade or any decline in the prices of primary commodities .  
Just a few years ago , at the Rio Conference , we , the Member countries of the United Nations , established as a primary concern the need to ensure a rational balance between realizing legitimate national goals and safeguarding the well-being of future generations through the protection of the world 's natural resources .  
The debt crisis , depressed prices of primary commodities , protectionist measures , the inadequate flow of direct foreign investment and financial and technical assistance , and deteriorating terms of trade are but a few of the factors adversely affecting socio-economic performance in most of these countries .  It is with this frustrating situation in mind that we intend to continue participating in the work of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group of this Assembly on An Agenda for Development .  
Under such circumstances , the Court , fully aware of its responsibilities as an integral part of the system of peaceful settlement of international disputes established under the Charter , has displayed judicial realism and has considered itself obligated to assist in bringing the parties closer together , while not at any time departing from its primary task of applying the law .  
Despite the fact that primary education has been free and mandatory under the Constitution since the early days of the Republic , there is a sector of our young population that , because of economic and social factors leading to hunger , poverty and social disintegration , is more exposed to marginalization and crime in short , to exclusion .  
The international community 's assistance in these areas will not only offset the adverse consequences of the Uruguay Round , but also lay the ground for effective participation by Africa in the new international trade regime , through processing , manufacturing and distributing finished goods based on the continent 's primary commodities .  
In that regard , the Summit called for increased funding for foreign assistance by governmental and non-governmental donors and multilateral financial institutions to specific programmes in primary education for girls , preventive health care and political participation and encouraged developing countries to use the 20 / 20 concept in planning and funding their human development priorities .  
According to some scenarios , sustainable biomass energy systems could be the largest single contributor to global energy supply , providing from 17 per cent to 35 per cent of the total demand for primary energy in 2050 .  Such a development would not occur under " business as usual " conditions but would derive from sustainability policies and technological advances with regard to liquid , solid and gaseous fuel production from biomass .  
Awareness should be increased of the fundamental linkages between improving the status of women and demographic dynamics , particularly through women 's access to education , primary and reproductive health care programmes , economic independence and their effective , equitable participation in all levels of decision-making .  
Developing industrial and non-industrial planted forests in order to support and promote national ecologically sound afforestation and reforestation / regeneration programmes in suitable sites , including upgrading of existing planted forests of both industrial and non-industrial and commercial purpose to increase their contribution to human needs and to offset pressure on primary / old-growth forests .  
African countries , in particular , required more imaginative long-term solutions to overcome their competitive disadvantage deriving from dependency on primary exports , a weak industrial and export base and technological backwardness .  
As to the financial resources , the representative replied that the process of providing government aid would be a gradual one ; by gradually transforming the current educational system , primary education would become government aided , and university and other forms of tertiary education would be on a cost-sharing basis .  
In the statement , the Conference noted that the Convention on Biological Diversity was the primary international legal instrument for advancing the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of genetic resources .  
The primary objective of the country studies programme initiated by UNEP is to assist national Governments to identify , in the light of social , economic , environmental and other objectives , the basic needs and levels of effective conservation , including the rational use of national biological resources and the necessary supportive measures and costs to meet those needs , as well as the benefits associated with the implementation of those measures .  
Approximately 1.4-billion ha are temperate , boreal and sub-temperate forests in industrialized countries ; these are broadly stable or increasing , although there is still pressure on primary 6 / and natural stands , as well as damage from pollution and fires that reduce forest quality .  
Other areas in which some progress has been made include the consideration of biological diversity ; the reservation of more primary forests ; the use of multi-purpose native species ; less regimented planting and management regimes for landscape and other environmental purposes ; the clear inclusion of forestry concerns into national sustainable development strategies ; and broadening end-use objectives beyond timber production to ecosystem management to sustain multiple benefits .  
The Convention on Biological Diversity is the primary international legal instrument for advancing the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of genetic resources , while recognizing the important role of other conventions to the objectives of the Convention .  
At the global level , a significant number of the inhabitants of our planet continue to be chronically poor ; nearly 35 per cent of the adult population are still illiterate , two thirds of whom are women ; 30 per cent of school age children do not complete primary school ; over 40 per cent in the developing countries are without basic services .

Although progress towards universal education and literacy has been impressive in recent times , the number of illiterate people will continue to grow and many developing countries are likely to fall short of universal primary education by the year 2000 .  Three main concerns regarding current systems of education may be expressed .  
Needless to say that these allegations are mainly propagated by a Government which has been the primary supporter and sponsor of Israel 's State-sponsored terrorism , of its aggressive policies , and of its production of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , and has also backed despotic Governments which have not experienced parliamentarianism , consultation and elections in their political life even for a single day .  
As stated in the guidelines and rules of procedure for the Seminar ( A / AC . 109 / 1107 ) , its primary objective was to review economic and social conditions in the Non-Self-Governing Territories of the Caribbean region and identify areas in which the international community could increase and enhance its participation in programmes of assistance and development and adopt a comprehensive and integrated approach to ensure the viable and sustainable development of the Territories concerned .  
The primary objectives of ECE for the biennium 1996-1997 , in response to the ongoing political and economic changes in the countries of central and eastern Europe , are the integration of these and other less developed countries in the region into the European and global economy and the consolidation of reforms .  
The Court of Appeals vacated the District Court 's decision in this respect and held that the appropriate primary standard for determining damages in such a case was the cost reasonably to be incurred by the sovereign or its designated agency to restore or rehabilitate the environment in the affected area to its pre-existing condition , or as close thereto as is feasible without grossly disproportionate expenditures .  [ 15 ] / A / CN . 4 / 443 , paras . 41 to 51 .  
Such crises may save various sources , continue for varying periods of time , and disrupt governmental performance to varying degrees , but their primary characteristic is that the existing national Government is unable to meet the immediate daily requirements of its population or to build a viable basis for sustainable development without external assistance .  
Improvement in the overall quality of both primary and secondary education will require tackling the internal inefficiencies in the existing system and improving services in keeping with the nation 's need for an educational content responsive to the changes occurring in the national market economy .  
The heavy emphasis on French language acquisition at the expense of mother tongue learning in the earlier primary grades may also be contributing to the overall low achievement levels being measured in mathematics and science skills among the majority of Djiboutian children sitting French public examinations .  
UNIDO offers a demand-oriented , integrated human resource development programme in three primary areas interlocking at three levels of support intervention : ( a ) policy advice based on analysis and assessment of requirements ; ( b ) institutional capacity-building and catalytic learning systems , including training , at subsector levels and in specialized fields ; and ( c ) communication networks to facilitate coordination and synergy of efforts .  
Its main functions include : ( a ) processing the dissemination of human rights as an effective means of guaranteeing their observance and consolidating the democratic system , ( b ) cooperating with relevant institutions to promote the teaching of human rights at the primary , secondary and university levels and in non-formal education and ( c ) promoting the alignment of domestic legislation with international agreements and treaties on human rights .  
Beginning in the 1960s , during the decolonization of Africa , the active presence of bands of mercenaries constituted a resource for the colonial interests that wished to remain in the region , hindering the process of self-determination from which new African States were emerging or giving rise to situations of destabilization and war in which the mercenary ingredient played a primary role in intensifying and internationalizing the armed conflict .  
Ensure universal and equal access to and completion of primary education by all children and eliminate the existing gap between girls and boys , as stipulated in article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child ; 10 / similarly , ensure equal access to secondary education by the year 2005 and equal access to higher education , including vocational and technical education , for all girls and boys , including the disadvantaged and gifted ;

Increase budgetary allocations for primary health care and social services , with adequate support for secondary and tertiary levels , and give special attention to the reproductive and sexual health of girls and women ; priority should be given to health programmes in rural and poor urban areas ;  
The employment-generating capacity of growth can be enhanced by investing in the more labour-intensive sectors of the economy , especially agriculture ; by increasing investments in human capital , i.e . , basic education , primary health care , nutrition and population programmes ; and by reducing or removing distortions in relative factor prices that arise from a malfunctioning of the labour market or of the market for credit . 
NULLThe primary stage of financial intermediation is dominated by a combination of a large informal sector where transactions between lenders and borrowers are direct and personal , a currency-creating authority ( a central bank or a currency board ) , and a limited number of deposit-receiving and credit institutions like the commercial banks .  
For this purpose , the central bank should promote the establishment , on a volunteer basis , of a critical mass of primary dealers who must satisfy certain minimum criteria ( such as observing minimum capital standards ) to possess the financial capacity to support the government securities market , and encourage competition .  
Assistance to human resources development totalled $ 64-million , and included school feeding at the primary and secondary levels , technical and vocational training and institutional feeding in social centres .  
Both objectives fulfil a catalytic role by raising the level of consciousness among the pertinent actors , generating functional dialogue with all concerned and fostering a collaborative process involving the primary responsibility of the Government and the complementary or supplementary role of the international community .  
During the 1980s , many African countries experienced sluggish economic growth , attributable to exogenous shocks , as well as to the latent structural weakness of many of the economies and the continuing high dependence on a few primary commodities .  
The primary aim of the Special Rapporteur is to present an objective and impartial assessment of the human rights situation in all countries covered by the mandate on the basis of first-hand information gathered during her missions to the region , as well as information collected by the field operation established by the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat in the former Yugoslavia .  
In order to promote social integration , Bangladesh had set up special programmes for women , children , youth , disabled and elderly persons and minorities focusing on reducing illiteracy ( through compulsory primary education , non-formal education and adult literacy programmes and innovative schemes such as the food-for-education programme aimed at reducing the drop-out rate ) , with special emphasis placed on the education of the girl child .  
While there was a need to stress the primary responsibility of the Security Council for imposing economic and trade sanctions in order to punish anyone who threatened international peace and security , target such sanctions to those whom they were intended to punish and lift them speedily whenever conditions so warranted , practical ways and means must be found to avoid unnecessary suffering by third States which applied such sanctions .  
Governments bore the primary responsibility for formulating appropriate strategies , policies , programmes and actions to combat poverty ; the effort required sound macroeconomic policies , structural changes and the mobilization of domestic resources , inter alia , through more equitable tax regimes and a reduction in military expenditures .  
contacts made a crucial contribution to the formulation of the highly relevant group projects listed below aimed at underpinning the educational system and supporting rural community economic development , including the delivery of primary health care and other services , and facilitating internships of UNETPSA and other graduates within the civil service . 
outbreak of hostilities in 1991 interrupted critical administrative and financial reforms within the Croatian Ministry of Health as it sought to end chronic financial deficits and increase efficiency by shifting resources from curative and secondary clinical care to primary and preventive services .

Condemns in the strongest terms all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict , recognizing that the leadership in territories under the control of Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and formerly Serb-held areas of the Republic of Croatia , the commanders of Serb paramilitary forces and political and military leaders in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) bear primary responsibility for most of those violations , and that persons who commit such acts will be held personally responsible and accountable ;  
Indeed , the need for fundamental review in the role of public administration and development has become urgent because countries have to meet the complex developmental challenges of dealing with the impact of increasing globalization and the role of non-governmental organizations and the private sector , while focusing on the primary objectives of eliminating poverty and promoting social justice and economic growth .  
With respect to this and to the general follow-up of the subject , we believe that the United Nations Development Programme , which has been doing work of this kind , must continue to play a primary role in this field , helping to coordinate activities in the field at the inter-agency level and promoting complementary activities at the bilateral level , particularly in State reform in the economic and social fields and in the justice sector .  
In the development debate , globalization and the call for integration into a single global economic grid are held out as the primary or even the sole option for developing countries seeking cooperation with developed countries .  
If we were to agree that the chain connecting home , primary school , secondary school , university , and life broke down some time ago , and that it is missing its first link , without which all else is pointless and without foundation , we would invest at the very roots of human life the economic and scientific resources needed to form human beings from the start , enabling them to grow , endowed with the values that would make them citizens .  
Indeed , 72 per cent of single heads of households , most of them female , live below the official poverty line , which simply implies a lack of access or limited access to basic social services , including food , sanitation , shelter , basic education and primary health care . 
We in Japan believe that such genuine development can only be achieved on the basis of a comprehensive approach to development which would involve activities ranging over the economic and social fields , such as financial resource mobilization through official development assistance , investment and trade , and human resource mobilization through social integration of people by means of ensuring basic education , primary health care and empowerment of all groups of people in society .  
Thus while it acknowledged that individual countries bear the primary responsibility for the attainment of the goals of the conference , it also recognized that the support of the international community as a whole including of the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , bilateral donors , non-governmental organizations and all actors of civil society will be crucial if we are to realize all the objectives of the conference .  
We may recall that , although the Social Summit acknowledged that the primary responsibility to attain the goals set out in the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action rests with national Governments , it also emphasized the importance of support and contributions from the international community , the United Nations and multilateral financial institutions .  
While recognizing that primary responsibility for nuclear safety rests with national Governments , the European Union welcomes the initiatives taken by the IAEA to strengthen cooperation and mutual assistance and its continuing work in fostering a global nuclear safety culture , and recognizes its contribution to future work under the Convention on Nuclear Safety , which is a major accomplishment in this field .  
Thus , any State which is individually capable of assuming primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and whose candidature is acceptable at both the regional and global levels can become a permanent member of the Security Council through the relevant procedure .  
Inasmuch as the Security Council bears the primary responsibility for carrying out the major purpose of the United Nations , namely , the achievement and maintenance of world peace and stability , its importance is obvious .  As it has indicated on previous occasions , Japan , with the endorsement of many other countries , is prepared to discharge its responsibilities as a permanent member of the Security Council in accordance with its basic philosophy of the non-resort to the use of force prohibited by its Constitution .  
Further , it had established a family planning and education policy which allowed it , through mother and child public health services , to keep the population informed regarding every kind of health and nutritional problem , and it applied strict primary and community health care policies in villages and rural centres .

The occupation itself constituted the primary violation of the human rights of the civilian population and was the source of other violations and harsh practices by the occupying Israeli authorities , including closure and sealing of the occupied territories , land confiscation , the demolition of Palestinian homes , the detention of Palestinians , and the killing of Palestinians by military and undercover security forces .  
As far as the energy-deficient developing countries are concerned , to meet this challenge and to arrest their ever-increasing dependence on imported energy , mainly oil , it will be necessary to accelerate exploration and development of indigenous energy resources and to develop greater capacity for producing commercial primary energy : oil , natural gas , coal , hydropower and other new and renewable sources of energy .  
Nevertheless , developing countries will require substantial investments considering that their total primary energy demand will continue to grow ; and even though the demand is expected to moderate , the outlook , as mentioned above , projects that , in a couple of decades , their total primary energy consumption may account for one half or more of global consumption . 
World wide , fossil fuels have continued to be the dominant primary energy source for electricity generation , with coal accounting for the major share and likely to remain so well into the next century , although hydro and nuclear energy have made tangible progress in many countries .  
KAMAL ( Pakistan ) , speaking on agenda item 112 ( c ) , said that , while there were many types of human rights violations , the primary concern of the United Nations was the systematic violation of human rights committed by States and persons in authority and that the United Nations could influence Member States to take legislative , administrative and judicial measures to promote and protect human rights .  
More detailed analysis is required for assessing the applicability and reliability of valuation in the key situations in which valuation is important that are probably more central to the concerns of the Panel such as ( i ) utilization or conservation of primary , unmanaged or any other types of forests , ( ii ) establishment of reserves for biological diversity , ( iii ) carbon sequestration and ( iv ) international watersheds , among others ; 
According to some scenarios , sustainable biomass energy has the potential to become the largest single source of energy globally , providing from 17 per cent to 35 per cent of the total demand for primary energy in 2050 if sustainability policies are adopted and technological advances achieved in the production of liquid , solid and gaseous fuels from biomass , based on the use of fast-growing species , soil-water species relationships , new harvesting and conversion techniques or the application of genetically engineered bacteria .  
UNDP / PAPP is upgrading a cultural and educational complex in Jericho to provide 23 additional classrooms for primary and secondary girls ' schools and is engaging in an extensive school rehabilitation project to provide supplementary facilities for schools throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip , including at least 25 classrooms in primary and secondary girls ' schools .  
Condemns in the strongest terms all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict , recognizing that the leadership in territories under the control of Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and formerly Serb-held areas of the Republic of Croatia , the commanders of Serb paramilitary forces and political and military leaders in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) bear primary responsibility for most of those violations and that persons who commit such acts will be held personally responsible and accountable ;  
The Andean Presidents take note of the sustained and financially sound growth of the Andean Development Corporation in the international sphere , to the point where it has become the primary source of financing for the Andean countries , supporting physical integration projects , private-sector development , increased trade and the procurement of resources in capital markets .  
The private sector is slowly responding through increased financial investment , the development of primary and ancillary industries and businesses around mining , the implementation of education and training programmes for local workforces , the transfer of technology and the deepening of institutions required to sustain growth .  
Therefore , the primary [ ultimate ] loyalty of public officials shall be to the public interests of their country as expressed through the [ democratic ] institutions of government , and not to [ national or foreign ] persons , political parties [ or entities ] [ or specific government departments or agencies ] .  
Most of the developed countries draw on large shares of crude oil and natural gas in their primary energy consumption ; some regions have substantial contributions of nuclear energy and modern renewable sources . 
The evolution of the relative shares of each of the most important sources of energy in total global consumption , the dynamics of structural change in the global energy system , and the relative shares of different primary energy sources in global primary energy show that it took about half a century before coal was replaced by crude oil as the dominant global energy source .  
Recognizing that the prime responsibility for nuclear safety rests with national Governments , it is of primary importance to continue to enhance international collaborative efforts to promote a high level of nuclear safety world wide .  
Reducing the adult illiteracy rate - the appropriate age group to be determined in each country - to at least half its 1990 level , with an emphasis on female literacy ; achieving universal access to quality education , with particular priority being given to primary and technical education and job training , combating illiteracy , and eliminating gender disparities in access to , retention in and support for education ;  
Within the context of this 20 / 20 initiative , the meeting understood basic social services as comprising basic education and primary health care , including reproductive health and population programmes , nutrition programmes and safe drinking water and sanitation , as well as the institutional capacity for delivering those services .  
The representative of the Centre explained the primary goal and objectives of the five-year project : to help the organization better meet the current and diverse demands placed on it in matters relating to peace and security and humanitarian and human rights affairs ; to help the United Nations system to meet the new and dramatic challenges of the future ; to strengthen cooperation and coordination among the system partners ; and to help the United Nations organization to meet the calls for reform , accountability and flexibility .  
Improvement in the overall quality of both primary and secondary education will require tackling the internal inefficiencies in the existing system and improving services in keeping with the nation 's need for an educational content responsive to the changes occurring in the national market economy .  
While it is the primary responsibility of African States to bear the bulk of their development burden by tapping as a matter of priority their own financial resources , the rigid international economic environment , the domestic economic hardship and the lukewarm disposition of some creditors to adopt radical measures have constituted obstacles to the mobilization of financial resources and to the development of Africa .  
Both at the eighth ministerial meeting at Yaound and at the Bureau meeting at Brazzaville , it was felt that while the primary responsibility for resolving the political and security problems in the Central African subregion rested with the Governments and peoples of the countries concerned , concerted action at the subregional and wider levels was required to promote lasting solutions .  
It reached the understanding that , while there would be no change in the procedure , the following categories of items would generally receive favourable consideration : medical equipment ; packaging material for medical supplies and foodstuffs ; clothing ; supplies for babies and infants ; soaps ; animal feed and animals and eggs for breeding or hatching purposes ; agricultural seeds ; supplies and materials for primary and secondary education ; spare parts and materials for water treatment and sewage plants ; and storage facilities for grain and foodstuffs . 
While the United Nations system has an essential and complementary role to play in supporting Governments in their efforts to eradicate poverty , the primary responsibility for the assessment of poverty situations and for the formulation , strengthening and implementation of national poverty eradication plans and programmes lies with Governments and requires a strong political commitment at the national level .  
While it is the primary responsibility of the Government to mobilize resources for poverty eradication at the national level , the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , is recognized - as is the need to enhance the effectiveness , efficiency and impact of the activities of the United Nations system in the area of poverty eradication .  
At the Social Summit , Heads of State or Government acknowledged that the primary responsibility to attain the goals set out in the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action rested with national Governments , with the support and contributions of the international community , the United Nations , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society , including private citizens .  
By its resolution 50 / 227 of 24 May 1996 on further measures for the restructuring and revitalization of the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields , the General Assembly decided that in the case of functional commissions with the primary responsibility for the follow-up and review of the implementation of major conferences , the Council should ensure the coordination of their multi-year programmes , in accordance with the agreed conclusions adopted by the Council at its substantive session of 1995 on the coordinated follow-up of the results of major international conferences .  
Much of sub-Saharan Africa suffers from severe shortages of technical , managerial and entrepreneurial skills , acute infrastructure bottlenecks , weak institutional capabilities , severe limitations in the capacity to import , and continued dependence on exports of a few primary commodities .  
A primary responsibility of the regional commissions is to provide advisory services and to strengthen regional networks by which Member States may exchange experience and information , and harmonize national economic , social , environmental and settlement policies and strategies - in particular those that have a critical cross-border impact on , inter alia , migration , shared coastal zones , river basins and ecosystems , watersheds , and pollution and waste management .  
In addition it appears that occupational and educational counselling is available to all citizens in Greenland , that the counselling is free of charge , and that it is provided by municipal labour market offices , municipal or regional vocational guidance officers , institutions of primary and lower secondary education and institutions of vocational training .  
Tunisia 's health system has developed a policy based on primary health care , which is itself focused on mother and child care , family planning , school and university medicine , prevention of epidemic diseases , and campaigns against certain social ills , as well as on treatment of everyday illnesses and dispensing of basic medicines .  
It must be pointed out here that children and adolescents are targeted by this education-for-health programme as recipients and agents who can pass on the benefits , and health topics are increasingly incorporated in primary and secondary curricula as well as in cultural activities in schools and universities ( hygiene , nutrition , accident prevention , living with domestic animals , prevention of transmissible diseases , contraception , sexually transmitted diseases , AIDS . . . ) . 
The Council decided that , prior to the annual high-level policy dialogue , and allowing sufficient time for preparation , the Secretariat should communicate to the financial and trade institutions a report on the relevant issues to be discussed at the session , with a primary focus on the agreed theme ; and that communication should be prepared in part based on the submission of issues and questions that Member States could be invited to suggest to the Secretariat , which would then be taken into account in the preparation of the Secretariat 's report to the institutions .  
It is suggested that the focal points ' tasks should be to identify national human rights education needs and to develop a national plan of action for human rights education containing specific objectives , strategies and programmes for the enhancement of human rights education at all levels , including pre-schools , primary and secondary schools , higher education , professional schools , training programmes for public officials and non-formal learning , including general public information .  
The training packages will incorporate the methodological approach mentioned in paragraph 75 of the Plan of Action , and address the following professional groups : prison officers ; primary and secondary schoolteachers ; legal professionals ( judges and lawyers ) ; national and local non-governmental organizations ; media ; and human rights monitors .  
The World Food Summit was a fitting end to that series of conferences and a bridge into the future because it addressed the primary needs of all mankind and proposed solutions for food security and sustainable agricultural development at the global level . 
In the context of the Programme of Action for the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education and in cooperation with relevant experts and organizations , the High Commissioner for Human Rights / Centre for Human Rights has envisaged the preparation and publication of six new training manuals - for prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , legal professionals , national and local non-governmental organizations , mass media and for monitoring - and three handbooks on human rights and conflict resolution , human rights and parliament , and human rights and constitutions .  
Reaffirms that the Inter-agency Standing Committee is the primary mechanism for inter-agency decisions on system-wide policy issues relating to humanitarian assistance , for formulating a coherent and timely response to major disasters and complex emergencies and for inter-agency decisions of an operational nature , and calls on members of the Standing Committee to continue to examine as a matter of priority options and proposals to improve its functioning ;  
To strengthen and reorient health education and health services , particularly primary health care programmes , including sexual and reproductive health , and to design quality health programmes that meet the physical and mental needs of girls and that attend to the needs of young expectant and nursing mothers ;  
While the primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security lay with the United Nations , regional organizations could also make a valuable contribution to facilitating the peaceful resolution of conflicts .  However , regional initiatives , especially in developing countries , had so far been constrained by logistical and financial difficulties .  
Reaffirms that the Inter-agency Standing Committee is the primary mechanism for inter-agency decisions on system-wide policy issues relating to humanitarian assistance , for formulating a coherent and timely response to major disasters and complex emergencies and for inter-agency decisions of an operational nature , and calls on members of the Standing Committee to continue to examine as a matter of priority options and proposals to improve its functioning ;  
To make primary education compulsory and available free for all , particularly children , indicating the minimum age for enrolment in primary school , the minimum and maximum ages for compulsory education , the proportion of children enrolled , who complete primary education , as well as any relevant disaggregated data including by age , gender , region , urban / rural area , national , social and ethnic origin , service coverage and budgetary allocation ;  
While the developing countries bore the primary responsibility for finding solutions to their economic predicament , their development efforts should be based on genuine interdependence and mutual cooperation with the developed economies in the context of global partnership rather than on the old donor-recipient relationship .  
To strengthen and reorient health education and health services , in particular primary health care programmes , including sexual and reproductive health , and to design quality health programmes that meet the physical and mental needs of girls and that attend to the needs of young expectant and nursing mothers ;  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Recognizing that , while developing countries have primary responsibility for their own development , there is continuing need for the international community to give strong support to their efforts to solve their economic and social problems through , inter alia , the promotion of a favourable international economic environment ,  
In this context , he felt sure that delegations had come to the current session of the Board not to fulfil routine representational formalities but , stimulated and motivated by the in-depth and solid analytical reports prepared by the secretariat , to hold a serious dialogue on issues that were of primary concern to their policy-makers .  
These included macroeconomic stability , high rates of domestic saving , maintenance of sound financial intermediaries , high priority given to human resource development ( especially to high _ quality primary and secondary education ) , competitive exchange rates , export orientation , a supportive environment which rewarded entrepreneurship and allowed open and constructive dialogue between government and the private sector regarding objectives and policies , and governance which balanced the promotion of social cohesion and consensus with that of competition between individuals and companies .  
The programmes contained in the appeal are aimed at establishing nationwide mechanisms that respond to immediate needs , such as basic relief , mine clearance and repatriation , and other mechanisms that respond to priority needs in deprived areas in the different regions , such as the provision of safe drinking water , primary health care , urban and rural recovery .  
These organizations could help , through international and regional meetings , to sensitize countries to pressing bioethical issues , notably those raised in the primary health care context , and to foster a North-South dialogue in this area , aimed at achieving broad universal consensus on the essential principles of contemporary bioethics and their implementation in the health and related sectors ( principle 4.1 ) .  
Significant human and financial resources are being devoted by the international community to assistance in mine clearance , which is , by its nature , a long-term task ; to efficient and effective demining programmes where the primary emphasis is on the development of national mine-clearance capacities by afflicted countries ; to mine-awareness programmes ; and to the rehabilitation and reintegration into society of victims of landmines .  
Schools , universities , professional and vocational training programmes and institutions should be encouraged and assisted in developing human rights curricula and corresponding teaching and resource materials , with the help of Governments and international donors and programmes , for incorporation into formal education at the early childhood , primary , secondary , post-secondary and adult education levels .  
The survey and evaluation and the resulting preliminary report shall seek to identify with particularity , at the international , regional and national levels , inter alia , the number and types of human rights educational materials available , existing human rights educational institutes , centres and permanent focal points , national percentages of teachers trained in human rights education , the percentage of schools having adopted human rights curricula at the primary , secondary and post-secondary levels , and number and types of human rights education components in professional training and non-formal education programmes .  
Underlines that the primary responsibility for the further successful implementation of the peace process lies with the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina themselves , which during the next two years should assume increasingly a greater responsibility for the functions now undertaken or coordinated by the international community , and stresses that without compliance and active participation by all the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina in rebuilding a civil society they can not expect the international community and major donors to continue shouldering the political , military and economic burden of the implementation and reconstruction efforts ;

CARICOM countries had assumed primary responsibility , while fully conscious that the ultimate success of their efforts could only be guaranteed within a framework of international cooperation and partnership based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibility .  
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
While it is recognized that States have the primary responsibility in securing a sound and stable national political , economic and social environment for development , international support , at the request of interested Governments , and the creation of a favourable international economic environment are crucial ingredients in this effort .  
The Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America is an integral development programme that focuses on the human being as the central and primary subject of development and gives priority to economic and social growth in our countries and to the protection and conservation of the ecosystem , as is evidenced by regional efforts in the areas of biodiversity , climate change and forests .  
The international community is devoting considerable human and financial resources to assistance in mine clearing , which by its very nature is a long-term job ; to efficient mine clearance programmes in which the primary emphasis needs to be on helping the afflicted countries to develop national mine clearance capability ; to mine-awareness programmes ; and to the rehabilitation and reintegration into society of landmine victims .  
Australia 's primary goal for the Commission 's work on nuclear-weapon-free zones is an outcome in keeping with the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) decision on principles and objectives , that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones , on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned , enhances regional and global peace and security and contributes to the ultimate objective of achieving a world entirely free of nuclear weapons .  
The Task Force on Employment and Sustainable Livelihoods conducted one review in a country where poverty eradication was the primary focus in a setting of low economic growth and rapid labour force expansion ; in another country , the main concern was how to move from structural adjustment to growth with equity ; in another , the review focused on the employment aspects associated with a shift from a planned to a market-oriented economy .  
In specifically identified primary and secondary compulsory schools located in the traditional area of settlement of an ethnic group , this right is ensured for every member of the ethnic minority regardless of the number of pupils participating , and in primary and secondary compulsory schools located outside the traditional settlement area minority language instruction is provided where there is a demand , requiring a minimum number of participants which varies between four and nine .  
Since 1977 , in the light of the considerable increase in the number of children having to begin a form of education completely different from that of their country of origin and unrelated to their native language , and in the middle of the school year , special primary classes have been set up to smooth their transition and a specific teaching method developed to help them learn French quickly . 
Such a forum and other appropriate instruments might be based on a framework convention containing flexible rules whose primary objective is to create the appropriate dynamics aimed at the implementation and ongoing consolidation of an international economic environment leading to the exercise by all nations of the right to development and to genuine international peace and security .  
Moreover , the Programme of Action is committed to improving the quality of life by focusing on three interdependent goals : reductions in infant , child and maternal mortality ; expanded access to education , particularly for women and girls ; and universal access to primary health care , including reproductive health and family planning services .  
Four working groups have been constituted within the Committee to assess the state of human rights education in the following areas : primary and secondary schools ; universities and higher education ; adult education , including several professional groups ( police , armed forces , judges , teachers , social workers , etc . ) ; and activities undertaken by NGOs , associations and trade unions .  
Work has continued on the six training packages to support training activities addressed to professional and other target groups ( prison officers ; primary and secondary school teachers ; judges and lawyers ; national and local non-governmental organizations ; journalists ; human rights monitors ) undertaken by the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights and by the national committees and training centres for human rights education .  
Although the number of boys enrolled in primary school is roughly equal to that of girls , the drop-out rate among girls is so much higher that the initial benefit is lost .  Teenage pregnancies and marriages , the inadequacy of recovery structures , impoverished parents , the girls ' lack of a sense of reality , and backward prejudices towards them are among the main causes of girls ' low level of education , which is reflected in a very high illiteracy rate .  
He made it clear in his previous report to the General Assembly that those measures were beginning to have a real impact on the people in the towns , particularly the urban elite , and that they were adding to the suffering in rural areas , where people are often poor and where , owing to the violence and the civil war , regular access to , inter alia , health care , hygiene , various essential goods and primary and secondary education have become even more curtailed .  
Space telecommunications , which are the primary field of commercial applications of space , involve major economic , political , cultural , strategic and industrial stakes .  
The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the Centre for Human Rights should provide advisory services on the organization at the federal and State level of training courses for teachers in preschool , primary or basic and secondary educational establishments to make them aware of the importance of teaching the principles of tolerance and non _ discrimination based on religion and belief .  
Recognizing that , while developing countries have primary responsibility for their own development , there is continuing need for the international community to give strong support to their efforts to solve their economic and social problems through , inter alia , the promotion of a favourable international economic environment ,  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly the primary and secondary levels , including a focus on the local environment in the context of sustainable development .  
While some requested an improvement in quality in public rather than private schools , maintaining free public education at the primary level , others favoured a more liberal policy environment with competition between the private and public sector .  
In her statement , the Chairperson-Rapporteur , Ms . Erica-Irene Daes , outlined four major concerns : ( a ) the need for a recognition of the effects of dispossession of lands and habitat on the health of indigenous peoples ; ( b ) the exposure of indigenous peoples to hazardous industrial and military activities ; ( c ) the need to improve access to national health-care systems ; ( d ) the role traditional medical practices could play in national primary health-care systems and the protection of those practices .  
Application of telemedecine was seen by experts as a promising way of addressing issues such as equity , cost containment , optimizing the use expensive technology and specialized medical services , upgrading of health treatment , improving access of patients in remote areas to primary and specialized health services , and regional sharing of knowledge and cooperation .  
This action has received increased support from different donor sources ; however , additional and increased development assistance is to be directed towards the basic social services with a view to improving primary and reproductive health care , basic education , skills development and literacy in priority , to at least meet the targets set by recent international conferences . 
In view of the current situation in Haiti , so ably described today by the representative of Haiti , we can not but conclude that the primary objective of UNSMIH 's mandate has not yet been fully accomplished , and that sustained international assistance remains essential .  
Recalling that in the same resolution the Commission called upon the Sub _ Commission to focus on its primary role as an advisory body of the Commission , to facilitate efficient and effective participation of non _ governmental organizations , to devote sufficient time at its forty _ ninth session to the discussion of its working methods and to prepare specific recommendations on that issue for consideration by the Commission ,  
While everyone accepted that the primary responsibility in that regard lay at the national level , the Summit was an important and timely recognition of the multifaceted nature of food security and of the need to encourage cooperation at the international level to support the efforts of Governments .  
Because of a range of technical problems and the rate at which applications have been approved by the Security Council Committee , medical commodities have not reached Iraq in a coordinated or complementary manner , and most have been destined for hospitals and specialized facilities rather than primary health care centres .  
While it is the primary responsibility of national Governments to achieve the economic , social and environmental objectives of Agenda 21 , it is essential that international cooperation be reactivated and intensified , recognizing , inter alia , the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as set forth in Principle 7 of the Rio Declaration .  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly the primary and secondary levels , that is accessible to all and that augments both human capacity and well-being .  
For developing countries , the primary motivation is the formation and consolidation of viable economic spaces that would create dynamic trade and investment growth , develop viable , integrated and competitive productive systems to serve regional and international markets , strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination and enhance infrastructural linkages .  
In addition to the services provided at the primary level , UNRWA aims , in principle , at providing essential in-patient medical services to the refugee population at its own facilities , at local contracted hospitals or through partial reimbursement of costs incurred by refugees for treatment at government or private hospitals .  
Improvement in the overall quality of both primary and secondary education would require tackling the internal inefficiencies in the existing system and improving services in keeping with the nations need for an educational content responsive to the changes occurring in the national market economy .  
Although , in practice , compulsory education in the national system of education consists of primary education and basic middle education ( basic secondary ) , its compulsory nature has not been established expressly by law , since the Act promulgated in 1959 ( No . 680 / 59 ) provided for compulsory education up to 12 years of age and the sixth grade of primary schooling , and its provisions have not been modified since .  
Several primary needs should be met : to devise effective and coherent arrangements for information and assessment of the impact of sanctions on third States ; to ensure appropriate access by third States to the process ; to develop a method of assessing actual adverse impact ; to explore practical and innovative measures of assistance ; and to enhance coordination and cooperation among relevant institutions and organizations both within and outside the United Nations system .  
Work has continued on the six training packages to support training activities addressed to professional and other target groups , such as human rights monitors , judges and lawyers , prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , journalists , and national and local non-governmental organizations undertaken by the Office and by the national committees and training centres for human rights education .  
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies in each country for promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
While it is recognized that States have the primary responsibility for securing a sound and stable national political , economic and social environment for development , international support , at the request of interested Governments , and the creation of a favourable international economic environment are crucial ingredients in this effort .  
At the World Conference on Education for All and the World Summit for Social Development , Governments committed themselves to ensuring universal access to quality education , attaining the highest possible standards of physical and mental health and ensuring access of all to primary health care .  This should include efforts to rectify inequalities relating to social conditions , race , national origin , age or disability , and between urban and rural areas .  
Recognizing that , despite the significant progress in basic education , especially the increase in primary school enrolment coupled with a growing emphasis on the quality of education , major problems , both emerging and continuing , still persist which require even more forceful and concerted action at national and international levels to achieve the goal of education for all ,  
Education was free at all levels and compulsory at the primary level , health care was provided free to all sectors of the population without exception , special attention being paid to vulnerable groups , and young people played an important part in the development and execution of development plans . 
The Ministry of Health : The Ministry offers primary , secondary and tertiary health-care services in Jordan through main and subsidiary health centres , consisting of 506 health centres , 161 maternal and child clinics , 110 dental clinics and 15 respiratory disease clinics , as at the end of 1990 .  
The Movement observed that in his note the Secretary-General expressed the view that weapons of mass destruction continued to be of primary importance despite significant progress achieved to outlaw chemical and biological weapons and to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regimes .  
One delegation , also speaking on behalf of a large group , advanced some specific suggestions to the Task Force , among which was that the free flow of accurate and up-to-date information , taking into account the linguistic diversity of the Organization , must remain the primary function of the Department and that the dissemination of relevant information about the United Nations and its programmes should continue to be a core activity of the Department , particularly in developing countries .

Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Recognizes that business and industry , including transnational corporations , play a crucial role in the social and economic development of a country , that a stable policy regime enables and encourages business and industry to operate responsibly and efficiently and to implement longer-term policies and that the activities of business and industry are the primary contributors to increasing prosperity , which is a major goal of the development process ;  
Even though the total number of peacekeeping operations and their average size have been reduced in recent years , peacekeeping is still the key instrument available to the United Nations in discharging its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
Among its primary purposes , the Charter of the United Nations provides for the maintenance of international peace and security ; the fostering between nations of international relations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples ; international cooperation in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields ; and the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all .  
While recognizing that international cooperation and assistance are essential for the full implementation of the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , my delegation is very well aware of the primary role that Governments and civil society must play at the national level towards the fulfilment of the objectives set forth .  
While recognizing that the primary responsibility for nuclear safety rests with the respective national Governments , the European Union welcomes the entry into force of this Convention , which was concluded under IAEA auspices and which will strengthen cooperation and mutual assistance in a favourable climate for the development a global nuclear-safety culture . 
Past endeavours have also shown that the primary objective of establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones is to seek the absence of nuclear weapons from various parts of the world ; to insulate the zonal States from the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons ; to prevent horizontal as well as vertical proliferation of nuclear weapons , which could pose new and unacceptable threats to the security of States ; to contribute to the process of disarmament , especially nuclear disarmament ; and to facilitate cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy .  
Developed countries should sustain stable economic growth at home and provide increased opportunities for developing countries to expand their exports , including both manufactured products from more advanced developing countries and primary commodities from less developed countries .  
The health component of such plans should address the key objectives spelled out in chapter 6 of Agenda 21 , namely ( a ) meeting primary health care needs , particularly in rural areas , ( b ) control of communicable diseases , ( c ) protecting vulnerable groups , ( d ) meeting the urban health challenge and ( e ) reducing health risks from environmental pollution and hazards .  
A number of Governments have taken action to provide basic health services for youth ; promote good sanitation and hygiene practices among youth ; develop health education and accessible , available and affordable primary health care services ( including services related to sexual and reproductive health and relevant education in those fields , such as information about sexually transmitted diseases , such as human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) ) ; eliminate sexual abuse of young people ; and combat malnutrition among young people .  
In the context of the Programme of Action for the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education and in cooperation with relevant experts and organizations , HCHR / CHR has envisaged the preparation and publication of six new training manuals - for prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , legal professionals , national and local non-governmental organizations , mass media and for monitoring - and three handbooks on human rights and conflict resolution , human rights and parliament , and human rights and constitutions .  
Reaffirms that the Inter-Agency Standing Committee is the primary mechanism for inter-agency decisions on system-wide policy issues relating to humanitarian assistance , for formulating a coherent and timely response to major disasters and complex emergencies and for inter-agency decisions of an operational nature , and calls upon members of the Standing Committee to continue to examine , as a matter of priority , options and proposals to improve its functioning ;  
However , to combat crimes involving , in particular , illegal trafficking in hazardous and nuclear substances and endangered species , criminal law should be used as the primary tool , since penal sanctions , by criminalizing a certain behaviour with a corresponding penalty , have a greater deterrent effect .  
As the embodiment of the world community 's conscience and the sole recognized multilateral negotiating forum on disarmament , this Conference not only shoulders the primary responsibility for finding ways and means to really deal with the problem , but is also the most appropriate venue to commence the negotiations on a universal , effectively verifiable and legally binding multilateral treaty regulating the development , production , stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons and their destruction .  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
The primary objectives of the UNISPACE III Conference would be ( a ) to promote effective means of using space technology to assist in the solution of problems of regional or global significance and ( b ) to strengthen the capabilities of Member States , in particular developing countries , to use the applications of space research for economic , social and cultural development .  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly at the primary and secondary levels , including lifelong education , accessible to all , that augments both human capacity and well-being . 
WHO envisages future activities in the northern Caucasus region which are of primary importance , including projects aimed at the control of communicable diseases in the region , in particular vaccine preventable diseases , acute diarrhoeal diseases and tuberculosis , and mental health assistance .  [ 1 ] / Available for consultation in the Secretariat .  
Governments and all other actors should make special efforts to achieve the benchmarks set in the Platform for Action of universal access to basic education and completion of primary education by at least 80 per cent of primary school-age children by the year 2000 ; close the gender gap in primary - and secondary-school education by the year 2005 ; provide universal primary education in all countries before the year 2015 ; and consider providing multilateral and bilateral assistance .  
The Convention on the Rights of the Child being a point of departure to guarantee child rights ; taking into consideration the progressive character of the implementation of certain social , economic and cultural rights as recognized in article 4 of the Convention , the Government of the Kingdom of Swaziland would undertake the implementation of the right to free primary education to the maximum extent of available resources and expects to obtain the cooperation of the international community for its full satisfaction as soon as possible .  
In addition to the costed population package , the Programme of Action also calls for socio-economic development programmes designed to strengthen the primary health-care delivery system and child survival programmes , provide universal basic education , improve the status and empowerment of women , generate employment , address environmental concerns , provide social services and address poverty eradication through sustained economic growth .  
In the case of functional commissions with the primary responsibility for the follow-up and review of the implementation of a major conference , the Council was requested to ensure the coordination of their multi-year programmes , in accordance with the agreed conclusions adopted by the Council at its substantive session of 1995 on the coordinated follow-up of the results of major international conferences .  
Although the importance of education , from the primary stage to university , is widely accepted as critical for sustained development , many developing societies continue to suffer from a growing mismatch between the skills generated by the educational system and those that are needed by the productive system .  
In the past few months , UNICEF emergency interventions had been focused on ensuring protection and care of the most vulnerable children , including tracing and reunification of unaccompanied children ; provision of primary health care services and of safe water , sanitation and hygiene education , particularly in the camps for refugees and displaced people ; monitoring children 's nutritional status and supporting therapeutic feeding ; and provision of emergency supplies .  
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
While it is recognized that States have the primary responsibility in securing a sound and stable national political , economic and social environment for development , international support , at the request of interested Governments , and the creation of a favourable international economic environment are crucial ingredients in this effort .  
All of the major developing regions of the world registered significant increases in primary school enrolments , with the combined total reaching some 545-million in 1995 , representing an increase of nearly 50-million in five years , double the pace of expansion during the 1980s .  Since enrolment rates increased faster than population growth , the net enrolment ratios continued to rise in all developing regions .  
While it was true that developing countries bore the primary responsibility for solving their human settlements problems , the international community , and the developed countries in particular , should endeavour to create a favourable international environment for the development of human settlements by providing sufficient financial resources and technologies to the developing countries .  
While it is the primary responsibility of national Governments to achieve the economic , social and environmental objectives of Agenda 21 , it is essential that international cooperation be reactivated and intensified , recognizing , inter alia , the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as set forth in principle 7 of the Rio Declaration .  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly the primary and secondary levels , that is accessible to all and that augments both human capacity and well-being .  
When authorities at the national , regional or local levels faced a sufficiently high number of individuals whose primary language was a minority language , States had come to accept that they must provide a level of service appropriate to the relative number of individuals involved .  
This performance reflected the combined effects of a variety of factors : the results of most countries efforts to control severe macroeconomic imbalances in 1995 , adverse climate conditions which affected primary production , and the drop in the international prices of the main export goods .  
Successful implementation of the Platform for Action depended on the contribution of all the participants - Governments , civil society and international organizations - and while the primary responsibility for implementation lay at the national level , international cooperation was crucial , particularly with regard to fulfilling commitments to provide financial resources .  
When economic measures are employed for coercive purposes , instrumental economic effects are obviously their primary objective , which is achieved by restricting the target State 's access to markets , capital , technology and communications .  
Changes in the sectoral composition of world output towards less commodity-intensive service sectors , combined with technological advances making for less raw material use per unit of output , appear to foreshadow a continuing long-run decline in the prices of primary commodities relative to those of manufactured goods .  
In developing countries and in western financial capitals , there is now a growing acceptance that premature liberalization of capital markets has been a primary cause of the current crisis .  
With water a primary agent in maintaining human health and transmitting disease , the imperative remains to manage all freshwater sources to maintain chemical and biological quality within minimum acceptable standards .  
Although humanitarian agencies have continued to transport modest quantities of medical and other non-food supplies across the Guinean border , those operations have been insufficient to meet the growing needs of a collapsing primary health care system .  
With water as a primary agent in maintaining human health and transmitting disease , there is an imperative need to manage land and freshwater sources to maintain chemical and biological quality to minimum acceptable standards .  
While human rights education was not an obligatory part of the national curriculum , the concept of the equal worth of human beings was among the basic values taught at the primary school level .  
While UNESCO will be responsible for the conceptual aspects and educational content , ITU , which is developing the standards , will take primary responsibility for the technical implementation and choice of technological solutions .  
The primary goals of enhancing the social safety net of individuals and promoting their integration into society could be achieved only with the firm political will to invest at the national as well as the international level for the well-being of all .  
Sex education is included in general studies , biology , human biology , science , social studies , home economics , religious studies and liberal studies courses at the primary , secondary and sixth form levels .  
His Government considered regional and international coordination of primary importance for such activities , as it was impossible to solve ecological problems on a purely national level .  
The Honduran approach to the problem of social insecurity is based on the belief that the primary cause is the insufficient and unreliable national supply of food , either home-produced or imported , for domestic consumption .  
In one multiracial country , Trinidad and Tobago , social studies textbooks utilized at the primary _ school level continue to educate citizens . . . about their diverse racial , religious and cultural society ( CERD / C / 224 / Add . 1 , para .  34 ) .  
The system of municipal and prefectural agricultural committees , which played a central role in agricultural land reform as the primary administrative organization , was also revised .  
Other training and reference materials in the pipeline are : a training manual for primary and secondary school teachers ; a training manual for national and local NGOs ; a handbook for parliamentarians ; a trainers guide for military peacekeepers , a training manual for the treatment of victims of domestic violence for the police ; and a handbook on human rights and constitutions .  
It is Japans fundamental view that the primary objective of any effort to codify a multilateral treaty on State responsibility is to provide an effective legal framework for the resolution of international disputes on that subject .  
To strengthen and reorient health education and health services , in particular primary health-care programmes , including in sexual and reproductive health , and to design quality health programmes that meet the physical and mental needs of girls and attend to the needs of young expectant and nursing mothers ;  
The Department acts as the operational arm of the Secretary-General for United Nations peacekeeping operations and has primary responsibility for managing , directing and supporting all mandated peacekeeping operations and for providing administrative and logistics support to good offices , preventive diplomacy , peacemaking and humanitarian missions , as required .  
This was noted by the Secretary-General , who stressed in his reform proposals that weapons of mass destruction continued to be of primary importance while at the same time the spread of conventional weapons , especially in relation to landmines and small arms , which were being used extensively in regional and subregional conflicts , had become of greater concern to the international community .  
In order to achieve the goals agreed by both developing and developed countries at the United Nations global conferences , it was necessary to establish an integrated set of indicators against which progress could be evaluated at the policy and operational levels in such areas as poverty , gender equality , environmental sustainability and access to primary health care and primary education .  
The primary causes of racism and racial discrimination are deeply embedded in the historical past and are determined by a number of economic , political , social and cultural factors .  
The Department of Social Affairs had also tried to reduce poverty by providing financial assistance to private institutions , food assistance to primary school children and children of poor families , financial and technical assistance to groups of poor families and other social welfare recipients undertaking economic activities , and by providing assistance to the children of the unemployed .  
Being cognizant of the importance of focusing upon the family , which is the primary unit of any society , and on economic entities in the fight against poverty , the Government orients its activities towards changing the current inert status of poor families living below the poverty line , as mere recipients of aid .  
Therefore the primary focus of operational activities must continue to be at the country level , with national Governments assuming the main responsibility for coordinating development assistance programming , which , in turn , must be based on the national development plans and priorities of those countries .  
The primary objective of the unit will be to promote respect for human rights and compliance with minimum humanitarian standards , and to deter massive and systematic violations of human rights in the future .  
Comprehensive revised guidelines for these types of contracts have been developed and will be implemented in 1999 , bearing in mind the primary objective of achieving value for money in an efficient and expeditious manner .  
The primary causes for these types of violation , one source reported , are the wide gap between the letter of the law and practice by the relevant authorities ; legislation and regulations that lead to the arbitrary detention of political opponents ; the absence of procedural safeguards in the law ; the lack of judicial independence ; and the absence of a separation between the military and the police . 
In keeping with its basic mandate , resolution 13 ( I ) of 13 February 1946 , the primary activity of the Department should be to assist and rely upon established governmental and non-governmental agencies of information to provide the public with information about the United Nations ; the Department should engage in activities that will supplement the services of existing agencies of information to the extent that these are insufficient to provide adequate information .  
ECA Regional Statistical Database ; Africa Live Database and five country Live Database ; bibliographic information data , including : ECA Library on-line catalogue ; databases of : official publications and primary sources ; ECA publications ; new acquisitions ; indexed , abstracted journals and periodicals ; economic , social , scientific and technical aspects on Africa ( bibliographic ) ; geo-information in Africa including GIS applications , mapping coverage and educational training facilities ;  
Reducing the adult illiteracy rate the appropriate age group to be determined in each country to at least half its 1990 level , with an emphasis on female literacy ; achieving universal access to quality education , with particular priority being given to primary and technical education and job training , combating illiteracy , and eliminating gender disparities in access to , retention in and support for education ;  
Crucial requirements are well known and include improving the access to and quality of primary , secondary , technical and vocational education ; improving marketing arrangements for primary commodities ; land reform ; mobilization of domestic saving for infrastructure including small scale , local public works and for private investment ; and attracting foreign direct investment under conditions that ensure benefits to the receiving countries .  
At its thirty-sixth session , in 1998 , the Commission for Social Development considered that while the primary responsibility for crime prevention and criminal justice rests at the national level , violence , crime and illicit drugs activities are of such magnitude and also have such major transnational dimensions that they require international cooperation and coordination in respect of formulating and implementing effective responses .  
Measures for the provision of primary health care are primarily geared to the promotion of health , to preventive health education activities and hygienic and epidemiological policies which are pursued at the level of the community and the municipality , where people live and work .  
Emphasizes once more that the primary responsibility for ensuring the progressive achievement of democratic goals and building a tolerant , multi-ethnic society lies with the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina , in particular through the central Government and the governments of both entities , as well as through , inter alia , municipal and cantonal authorities , religious communities , humanitarian organizations and non-governmental organizations ;  
To recognize the right to education on the basis of equal opportunities by making primary education compulsory and ensuring that all children have access to free and relevant primary education , as well as making secondary education generally available and accessible to all , and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education ;

To recognize the right to education on the basis of equal opportunities by making primary education compulsory and ensuring that all children have access to free and relevant primary education , as well as making secondary education generally available and accessible to all , and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education ;  
The Government should also conduct a comprehensive review of all educational curricula at the primary , secondary and tertiary levels with a view to eliminating remaining discriminatory aspects , remedying the stereotypical portrayal of women and girls and creating an educational environment that is conducive to girls and womens education and learning .  
In his seventh report , in response to various suggestions for dealing with the question of liability by giving greater weight to domestic or private law remedies , Barboza proposed that civil liability should be primary and State liability should be residual . 82 In this regard , State liability would only replace civil liability if the private person who is liable can not fully compensate the harm or if that person can not be identified or located . 
While noting that the lack of financial resources due to the prevailing economic crisis in Solomon Islands leaves little scope to the State party for providing adequate educational services , the Committee nevertheless is concerned about the absence of compulsory primary education in Solomon Islands , with merely 60 per cent of school age children having access to primary education .  
It was pointed out , however , that the primary responsibility for implementing the Beijing Platform for Action rested with Governments , and that political will and commitment at the national and international levels played a critical role in creating the enabling environment necessary for equal treatment and gender mainstreaming .  
It will be responsible for defining national space projects , plans and programmes and encouraging training , skills development and educational programmes in the different sectors of space sciences at the institutional , university and basic ( primary and secondary ) levels .  
The world economy was growing well below its potential , a large number of developing countries were stagnant or had a declining GDP , prices of many primary commodities were at unusually low levels , social conditions in crisis countries had suffered serious setbacks , and downside risks were substantial .  
During the period under review , the Government of Argentina maintained its position that the restoration of communications between the mainland and the Falkland Islands ( Malvinas ) continued to be a primary objective , since improved links would produce commercial and economic benefits for the entire region , by creating the necessary framework for achieving a greater understanding between the inhabitants of the region and for serving their interests .  
Their primary objective should be to seek , through their presence and contacts with the local authorities , to promote respect for minimum humanitarian standards and deter massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law in the future .  
While the distinction was considered of some use in the interpretation of primary rules in an explanatory , didactic sense , doubts were expressed as to whether it should be included in a codification of the law of State responsibility , and if so , whether it could be made operational at the level of secondary rules .  
If the primary injured subject changed from , e.g . , the individual to a State of which he is a national , this would affect the application of the rule of the exhaustion of local remedies insofar as it did not apply in the case of a composite wrongful act .  
Governments should strive to ensure that by 2015 all primary health-care and family-planning facilities are able to provide , directly or through referral , the widest achievable range of safe and effective family-planning and contraceptive methods ; essential obstetric care ; prevention and management of reproductive tract infections , including sexually transmitted diseases , and barrier methods ( such as male and female condoms and microbicides if available ) to prevent infection .  
The primary goals of the Conference were to agree on an approach to development that would protect the environment while ensuring economic development , and to lay the foundation for a global partnership between the developing and the more industrialized countries , based on mutual needs and common interests , to ensure a healthy future for the planet .  
A number of functional commissions did not concur with proposals , contained , inter alia , in the 1998 consolidated report ( E / 1999 / 3 ) that certain topics , such as gender equality and human rights , should be addressed exclusively by the single functional commission which has the primary responsibility for the subject matter , in particular in the context of implementation and follow-up to a major conference .  
It should be stressed , however , that the most efficient and effective way for a functional commission that wishes quite legitimately to contribute its own particular perspective on a multidimensional issue is to build its input on the basis of relevant analyses and policy recommendations provided by other functional commissions and other United Nations bodies , in particular those which have primary responsibility for addressing the underlying major issue , and in close consultation with them .  
These included universal access to primary education , with special attention to closing the gender gap in primary and secondary school education , wherever it exists ; universal access to primary health care ; universal access to a full range of comprehensive reproductive health-care services , including family planning , as set out in paragraph 7.6 of the Programme of Action ; reductions in infant , child and maternal morbidity and mortality ; and increased life expectancy .  
Governments should strive to ensure that by 2015 all primary health-care and family planning facilities are able to provide , directly or through referral , the widest achievable range of safe and effective family planning and contraceptive methods ; essential obstetric care ; prevention and management of reproductive tract infections , including sexually transmitted diseases , and barrier methods ( such as male and female condoms and microbicides if available ) to prevent infection .  
What began as a modest capacity-building exercise in delivering birth-spacing services in selected parts of the country has expanded into a full nationwide reproductive health programme which is a fully integrated part of the standard minimum package of activities for primary health-care services .  
These objectives include economic development , poverty eradication , sustainable population growth , universal access to comprehensive reproductive health services , reduction in infant and maternal mortality and universal access to primary education , with special attention to closing the gender gap .  
According to article 8 of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages , which covers the subject in more detail , States have a choice between different types of obligation in relation to education of or in the regional or minority language , at the pre _ school , primary or secondary level , and where technical or professional , university and other forms of education are concerned .

While recognizing the efforts made by the State party in the area of education , the Committee remains concerned at the high drop _ out rate for males in the upper grades of primary school , the poor reading ability or primary school males , the high incidence of truancy , lack of relevant learning material , insufficient numbers of trained and qualified teachers , and the tendency towards teaching methods that are almost exclusively exam oriented .  
Although the growing influence of bilateral donors and conditionalities attached to their aid for education have increased the Governments budgetary allocation for primary education , this influence has not encompassed facilitating a translation of Ugandas human rights obligations - including those concerning primary education - into recognized and enforceable rights .  
UNICEF promotes and supports physical and psychosocial recovery and social reintegration as the pillar of all humanitarian assistance policy and programmes and to that end , is committed to the rapid re-establishment of primary education in emergency situations , partly as an aim in itself and partly because relevant quality education helps to restore normality and enables children to cope better with stress .  
For both privatization and project finance , the most attractive areas are those for which : ( a ) access can be limited ( as in airports , tunnels , bridges and major highways ) ; ( b ) the projected volume of traffic is high ( container ports , freight rail , primary roads ) ; ( c ) the generation of cash is expected to be reliable , and ( d ) foreign exchange earnings are possible . 30 Attractive assets are ones in which there is a scope for monopolistic power . 
The primary aim of the latter project will be a global report on organized crime , to be published every two years , which will provide qualitative and quantitative information on trends in organized crime activities and structures of groups operating at the international level ; types and distribution of illicit markets ; major international initiatives ; and developments in national legislation against organized crime .  
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) and geographical constraints , such as being landlocked and lacking good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .  
Africas heavy dependence on primary commodity exports ( accounting for about 80 per cent of total export earnings ) is evidence of the low level of human resource development and limited technological capability to take advantage of emerging trade and investment opportunities .  
Through renewed support for IDDA , efforts must be intensified to reduce the gap between those with knowledge and skills and those without , as well as to facilitate foreign and domestic private sector investment in the value chain of primary products and other manufacturing activities in order to address the emerging problems of the technology gap , urban unemployment and rural poverty .  
A panel of technical experts held during the Consultative Group Meeting , which included representatives from UNICEF and other United Nations organizations , suggested that reducing ecological and social vulnerability to natural hazard is a core regional development issue and that the primary responsibility for reducing vulnerability lies with sectoral institutions and with local communities . 
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) , and geographical constraints and lack of good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .

Even though the primary responsibility of maintaining security and the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and areas always lies with the host State , the international community is duty bound to assist governments in this task and , above all , to bear the bulk of the costs to African States whose financial and logistic capacities are limited .  
Recognizing that , despite the significant progress in basic education , especially the increase in primary school enrolment coupled with a growing emphasis on the quality of education , major problems , both emerging and continuing , still persist , which require even more forceful and concerted action at the national and international levels so as to achieve the goal of education for all ,  
Successful elements of those strategies included increasing penetration of external markets ; facilitating access to imported inputs ; creating an enabling environment ; improving universal primary education and access to secondary , vocational and higher education , with emphasis on science and technology ; promoting entrepreneurship and enhancing the competence of the civil service .  
As national governments had the primary responsibility for setting macroeconomic , structural and social policies that would generate growth and contribute to poverty reduction , such comprehensive strategies should be country-driven and elaborated in close cooperation with the international financial institutions . 
Recognizing the need for the realization of a standard of living adequate for the childs physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development , as well as the provision of universal and equal access to primary education ,  
Recognizing that , despite the significant progress in basic education , especially the increase in primary school enrolment coupled with a growing emphasis on the quality of education , major problems , both emerging and continuing , still persist , which require even more forceful and concerted action at the national and international levels so as to achieve the goal of education for all ,

The Amal ( Hope ) School for the Welfare of Physically Disabled Children at Damascus , which provides educational , social and health care for disabled persons of primary , preparatory and secondary school age and also offers boarding facilities free of charge for persons living outside the city limits of Damascus ;  
Endeavours are being made to achieve this goal through the programmes and activities of the primary health-care institutions ( primary health services , maternal care and family planning , immunization against contagious and endemic diseases , environmental health , promotion of healthy nutrition , provision of a safe water supply , health education , oral and dental hygiene and care of the aged ) . 
The administrative and technical structure of primary health care has been developed at the central and local levels in such a way as to constitute an integrated system conducive to the promotion of development through collaboration among all the sectors concerned with health and development .  
All the international organizations operating in the field of health are also providing technical and material assistance to improve the quality of the health services available to the population , particularly at the primary health-care level , now that these services have become widely accessible to the whole population .  
Recognizing the need for the realization of a standard of living adequate for the childs physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development , as well as the provision of universal and equal access to primary education ,  
Even though it was true that primary responsibility for the implementation of Agenda 21 lay with each individual country , it was also true that international cooperation was an important complementary factor in taking advantage of the real benefits of sustainable development .  
So , references to wider macroeconomic concerns , i.e . debt relief and calls for increased official development assistance ( ODA ) levels by developed countries should be balanced by acknowledgement of the primary duty of all States to provide the conditions for the realization of the right to development , via good governance and the effective use of existing resources .

These included reduction of the infant mortality and under-five child mortality by one third and of maternal mortality by half , cutting down by 50 per cent the number of children under five suffering from malnutrition , enabling every child to attend primary school , immunizing 90 percent of the worlds infants and protecting children in especially difficult circumstances , particularly in situations of armed conflict .  
Even if it is established that primary responsibility for the implementation of existing international commitments belongs to national Governments , it is important to stress the irreplaceable role of the United Nations and of the whole international community in the mobilization of resources and support for the national efforts of poor and deprived countries .  
The term primary data means those raw data that are acquired by remote sensors borne by a space object and that are transmitted or delivered to the ground from space by telemetry in the form of electromagnetic signals , by photographic film , magnetic tape or any other means ;

Invites concerned non-governmental organizations , funding sources and the private sector , in coordination with national authorities concerned , to support and develop a programme that will bring a wide range of expertise and proven interventions , including alternative community-based services , to the training of local community workers , teachers and primary health care staff and to provide appropriate interventions for stress-related disorders to girls and women in crisis ;  
Data based on a number of indicators of the gender gap for different regions show that , for developing countries as a whole , the adult literacy rate is 16 percentage points higher for men than for women ; female school enrolment even at the primary level is 13 per cent lower than the level for males ; and womens share of earned income is a third of the total .  
The primary reason is that the increase in employment growth has not been matched by quality improvements , since the main sources of their employment have been in the expanding informal sector , as well as in non-standard and precarious forms of employment , including home-based , temporary or casual employment .

The gross contribution of tourism to national income is diminished by primary leakages of foreign exchange earnings arising from imports of materials and equipment for construction , imports of consumer goods ( including food and drink ) , repatriation of profits earned by foreign investors , overseas promotional expenditures and amortization of external debt incurred in the development of hotels and resorts .  
The inundation of coastal areas can result in : ( a ) loss of agricultural land , a common concern because agriculture is still the primary source of income in many small island developing States , and most agricultural land lies along the coastline , increasing its vulnerability to sea level rise ; ( b ) loss of exclusive economic zone ( EEZ ) , a common concern because sea level rise will also reduce the exclusive economic zone , thereby reducing the resource base .  
Even where humanitarian objectives were not part of their primary mandates , peacekeeping operations have proved valuable , often vital , in supporting and protecting needy populations , humanitarian workers and supplies in environments where there was limited consent from the warring parties or when the security situation is simply beyond their control .  
My delegation welcomes this briefing and future briefings on this important subject , which has a direct bearing on the primary responsibility of the Council in the maintenance of international peace and security as it deals more and more with the issue of the humanitarian dimensions of conflicts around the world , especially given the new and more pernicious forms of conflict in our contemporary world .  
While highlighting the primary responsibility of national Governments for the development and promotion of SMEs , representatives from developing countries emphasized the critical need for appropriate support and assistance from the international community , particularly through the UNCTAD technical assistance programmes which were relevant to enterprise development .  
The report importantly confirms the findings of a previous international review that underlines the merits of purchasing power parity ( PPP ) calculations . 1 The Bank agrees with the main conclusions of both the report and the above-mentioned review that PPPs the estimation of which is the primary objective of ICP are vital for a wide range of important policy-related economic analysis . 
Considering the size and nature of the Missions real estate , which includes 166 observation posts and 14 primary United Nations camps locations including accommodations , offices and other premises , and in line with the recommendation of the internal auditors , it is important that a civil engineer be assigned to oversee the planning , repair and renovation of the premises in order to ensure the most economic , efficient and effective utilization of resources .  
Mr . GOOSEN ( South Africa ) : It is obviously with deep regret that we hear today that the Conference on Disarmament , which is defined as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum of the international community and which has the primary role in substantive negotiations on priority questions of disarmament , remains unable to reach a consensus on the establishment of a mechanism to deliberate on the issue of nuclear disarmament .

In view of their narrow natural resource base , their proneness to disruption by natural disasters , their small range of primary product exports and their limited local capital for productive investment , small island developing States need to join forces for their development , so that communication and exchange of information becomes vital .  
While article 3 , paragraph 1 of the Declaration places upon States the primary responsibility for the creation of national and international conditions favourable to the realization of the right to development , article 4 , paragraph 2 clearly states that effective international cooperation is essential in providing these countries with appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive development .  
Lithium content means the mass of lithium in the anode of a lithium metal or lithium alloy cell , which for a primary cell is measured when the cell is in an undischarged state and for a rechargeable cell is measured when the cell is fully charged , except that in the case of a lithium-ion cell the lithium content is measured in terms of equivalent lithium content , which in grams is calculated to be 0.3 times the rated capacity in ampere-hours .  
ACORD defined health as a priority , focusing on the specific aspect of primary health care as a factor integral to an appropriate development process , and has proposed a new approach based on the creation of permanent , lasting development infrastructure as a complement to the existing socio-economic , health and social fabric .  
The project has contributed in a meaningful way to the training of national primary health care staff at the local level and has assisted civil society organizations in counselling , and has supported blood-screening activities in 11 HDI townships .  
Emphasizes once more that the primary responsibility for ensuring the progressive achievement of democratic goals and building a tolerant , multi-ethnic society lies with the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina , in particular through the central Government and the governments of both entities , as well as through , inter alia , municipal and cantonal authorities , religious communities , humanitarian organizations and non-governmental organizations ;  
This new policy should aim at the creation of more equitable and effective international economic structures in finance , trade and transfer of technology , as well as address the endemic problems of debt and transfer of resources , financial vulnerability , declining terms of trade in primary commodities , and restricted access to developed country markets .

The ongoing human suffering inflicted by conflicts , from Afghanistan to Angola and from the Middle East to the Great Lakes , is a daily reminder of the need for a new and concerted response at the highest political levels from Governments , which bear the primary responsibility for protecting civilians , from the Security Council , and from all others who can help cover the considerable distance still to be travelled if the international community is to find truly effective solutions in this area of acute human need .  
It reiterates its position that the primary responsibility for the continued fighting lies with the leadership of the armed faction of the Unio Nacional Para a Independencia Total de Angola ( UNITA ) headed by Mr . J . Savimbi , which is refusing to fulfil its obligations under the Accordos de Paz ( S / 22609 , annex ) , the Lusaka Protocol ( S / 1994 / 1441 , annex ) and relevant resolutions of the Security Council , which remain the only viable basis for political settlement of the conflict in Angola .  
As a guarantor , under the Charter , of the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security , the Council can no longer continue to be a passive bystander in the face of a tragedy that had gone on too long and the result of which has been the de facto dismemberment of the Somali State and almost total marginalization of a nation that has been abandoned to its fate , riven by a struggle whose finer points escape it and bereft of the dignity to which it is entitled , like any other nation .  
[ 16 ] Alongside the absence of a commitment to making primary education free , and uncertainties as to which children will be classified as poor ( or ultra-poor ) to merit bursaries , this model also raises concerns about the administrative costs of collecting school fees ( necessarily minuscule in poor rural Zambia ) and administrating the bursaries ( also minuscule ) . 
Categorizations of education into primary , elementary , fundamental , or basic are not internationally comparable and are unsuited to the requirements of international human rights law , which embodies the principle that children have to be in school until they reach the minimum age for employment .  
First and foremost , they are to engage in dialogue with national and local authorities , in particular to impress upon them their primary responsibility for the protection and assistance of internally displaced persons in conformity with international human rights and humanitarian law , as elaborated in the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement .  
While international efforts could create conducive conditions for economic development , the primary responsibility for a nations development lay with its Government and people , and discussions on financing growth the development should focus on how to help LDCs mobilize domestic financial resources and attract external resources .

The Subcommittee also agreed that there remained a number of issues and concerns to be addressed , in particular with regard to the relationship between that initiative and existing international space law and that , in view of its primary responsibility for the development of international space law , the Subcommittee should make every effort to deal effectively with that new subject of substantial legal significance . 
In the light of the achievement of near universal enrolment at the primary level , there has been no need for a concerted effort to establish a system of fundamental education for persons who have not received or completed the whole period of their primary education .  
The suffering of large numbers of children especially infants and nursing mothers from lack of primary health care , basic health services and malnutrition or unbalanced diets , lack of clean drinking water and proper sanitation , especially in rural and desert areas , poor districts and refugee camps , increased hazards of environmental pollution , dangers of the spread of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) and lack of care provided to children with special needs ;  
We recognize and admit that slavery and the slave trade , other forms of servitude , conquest and colonialism were the primary sources and manifestation / a source of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and condemn the injustices that were committed , especially against Africans , people of African descent and indigenous peoples and stress the need for all States which were engaged in such practices to acknowledge the grave human suffering they caused and the heinous racist acts committed ;  
Similar considerations apply as for completed and continuing wrongful acts in determining when a breach of international law exists ; the matter is dependent upon the precise facts and the content of the primary obligation .  
The costs involved are certainly much less than the overall costs of malnourishment and malnutrition : for example , it has been calculated that malnutrition costs Pakistan 5 per cent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) and just iron deficiency in children costs Bangladesh 2 per cent of GDP . 81 The fact that the primary cause of hunger and malnutrition is poverty does not prevent efficient measures being taken that are not costly . 
It has formulated a national cooperative policy with the primary objective to create solid economic , legal and institutional environment conducive to growth and development of all types of cooperatives in the country .  
While landlocked and transit developing countries bear the primary responsibility to implement measures designed to strengthen their cooperative and collaborative efforts , the international community , including financial and development institutions should provide more support to enable these countries to deal effectively with their transit transport problems and requirements .  
It was stated that the suggested draft articles contained some contradictory elements in that they posed intention as a primary criterion yet placed among the supplementary means of interpretation the main ways in which intention could be asserted in connection with a unilateral act , namely preparatory work and the circumstances at the time of the acts formulation .  
While it was recognized that the primary responsibility for development in least developed countries rested with the least developed countries themselves , the Brussels Declaration acknowledged that their efforts needed to be given concrete and substantial international support from Governments and international organizations in a spirit of shared responsibility through genuine partnerships , inter alia , with the civil society and the private sector .  
While least developed countries should assume ownership of designing and formulating appropriate national policies of their own will and choice so as to create conditions conducive to development , and continue to have the primary responsibility for effective implementation of those policies and measures , the full implementation of the Programme of Action is the shared responsibility of these countries and their development partners .  
Just prior to the Conference , the Ministers of the least developed countries met in Brussels on 13 May 2001 and adopted a Declaration21 in which they stressed that while the primary responsibility for the development of least developed countries rested with these countries themselves , the amelioration of the worsening social economic conditions in the least developed countries required , among other things , substantial and concrete international support measures . 
The Refugee Education Trust , an independent fund established in December 2000 with strong support from United Nations agencies , donors , Governments and non-governmental organizations , is a mechanism designed to provide sustainable post-primary education , motivating refugee children to continue and complete primary schooling in the hope that they may return to their communities as teachers , professionals and leaders after obtaining the necessary skills at the post-primary level . 
While landlocked and transit developing countries bear the primary responsibility to implement measures designed to strengthen their cooperative and collaborative efforts , the international community , including financial and development institutions , should provide more support to enable these countries to deal effectively with their transit transport problems and requirements .  
Recognizing that , despite the significant progress in basic education , especially the increase in primary school enrolment coupled with a growing emphasis on the quality of education , major problems , both emerging and continuing , still persist , which require even more forceful and concerted action at the national and international levels so as to achieve the goal of education for all ,  
The complexity of managing East Timors public finances is compounded by the need to obtain donor support for the two primary trust funds ( the first funds the national budget , and the second supports capital investment and recovery ) , while coordinating other bilateral and multilateral development assistance .

The primary strategic objective of the Missions public information programme is to project , country-wide , the efforts of the military and civilian components of UNAMSIL in facilitating the peace process in Sierra Leone and the promotion of a better understanding of the mandate of the Mission and the activities of other international organizations that are operating in the country .  
Recognizing that , despite the significant progress in basic education , especially the increase in primary school enrolment coupled with a growing emphasis on the quality of education , major problems , both emerging and continuing , still persist , which require even more forceful and concerted action at the national and international levels so as to achieve the goal of education for all ,  
Besides poverty reduction , the international community had given specific commitments to ensure that by 2015 boys and girls would have equal access to primary schooling and had also resolved to reduce maternal mortality by three quarters , to reduce child mortality by two thirds , to restrict the spread of HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis , and to improve the conditions of 100-million urban poor by 2020 .
