In contemporary China , the correct and progressive ideological concept under the guidance of Marxism is the main current of the whole social ideology and some wrong and backward concepts running against Marxism are only branch currents .  
Although many things in Western economic theories reflect the common regularity in mass production and market operation in an era of scientific and technological revolution , being the reflection of the basic economic relations in capitalist society , in essence , such theories just embody the requirements of the capitalist economic system in its contemporary development .

As radical nationalism in itself is just an operational platform for speech , it must be combined with other ism values in order to assume the state of actual political operation .  In terms of contemporary China , the ideology or ism the most capable of functioning well on the platform of nationalism is exactly leftist radicalism ; such a leftist current of thought , revitalized through being combined with radical nationalism , will acquire momentum in terms of " being able to command the local lords in the name of the emperor . "

While seizing the historical opportunities and concentrating strength on advancing modernization , we must also be soberly aware that the contemporary world is still not peaceful though the situation is easing on the whole , and the parity of international strength is seriously imbalanced .  Hegemonism and power politics still exist and make new developments in the fields of international politics , economy , and security .  Military interventionism has further increased .

It greatly enrich people 's understanding of the party 's character , basic principle , and task .  
In the course of leading the whole party and the people of the entire country to continuously advance the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the party Central Committee , with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , has persistently integrated the basic tenets of Marxism with the practice of the modernization drive in the contemporary China and has constantly deepened the understanding of party building of the ruling party and the law governing the socialist modernization drive .  
It represents the contemporary advanced strategic culture and security idea , is a continuation and development in the new period of China 's Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , an extension and continuation in international security affairs of China 's new type of peace-loving and development-pursuing political idea , and the new manifestation in contemporary security affairs of China 's fine cultural tradition of regarding peace as the top priority , maintaining good neighborly and amicable relations with one 's neighbors , and maintaining peaceful and cooperative relations with all countries .

The important thinking on " three represents , " the party-building theory for a communist party and especially a communist party in a ruling position , and the thesis on combining the long-term struggle objective of the communist party with the contemporary historical tasks are all important theoretical subjects related to all branches of culture and social sciences .

They hold the key to how the emerging countries should deal with today 's international order and rules .  The many problems China has run into in its modernization process , including its backward political , military , economic conditions today , make many people suspicious of the rules of international competition and contemporary warfare .

Hu Jintao pointed out that the ideas of " how to understand four things " put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin involve important theoretical and strategic issues of the contemporary general trends of development of China and the world , are basic questions that must be correctly answered by means of theoretical research on scientific socialism , and are also issues of ideological understanding at a deeper level which the broad masses of party members and cadres are concerned about .  
Though the Chinese nationals residing abroad are physically overseas , the declaration said , their hearts are linked to the motherland .  During the critical moment when China faced danger on two occasions in contemporary times , they united themselves and contributed to the future of China .  
We must actively meet the new demands of the contemporary economic , science , technology , and social development , and speed up the establishment and perfection of a complete set of systems and mechanisms that are indispensable to developing the socialist market economy .  
In the contemporary world , the new scientific and technological revolution is rapidly forging ahead with great momentum , the trend of economic globalization is also gathering momentum .  Many countries , including developed countries , are speeding up their own reforms mainly by actively promoting industrial restructuring .  They are all trying to seize a more favorable and advantageous position ahead of others by stimulating vigor , enhancing strength , and increasing their international competitive power .

The scenic surroundings of the university campus inspired her creative writing , and she often contributed to literary journals . Wang has written hundreds of short stories in which a trend away from the vague earlier works to the current contemporary social dramas is apparent .  
Master Sheng-yen has two explanations for the turnabout . First , at a time when contemporary man 's living space grows ever smaller and social tensions ever greater , Buddhism offers people explanations for the flux around them and a limitless spiritual space to roam in . And second , as people rise in educational level , they gain a new understanding of Buddhism which they find more acceptable .  
Read in the light of contemporary trends , Ch'en 's work may seem no longer fresh or original in conception and rather to await further exploration of its potential . But among the paths taken by Taiwan photographers in the 1960s , Ch'en 's development , from amateur realistic photographer to a sketcher of imagistic scenery , can be considered representative .  
As well as texts , each entry in the work also comprises basic biographical information concerning the author ; complete bibliographical information concerning the first edition of the work ; a summary of the content , analysis or appraisal of the work ; and references to contemporary reviews , secondary works and translations into English .  
Several of the most popular areas of research , such as the encroachment of Western imperialism on China , Christianity in China , Chinese political philosophy and the spread of education were all aimed at gaining a quick understanding of modern China , and areas not related to contemporary China were neglected .  
Chinoiserie , the vogue for Chinese-style interior decoration , furniture , porcelain and textiles that swept Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , has sometimes been explained as blatant imitation of Chinese products , as freely creative art with China as its inspiration , or even as the product of commercial protectionism aimed at keeping Chinese exports out of contemporary markets .  
At about the time the maritime powers were making links with the orient , the notion of China as a land of extraordinary riches began to spread . As one contemporary visitor reported : " This is a mighty , wealthy country , blessed with silk , gems , pearls , quicksilver , rhubarb , japonica , musk , and other treasures , in great abundance . "  
What they shared in common was in showing new problems brought about by social development , such as conflicts between development and traditional ways of thinking or the adverse health effects of pollution and the fast pace of contemporary life brought about by industrialization . I feel the articles have a lot of reference value , because these situations are ones that the mainland is encountering or is going to encounter in the course of opening up .  
Leaving chilly , rainy Taipei on a winter 's day in December , and walking on Chungkang Road under clear skies with the sun lightly caressing your shoulders , it really does seem a little like the West Coast ; clean-lined , soaring office blocks show that Taichung is eager to shake off its old image , dress up in contemporary style , and step on to the international cosmopolitan stage .  
A . With any kind of historical research , especially recent or contemporary , for which many of the people involved are still alive , it is comparatively easy to be coolly objective . Yet it is also , therefore , difficult to get a true picture and description .  
Puli is right in the geographic center of Taiwan . Some people say that Taiwan 's contemporary food market is ' controlled by President in the north and by Wei chuan in the south . ' Although Taiwan Sugar is getting off the blocks relatively late , one day you may be hearing ' Taiwan Sugar controls the center , ' " says Hsieh with confidence , because " there are still so many treasures to be unearthed at our Puli ! "  
When some of the ridiculous aspects of contemporary funerals are mentioned , Hsu Fu-chuan , a professor at the Taiwan Institute of Technology who has studied quite a bit about traditional funeral rites , ca n't help but sigh . Birth and death are major events in the lives of any individual , yet are also important for socialization . The only thing is , in today 's changing society , who will pass these ceremonies along ?  
Those in favor say that there is already a gulf between vernacular and classical Chinese ( or wen-yen-wen ) . Through translation , modern people can share in the wisdom of the ancients . Those opposed contend that it would be difficult to avoid error in translating the spare and refined classical into the modern vernacular . If errors do occur , this will mislead contemporary readers about their history .  
For apart from the historical space-time and special political and social circumstances constituted by the discourse , the " special context " which he has chosen is on the one hand inherent in the very phylogeny of the sub-genres within modern fiction , and on the other hand is a basic turning point in the development of Chinese and Western culture , highlighted by all the theories of contemporary culture and literature .  
In his choice of these genres , and by defining his period of investigation at the late Ching to the present day , David Wang not only objectively grasps how the basic distinctive essence of the contemporary and modern Chinese novel is in the emergence and evolution of the modern consciousness which is unfolded within its pages ; in fact he also displays how his subjective concern is the entire flood torrent of China 's headlong progress toward modernization .  
As for the current fashion for biographies of contemporary political figures , historians view this as " front line " work in the writing of history , by which the opinions of contemporary persons are first recorded ; but defining each person 's place in the rolling tide of history is something that must wait many decades or even centuries , until historians can make judgements on the basis of more comprehensive investigation and more stringent proof .  
We saw old women who were living proof of the traditional model , mature women caught at the crossroads of tradition and contemporary society , and women who have crossed the historical divide and are actively creating their own space for the " new generation . "  
It 's no longer startling to see stories in the press of students and parents thinking that the behavior of such teachers is wrong , some teachers have even been physically attacked . Now we 're hearing calls to " maintain respect for teachers " even from university campuses , where the nation 's highest - ranking intellectuals are trained . This means that the traditional respect for teachers is being widely challenged all across contemporary society .  
A : I think we should avoid a proliferation of so - called " international " productions which try to attract a poorly defined audience , and to sign themselves up for a round of " patchwork " festivals . I believe we should present the public with a more coherent series of performances from a single country or a group of countries , which relate the history of that region 's performing arts , ranging from traditional forms ( folk ) to classical cultures , up to and including modern or contemporary forms .  
The international success of the Swedish group Abba , who were contemporary with Teresa Teng , just goes to prove to what extent the English language has become the exclusive medium of the global pop-music industry over the last thirty years , a phenomenon matched equally by its unrivaled position as the language of science and technology .  
At the early stage of development , comic dialogues were close to being musical dramas . Some comic dialogue performers would put on extra little shows outside the theater to attract an audience . Other performers simply had a background in Peking opera and thus " stole " quite a few performance techniques . For example , they incorporated stage acrobatics and the vocal techniques of musical dramas , and even contemporary pop songs .  
But in the view of the institute 's director Chen San-ching , since Liu Shao-tang began the magazine thirty-odd years ago , although his work can not be said to follow the traditional methods of academic research , his contribution to Chinese contemporary history has been incomparable , for he has rescued countless quantities of first-hand material including manuscripts , photographs , documents and personal memoirs , and has inspired many people who then participated actively in research and writing .  
In this sort of cultural tradition , even if many contemporary women and their husbands enjoy a substantial level of educational achievement and income , when these women return to their motherinlaw 's house , they still come down a notch , afraid of offending at every turn , making their inlaws unhappy and causing trouble for their husbands .  
Activities on the tour included both highly refined traditional live budaixi and contemporary TV budaixi . HEPP wisely invited ethnologists-who have wide connections in the field of traditional culture-to organize the event . As a result , virtually all the major puppet theater families from all over Taiwan were brought together . In the world of budaixi , where each " school " carefully distinguishes itself from its competitors , this was truly unprecedented .  
However , many artists are unwilling to let this 800-year-old Chinese folk tradition wither and die . In 1985 the Council for Cultural Planning and Development began an annual competition to select the best New Year 's prints . Each year many creative submissions combining tradition and contemporary styles are received , reflecting today 's actual mass culture .  
" The fact that aboriginal cultures are ' living cultures ' allows the Sheng Ye Museum to adopt an unusual style of exhibition , " explains Hsu Kung-ming , associate research fellow at the National Museum of Natural Science . " Unlike many other museums which must rely on displays of historical artifacts , the Sheng Ye Museum pays equal attention to collecting reproductions of antique styles , modern works of aboriginal art , and exhibiting displays created by contemporary craftsmen .  
Paiwan pottery can be divided into male and female . Male pots have designs of the hundred-pace snake while female pots are decorated with nipples . Because the Paiwan tribe long ago lost techniques for making pots , contemporary artists such as Pavavalung must attempt to imitate ancient pots .  
At the tenth anniversary of Tiananmen , preventive measures by the mainland authorities made substantive attacks against the government impossible . But participants in a symposium on " The May Fourth Movement and 20th-Century China " at Peking University in early May could scarcely fail to expand on the stated theme , to touch on the currently most sensitive topics of democracy , human rights and freedom which were the issues behind Tiananmen . Hence the symposium was full of the sense that " all history is contemporary history . "  
In addition to introducing mechanical sets , the Fujianese opera groups adapted to keep up with developments in the movies . When the film Mambo Girl was all the rage , the Fujianese troupes suddenly started doing musicals-which they described as " modern Fujianese opera " - wearing contemporary costumes and mambo-dancing to accompaniment from piano , saxophone and drums . It certainly testifies to the eclectic nature of ko-tzai-hsi , and the opera troupes ' imaginative instinct for self-preservation .  
The Taipei Fine Arts Museum offered visitors a peek outside the mainstream in October , exhibiting a collection of works by contemporary artists from five Central American nations . Apart from the exotic nature of the exhibit , the deep insights that the artists have incorporated into these works offer a portrait of the political , economic , cultural , and social realities of Central America today .  
Rather this kind of thing is a " trademark " that has become attached to Taiwanese drama over the course of its history . As a result , even though " nativist drama " has escaped the stereotypical setting of the Taiwanese countryside of the past and increasingly focuses on contemporary urban life , such provocative scenes-playing to elemental emotions to pull on the heart-strings-are still common .  
" Historical truth " is of course a fascinating topic of its own . While Biographical Literature has had an unmatched impact on contemporary historians , on popular interest in history , and in capturing the flavor of the past , there is at least one point worth wondering about : It has rarely published any material about Taiwan over the last 50 years , such as the stories of the opposition movement or of well-connected families like the Lins or Koos .  
The " one priority " was arts education . The " two legs to walk on " was a reference to the importance of state-run professional opera troupes and the encouragement of private theater troupes . And the talk about " three items of equal importance " meant that traditional opera , contemporary opera , and newly composed works dealing with historical subjects were all equally deserving of attention .  
Chen Bin , a gezai xi music composer who graduated from the music department at the Fujian Provincial Academy of the Arts , has noticed that when he composes music for a contemporary gezai xi work , stirring Western symphonies or military tunes always come into his head subconsciously , which is very much at odds with the warm , homey emphasis of traditional gezai xi .  
At the same time , he has worked all his life in his capacity as an individual artist to promote contemporary Taiwanese art both at home and abroad . To this end , he has organized countless solo and joint exhibits , talked his good friend and printmaker Chu Wei-pai into opening an art gallery , introduced to Taiwan 's art community the works of such expatriate painters as Charng Yuh and Chao Wu-chi , and done many other things to inject renewed life into Taiwan 's arts scene .  
Lee first gained acclaim in the late 1950s with semi-abstract works depicting dilapidated scenes of faded glory , featuring architectural elements to set the tone . In these works he used a coarse , brusque style to create a feeling of loss . This was the first attempt by Lee to usher Chinese elements into Western artistic form . This series of works won him several international awards and established his position as an important contemporary painter  
The 1990s were a decade of great political , social , and economic change in Taiwan . Against this backdrop contemporary Taiwanese artists were active participants in the global fashion for installation art , integrating an essentially Western conceptual skeleton with an indigenous or local skin .  
But on the other hand , the promotion of creativity certainly does make contemporary society more diverse and interesting . Thus some school principals try to inspire a greater love of learning in their students with a performance of ballet . Or powerful political and business leaders are delighted to join in a costume show during New Year office parties . Even corpses , not normally put on public show , can be shaped and sculpted into all kinds of forms and go on a global tour .  
In contemporary society , life and death have moved from being centered around the family to being handled by professionals , from being something human to becoming something mechanized . People have few opportunities to encounter birth or death , and to plumb the mysteries of life . On the one hand , this unfamiliarity with the basic processes of life frequently results in a nameless fear .  
The Secrets of Fashion 's editors set out to produce a marketable book , and the editing of the text , the book 's layout and design , and the subject matter all reflect this , giving the book a style that is simultaneously classic and hip . Every chapter abounds in photographs that run the gamut from classical to contemporary and Chinese to international , yet there is nothing haphazard about the presentation .  
In short , then , contemporary racism is a kind of anachronistic biological and cultural fundamentalism , given that the current trend of human societies is towards racial mixing and globalization . 
The first is the international economy , transformed by global movements of trade , capital and labour ; driven by forces which can break developing economies ; regulated if they can be at all in forums outside the United Nations , which is therefore marginalized in this most momentous of contemporary developments . 
Owada ( Japan ) : The fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations , coming as it did in the midst of the structural changes that are taking place in the world in the wake of the end of the cold war , has offered us a golden opportunity for sober reflection upon the role of the United Nations in the contemporary international system .  
This is an imaginative , promotive , contemporary and fair State that respects economic , political and social balance and makes room for individual and collective creativity in society .  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .

As regards the assurances given by Mr . Batu that Turkey does not harbour any designs or territorial ambitions against Greece or any of its neighbours and without going into any historic retrospection that would give ample and eloquent proof of Turkey 's traditional performance in the broader area of the Balkans and the Middle East , suffice it to recall the notorious contemporary case of the military invasion and ongoing occupation of Cyprus .  
Thus , contemporary United States domestic law on federal , state and local levels provides strong protections against racial discrimination in all fields of public endeavour and in many areas of private life .

The conference papers , written by leading scholars , covered an extremely broad field in terms of geography and intellectual disciplines and were directly relevant to matters of great contemporary international concern .  
The appointment of a Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance indicated the deep concern raised in the international community by those tendencies , among which " ethnic cleansing " gave special cause for alarm .  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .  
That is why we view with growing concern the fact that , in supposed support of freedom and democracy , action is being taken in the opposite direction through the adoption of laws in the field of trade the nerve centre of contemporary progress that are extraterritorial in scope and in complete disagreement with the fundamental principles of international law .  
The social and economic consequences of these conflicts have no parallel in contemporary history , but we can not simply pretend that military imposition , coercion and sanctions are a universal panacea that can solve the numerous humanitarian problems of the world .  
In order to be able to understand these political ramifications in their historical context , we must consider this phenomenon in the context of the flexibility and inflexibility that characterize the structure of the contemporary system of international relations .  That is because the crisis afflicting current international political relations has been caused largely by the persistence of complex political and historical dilemmas that have continued to interact within a system of international relations based on visions formulated by the allies before the end of the Second World War .  
Recent unilateral sanctions enacted by the United States against the trading partners of a number of countries not only constitute a grave breach of various norms and principles of international law and many resolutions of this Assembly and other international forums as well as blatant interference in the internal and external affairs of other States , but , indeed , point to a very dangerous trend , which undermines the very foundations of contemporary inter-State relations .  
In addition , the costs of building additional storage facilities and conveyance systems are soaring , and attempts to recover costs have so far met with little progress ; financial constraints are contributing to a revision of previous policies ; and many contemporary projects are being questioned by vocal environmental movements .  
Mr . AL-MUALLA ( United Arab Emirates ) said that the international community had in recent years set about elaborating plans for the advancement of women that were in keeping with contemporary aspirations for global progress towards societies in which women and men played complementary and active roles in meeting the needs of national , regional and international development .  
It is therefore pertinent to ask how long the international community can countenance the present untenable status quo ; what the reasoning is behind the stated preference of some Members for the present state of affairs over changes in the composition of the Security Council and its decision-making processes ; and whether we are genuinely committed to a Council that would reflect the undeniable realities of the contemporary world .  
As part of the measures agreed upon between States and the international organizations , Algeria fully supported proposals for the convening of an international conference on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ; the creation of a mechanism to monitor the media as purveyors of hatred , racism and xenophobia ; making the administrative regulations for the granting of visas more flexible ; promoting exchanges between individuals and cross-cultural communication ; and the teaching of human rights at all levels of education .  
It laid down guidelines for concerted action by Governments and the United Nations system to take effective measures to eliminate contemporary forms of racism and racial discrimination and encouraged the mass media to promote ideas of tolerance and understanding .  
These organizations could help , through international and regional meetings , to sensitize countries to pressing bioethical issues , notably those raised in the primary health care context , and to foster a North-South dialogue in this area , aimed at achieving broad universal consensus on the essential principles of contemporary bioethics and their implementation in the health and related sectors ( principle 4.1 ) .  
The concept of an international crime was deeply rooted in contemporary positive law , and the distinction between crimes and delicts was a qualitative one between ordinary wrongful acts and serious wrongful acts which damaged the fundamental interests of the international community .  
China is ready to work with the countries concerned in accordance with the established basic principles and legal regime , as contained in recognized international law and contemporary law of the sea including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to achieve an appropriate settlement of disputes through peaceful negotiations . 
During that event , more than 140 leading media figures from around the globe , representing more than 50 countries , had discussed the growing significance of television in the changing contemporary world , the opportunities offered by the current technological revolution in communications , which vastly increased the possibilities of cultural exchange , the role of both private and public broadcasters in providing information on global events and the strengthening of the partnership between the United Nations system and the international media .  
The Conference welcomes the fact that the United Nations approaches racism by examining incidents characteristic of contemporary forms of racism , incidents which unfortunately seem to be on the rise throughout the world , aggravated by economic and social problems and the current universal decline in moral standards .  
50 The expert encouraged the working group , in drafting the optional protocol , to take a realistic approach in relation to non-governmental armed groups , in the light of the fact that the vast majority of contemporary armed conflicts were internal . 
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance continue to persist and even to grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia , against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
It was only in this century , and more particularly after the Second World War , that human rights took on an international dimension as a result of the incorporation of their norms into a great variety of regional and universal treaties and conventions , thereby becoming one of the most dynamic and revolutionary branches of contemporary international public law .  
While contemporary terrorism does seem a particularly novel and dangerous threat , for it possesses attributes which set it apart from its historical forebears and make it more effective as a result of the confluence of new political circumstances and modern technological advances , it still remains an imitative mode of behaviour with a limited tactical repertoire 9 / and deplorable , as ever , effects on human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
The need for such volunteer effort is greater today than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse or HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of society , given the concern of the international community for the eradication of poverty and given the contemporary trend for civil society , in partnership with Governments and the private sector , to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process .  
According to the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ( A / 51 / 301 ) , such manifestations had profound and complex historical , political , social , economic and even religious causes which should be removed by taking measures to achieve genuine equality , human rights and fundamental freedoms among all racial or ethnic groups .  
We believe that in thinking about the African future they would be well advised to build on well-tested solutions , enriched with their specific local experience and African traditions , bearing in mind that respect for universally recognized standards of democracy , the rule of law and basic human rights lies at the centre of contemporary international relations .  
The themes of the Colloquium will be : an overview of the international law-making process and the role of the International Law Commission ; major complexities encountered in contemporary international law-making ; selection of topics for codification and progressive development by the Commission and its working methods ; the Commissions work and the shaping of international law ; enhancing the Commissions relationship with other law-making bodies and relevant academic and professional institutions ; and making international law more relevant and readily available .  
The informed assessment of these contemporary hazards , effective risk management , and the prevention of future disasters must begin at the present time and be fully incorporated into the ongoing commitments of economic growth and developmental planning - at the international , regional , and national levels of responsibility .  
Requests Governments , the specialized agencies , other international organizations , concerned United Nations bodies , regional organizations , non-governmental organizations , the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination , the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and other human rights mechanisms to assist the preparatory committee , to undertake reviews and submit recommendations concerning the conference and the preparations therefor to the preparatory committee through the Secretary-General , and to participate actively in the conference ;  
They also expressed their support for a new , more democratic and just world order , and noted the growing geopolitical and economic importance of the countries represented at the meeting in contemporary international relations .  
For an intergovernmental organization such as IOM , which works in a field with clear links to the issues dealt with by a number of United Nations organizations and bodies , timely , systematic interchanges and close working relationships with our partners promote the sorts of innovative , practical , cost effective initiatives required to address contemporary migration issues .  
Inasmuch as Europe Eastern and Western has been the main partner with Egypt in trade transactions , tourist flows and cultural interactions , so has Egypt been and will continue to be a major active party in ensuring stability and regulating a veritable interaction between the European dimension of Mediterranean security and the Mediterranean dimension of European security , in the full meaning of the comprehensive concept of contemporary security . 
Requests Governments , the specialized agencies , other international organizations , concerned United Nations bodies , regional organizations , non-governmental organizations , the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination , the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , and other human rights mechanisms to assist the preparatory committee , to undertake reviews and submit recommendations concerning the conference and the preparations therefor to the preparatory committee through the Secretary-General , and to participate actively in the conference ;  
With regard to diplomatic protection by international organizations , her delegation believed that since the number of international , regional and governmental organizations had grown immensely in the past decade , the functional diplomatic protection of those organizations formed an important part of contemporary diplomatic protection .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance continue to persist and even to grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,

We are especially pleased that the United Nations accepted our invitation to host this most important forum which is so critical to an international understanding of the dynamics of the contemporary self-determination process and future advancement of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories in our region and beyond .  
Convinced that the need for volunteer effort is greater than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse and HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of societies , and the contemporary trend for civil society _ in partnership with Government and the private sector _ to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process ,  
That occupation represented one of the ugliest forms of occupation in contemporary history , involving expansionist policies and practices , especially in East Jerusalem ; illegal Israeli colonial settlements ; usurpation and exploitation of Palestinian natural resources ; and the building of infrastructure separate from that available to the Palestinian people , all of which represented a unique mixture of colonialism and apartheid-like arrangements .  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 46 / 122 of 17 December 1991 by which it established the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery to assist representatives of non _ governmental organizations to participate in the deliberations of the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery by providing them with financial assistance and to extend through established channels of assistance , humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals whose human rights have been severely violated as a result of contemporary forms of slavery ,  
Since 1993 , his Government had been pursuing simultaneously processes aimed at transforming the State , promoting social participation , adapting the production base to the changes in contemporary international life and strengthening democratic and participatory institutions , in the belief that economic development must be compatible with concern for nature and the environment .  
With respect to economic concerns , the Commission is looking at how far contemporary economic theory can be applied to ocean management in the context of sustainable development , at the national , regional and global levels and is assessing the effectiveness of alternative policy instruments in improving the way humans treat the oceans .  
This very clear philosophy , shared by many other actors of contemporary international relations , has inspired my country , Ukraine , to take the position of an active and staunch supporter of a stronger , more efficient and more effective United Nations .  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,

In many respects , those conditions did not meet contemporary international standards in the field of human rights or the requirements of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 , which the General Assembly had determined was applicable to the occupied territories . 
The International Social Science Council ( ISSC ) has as its aim the promotion of the understanding of human society in its environment by fostering the social sciences throughout the world and their application to major contemporary problems and by enhancing cooperation by means of a global international organization of social scientists and social science organizations , encouraging multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary cooperation among its members . 
The main method , if it can be put that way , of conducting so-called combat operations during contemporary armed conflicts is ethnic cleansing , whereby a part of the territory of a sovereign State is cleansed of its local population , who , in turn , become displaced persons and virtual refugees on their own soil . 
More contemporary national and international discussion of how to achieve a balanced approach to macroeconomic policy could be very valuable , focusing on how to simultaneously address economic and social goals , such as full employment , low inflation and development in the fullest sense , including both efficient economic growth and an effective strategy for increasing equity .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination against , inter alia , Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , Negrophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,

As far as issues recognized in the 1988 outline as elements to be addressed at the end of the study are concerned , the Special Rapporteur identified the role of treaties in European expansion overseas ( addressed in chapter III above ) ; the contemporary significance of treaties , agreements , and other constructive arrangements , including questions relating to State succession , national recognition of such instruments , and the views held by indigenous peoples on them .  
The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that to link the determination of the original legal status of indigenous peoples as nations ( in the contemporary sense of international law ) or as non-nations to the single factor of whether or not they have formalized relations with non-indigenous colonizing powers , is faulty .  
Being a developing country with a vast territory , a varied topography , a large population and a weak economic foundation , China is confronted with a tremendous challenge of modernization and construction , and space technology , as one of the most sophisticated technologies in the contemporary world , is not only a representation of the overall national strength , but also an important means to transcend the phase of traditional development and accelerate economic and social development .  
Accordingly , the Working Group had asked Mr . David Weissbrodt and Anti _ Slavery International , in consultation with non _ governmental organizations with an established record in that field , to prepare a comprehensive review of existing treaty and customary law covering all the traditional and contemporary slavery _ related practices and relevant monitoring mechanisms .  
Globalization , diversification of forms of migration , the declining role of State leadership in migration , decrease of State _ organized migration as compared to spontaneous migration , increase in temporary migration , growth of private recruitment agencies , increase in irregular migration , trade in human beings and - what is very important - feminization of migration have substantially changed the context of contemporary migration .  
Instead , the perception has arisen that scientists and government officials , allegedly were either directly responsible for , or else proved in league with big business , incapable of preventing , such contemporary problems as " mad cow disease " , the transatlantic dispute over beef cattle pumped full of hormones , fears about genetically modified food or the failure to find a cure for AIDS . 
Among general lessons is the importance of historical and contemporary diversity of national economic systems and trajectories within each great systemic family , and in the process of shifting from the socialist to the capitalist family ( Chavance and Magnin , 1998 ) .  
The Board is composed of five persons with relevant experience in the field of human rights and contemporary forms of slavery in particular , who serve in their personal capacity , as United Nations experts and are appointed by the Secretary-General for a three-year renewable term , in consultation with the current Chairman of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights , with due regard to equitable geographical distribution . 
As regards the issue of humanitarian intervention and limited sovereignty , we associate ourselves with the majority of Member States , especially States of the South , that referred to the contravention by such ideas of international law , the Charter and the principal guidelines in contemporary law such as sovereignty , political independence and territorial integrity , as well as non-interference in the internal affairs of others .  
Similarly , at the national level , there was a growing awareness that sustainable development , as well as the prevention and peaceful settlement of most contemporary conflicts , depended on effective guarantees of human rights .  
The Turkish Government is concerned that , despite continuing efforts to increase the vigilance of Governments and arouse international public opinion , contemporary forms of racism and racial discrimination , in particular against Blacks , Muslims and migrant workers , and xenophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance , continue to exist and even grow in magnitude by adopting subtle new forms .  
This task is fulfilled through in-depth analyses , pioneering research and debates , conducted with a multidisciplinary methodology , on the process of social and economic change in contemporary societies and of the demands addressed to political , legal , judicial and social professions .  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
My delegation welcomes this briefing and future briefings on this important subject , which has a direct bearing on the primary responsibility of the Council in the maintenance of international peace and security as it deals more and more with the issue of the humanitarian dimensions of conflicts around the world , especially given the new and more pernicious forms of conflict in our contemporary world .  
Secondly , as evidenced in the report above , TCDC - both as a modality and as an integral component of contemporary international development cooperation - is increasingly recognized and appreciated by the international community , as offering viable opportunities for improving socio-economic development of developing countries and for enabling their participation and integration in the global economy .  
The knowledge and wisdom of indigenous and local communities is critical to the conservation and management of much of the worlds biological diversity and natural resources and can add value to contemporary , scientific ways of thinking .  
The World Conference would offer an exceptional opportunity to examine a wide range of issues of the utmost relevance today , including ethnic cleansing , the emergence of contemporary forms of slavery , traffic in humans , discrimination against minorities , migrant workers , indigenous peoples and refugees , the preservation of cultural identity in multi-cultural societies , racism on the Internet , and new and more subtle forms of racism .  
He wished to know whether the Special Rapporteur was participating in the preparatory regional meetings for the World Conference , whether he had attended the preparatory meeting in Strasbourg and what his relations were with the Council of Europe , which was intimately concerned with issues of racism and racial discrimination .  52 .  Regarding contemporary forms of racism , he wondered whether the Special Rapporteur considered that they were linked with new forms of criminal behaviour , inter-ethnic conflict and economic discrimination .  
Note with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be victims of varied , evolving and sophisticated contemporary forms of racism and racial discrimination , in particular nationals of different origins , migrant workers , asylum-seekers , refugees and foreigners ;  
Express our concern that beyond the material progress of racism is the disturbing fact that contemporary forms and manifestations of racism are striving to regain political , moral and even legal recognition in many ways , including through legislative prescriptions such as those relating to the freedom of expression , the platforms of some political parties and organizations , and the dissemination through modern communication technologies of ideas based on racial superiority ;  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , discrimination against , inter alia , Africans , people of African descent , Arabs and Muslims , and incidents of xenophobia , Negrophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , discrimination against , inter alia , Africans , people of African descent , Arabs and Muslims , and incidents of xenophobia , Negrophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Also urge them to provide an accurate presentation of the history of the State , highlighting the contributions of the different culture and civilizations of the region and the world , including the role that indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities have played in building national identities in the Americas , and historical and contemporary examples of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance directed against these groups ;  
We recall that , without the necessary political will to recognize and assume responsibility for historical injustices and their contemporary forms and repercussions [ modern slavery and slavery-like practices , ] programmes of action against racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as the anti-racist slogans and measures adopted at the World Conference and at the regional and national levels , will not change deeply ingrained prejudices or achieve the noble goal of a genuine human family based on equal dignity and opportunities ;  
New and more dangerous phenomena have emerged that affect the security of States and their citizens , such as international terrorism , drug trafficking , transnational organized crime , the illegal exploitation of natural resources and other factors that threaten the regional and international security balance of our contemporary world .  
At a press conference held after the closing of the 60th session of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , Li Zhaoxing said the United Nations is the most representative and authoritative international organization of governments in the contemporary world and has an irreplaceably important role in maintaining world peace and stability and promoting common development .  Solutions to many major world issues would not be possible without the United Nations .  
Being the largest multilateral economic organization for the standardized international economic and trade rules in the contemporary world , the WTO has formulated and implemented a complete set of multilateral trade rules with a very extensive coverage , which almost involve all facets of the contemporary world 's economy and trade and have legal effect and standards .  
In contemporary history , the Palestinian people conducted hard and bitter struggles to defend their homeland and national dignity , restore their legitimate national rights and interests , and gain national liberation and independence , composing magnificent paeans .  Finally , they built autonomous political power on their own land .  And they are advancing toward a lofty goal of establishing an independent state .  
As we all know , the founders of Marxism always approached the revolutionary spirit , the historical mission , and the source of strength of both the proletariat and their political parties in different countries from the angle of their relationship with the emergence and development of socialized productive forces represented by the big industry in both modern and contemporary times .  
The rich ideological content of those songs realizes the spirit of Chairman Jiang 's major instructions on enhancing the Army 's ideological and political education , warmly eulogizes the nature and purposes of the people 's army and the glorious chapters of unity and struggle under the Party leadership , and displays the spiritual outlook of the vigorous and high-fighting spirit contemporary military personnel .  Songs are varied in style .  
The Party 's basic lines have embodied in a centralized manner the Party 's nature of being advanced , of reflecting the fundamental interests and wishes of the broad number of the masses , of meeting the requirements for developing the social productive forces in contemporary China , and of powerfully pushing forward the development and the progress of socialist material and spiritual civilization 's construction .  
Reform and opening up is a historical policy decision determining the fate of contemporary China . This great practice has not only greatly liberated and developed productive forces , but also greatly emancipated people 's minds , deeply transformed the mental outlook of the masses of people , and promoted the constant progress of social thinking .  
In contemporary China , the correct and progressive ideological concept under the guidance of Marxism is the main current of the whole social ideology and some wrong and backward concepts running against Marxism are only branch currents .  
Although many things in Western economic theories reflect the common regularity in mass production and market operation in an era of scientific and technological revolution , being the reflection of the basic economic relations in capitalist society , in essence , such theories just embody the requirements of the capitalist economic system in its contemporary development .  
The leading body invited military technology experts to teach its members the military space technology , guided missile precision control and guide , automatic commanding technology , and other frontier military knowledge of the contemporary world .  Members of the leading body went deep into the training fields and launching pads to carry out technical practices and scientific and technological research , and to guide troops in completing a number of projects on scientific and technical drills .  
As radical nationalism in itself is just an operational platform for speech , it must be combined with other ism values in order to assume the state of actual political operation .  In terms of contemporary China , the ideology or ism the most capable of functioning well on the platform of nationalism is exactly leftist radicalism ; such a leftist current of thought , revitalized through being combined with radical nationalism , will acquire momentum in terms of " being able to command the local lords in the name of the emperor . "  
The vast number of theoretical workers should take pains to undertake the lofty mission of theoretical innovation which has been entrusted to them by the age , persistently emancipate their minds , make courageous exploration , observe and take hold of the trends of economic , political , scientific and technological , and cultural development in the contemporary world as well as the great changes in China today , and strive to make new progress and new contributions in theoretical innovation .  
Zhang Yingying , a student of the English Department , said that contemporary university students should keep themselves sober-headed , resolutely support the solemn and just position of the Chinese Government , proficiently master scientific and general knowledge , make preparations for participating in our country 's economic construction and national defense construction , and enhance our country 's comprehensive national strength and international influence .  
Comrade Wang Wei was an outstanding representative of contemporary Chinese youths .  He epitomized the characteristics of the young generation of our time - - ambitious , eager to learn , bold in practice , always thinking about the interests of the motherland , and keen to serve the people .  He is the example whom the youths of all ethnic groups throughout the country in the new period should learn from .  
We must always adhere to the Marxist viewpoint of historical materialism , firmly adopt the basic viewpoint that only people are the driving force for creating history , give wider publicity to the need to further enhance the status and role of the working class , greatly carry forward the great contemporary spirit of the working class , use the advanced ideas and model conduct of the working class to influence and lead all other sectors of our society , continuously consolidate and enhance the master status of the broad working masses .  
While seizing the historical opportunities and concentrating strength on advancing modernization , we must also be soberly aware that the contemporary world is still not peaceful though the situation is easing on the whole , and the parity of international strength is seriously imbalanced .  Hegemonism and power politics still exist and make new developments in the fields of international politics , economy , and security .  Military interventionism has further increased .  
Li Liguo noted : On 23 May 1951 , the Central People 's Government and the former local government of Tibet signed a 17-clause " Agreement on Procedures Concerning the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet " ; and the People 's Liberation Army entered Tibet , drove out imperialist forces , and brought true both the peaceful liberation of Tibet and the unification of the mainland motherland .  This was a major event in China 's modern and contemporary history , and a natural and epoch-making turning point in the historical development of Tibet .  
It is necessary to rectify guiding thinking on education , to set education objectives , to arrange education contents , and to improve the education system on the basis of closely centering on the implementation of the military strategic policy for the new period , so as to form an education mechanism suited for prevailing in contemporary warfare and to ensure that the military is capable of accomplishing the sacred mission of resisting aggression and maintaining the country 's unity and territorial integrity .  
The key to upholding Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in the new historical period lies in persistent use of Deng Xiaoping Theory to observe the present-day world and contemporary China , incessantly sum up practical experience and generalize it in the new theoretical light and open up new ways forward .  
Those advanced collectives and outstanding individuals are from enterprises , rural areas , organizations , schools , scientific research institutes , neighborhoods , military and other fronts .  Their advanced deeds and noble spirit have embodied the character , styles and features of contemporary members of the CPC with clear characteristics of our time .  
Through study and discussion , all people attending the meeting deeply realized that the important thinking on " three represents " set forth by Comrade Jiang Zemin is a creative application of the basic theory of historical materialism , which is practiced in contemporary China . It greatly enrich people 's understanding of the party 's character , basic principle , and task .  
In the course of leading the whole party and the people of the entire country to continuously advance the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the party Central Committee , with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , has persistently integrated the basic tenets of Marxism with the practice of the modernization drive in the contemporary China and has constantly deepened the understanding of party building of the ruling party and the law governing the socialist modernization drive .  
It represents the contemporary advanced strategic culture and security idea , is a continuation and development in the new period of China 's Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , an extension and continuation in international security affairs of China 's new type of peace-loving and development-pursuing political idea , and the new manifestation in contemporary security affairs of China 's fine cultural tradition of regarding peace as the top priority , maintaining good neighborly and amicable relations with one 's neighbors , and maintaining peaceful and cooperative relations with all countries .  
They should establish their footing on the current situation of the country , advance with the time , break new grounds , pay attention primarily to studying the important issues in real life , draw the rich resources and strong power for their theoretical innovation from reforms , opening up and modernization drive , closely follow the trend of world development , and profoundly understand the laws for contemporary China 's economic and social development .  
The important thinking on " three represents , " the party-building theory for a communist party and especially a communist party in a ruling position , and the thesis on combining the long-term struggle objective of the communist party with the contemporary historical tasks are all important theoretical subjects related to all branches of culture and social sciences .  The theoretical research work of the academy must deal with every issue and every link through in-depth study and understanding .  
Democracy must serve to resolve contemporary urgent social , political , or economic problems .  A parallel thinking is this : Whenever a political , economic , or social problem can not be resolved , people naturally pin their hopes on democracy .  
They hold the key to how the emerging countries should deal with today 's international order and rules .  The many problems China has run into in its modernization process , including its backward political , military , economic conditions today , make many people suspicious of the rules of international competition and contemporary warfare .  Many believe that under the rules drawn up mainly by the Western developed countries , China can never win .

In his speech , Jiang Zemin put forward and expounded on how to understand the historical process of the development of socialism and capitalism , the impact of the practice of China 's socialist reform on people 's thinking , the influence of the contemporary international environment and international political struggle , and other major issues that have a direct bearing on the mental state of cadres and the masses .  He urged all party comrades to jointly conduct in-depth study in an effort to acquire scientific knowledge in the ideological and political sphere .  
it is imbued with the intentions of the central authorities on governing the party with strictness and opposing corruption ; depicts a noble and healthy atmosphere of contemporary communists building a party serving the interests of the people and not being cowed by evil ; and expresses our party 's strong resolve to oppose corruption .  
In particular , in the contemporary world , from nature to human society , from the economic and political realms to culture and science , things are developing and changing at a speed unimaginable to people in the previous periods .  
He said : In the contemporary era , new knowledge keeps emerging in vast multitude , science and technology are advancing with each passing day , and the social productive forces are considerably elevated , which have produced enormous impacts on the world 's political , economic , cultural , and social lives , so that human beings are confronted with new , tremendous historical changes and leaps .  
Hu Jintao pointed out that the ideas of " how to understand four things " put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin involve important theoretical and strategic issues of the contemporary general trends of development of China and the world , are basic questions that must be correctly answered by means of theoretical research on scientific socialism , and are also issues of ideological understanding at a deeper level which the broad masses of party members and cadres are concerned about .

The scenic surroundings of the university campus inspired her creative writing , and she often contributed to literary journals . Wang has written hundreds of short stories in which a trend away from the vague earlier works to the current contemporary social dramas is apparent .  
Master Sheng-yen has two explanations for the turnabout . First , at a time when contemporary man 's living space grows ever smaller and social tensions ever greater , Buddhism offers people explanations for the flux around them and a limitless spiritual space to roam in . And second , as people rise in educational level , they gain a new understanding of Buddhism which they find more acceptable .  
Read in the light of contemporary trends , Ch'en 's work may seem no longer fresh or original in conception and rather to await further exploration of its potential . But among the paths taken by Taiwan photographers in the 1960s , Ch'en 's development , from amateur realistic photographer to a sketcher of imagistic scenery , can be considered representative .  
As well as texts , each entry in the work also comprises basic biographical information concerning the author ; complete bibliographical information concerning the first edition of the work ; a summary of the content , analysis or appraisal of the work ; and references to contemporary reviews , secondary works and translations into English .  
Several of the most popular areas of research , such as the encroachment of Western imperialism on China , Christianity in China , Chinese political philosophy and the spread of education were all aimed at gaining a quick understanding of modern China , and areas not related to contemporary China were neglected .  
Chinoiserie , the vogue for Chinese-style interior decoration , furniture , porcelain and textiles that swept Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , has sometimes been explained as blatant imitation of Chinese products , as freely creative art with China as its inspiration , or even as the product of commercial protectionism aimed at keeping Chinese exports out of contemporary markets .  
At about the time the maritime powers were making links with the orient , the notion of China as a land of extraordinary riches began to spread . As one contemporary visitor reported : " This is a mighty , wealthy country , blessed with silk , gems , pearls , quicksilver , rhubarb , japonica , musk , and other treasures , in great abundance . "  
What they shared in common was in showing new problems brought about by social development , such as conflicts between development and traditional ways of thinking or the adverse health effects of pollution and the fast pace of contemporary life brought about by industrialization . I feel the articles have a lot of reference value , because these situations are ones that the mainland is encountering or is going to encounter in the course of opening up .  
Leaving chilly , rainy Taipei on a winter 's day in December , and walking on Chungkang Road under clear skies with the sun lightly caressing your shoulders , it really does seem a little like the West Coast ; clean-lined , soaring office blocks show that Taichung is eager to shake off its old image , dress up in contemporary style , and step on to the international cosmopolitan stage .  
A . With any kind of historical research , especially recent or contemporary , for which many of the people involved are still alive , it is comparatively easy to be coolly objective . Yet it is also , therefore , difficult to get a true picture and description .  
Puli is right in the geographic center of Taiwan . Some people say that Taiwan 's contemporary food market is ' controlled by President in the north and by Wei chuan in the south . ' Although Taiwan Sugar is getting off the blocks relatively late , one day you may be hearing ' Taiwan Sugar controls the center , ' " says Hsieh with confidence , because " there are still so many treasures to be unearthed at our Puli ! "  
When some of the ridiculous aspects of contemporary funerals are mentioned , Hsu Fu-chuan , a professor at the Taiwan Institute of Technology who has studied quite a bit about traditional funeral rites , ca n't help but sigh . Birth and death are major events in the lives of any individual , yet are also important for socialization . The only thing is , in today 's changing society , who will pass these ceremonies along ?  
Those in favor say that there is already a gulf between vernacular and classical Chinese ( or wen-yen-wen ) . Through translation , modern people can share in the wisdom of the ancients . Those opposed contend that it would be difficult to avoid error in translating the spare and refined classical into the modern vernacular . If errors do occur , this will mislead contemporary readers about their history .  
For apart from the historical space-time and special political and social circumstances constituted by the discourse , the " special context " which he has chosen is on the one hand inherent in the very phylogeny of the sub-genres within modern fiction , and on the other hand is a basic turning point in the development of Chinese and Western culture , highlighted by all the theories of contemporary culture and literature .  
In his choice of these genres , and by defining his period of investigation at the late Ching to the present day , David Wang not only objectively grasps how the basic distinctive essence of the contemporary and modern Chinese novel is in the emergence and evolution of the modern consciousness which is unfolded within its pages ; in fact he also displays how his subjective concern is the entire flood torrent of China 's headlong progress toward modernization .  
As for the current fashion for biographies of contemporary political figures , historians view this as " front line " work in the writing of history , by which the opinions of contemporary persons are first recorded ; but defining each person 's place in the rolling tide of history is something that must wait many decades or even centuries , until historians can make judgements on the basis of more comprehensive investigation and more stringent proof .  
We saw old women who were living proof of the traditional model , mature women caught at the crossroads of tradition and contemporary society , and women who have crossed the historical divide and are actively creating their own space for the " new generation . "  
It 's no longer startling to see stories in the press of students and parents thinking that the behavior of such teachers is wrong , some teachers have even been physically attacked . Now we 're hearing calls to " maintain respect for teachers " even from university campuses , where the nation 's highest - ranking intellectuals are trained . This means that the traditional respect for teachers is being widely challenged all across contemporary society .  
A : I think we should avoid a proliferation of so - called " international " productions which try to attract a poorly defined audience , and to sign themselves up for a round of " patchwork " festivals . I believe we should present the public with a more coherent series of performances from a single country or a group of countries , which relate the history of that region 's performing arts , ranging from traditional forms ( folk ) to classical cultures , up to and including modern or contemporary forms .  
The international success of the Swedish group Abba , who were contemporary with Teresa Teng , just goes to prove to what extent the English language has become the exclusive medium of the global pop-music industry over the last thirty years , a phenomenon matched equally by its unrivaled position as the language of science and technology .  
At the early stage of development , comic dialogues were close to being musical dramas . Some comic dialogue performers would put on extra little shows outside the theater to attract an audience . Other performers simply had a background in Peking opera and thus " stole " quite a few performance techniques . For example , they incorporated stage acrobatics and the vocal techniques of musical dramas , and even contemporary pop songs .  
But in the view of the institute 's director Chen San-ching , since Liu Shao-tang began the magazine thirty-odd years ago , although his work can not be said to follow the traditional methods of academic research , his contribution to Chinese contemporary history has been incomparable , for he has rescued countless quantities of first-hand material including manuscripts , photographs , documents and personal memoirs , and has inspired many people who then participated actively in research and writing .  
In this sort of cultural tradition , even if many contemporary women and their husbands enjoy a substantial level of educational achievement and income , when these women return to their motherinlaw 's house , they still come down a notch , afraid of offending at every turn , making their inlaws unhappy and causing trouble for their husbands .  
Activities on the tour included both highly refined traditional live budaixi and contemporary TV budaixi . HEPP wisely invited ethnologists-who have wide connections in the field of traditional culture-to organize the event . As a result , virtually all the major puppet theater families from all over Taiwan were brought together . In the world of budaixi , where each " school " carefully distinguishes itself from its competitors , this was truly unprecedented .  
However , many artists are unwilling to let this 800-year-old Chinese folk tradition wither and die . In 1985 the Council for Cultural Planning and Development began an annual competition to select the best New Year 's prints . Each year many creative submissions combining tradition and contemporary styles are received , reflecting today 's actual mass culture .  
" The fact that aboriginal cultures are ' living cultures ' allows the Sheng Ye Museum to adopt an unusual style of exhibition , " explains Hsu Kung-ming , associate research fellow at the National Museum of Natural Science . " Unlike many other museums which must rely on displays of historical artifacts , the Sheng Ye Museum pays equal attention to collecting reproductions of antique styles , modern works of aboriginal art , and exhibiting displays created by contemporary craftsmen .  
Paiwan pottery can be divided into male and female . Male pots have designs of the hundred-pace snake while female pots are decorated with nipples . Because the Paiwan tribe long ago lost techniques for making pots , contemporary artists such as Pavavalung must attempt to imitate ancient pots .  
At the tenth anniversary of Tiananmen , preventive measures by the mainland authorities made substantive attacks against the government impossible . But participants in a symposium on " The May Fourth Movement and 20th-Century China " at Peking University in early May could scarcely fail to expand on the stated theme , to touch on the currently most sensitive topics of democracy , human rights and freedom which were the issues behind Tiananmen . Hence the symposium was full of the sense that " all history is contemporary history . "  
In addition to introducing mechanical sets , the Fujianese opera groups adapted to keep up with developments in the movies . When the film Mambo Girl was all the rage , the Fujianese troupes suddenly started doing musicals-which they described as " modern Fujianese opera " - wearing contemporary costumes and mambo-dancing to accompaniment from piano , saxophone and drums . It certainly testifies to the eclectic nature of ko-tzai-hsi , and the opera troupes ' imaginative instinct for self-preservation .  
The Taipei Fine Arts Museum offered visitors a peek outside the mainstream in October , exhibiting a collection of works by contemporary artists from five Central American nations . Apart from the exotic nature of the exhibit , the deep insights that the artists have incorporated into these works offer a portrait of the political , economic , cultural , and social realities of Central America today .  
Rather this kind of thing is a " trademark " that has become attached to Taiwanese drama over the course of its history . As a result , even though " nativist drama " has escaped the stereotypical setting of the Taiwanese countryside of the past and increasingly focuses on contemporary urban life , such provocative scenes-playing to elemental emotions to pull on the heart-strings-are still common .  
" Historical truth " is of course a fascinating topic of its own . While Biographical Literature has had an unmatched impact on contemporary historians , on popular interest in history , and in capturing the flavor of the past , there is at least one point worth wondering about : It has rarely published any material about Taiwan over the last 50 years , such as the stories of the opposition movement or of well-connected families like the Lins or Koos .  
The " one priority " was arts education . The " two legs to walk on " was a reference to the importance of state-run professional opera troupes and the encouragement of private theater troupes . And the talk about " three items of equal importance " meant that traditional opera , contemporary opera , and newly composed works dealing with historical subjects were all equally deserving of attention .  
Chen Bin , a gezai xi music composer who graduated from the music department at the Fujian Provincial Academy of the Arts , has noticed that when he composes music for a contemporary gezai xi work , stirring Western symphonies or military tunes always come into his head subconsciously , which is very much at odds with the warm , homey emphasis of traditional gezai xi .  
At the same time , he has worked all his life in his capacity as an individual artist to promote contemporary Taiwanese art both at home and abroad . To this end , he has organized countless solo and joint exhibits , talked his good friend and printmaker Chu Wei-pai into opening an art gallery , introduced to Taiwan 's art community the works of such expatriate painters as Charng Yuh and Chao Wu-chi , and done many other things to inject renewed life into Taiwan 's arts scene .  
Lee first gained acclaim in the late 1950s with semi-abstract works depicting dilapidated scenes of faded glory , featuring architectural elements to set the tone . In these works he used a coarse , brusque style to create a feeling of loss . This was the first attempt by Lee to usher Chinese elements into Western artistic form . This series of works won him several international awards and established his position as an important contemporary painter  
The 1990s were a decade of great political , social , and economic change in Taiwan . Against this backdrop contemporary Taiwanese artists were active participants in the global fashion for installation art , integrating an essentially Western conceptual skeleton with an indigenous or local skin .  
But on the other hand , the promotion of creativity certainly does make contemporary society more diverse and interesting . Thus some school principals try to inspire a greater love of learning in their students with a performance of ballet . Or powerful political and business leaders are delighted to join in a costume show during New Year office parties . Even corpses , not normally put on public show , can be shaped and sculpted into all kinds of forms and go on a global tour .  
In contemporary society , life and death have moved from being centered around the family to being handled by professionals , from being something human to becoming something mechanized . People have few opportunities to encounter birth or death , and to plumb the mysteries of life . On the one hand , this unfamiliarity with the basic processes of life frequently results in a nameless fear .  
The Secrets of Fashion 's editors set out to produce a marketable book , and the editing of the text , the book 's layout and design , and the subject matter all reflect this , giving the book a style that is simultaneously classic and hip . Every chapter abounds in photographs that run the gamut from classical to contemporary and Chinese to international , yet there is nothing haphazard about the presentation .  
In short , then , contemporary racism is a kind of anachronistic biological and cultural fundamentalism , given that the current trend of human societies is towards racial mixing and globalization . 
The first is the international economy , transformed by global movements of trade , capital and labour ; driven by forces which can break developing economies ; regulated if they can be at all in forums outside the United Nations , which is therefore marginalized in this most momentous of contemporary developments . 
Owada ( Japan ) : The fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations , coming as it did in the midst of the structural changes that are taking place in the world in the wake of the end of the cold war , has offered us a golden opportunity for sober reflection upon the role of the United Nations in the contemporary international system .  
This is an imaginative , promotive , contemporary and fair State that respects economic , political and social balance and makes room for individual and collective creativity in society .  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .

As regards the assurances given by Mr . Batu that Turkey does not harbour any designs or territorial ambitions against Greece or any of its neighbours and without going into any historic retrospection that would give ample and eloquent proof of Turkey 's traditional performance in the broader area of the Balkans and the Middle East , suffice it to recall the notorious contemporary case of the military invasion and ongoing occupation of Cyprus .  
Thus , contemporary United States domestic law on federal , state and local levels provides strong protections against racial discrimination in all fields of public endeavour and in many areas of private life .

The conference papers , written by leading scholars , covered an extremely broad field in terms of geography and intellectual disciplines and were directly relevant to matters of great contemporary international concern .  
The appointment of a Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance indicated the deep concern raised in the international community by those tendencies , among which " ethnic cleansing " gave special cause for alarm .

That is why we view with growing concern the fact that , in supposed support of freedom and democracy , action is being taken in the opposite direction through the adoption of laws in the field of trade the nerve centre of contemporary progress that are extraterritorial in scope and in complete disagreement with the fundamental principles of international law .  
The social and economic consequences of these conflicts have no parallel in contemporary history , but we can not simply pretend that military imposition , coercion and sanctions are a universal panacea that can solve the numerous humanitarian problems of the world .  
In order to be able to understand these political ramifications in their historical context , we must consider this phenomenon in the context of the flexibility and inflexibility that characterize the structure of the contemporary system of international relations .  That is because the crisis afflicting current international political relations has been caused largely by the persistence of complex political and historical dilemmas that have continued to interact within a system of international relations based on visions formulated by the allies before the end of the Second World War .  
Recent unilateral sanctions enacted by the United States against the trading partners of a number of countries not only constitute a grave breach of various norms and principles of international law and many resolutions of this Assembly and other international forums as well as blatant interference in the internal and external affairs of other States , but , indeed , point to a very dangerous trend , which undermines the very foundations of contemporary inter-State relations .  
In addition , the costs of building additional storage facilities and conveyance systems are soaring , and attempts to recover costs have so far met with little progress ; financial constraints are contributing to a revision of previous policies ; and many contemporary projects are being questioned by vocal environmental movements .  
Mr . AL-MUALLA ( United Arab Emirates ) said that the international community had in recent years set about elaborating plans for the advancement of women that were in keeping with contemporary aspirations for global progress towards societies in which women and men played complementary and active roles in meeting the needs of national , regional and international development .  
It is therefore pertinent to ask how long the international community can countenance the present untenable status quo ; what the reasoning is behind the stated preference of some Members for the present state of affairs over changes in the composition of the Security Council and its decision-making processes ; and whether we are genuinely committed to a Council that would reflect the undeniable realities of the contemporary world .  
As part of the measures agreed upon between States and the international organizations , Algeria fully supported proposals for the convening of an international conference on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ; the creation of a mechanism to monitor the media as purveyors of hatred , racism and xenophobia ; making the administrative regulations for the granting of visas more flexible ; promoting exchanges between individuals and cross-cultural communication ; and the teaching of human rights at all levels of education .  
It laid down guidelines for concerted action by Governments and the United Nations system to take effective measures to eliminate contemporary forms of racism and racial discrimination and encouraged the mass media to promote ideas of tolerance and understanding .  
These organizations could help , through international and regional meetings , to sensitize countries to pressing bioethical issues , notably those raised in the primary health care context , and to foster a North-South dialogue in this area , aimed at achieving broad universal consensus on the essential principles of contemporary bioethics and their implementation in the health and related sectors ( principle 4.1 ) .  
The concept of an international crime was deeply rooted in contemporary positive law , and the distinction between crimes and delicts was a qualitative one between ordinary wrongful acts and serious wrongful acts which damaged the fundamental interests of the international community .  
China is ready to work with the countries concerned in accordance with the established basic principles and legal regime , as contained in recognized international law and contemporary law of the sea including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to achieve an appropriate settlement of disputes through peaceful negotiations . 
During that event , more than 140 leading media figures from around the globe , representing more than 50 countries , had discussed the growing significance of television in the changing contemporary world , the opportunities offered by the current technological revolution in communications , which vastly increased the possibilities of cultural exchange , the role of both private and public broadcasters in providing information on global events and the strengthening of the partnership between the United Nations system and the international media .  
The Conference welcomes the fact that the United Nations approaches racism by examining incidents characteristic of contemporary forms of racism , incidents which unfortunately seem to be on the rise throughout the world , aggravated by economic and social problems and the current universal decline in moral standards .  
50 The expert encouraged the working group , in drafting the optional protocol , to take a realistic approach in relation to non-governmental armed groups , in the light of the fact that the vast majority of contemporary armed conflicts were internal . 
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance continue to persist and even to grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,

It was only in this century , and more particularly after the Second World War , that human rights took on an international dimension as a result of the incorporation of their norms into a great variety of regional and universal treaties and conventions , thereby becoming one of the most dynamic and revolutionary branches of contemporary international public law .  
While contemporary terrorism does seem a particularly novel and dangerous threat , for it possesses attributes which set it apart from its historical forebears and make it more effective as a result of the confluence of new political circumstances and modern technological advances , it still remains an imitative mode of behaviour with a limited tactical repertoire 9 / and deplorable , as ever , effects on human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
The need for such volunteer effort is greater today than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse or HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of society , given the concern of the international community for the eradication of poverty and given the contemporary trend for civil society , in partnership with Governments and the private sector , to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process .  
According to the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ( A / 51 / 301 ) , such manifestations had profound and complex historical , political , social , economic and even religious causes which should be removed by taking measures to achieve genuine equality , human rights and fundamental freedoms among all racial or ethnic groups .  
We believe that in thinking about the African future they would be well advised to build on well-tested solutions , enriched with their specific local experience and African traditions , bearing in mind that respect for universally recognized standards of democracy , the rule of law and basic human rights lies at the centre of contemporary international relations .  
The themes of the Colloquium will be : an overview of the international law-making process and the role of the International Law Commission ; major complexities encountered in contemporary international law-making ; selection of topics for codification and progressive development by the Commission and its working methods ; the Commissions work and the shaping of international law ; enhancing the Commissions relationship with other law-making bodies and relevant academic and professional institutions ; and making international law more relevant and readily available .  
The informed assessment of these contemporary hazards , effective risk management , and the prevention of future disasters must begin at the present time and be fully incorporated into the ongoing commitments of economic growth and developmental planning - at the international , regional , and national levels of responsibility .  
Requests Governments , the specialized agencies , other international organizations , concerned United Nations bodies , regional organizations , non-governmental organizations , the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination , the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and other human rights mechanisms to assist the preparatory committee , to undertake reviews and submit recommendations concerning the conference and the preparations therefor to the preparatory committee through the Secretary-General , and to participate actively in the conference ;

For an intergovernmental organization such as IOM , which works in a field with clear links to the issues dealt with by a number of United Nations organizations and bodies , timely , systematic interchanges and close working relationships with our partners promote the sorts of innovative , practical , cost effective initiatives required to address contemporary migration issues .  
Inasmuch as Europe Eastern and Western has been the main partner with Egypt in trade transactions , tourist flows and cultural interactions , so has Egypt been and will continue to be a major active party in ensuring stability and regulating a veritable interaction between the European dimension of Mediterranean security and the Mediterranean dimension of European security , in the full meaning of the comprehensive concept of contemporary security .

We are especially pleased that the United Nations accepted our invitation to host this most important forum which is so critical to an international understanding of the dynamics of the contemporary self-determination process and future advancement of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories in our region and beyond .  
Convinced that the need for volunteer effort is greater than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse and HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of societies , and the contemporary trend for civil society _ in partnership with Government and the private sector _ to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process ,  
That occupation represented one of the ugliest forms of occupation in contemporary history , involving expansionist policies and practices , especially in East Jerusalem ; illegal Israeli colonial settlements ; usurpation and exploitation of Palestinian natural resources ; and the building of infrastructure separate from that available to the Palestinian people , all of which represented a unique mixture of colonialism and apartheid-like arrangements .  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 46 / 122 of 17 December 1991 by which it established the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery to assist representatives of non _ governmental organizations to participate in the deliberations of the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery by providing them with financial assistance and to extend through established channels of assistance , humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals whose human rights have been severely violated as a result of contemporary forms of slavery ,  
Since 1993 , his Government had been pursuing simultaneously processes aimed at transforming the State , promoting social participation , adapting the production base to the changes in contemporary international life and strengthening democratic and participatory institutions , in the belief that economic development must be compatible with concern for nature and the environment .  
With respect to economic concerns , the Commission is looking at how far contemporary economic theory can be applied to ocean management in the context of sustainable development , at the national , regional and global levels and is assessing the effectiveness of alternative policy instruments in improving the way humans treat the oceans .  
This very clear philosophy , shared by many other actors of contemporary international relations , has inspired my country , Ukraine , to take the position of an active and staunch supporter of a stronger , more efficient and more effective United Nations .

In many respects , those conditions did not meet contemporary international standards in the field of human rights or the requirements of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 , which the General Assembly had determined was applicable to the occupied territories . 
The International Social Science Council ( ISSC ) has as its aim the promotion of the understanding of human society in its environment by fostering the social sciences throughout the world and their application to major contemporary problems and by enhancing cooperation by means of a global international organization of social scientists and social science organizations , encouraging multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary cooperation among its members . 
The main method , if it can be put that way , of conducting so-called combat operations during contemporary armed conflicts is ethnic cleansing , whereby a part of the territory of a sovereign State is cleansed of its local population , who , in turn , become displaced persons and virtual refugees on their own soil . 
More contemporary national and international discussion of how to achieve a balanced approach to macroeconomic policy could be very valuable , focusing on how to simultaneously address economic and social goals , such as full employment , low inflation and development in the fullest sense , including both efficient economic growth and an effective strategy for increasing equity .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination against , inter alia , Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , Negrophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,

As far as issues recognized in the 1988 outline as elements to be addressed at the end of the study are concerned , the Special Rapporteur identified the role of treaties in European expansion overseas ( addressed in chapter III above ) ; the contemporary significance of treaties , agreements , and other constructive arrangements , including questions relating to State succession , national recognition of such instruments , and the views held by indigenous peoples on them .  
The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that to link the determination of the original legal status of indigenous peoples as nations ( in the contemporary sense of international law ) or as non-nations to the single factor of whether or not they have formalized relations with non-indigenous colonizing powers , is faulty .  
Being a developing country with a vast territory , a varied topography , a large population and a weak economic foundation , China is confronted with a tremendous challenge of modernization and construction , and space technology , as one of the most sophisticated technologies in the contemporary world , is not only a representation of the overall national strength , but also an important means to transcend the phase of traditional development and accelerate economic and social development .  
Accordingly , the Working Group had asked Mr . David Weissbrodt and Anti _ Slavery International , in consultation with non _ governmental organizations with an established record in that field , to prepare a comprehensive review of existing treaty and customary law covering all the traditional and contemporary slavery _ related practices and relevant monitoring mechanisms .  
Globalization , diversification of forms of migration , the declining role of State leadership in migration , decrease of State _ organized migration as compared to spontaneous migration , increase in temporary migration , growth of private recruitment agencies , increase in irregular migration , trade in human beings and - what is very important - feminization of migration have substantially changed the context of contemporary migration .  
Instead , the perception has arisen that scientists and government officials , allegedly were either directly responsible for , or else proved in league with big business , incapable of preventing , such contemporary problems as " mad cow disease " , the transatlantic dispute over beef cattle pumped full of hormones , fears about genetically modified food or the failure to find a cure for AIDS . 
Among general lessons is the importance of historical and contemporary diversity of national economic systems and trajectories within each great systemic family , and in the process of shifting from the socialist to the capitalist family ( Chavance and Magnin , 1998 ) .  
The Board is composed of five persons with relevant experience in the field of human rights and contemporary forms of slavery in particular , who serve in their personal capacity , as United Nations experts and are appointed by the Secretary-General for a three-year renewable term , in consultation with the current Chairman of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights , with due regard to equitable geographical distribution . 
As regards the issue of humanitarian intervention and limited sovereignty , we associate ourselves with the majority of Member States , especially States of the South , that referred to the contravention by such ideas of international law , the Charter and the principal guidelines in contemporary law such as sovereignty , political independence and territorial integrity , as well as non-interference in the internal affairs of others .  
Similarly , at the national level , there was a growing awareness that sustainable development , as well as the prevention and peaceful settlement of most contemporary conflicts , depended on effective guarantees of human rights .  
The Turkish Government is concerned that , despite continuing efforts to increase the vigilance of Governments and arouse international public opinion , contemporary forms of racism and racial discrimination , in particular against Blacks , Muslims and migrant workers , and xenophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance , continue to exist and even grow in magnitude by adopting subtle new forms .  
This task is fulfilled through in-depth analyses , pioneering research and debates , conducted with a multidisciplinary methodology , on the process of social and economic change in contemporary societies and of the demands addressed to political , legal , judicial and social professions .  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
My delegation welcomes this briefing and future briefings on this important subject , which has a direct bearing on the primary responsibility of the Council in the maintenance of international peace and security as it deals more and more with the issue of the humanitarian dimensions of conflicts around the world , especially given the new and more pernicious forms of conflict in our contemporary world .  
Secondly , as evidenced in the report above , TCDC - both as a modality and as an integral component of contemporary international development cooperation - is increasingly recognized and appreciated by the international community , as offering viable opportunities for improving socio-economic development of developing countries and for enabling their participation and integration in the global economy .  
The knowledge and wisdom of indigenous and local communities is critical to the conservation and management of much of the worlds biological diversity and natural resources and can add value to contemporary , scientific ways of thinking .  
The World Conference would offer an exceptional opportunity to examine a wide range of issues of the utmost relevance today , including ethnic cleansing , the emergence of contemporary forms of slavery , traffic in humans , discrimination against minorities , migrant workers , indigenous peoples and refugees , the preservation of cultural identity in multi-cultural societies , racism on the Internet , and new and more subtle forms of racism .  
He wished to know whether the Special Rapporteur was participating in the preparatory regional meetings for the World Conference , whether he had attended the preparatory meeting in Strasbourg and what his relations were with the Council of Europe , which was intimately concerned with issues of racism and racial discrimination .  52 .  Regarding contemporary forms of racism , he wondered whether the Special Rapporteur considered that they were linked with new forms of criminal behaviour , inter-ethnic conflict and economic discrimination .  
Note with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be victims of varied , evolving and sophisticated contemporary forms of racism and racial discrimination , in particular nationals of different origins , migrant workers , asylum-seekers , refugees and foreigners ;  
Express our concern that beyond the material progress of racism is the disturbing fact that contemporary forms and manifestations of racism are striving to regain political , moral and even legal recognition in many ways , including through legislative prescriptions such as those relating to the freedom of expression , the platforms of some political parties and organizations , and the dissemination through modern communication technologies of ideas based on racial superiority ;  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , discrimination against , inter alia , Africans , people of African descent , Arabs and Muslims , and incidents of xenophobia , Negrophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , discrimination against , inter alia , Africans , people of African descent , Arabs and Muslims , and incidents of xenophobia , Negrophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Also urge them to provide an accurate presentation of the history of the State , highlighting the contributions of the different culture and civilizations of the region and the world , including the role that indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities have played in building national identities in the Americas , and historical and contemporary examples of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance directed against these groups ;  
We recall that , without the necessary political will to recognize and assume responsibility for historical injustices and their contemporary forms and repercussions [ modern slavery and slavery-like practices , ] programmes of action against racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as the anti-racist slogans and measures adopted at the World Conference and at the regional and national levels , will not change deeply ingrained prejudices or achieve the noble goal of a genuine human family based on equal dignity and opportunities ;  
New and more dangerous phenomena have emerged that affect the security of States and their citizens , such as international terrorism , drug trafficking , transnational organized crime , the illegal exploitation of natural resources and other factors that threaten the regional and international security balance of our contemporary world .
