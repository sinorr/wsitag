In the face of the " Taiwan independence " forces that are running wild and an adverse international current against China in particular , we must pay close attention to making preparations for a military struggle , keep increasing our defense capacity , do our utmost to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland and to safeguard our state sovereignty and the interests of the people , and ensure that our armed forces are capable of fighting and winning when the motherland and the people need them .  
The fact is that only a leader of the oil fields who is stupid in the extreme would put the chief engineer and the chief geologist in a subordinate position .  Even during the " Cultural Revolution " when the extreme leftist line was wild and unrestrained , though " the stinky ninth category " were damned , " the stinky ninth category " could n't be allowed to lie fallow .  
Despite Li Hongzhi 's wild boasting and loud preaching about the series of absurd beliefs that he has created , facts speak louder than words .  In the light of dialectical materialism and historical materialism , his reactionary and decadent nature is abundantly clear .  
In particular , after a three-year , large-scale production campaign , the barren mountains and wild hills were turned into the " fertile lower Chang Jiang valley of northern Shaanxi , " an achievement that won commendations and awards from Chairman Mao and the party Central Committee and helped establish a glorious banner for the entire army .  
" It has always been my dream to wear the green military uniform .  I want to fly a fighter plane and take to the wild blue yonder .  
Meanwhile , they are also deeply perplexed by numerous problems like the foundation of state regimes being fragile , the religious forces being powerful which gives rise to political and social disunity and complicated peripheral environments , the three evil forces running wild , the phenomena of smuggling , drug trafficking , arms trade , and so on being serious , and so on .  
It is quite unreasonable for Japan to make wild comments about China 's normal national defense construction in an official publication such as its " Defense White Paper , " and this does not help to promote mutual understanding and trust between the two countries in the military security field .  
The degree of wild celebration and emotional reactions by the Chinese both at home and abroad to Beijing 's successful bid as seen on television and in news photos over the past several days is no less than those several major events since the founding of the People 's Republic , say , the successful explosion of the atomic and hydrogen bombs , the launch of a satellite into space , and China winning the first Olympic medal .  
China 's negotiations with various countries on its WTO accession are raging on like wild fires .  As far as China is concerned , to be able to join the WTO naturally would be like winning a trade war , but the problem today is the arduous tasks the country will be facing after its WTO accession .  In particular , the people have not yet truly linked the WTO to their future livelihood , and most are underestimating the profound changes in the future .

repeatedly talked nonsense at international occasions ; made malicious and entirely groundless accusations against the policy of the Chinese Government towards Tibet ; and wantonly spread such rumors as that " the human rights situation in Tibet is deteriorating , " " the Tibetan culture has become extinct , " and " there is no religious freedom in Tibet , " thus turning himself into a " master of wild lies . "  
Since the " networked national import declaration form verification system " was introduced by the customs departments , the foreign exchange administration departments , and the banks on 1 January 1999 , banks have begun paying foreign exchange to the enterprises producing customs declaration forms for foreign exchange settlement only after verifying the original accounts via this networked system , and this has immediately rendered ineffective the trick of cheating in foreign exchange with forged documents and has quickly checked a wild wave of foreign exchange cheating .  
Some foreign missionaries directly served colonial expansion , took part in selling opium , gathered intelligence , encouraged and participated in military aggression , seized economic gains , took part in plotting to force the government to sign unequal treaties , relied on the special privileges provided by unequal treaties , ran wild in the countryside , bullied and humiliated the people , and stirred up the opposition of the people .  
23 .  Article 27 shall be changed to Article 37 and amended as : " The state shall give special protection to rare and endangered aquatic wild animals , such as the Chinese river dolphin , to prevent them from becoming extinct .  
Domestic financial laxity and economic policy distortions were common factors in Asia . The wild swings of fast-flowing and highly-leveraged speculative capital in narrower emerging markets led to strong overshoots which were highly destabilising and severely eroded investor and consumer confidence .  
" There have still been wild stories flying around in the international media that Hong Kong 's economic autonomy has been greatly eroded , that the Beijing Government is interfering in Hong Kong 's administration , that Hong Kong is the base of diversion for the PLA to smuggle controlled items into China and that Chinese owned firms in Hong Kong escape prosecution for gross criminal acts .  
To wild dolphins , human is the biggest threat to them apart from shark , its main predator .  Thousands of dolphins die everyday in fishing nets around the world .  What 's more , the seriously polluted environment makes dolphins increasingly vulnerable .  In view of that , many scientists , naturalists and marine biologists devote their lifetime to study dolphins , their mode of communication , foraging and social behaviors so as to preserve these graceful and extraordinary creatures .  
His lips were purple from the cold , his face bloodless , but his eyes shone with a fanatical ecstasy . At last the owner recognized the wild man before him as the person who ten days before had cared so much about the red glazed bottle .  
( The left over sauce can be stored in a jar for future use . ) Ingredients : 1 whole duck ( or chicken ) green onions2 dried plums ginger1 / 2 1b Suchow plums star anise2 / 3 cup soy sauce wild pepper1 / 3 cup wine licorice2 tsp sugar preserved plums  
Included among these are numerous water fowl varieties such as wild geese , ducks and gulls . Originating from their summer nesting grounds in Japan , Manchuria , Siberia and the plateau region of Mongolia , they fly southward making Taiwan one of their chief wintering and resting stops . Those that take brief respite here continue on to destinations further to the south like the Philippines , Indonesia and sometimes fly as far south as the southern hemispheric lands of Australia and New Zealand .  
During the Japanese occupation , the Japanese army surveyed the island 's mountain roads , but many of them were already long overgrown with brambles and wild grass . In addition , the paths used by the aboriginals on their hunts were not suitable for climbers , especially with the primitive equipment available to them at the time . As a result , climbing was a matter of going step by step through dense forests , and up unknown ridges , so most climbers limited themselves to familiar mountains like Yushan and Hsuehshan .  
In order more effectively to close off illegal channels for the entry into Taiwan of chameleons , wa-wa-yu ( Chinese salamanders ) , and other wild animals from mainland China , the Council of Agriculture in the Executive Yuan has decided that all wild animals brought into the country by travelers will be reported to the Japan chapter of the international Special Commission for Investigating Trade in Wild Plants and Animals , which in turn will notify the countries of export so that the exporters involved may be strictly apprehended .  
From the green-house effect , global climatic change , acid rain , the hole in the ozone layer , destruction of the rain forests , conservation of animal and plant species in the wild , to desertification and the shrinkage of marine mammals , all of this was very little discussed and paid scant attention .  
But if in the long term the good quality of cultivated fruits is to be guaranteed , then they will still have to rely on the occasional improvement from wild varieties . It is thus that the bat remains an animal of crucial importance for the fruit harvest of Southeast Asia . Eating 3,000 insects an evening : On average , 70 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the tropical rain forests , which are also home to 90 percent of the world 's animal and vegetable species .  
Thus in the spring they turned the soil and planted seeds ; when the summer rainy season came , that was the time to allow the little creatures of the wild to be born and mature , and anyway it being dangerous to go deep into the mountains in the rainy season , people held off on hunting .  
The memoir 's depiction of the events of the Cultural Revolution , however , does convince a reader that the deliberate selfishness of leaders , combined with the wrong political system , allowed the evil and selfish in people to run wild . Only people of excellent character could lend a helping hand or show a little gentleness .  
" It has passed from the youthful stage of development into the mature period , and now artificial factors are pushing it towards premature old age , " says Lin Yung-teh , explaining that even in the early period after Cheng Cheng-kung arrived in Taiwan , the clearing of land for farming , the quarrying and mining and the steps taken to control the wild rivers quickly began to affect the supply of silt downstream ; however , the potential for creating environmental disasters was very limited compared with today 's development .  
In general , there was fear of the sea as expressed in the old poem , " The sky is so black , the waves so rough ; papa has gone fishing , but why has n't he come back yet ? Watching the wild wind and pounding waves makes me anxious . " Today , backed by technology , people have a spirit that says , " I 'm not afraid of the white-capped waves ; hold onto the rudder , and full speed ahead ! " With this spirit they develop the tidal land .  
The price of falconry : If you want the hawks to have glossy and healthy-looking plumage , be vigorous and formidable , fly high , and aim sure , as they do in the wild , it takes a lot of time and effort . Given modern lifestyles , it 's impossible for most people to find the patience or time to take care of the " troublesome , " tempestuous animals from morning to night .  
In 1989 the Wildlife Conservation Law was passed . Besides being concerned about Taiwan 's image , the Council of Agriculture , which is responsible for ecological preservation work , is even more worried that the mountains are being scarred by ever-larger development projects , which are destroying the habitat of wild animals . It is feared that this destruction of habitat , combined with the Chinese belief that monkey brain is especially fortifying in the winter , will make the Formosan Rock Monkey an endangered species .  
A bird in the hand : This may be the case , but in looking at current efforts to breed wild animals in captivity , the Council of Agriculture takes a more practical tack , asking scholars to gather data widely and hoping they will refer to the experimental models used by foreign studies of primates . The council is also drawing up guidelines for the breeding of protected wild animal species . At appropriate times it will provide human-bred monkeys to be used by research units . "  
This is why many people take the view that just at the basic spirit behind the children 's welfare law is that children have self-esteem and need to be respected by adults , wild animals involved in the workings of human society also need people to fight for their most basic right " not to be subjected to mental terror or physical abuse , " in the same way that disadvantaged groups in society are protected .  
Professor Hsia Liang-chou of the Pingtung Polytechnic Institute , who has studied animal welfare in depth , explains that animal welfare is concerned not only for wild animals ; the hope is that people will understand that it is not true that any animal " can be used for medical experiments in laboratories , so it 's all right to butcher them any way one pleases ; " and that one should also consider the feelings , moods , and physical responses of the domestic fowl and animals which supply human beings with rich protein .  
But the old trails run deep into the furthest recesses of the mountain ranges , and were often cut along hunting trails and the tracks worn by wild animals , so that they are difficult for most people to reach , and with little in the way of historical records , searching them out is an extremely difficult task .  
At that time , two Peipo women discovered by chance that when dried , the wild rushes from the wetlands where the Ta-an River flows into the sea are extremely tough and flexible and highly resistant to splitting , making them a very suitable material for making everyday utensils .  
Han Chinese migrants to Taiwan who tried these mats were all enthusiastic about them , so many women started making them . The addition of hand-woven patterns started a real fashion for the mats , making them a much-sought-after commodity , and high officials and rich folk going to the capital also looked on " dragon and phoenix mats " as ideal gifts to present to superiors . The rushes began to be specially cultivated instead of just being cut from the wild .  
From these everyday natural ingredients he completes a work of art . The hues of the glaze are restrained , serene and firm ; they are the colors of Lungteng Village , colors whose power pours forth from the inside , reflecting its master 's wild head of hair and spirited eyes . Earth and man draw near to each other !  
Thus far nearly NT $ 100 million has been invested in efforts by more than a dozen agencies to breed the species , which exists in the wild only in the upstream portion of the Tachia River . Sadly , not only have its numbers not increased , none of the seven people who have earned PhDs or MAs through the breeding program hold out very optimistic hopes for the fate of the brook masu salmon .  
Of course , if the targets for expansion of the wild salmon population are reached , there are regulations governing the raising of animals which , strictly applied , should prevent artificially propagated animals from getting mixed into the species in the wild . Of course then it would be fine to take a few samples from nature for research into artificial propagation .  
The year before last , Wong Ka Kue , lead singer of the Hong Kong pop group Beyond , fell from the stage while performing in Japan and thereafter remained in a coma , diagnosed as brain dead . One of the group 's fans went to seek a divination at Wong Tai Sin Temple , and got the answer : " A wild wind swept through the eastern garden last night / Tearing out all the flowers / But fortunately the gardener rose early / And replanted their roots to restore them to life . "  
But Chinese herbal pharmacists distinguish between this drained gall and the gall taken from wild bears , which they call " true gall . " Drained gall , they say , lacks three active medicinal ingredients , and they have indeed shown that it is not as effective as true gall . But because it is only a tenth as expensive , consumers and pharmacies alike are gradually taking to using it for chronic illnesses .  
But today , when there is a greater emphasis on morality and humane treatment of other living beings , many countries are hard at work creating animal protection laws in the hope that in addition to wild animals , the pets with whom people have ever closer relationships , livestock and other animals that serve economic functions can also have legal protection . Humans will never stop eating and using animals , but some of the pain and hardship can be eliminated from how they use them . Such laws could also prevent unnecessary abuse .  
In recent years , wild animals raised in captivity have been given more living space and more natural surroundings . Still , says Marcus Phipps of TRAFFIC , there are still some extremist animal rights groups overseas who wish to close all zoos and sea-world theme parks , with the goal of returning the animals to their natural habitats .  
With many of Taiwan 's wild animals having become " disadvantaged groups " or having even been driven to the verge of extinction by pressure from human development , it became a matter of necessity to pass the Wildlife Conservation Law to protect endemic and rare species . But at the same time , previously unknown species of tree frogs , shrews , bats , spiders and many other animals which , though unfamiliar , enrich the list of Taiwan 's endemic species , have recently been " discovered " in the wild .  
Whether in terms of their right to exist or their value to the ecosystem , an elephant and an ant are equal . From an evolutionary perspective , every wild species alive on Earth today is a repository of genes which have passed the test of natural selection . Only if " genetic diversity " is maintained can these genes come into play to respond to sudden changes in the environment .  
The Formosan landlocked salmon was the main reason for the establishment of Shei-Pa National Park ; the Formosan clouded leopard was fielded by the newly formed Green Party as its presidential candidate ; and NT $ 200 million has been spent on the rehabilitation of the Formosan sika deer . But by the ecological definition , because these three species ' wild populations are so small that they can no longer reproduce healthily , in effect they are already extinct .  
Of course , reintroducing a species to the wild is very different from the artificial breeding performed in professional animal husbandry . In an artificial wild habitat , the deer must be gradually paired up and monitored . They must adapt to the wild setting and be tested by the powers of nature . The process takes a lot of time , and repopulation work is not so simple as artificial breeding .  
It is the dangers posed to juvenile deer by wild dogs that causes concern . Nevertheless , today with human footsteps covering every stretch of the land , it is impossible to let the deer go completely wild . Not wanting to put all their eggs in one basket , project personnel hope to select repopulation locales in northern , eastern and southern Taiwan . Since they have been operating in Kenting ( in the south ) for 12 years now , Yangming-shan National Park ( in the north ) is being considered as the second locale .  
Thirty years ago , an American director and cinematographer named Morton Heilig , inspired by 3-D films , had the " wild idea " of developing a " total illusion of reality " which would encompass sight , smell , motion , and sound . He declared that audiences would enjoy complete and realistic sensory stimulation .  
Up above , amid the grey , misty emptiness , the birds were the only discernable flecks of color . Amid this triple-layered scene of swans at the lake , there were also thousands of sea gulls swoop ing and diving overhead , wild geese flying in orderly formation , mandarin ducks swimming in pairs , wild ducks quacking , and even rare red-crowned cranes prancing elegantly on the beach .  
North-South cooperation But what of mainland China , the real homeland of the mihoutao ? Having woken up to the fact that what had been considered a very ordinary wild fruit actually has an export earnings potential far beyond what anyone could have imagined years ago , in recent years the mainland has started making strenuous efforts to make up lost ground by setting up research establishments and commencing commercial cultivation .  
Our ancient ancestors knew only too well how active and vital love can be at its most primitive , so it is hardly surprising if they regarded it as a raging flood or wild beast , and tried to " preserve Heaven 's order by eliminating human desire . "  
But associate professor Wang Li-chih of National Taiwan University 's forestry department is not worried that introduced rhododendrons will become dominant species and squeeze out other plants . The hybrid rhododendron cultivars , in which particular features are developed for commercial purposes , actually have weaker constitutions than naturally occurring varieties , and rhododendrons generally choose land " abandoned " by other species : on fertile ground , rhododendron can not necessarily compete with other plants in the wild .  
Over the last few years , Taiwan 's con-servation movement has risen to the level where there is discussion and debate on the merits of animal welfare . The people of Taiwan have been scolded for consuming wild animals , and the hunters among the indigenous tribes on the island , who are the direct source of these animals , have been labeled " wildlife terminators . "  
Here in Taiwan , however , under the umbrella of the Wildlife Conservation Law , any duck hunting can only be done on the sly . But people still have a deep sense that other countries must be making a better job of things . At a " Kuantu Nature Reserve Symposium " held late last year , a wetlands expert reported how happily wild ducks and humans get along in Japan .  
In contrast with today , when wild ducks live on river beds choked with stinking organic chemicals and strewn with styrofoam and other plastics , in written records from the past the ducks suck up red algae , delve beneath green lotus leaves , wash themselves with dew and live among clouds and mists .  
After cold fronts pass through , however , bird associations are always telling bird watchers to rush off to the seashore and mouths of rivers . If their luck is good , they may be able to see wild geese blown off course by the rough weather .  
One way , reveals a veterinarian , is that many people whose pets become seriously ill just abandon them at the animal hospital , never returning to pick them up . There is no system in place in Taiwan to take in stray animals . Given operational constraints on a hospital , the only thing a vet can do is to set these unhealthy animals free in the wild . But this turns the problem from being an implicitly contractual one ( between owner and vet ) , or personal moral one , into one foisted on society .  
In recent years organically grown vegetables have become increasingly popular . " Wild " veggies , grown without depending on man-made fertilizers and not using pesticides , fit right in with this trend . Add to this the common belief that bitter tasting foods have medicinal value , and wild vegetables have become a new favorite for health-minded modern people .  
On another front , because Taiwan is poised to enter the World Trade Organization , Taiwan agriculture must face competition from imported agricultural products . Cheng Shu-hsing , an assistant in the AIS horticulture lab and a specialist in wild vegetables , explains : " We are encouraging localities to develop specialized agricultural products in small volumes but greatly diversified varieties . Although production volume is low , by diversifying and growing unusual crops , farmers will better their chances of surviving WTO admission and soften its overall impact on agriculture here . "  
Seeing that many Han Chinese appear to be so concerned about surveying and recording aboriginal culture , Wu has , over the past two years , begun trying to collate and systematize aboriginal culinary culture . She has already identified and recorded more than 100 varieties of wild edible plants . The most able to " eat bitterness " Wu notes that most wild vegetables are bitter .  
Recently natural wild plants have become popular foods in Taiwan , and aboriginal edible plants have become well-known in the process . However , edible plants account for only one-quarter of the plants used in daily life in Taniao village . Besides the necessities ( food , shelter , clothing ) , plants are essential materials for a huge number of other uses-medicine , landmarks , all kinds of tools used for outdoor work , rope , packaging , sandpaper , and cloth .  
Entering the museum is as dazzling as discovering King Solomon 's treasure house : Here there is a giant painting , marble sculpture , player piano , or rare violin , while over there is a suit of armor , a cannon , a terra cotta statue , an image of the Buddha , or a stuffed wild animal . . . . You never get tired of the place .  
But in natural forests , every creature has its natural enemies , and the insect fungus Beauveria bassiana and parasitic flies are ready and waiting for M . basalis pryeri . Furthermore , in the wild the inchworms prefer trees over two meters tall , and by the time trees have reached this size they are strong enough for a few caterpillars not to pose them any threat .  
These included " fish souls , " made from the lips cut from live sturgeon ; " Xi Shi 's bosom , " made with white fat from pufferfish bellies and named after a famous beauty ; and the " gold soup and jade slices " served by Mrs . Song outside Qiantang Gate , which comprised a thick wild rice stem soup and sliced raw common carp and crucian carp .  
Once a week we worked on a specific topic assigned by Marian . We did role playing ( bought and sold stocks , for example ) , prepared a newspaper column , visited a local junior college , and picked wild strawberries . We even carried out a mock American-style election by printing out election ballots . Marian brought her shower curtain from home to set up a voting booth in the classroom .  
" A child deciding to become a monk or nun is no easy matter , " says Abbot Wei-chueh . Children are like blank slates and can easily be tarnished if exposed to filth . It is best that they wait until they have graduated from junior high , he argues . If they 're not wild , and their hearts and minds are pure , they can then talk about joining a monastery .  
In the center of one of the exhibition rooms , the NPM has laid out a realistic picture of the life of the literati , based on a portrayal in an anonymous Song painting . The main character sits alone in front of a painted screen depicting wild and domestic fowl . To one side , a servant pours tea from a white porcelain pot ; on a table are two or three dishes of fruit and snacks . In front of the scholar stands a basket of classically arranged flowers .  
The story is much the same when it comes to birds . Surveys of foreign starlings and mynas , also by TESRI , identified 13 non-native members of the family Sturnidae living wild in Taiwan , mainly escaped or released pets and their offspring . " White-vented mynas and common mynas have been recorded in over a third of Taiwan 's 361 urban townships , rural townships and city districts , " says a survey report by Lin Ruey-shing of TESRI .  
For true flower lovers , the shy orchids of the wild are just as precious as the oversized local or exotic orchids grown in private gardens .  
But with a combination of superb cinematography , fine musical scores , and gorgeous stars in a single package , something clicks . The Korean shows appeal most to viewers who already have their own share of life experiences , enabling them to watch what might be their own stories , retold onscreen before them , rendered beautiful and poetic , with all of life 's wild storms , dreams , and regrets .  
" Independent , close to ordinary people 's hearts , vital , spring-flowering , sublimely pure and noble . " Students involved in the student movement of the late 1980s created a huge wild lily modeled on the Statue of Liberty , to symbolize the spirit of the Taiwanese student movement .  
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) , with over 170 member states , places wild animals into one of four categories depending upon the size of their surviving populations and how endangered the species may be . Various controls and limitations on import , export , and trade are then imposed for the various categories . Protected animals may only be imported under certain conditions , such as for educational purposes or medical treatment , but not for profit .  
In April , when the tung tree blossoms bloom , Taumi is a sea of snow white . In May , pink wild peonies crop up along the mountain trails . In June , wild ginger lilies in the western part of the community begin to give off a sweet fragrance . August , meanwhile , is when the Nakai podocarp tree - " the official tree of Taumi neighborhood " and a species unique to Taiwan-begins to fruit , presenting a remarkable picture of mixed red and green seeds and seed receptacles .  
In fact , the Council of Agriculture normally forbids the artificial breeding and sale of protected species , for fear that inbreeding will damage the wild gene pool . But with the resurgence of dengue fever , and with people 's enthusiasm for repopulating Taiwan 's rivers with the indigenous paradise fish , conservation agencies merely suggest that breeders should enlarge their sources of genetic material , to avoid narrowing the fishes ' gene pool .  
The Taiwan Mushroom Museum also contains various other zones : the " Taiwanese wild mushroom ecology zone , " the " Taiwanese poisonous mushroom ecology zone , " " the mushrooms ' back garden , " " the microscopic world of fungi , " " the mushrooms ' homeland , " " mushrooms and health , " " the history of edible mushrooms , " and a computer and audiovisual room , to provide a comprehensive and diverse introduction to mushrooms ' many different faces .  
Because of Taiwan 's unique soil and climatic conditions , the island is extraordinarily rich in wild fungi . To date over 5300 mushroom species have been recorded here . In terms of global distribution , the species of fungi found in Taiwan can be divided into those that are found worldwide , those found in the northern hemisphere , those found in tropical and subtropical regions , those found in temperate and alpine regions , and those that are unique to Taiwan .  
The Qing dynasty term for Aboriginal peoples was fan [ �g f ] , which originally meant tracks left by the passing of a wild beast [ and is generally translated into English as " barbarian " ] . The depictions of Aborigines in Qing dynasty documents as long-haired brutes little different from animals reflected the Chinese understanding of aborigines as barbaric and backward .  
The earliest tea in Taiwan was wild tea growing in the mountains around Puli , Nantou County . A small number of Aborigines also cultivated tea for medicinal purposes , but because under theories of Chinese medicine it was considered " cold , " it was not deemed suitable as a casual drink . Large-scale cultivation of tea began only with the arrival in Taiwan of immigrants from Anxi ( Fujian ) during the Qing Dynasty .  
The three major gods have thousands of incarnations . For instance Vishnu can appear as fish , wild boar , dwarf , holy turtle and so forth , and Vishnu 's wife-Durga the " inaccessible " - alike has multiple forms and godly powers : Devi , Parvati , Uma , and Kali are among her beautiful incarnations .  
In reality , neglected sites need not be publicly owned spaces , and they need not be limited to separate and distinct buildings . Idle spaces can be found everywhere . Their scope includes a single empty building , a sidewalk , a row of houses , or an abandoned or wild piece of land . " So long as spaces are n't managed well and do n't function well , then public and private spaces can both be included , " says Lin Po-nian , publisher of Space Magazine .  
Just after finishing his studies and completing his military service in 1985 , Hsu competed in a global trek around the globe sponsored by a local daily newspaper , the Independence Evening Post . After circling the globe , Hsu settled into the stable life of a salaryman . However , this adventurous spirit , who feels that sleeping in the wild is more comfortable than sleeping in a bed , seemed destined to return to the mountains , to the unpopulated wilds , and to the swift currents of the sea .  
An ancient wild relative of corn from Mexico - a perennial that is resistant to seven major corn diseases and can grow at high elevations in marginal soils - can be crossed with modern annual corn varieties , with potential savings to farmers estimated at US $ 4.4-billion annually world wide .  
As regards the subprogramme on environmental law , institutions and policies , over 10 additional intergovernmental meetings were convened on issues relating to the protection of marine environment from land-based sources of pollution ; the Lusaka Agreement on cooperative enforcement operations directed at illegal trade in wild fauna and flora ; military activities and the environment ; and African Ministerial Conference on the Environment .  
The most complex processes now being experienced by developed societies , including new forms of racism , are a direct consequence of deregulated economic activities at the international level and of an inequitable and " wild " process of globalization .  
Countries are still a long way from attaining the objective of providing incentive measures to enhance local benefits from biodiversity , including establishing secure property or use rights ; providing education and relevant technologies ; providing compensation for damage to crops , livestock and other property damaged by wild animals / predators ; involving local communities in biodiversity management ; and providing endowment funds or other financial mechanisms that ensure predictable and secure sources of income , such as user fees , franchises , land-use taxes and bonds .  
The Lusaka Agreement is a cooperative regional arrangement to combat illegal trade in wild fauna and flora , aimed at reducing but ultimately eliminating illegal trade in wildlife species by establishing bodies to ensure effective criminal enforcement mechanisms of environmental law at both the national and regional level .  
Does anyone in this Hall believe that they might read on the Internet or in a newspaper in the foreseeable future that a South-East Asian country has requested or received a mandate from the Security Council to intervene , without the consent of the White House , in a civil conflict in Michigan that the White House has been unable to control , a conflict resulting from wild actions of the famous local militias ? 
Aware of the adverse environmental , economic , social and scientific repercussions of transnational organized criminal activities devoted to illicit trafficking in species of wild flora and fauna and to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
Aware also that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that the eradication of poverty in developing countries depends on the implementation of policies directed towards conservation and the sustainable use of biological resources ,  
Taking into account General Assembly resolution 55 / 25 of 15 November 2000 , in which it is stated that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime [ 3 ] constitutes an effective tool and the necessary legal framework for international cooperation in combating such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in endangered species of wild flora and fauna ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the bilateral , regional and multilateral legal instruments and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in species of wild flora and fauna and of illicit access to genetic resources , and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .

Taking into account General Assembly resolution 55 / 25 of 15 November 2000 , in which it is stated that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime [ 11 ] constitutes an effective tool and the necessary legal framework for international cooperation in combating such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna , in furtherance of the principles of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , within existing resources or drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna by organized criminal groups and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session ;  
The Government of Togo notes that , in order to conceal the serious errors committed by Amnesty International , the Commission , at the initiative of its Chairman , who has links to Amnesty International , attempted to confuse the issue by exceeding its mandate and taking up wild and libellous allegations which are so ridiculous as to make the report devoid of all credibility .  
In the face of the " Taiwan independence " forces that are running wild and an adverse international current against China in particular , we must pay close attention to making preparations for a military struggle , keep increasing our defense capacity , do our utmost to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland and to safeguard our state sovereignty and the interests of the people , and ensure that our armed forces are capable of fighting and winning when the motherland and the people need them .  
The fact is that only a leader of the oil fields who is stupid in the extreme would put the chief engineer and the chief geologist in a subordinate position .  Even during the " Cultural Revolution " when the extreme leftist line was wild and unrestrained , though " the stinky ninth category " were damned , " the stinky ninth category " could n't be allowed to lie fallow .  
Despite Li Hongzhi 's wild boasting and loud preaching about the series of absurd beliefs that he has created , facts speak louder than words .  In the light of dialectical materialism and historical materialism , his reactionary and decadent nature is abundantly clear .  
In particular , after a three-year , large-scale production campaign , the barren mountains and wild hills were turned into the " fertile lower Chang Jiang valley of northern Shaanxi , " an achievement that won commendations and awards from Chairman Mao and the party Central Committee and helped establish a glorious banner for the entire army .  
" It has always been my dream to wear the green military uniform .  I want to fly a fighter plane and take to the wild blue yonder .  
Meanwhile , they are also deeply perplexed by numerous problems like the foundation of state regimes being fragile , the religious forces being powerful which gives rise to political and social disunity and complicated peripheral environments , the three evil forces running wild , the phenomena of smuggling , drug trafficking , arms trade , and so on being serious , and so on .  
It is quite unreasonable for Japan to make wild comments about China 's normal national defense construction in an official publication such as its " Defense White Paper , " and this does not help to promote mutual understanding and trust between the two countries in the military security field .  
The degree of wild celebration and emotional reactions by the Chinese both at home and abroad to Beijing 's successful bid as seen on television and in news photos over the past several days is no less than those several major events since the founding of the People 's Republic , say , the successful explosion of the atomic and hydrogen bombs , the launch of a satellite into space , and China winning the first Olympic medal .  
China 's negotiations with various countries on its WTO accession are raging on like wild fires .  As far as China is concerned , to be able to join the WTO naturally would be like winning a trade war , but the problem today is the arduous tasks the country will be facing after its WTO accession .  In particular , the people have not yet truly linked the WTO to their future livelihood , and most are underestimating the profound changes in the future .

repeatedly talked nonsense at international occasions ; made malicious and entirely groundless accusations against the policy of the Chinese Government towards Tibet ; and wantonly spread such rumors as that " the human rights situation in Tibet is deteriorating , " " the Tibetan culture has become extinct , " and " there is no religious freedom in Tibet , " thus turning himself into a " master of wild lies . "  
Since the " networked national import declaration form verification system " was introduced by the customs departments , the foreign exchange administration departments , and the banks on 1 January 1999 , banks have begun paying foreign exchange to the enterprises producing customs declaration forms for foreign exchange settlement only after verifying the original accounts via this networked system , and this has immediately rendered ineffective the trick of cheating in foreign exchange with forged documents and has quickly checked a wild wave of foreign exchange cheating .  
Some foreign missionaries directly served colonial expansion , took part in selling opium , gathered intelligence , encouraged and participated in military aggression , seized economic gains , took part in plotting to force the government to sign unequal treaties , relied on the special privileges provided by unequal treaties , ran wild in the countryside , bullied and humiliated the people , and stirred up the opposition of the people .  
23 .  Article 27 shall be changed to Article 37 and amended as : " The state shall give special protection to rare and endangered aquatic wild animals , such as the Chinese river dolphin , to prevent them from becoming extinct .  
Domestic financial laxity and economic policy distortions were common factors in Asia . The wild swings of fast-flowing and highly-leveraged speculative capital in narrower emerging markets led to strong overshoots which were highly destabilising and severely eroded investor and consumer confidence .  
" There have still been wild stories flying around in the international media that Hong Kong 's economic autonomy has been greatly eroded , that the Beijing Government is interfering in Hong Kong 's administration , that Hong Kong is the base of diversion for the PLA to smuggle controlled items into China and that Chinese owned firms in Hong Kong escape prosecution for gross criminal acts .  
To wild dolphins , human is the biggest threat to them apart from shark , its main predator .  Thousands of dolphins die everyday in fishing nets around the world .  What 's more , the seriously polluted environment makes dolphins increasingly vulnerable .  In view of that , many scientists , naturalists and marine biologists devote their lifetime to study dolphins , their mode of communication , foraging and social behaviors so as to preserve these graceful and extraordinary creatures .  
His lips were purple from the cold , his face bloodless , but his eyes shone with a fanatical ecstasy . At last the owner recognized the wild man before him as the person who ten days before had cared so much about the red glazed bottle .  
( The left over sauce can be stored in a jar for future use . ) Ingredients : 1 whole duck ( or chicken ) green onions2 dried plums ginger1 / 2 1b Suchow plums star anise2 / 3 cup soy sauce wild pepper1 / 3 cup wine licorice2 tsp sugar preserved plums  
Included among these are numerous water fowl varieties such as wild geese , ducks and gulls . Originating from their summer nesting grounds in Japan , Manchuria , Siberia and the plateau region of Mongolia , they fly southward making Taiwan one of their chief wintering and resting stops . Those that take brief respite here continue on to destinations further to the south like the Philippines , Indonesia and sometimes fly as far south as the southern hemispheric lands of Australia and New Zealand .  
During the Japanese occupation , the Japanese army surveyed the island 's mountain roads , but many of them were already long overgrown with brambles and wild grass . In addition , the paths used by the aboriginals on their hunts were not suitable for climbers , especially with the primitive equipment available to them at the time . As a result , climbing was a matter of going step by step through dense forests , and up unknown ridges , so most climbers limited themselves to familiar mountains like Yushan and Hsuehshan .  
In order more effectively to close off illegal channels for the entry into Taiwan of chameleons , wa-wa-yu ( Chinese salamanders ) , and other wild animals from mainland China , the Council of Agriculture in the Executive Yuan has decided that all wild animals brought into the country by travelers will be reported to the Japan chapter of the international Special Commission for Investigating Trade in Wild Plants and Animals , which in turn will notify the countries of export so that the exporters involved may be strictly apprehended .  
From the green-house effect , global climatic change , acid rain , the hole in the ozone layer , destruction of the rain forests , conservation of animal and plant species in the wild , to desertification and the shrinkage of marine mammals , all of this was very little discussed and paid scant attention .  
But if in the long term the good quality of cultivated fruits is to be guaranteed , then they will still have to rely on the occasional improvement from wild varieties . It is thus that the bat remains an animal of crucial importance for the fruit harvest of Southeast Asia . Eating 3,000 insects an evening : On average , 70 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the tropical rain forests , which are also home to 90 percent of the world 's animal and vegetable species .  
Thus in the spring they turned the soil and planted seeds ; when the summer rainy season came , that was the time to allow the little creatures of the wild to be born and mature , and anyway it being dangerous to go deep into the mountains in the rainy season , people held off on hunting .  
The memoir 's depiction of the events of the Cultural Revolution , however , does convince a reader that the deliberate selfishness of leaders , combined with the wrong political system , allowed the evil and selfish in people to run wild . Only people of excellent character could lend a helping hand or show a little gentleness .  
" It has passed from the youthful stage of development into the mature period , and now artificial factors are pushing it towards premature old age , " says Lin Yung-teh , explaining that even in the early period after Cheng Cheng-kung arrived in Taiwan , the clearing of land for farming , the quarrying and mining and the steps taken to control the wild rivers quickly began to affect the supply of silt downstream ; however , the potential for creating environmental disasters was very limited compared with today 's development .  
In general , there was fear of the sea as expressed in the old poem , " The sky is so black , the waves so rough ; papa has gone fishing , but why has n't he come back yet ? Watching the wild wind and pounding waves makes me anxious . " Today , backed by technology , people have a spirit that says , " I 'm not afraid of the white-capped waves ; hold onto the rudder , and full speed ahead ! " With this spirit they develop the tidal land .  
The price of falconry : If you want the hawks to have glossy and healthy-looking plumage , be vigorous and formidable , fly high , and aim sure , as they do in the wild , it takes a lot of time and effort . Given modern lifestyles , it 's impossible for most people to find the patience or time to take care of the " troublesome , " tempestuous animals from morning to night .  
In 1989 the Wildlife Conservation Law was passed . Besides being concerned about Taiwan 's image , the Council of Agriculture , which is responsible for ecological preservation work , is even more worried that the mountains are being scarred by ever-larger development projects , which are destroying the habitat of wild animals . It is feared that this destruction of habitat , combined with the Chinese belief that monkey brain is especially fortifying in the winter , will make the Formosan Rock Monkey an endangered species .  
A bird in the hand : This may be the case , but in looking at current efforts to breed wild animals in captivity , the Council of Agriculture takes a more practical tack , asking scholars to gather data widely and hoping they will refer to the experimental models used by foreign studies of primates . The council is also drawing up guidelines for the breeding of protected wild animal species . At appropriate times it will provide human-bred monkeys to be used by research units . "  
This is why many people take the view that just at the basic spirit behind the children 's welfare law is that children have self-esteem and need to be respected by adults , wild animals involved in the workings of human society also need people to fight for their most basic right " not to be subjected to mental terror or physical abuse , " in the same way that disadvantaged groups in society are protected .  
Professor Hsia Liang-chou of the Pingtung Polytechnic Institute , who has studied animal welfare in depth , explains that animal welfare is concerned not only for wild animals ; the hope is that people will understand that it is not true that any animal " can be used for medical experiments in laboratories , so it 's all right to butcher them any way one pleases ; " and that one should also consider the feelings , moods , and physical responses of the domestic fowl and animals which supply human beings with rich protein .  
But the old trails run deep into the furthest recesses of the mountain ranges , and were often cut along hunting trails and the tracks worn by wild animals , so that they are difficult for most people to reach , and with little in the way of historical records , searching them out is an extremely difficult task .  
At that time , two Peipo women discovered by chance that when dried , the wild rushes from the wetlands where the Ta-an River flows into the sea are extremely tough and flexible and highly resistant to splitting , making them a very suitable material for making everyday utensils .  
Han Chinese migrants to Taiwan who tried these mats were all enthusiastic about them , so many women started making them . The addition of hand-woven patterns started a real fashion for the mats , making them a much-sought-after commodity , and high officials and rich folk going to the capital also looked on " dragon and phoenix mats " as ideal gifts to present to superiors . The rushes began to be specially cultivated instead of just being cut from the wild .  
From these everyday natural ingredients he completes a work of art . The hues of the glaze are restrained , serene and firm ; they are the colors of Lungteng Village , colors whose power pours forth from the inside , reflecting its master 's wild head of hair and spirited eyes . Earth and man draw near to each other !  
Thus far nearly NT $ 100 million has been invested in efforts by more than a dozen agencies to breed the species , which exists in the wild only in the upstream portion of the Tachia River . Sadly , not only have its numbers not increased , none of the seven people who have earned PhDs or MAs through the breeding program hold out very optimistic hopes for the fate of the brook masu salmon .  
Of course , if the targets for expansion of the wild salmon population are reached , there are regulations governing the raising of animals which , strictly applied , should prevent artificially propagated animals from getting mixed into the species in the wild . Of course then it would be fine to take a few samples from nature for research into artificial propagation .  
The year before last , Wong Ka Kue , lead singer of the Hong Kong pop group Beyond , fell from the stage while performing in Japan and thereafter remained in a coma , diagnosed as brain dead . One of the group 's fans went to seek a divination at Wong Tai Sin Temple , and got the answer : " A wild wind swept through the eastern garden last night / Tearing out all the flowers / But fortunately the gardener rose early / And replanted their roots to restore them to life . "  
But Chinese herbal pharmacists distinguish between this drained gall and the gall taken from wild bears , which they call " true gall . " Drained gall , they say , lacks three active medicinal ingredients , and they have indeed shown that it is not as effective as true gall . But because it is only a tenth as expensive , consumers and pharmacies alike are gradually taking to using it for chronic illnesses .  
But today , when there is a greater emphasis on morality and humane treatment of other living beings , many countries are hard at work creating animal protection laws in the hope that in addition to wild animals , the pets with whom people have ever closer relationships , livestock and other animals that serve economic functions can also have legal protection . Humans will never stop eating and using animals , but some of the pain and hardship can be eliminated from how they use them . Such laws could also prevent unnecessary abuse .  
In recent years , wild animals raised in captivity have been given more living space and more natural surroundings . Still , says Marcus Phipps of TRAFFIC , there are still some extremist animal rights groups overseas who wish to close all zoos and sea-world theme parks , with the goal of returning the animals to their natural habitats .  
With many of Taiwan 's wild animals having become " disadvantaged groups " or having even been driven to the verge of extinction by pressure from human development , it became a matter of necessity to pass the Wildlife Conservation Law to protect endemic and rare species . But at the same time , previously unknown species of tree frogs , shrews , bats , spiders and many other animals which , though unfamiliar , enrich the list of Taiwan 's endemic species , have recently been " discovered " in the wild .  
Whether in terms of their right to exist or their value to the ecosystem , an elephant and an ant are equal . From an evolutionary perspective , every wild species alive on Earth today is a repository of genes which have passed the test of natural selection . Only if " genetic diversity " is maintained can these genes come into play to respond to sudden changes in the environment .  
The Formosan landlocked salmon was the main reason for the establishment of Shei-Pa National Park ; the Formosan clouded leopard was fielded by the newly formed Green Party as its presidential candidate ; and NT $ 200 million has been spent on the rehabilitation of the Formosan sika deer . But by the ecological definition , because these three species ' wild populations are so small that they can no longer reproduce healthily , in effect they are already extinct .  
Of course , reintroducing a species to the wild is very different from the artificial breeding performed in professional animal husbandry . In an artificial wild habitat , the deer must be gradually paired up and monitored . They must adapt to the wild setting and be tested by the powers of nature . The process takes a lot of time , and repopulation work is not so simple as artificial breeding .  
It is the dangers posed to juvenile deer by wild dogs that causes concern . Nevertheless , today with human footsteps covering every stretch of the land , it is impossible to let the deer go completely wild . Not wanting to put all their eggs in one basket , project personnel hope to select repopulation locales in northern , eastern and southern Taiwan . Since they have been operating in Kenting ( in the south ) for 12 years now , Yangming-shan National Park ( in the north ) is being considered as the second locale .  
Thirty years ago , an American director and cinematographer named Morton Heilig , inspired by 3-D films , had the " wild idea " of developing a " total illusion of reality " which would encompass sight , smell , motion , and sound . He declared that audiences would enjoy complete and realistic sensory stimulation .  
Up above , amid the grey , misty emptiness , the birds were the only discernable flecks of color . Amid this triple-layered scene of swans at the lake , there were also thousands of sea gulls swoop ing and diving overhead , wild geese flying in orderly formation , mandarin ducks swimming in pairs , wild ducks quacking , and even rare red-crowned cranes prancing elegantly on the beach .  
North-South cooperation But what of mainland China , the real homeland of the mihoutao ? Having woken up to the fact that what had been considered a very ordinary wild fruit actually has an export earnings potential far beyond what anyone could have imagined years ago , in recent years the mainland has started making strenuous efforts to make up lost ground by setting up research establishments and commencing commercial cultivation .  
Our ancient ancestors knew only too well how active and vital love can be at its most primitive , so it is hardly surprising if they regarded it as a raging flood or wild beast , and tried to " preserve Heaven 's order by eliminating human desire . "  
But associate professor Wang Li-chih of National Taiwan University 's forestry department is not worried that introduced rhododendrons will become dominant species and squeeze out other plants . The hybrid rhododendron cultivars , in which particular features are developed for commercial purposes , actually have weaker constitutions than naturally occurring varieties , and rhododendrons generally choose land " abandoned " by other species : on fertile ground , rhododendron can not necessarily compete with other plants in the wild .  
Over the last few years , Taiwan 's con-servation movement has risen to the level where there is discussion and debate on the merits of animal welfare . The people of Taiwan have been scolded for consuming wild animals , and the hunters among the indigenous tribes on the island , who are the direct source of these animals , have been labeled " wildlife terminators . "  
Here in Taiwan , however , under the umbrella of the Wildlife Conservation Law , any duck hunting can only be done on the sly . But people still have a deep sense that other countries must be making a better job of things . At a " Kuantu Nature Reserve Symposium " held late last year , a wetlands expert reported how happily wild ducks and humans get along in Japan .  
In contrast with today , when wild ducks live on river beds choked with stinking organic chemicals and strewn with styrofoam and other plastics , in written records from the past the ducks suck up red algae , delve beneath green lotus leaves , wash themselves with dew and live among clouds and mists .  
After cold fronts pass through , however , bird associations are always telling bird watchers to rush off to the seashore and mouths of rivers . If their luck is good , they may be able to see wild geese blown off course by the rough weather .  
One way , reveals a veterinarian , is that many people whose pets become seriously ill just abandon them at the animal hospital , never returning to pick them up . There is no system in place in Taiwan to take in stray animals . Given operational constraints on a hospital , the only thing a vet can do is to set these unhealthy animals free in the wild . But this turns the problem from being an implicitly contractual one ( between owner and vet ) , or personal moral one , into one foisted on society .  
In recent years organically grown vegetables have become increasingly popular . " Wild " veggies , grown without depending on man-made fertilizers and not using pesticides , fit right in with this trend . Add to this the common belief that bitter tasting foods have medicinal value , and wild vegetables have become a new favorite for health-minded modern people .  
On another front , because Taiwan is poised to enter the World Trade Organization , Taiwan agriculture must face competition from imported agricultural products . Cheng Shu-hsing , an assistant in the AIS horticulture lab and a specialist in wild vegetables , explains : " We are encouraging localities to develop specialized agricultural products in small volumes but greatly diversified varieties . Although production volume is low , by diversifying and growing unusual crops , farmers will better their chances of surviving WTO admission and soften its overall impact on agriculture here . "  
Seeing that many Han Chinese appear to be so concerned about surveying and recording aboriginal culture , Wu has , over the past two years , begun trying to collate and systematize aboriginal culinary culture . She has already identified and recorded more than 100 varieties of wild edible plants . The most able to " eat bitterness " Wu notes that most wild vegetables are bitter .  
Recently natural wild plants have become popular foods in Taiwan , and aboriginal edible plants have become well-known in the process . However , edible plants account for only one-quarter of the plants used in daily life in Taniao village . Besides the necessities ( food , shelter , clothing ) , plants are essential materials for a huge number of other uses-medicine , landmarks , all kinds of tools used for outdoor work , rope , packaging , sandpaper , and cloth .  
Entering the museum is as dazzling as discovering King Solomon 's treasure house : Here there is a giant painting , marble sculpture , player piano , or rare violin , while over there is a suit of armor , a cannon , a terra cotta statue , an image of the Buddha , or a stuffed wild animal . . . . You never get tired of the place .  
But in natural forests , every creature has its natural enemies , and the insect fungus Beauveria bassiana and parasitic flies are ready and waiting for M . basalis pryeri . Furthermore , in the wild the inchworms prefer trees over two meters tall , and by the time trees have reached this size they are strong enough for a few caterpillars not to pose them any threat .  
These included " fish souls , " made from the lips cut from live sturgeon ; " Xi Shi 's bosom , " made with white fat from pufferfish bellies and named after a famous beauty ; and the " gold soup and jade slices " served by Mrs . Song outside Qiantang Gate , which comprised a thick wild rice stem soup and sliced raw common carp and crucian carp .  
Once a week we worked on a specific topic assigned by Marian . We did role playing ( bought and sold stocks , for example ) , prepared a newspaper column , visited a local junior college , and picked wild strawberries . We even carried out a mock American-style election by printing out election ballots . Marian brought her shower curtain from home to set up a voting booth in the classroom .  
" A child deciding to become a monk or nun is no easy matter , " says Abbot Wei-chueh . Children are like blank slates and can easily be tarnished if exposed to filth . It is best that they wait until they have graduated from junior high , he argues . If they 're not wild , and their hearts and minds are pure , they can then talk about joining a monastery .  
In the center of one of the exhibition rooms , the NPM has laid out a realistic picture of the life of the literati , based on a portrayal in an anonymous Song painting . The main character sits alone in front of a painted screen depicting wild and domestic fowl . To one side , a servant pours tea from a white porcelain pot ; on a table are two or three dishes of fruit and snacks . In front of the scholar stands a basket of classically arranged flowers .  
The story is much the same when it comes to birds . Surveys of foreign starlings and mynas , also by TESRI , identified 13 non-native members of the family Sturnidae living wild in Taiwan , mainly escaped or released pets and their offspring . " White-vented mynas and common mynas have been recorded in over a third of Taiwan 's 361 urban townships , rural townships and city districts , " says a survey report by Lin Ruey-shing of TESRI .  
For true flower lovers , the shy orchids of the wild are just as precious as the oversized local or exotic orchids grown in private gardens .  
But with a combination of superb cinematography , fine musical scores , and gorgeous stars in a single package , something clicks . The Korean shows appeal most to viewers who already have their own share of life experiences , enabling them to watch what might be their own stories , retold onscreen before them , rendered beautiful and poetic , with all of life 's wild storms , dreams , and regrets .  
" Independent , close to ordinary people 's hearts , vital , spring-flowering , sublimely pure and noble . " Students involved in the student movement of the late 1980s created a huge wild lily modeled on the Statue of Liberty , to symbolize the spirit of the Taiwanese student movement .  
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) , with over 170 member states , places wild animals into one of four categories depending upon the size of their surviving populations and how endangered the species may be . Various controls and limitations on import , export , and trade are then imposed for the various categories . Protected animals may only be imported under certain conditions , such as for educational purposes or medical treatment , but not for profit .  
In April , when the tung tree blossoms bloom , Taumi is a sea of snow white . In May , pink wild peonies crop up along the mountain trails . In June , wild ginger lilies in the western part of the community begin to give off a sweet fragrance . August , meanwhile , is when the Nakai podocarp tree - " the official tree of Taumi neighborhood " and a species unique to Taiwan-begins to fruit , presenting a remarkable picture of mixed red and green seeds and seed receptacles .  
In fact , the Council of Agriculture normally forbids the artificial breeding and sale of protected species , for fear that inbreeding will damage the wild gene pool . But with the resurgence of dengue fever , and with people 's enthusiasm for repopulating Taiwan 's rivers with the indigenous paradise fish , conservation agencies merely suggest that breeders should enlarge their sources of genetic material , to avoid narrowing the fishes ' gene pool .  
The Taiwan Mushroom Museum also contains various other zones : the " Taiwanese wild mushroom ecology zone , " the " Taiwanese poisonous mushroom ecology zone , " " the mushrooms ' back garden , " " the microscopic world of fungi , " " the mushrooms ' homeland , " " mushrooms and health , " " the history of edible mushrooms , " and a computer and audiovisual room , to provide a comprehensive and diverse introduction to mushrooms ' many different faces .  
Because of Taiwan 's unique soil and climatic conditions , the island is extraordinarily rich in wild fungi . To date over 5300 mushroom species have been recorded here . In terms of global distribution , the species of fungi found in Taiwan can be divided into those that are found worldwide , those found in the northern hemisphere , those found in tropical and subtropical regions , those found in temperate and alpine regions , and those that are unique to Taiwan .  
The Qing dynasty term for Aboriginal peoples was fan [ �g f ] , which originally meant tracks left by the passing of a wild beast [ and is generally translated into English as " barbarian " ] . The depictions of Aborigines in Qing dynasty documents as long-haired brutes little different from animals reflected the Chinese understanding of aborigines as barbaric and backward .  
The earliest tea in Taiwan was wild tea growing in the mountains around Puli , Nantou County . A small number of Aborigines also cultivated tea for medicinal purposes , but because under theories of Chinese medicine it was considered " cold , " it was not deemed suitable as a casual drink . Large-scale cultivation of tea began only with the arrival in Taiwan of immigrants from Anxi ( Fujian ) during the Qing Dynasty .  
The three major gods have thousands of incarnations . For instance Vishnu can appear as fish , wild boar , dwarf , holy turtle and so forth , and Vishnu 's wife-Durga the " inaccessible " - alike has multiple forms and godly powers : Devi , Parvati , Uma , and Kali are among her beautiful incarnations .  
In reality , neglected sites need not be publicly owned spaces , and they need not be limited to separate and distinct buildings . Idle spaces can be found everywhere . Their scope includes a single empty building , a sidewalk , a row of houses , or an abandoned or wild piece of land . " So long as spaces are n't managed well and do n't function well , then public and private spaces can both be included , " says Lin Po-nian , publisher of Space Magazine .  
Just after finishing his studies and completing his military service in 1985 , Hsu competed in a global trek around the globe sponsored by a local daily newspaper , the Independence Evening Post . After circling the globe , Hsu settled into the stable life of a salaryman . However , this adventurous spirit , who feels that sleeping in the wild is more comfortable than sleeping in a bed , seemed destined to return to the mountains , to the unpopulated wilds , and to the swift currents of the sea .  
An ancient wild relative of corn from Mexico - a perennial that is resistant to seven major corn diseases and can grow at high elevations in marginal soils - can be crossed with modern annual corn varieties , with potential savings to farmers estimated at US $ 4.4-billion annually world wide .  
As regards the subprogramme on environmental law , institutions and policies , over 10 additional intergovernmental meetings were convened on issues relating to the protection of marine environment from land-based sources of pollution ; the Lusaka Agreement on cooperative enforcement operations directed at illegal trade in wild fauna and flora ; military activities and the environment ; and African Ministerial Conference on the Environment .  
The most complex processes now being experienced by developed societies , including new forms of racism , are a direct consequence of deregulated economic activities at the international level and of an inequitable and " wild " process of globalization .  
Countries are still a long way from attaining the objective of providing incentive measures to enhance local benefits from biodiversity , including establishing secure property or use rights ; providing education and relevant technologies ; providing compensation for damage to crops , livestock and other property damaged by wild animals / predators ; involving local communities in biodiversity management ; and providing endowment funds or other financial mechanisms that ensure predictable and secure sources of income , such as user fees , franchises , land-use taxes and bonds .  
The Lusaka Agreement is a cooperative regional arrangement to combat illegal trade in wild fauna and flora , aimed at reducing but ultimately eliminating illegal trade in wildlife species by establishing bodies to ensure effective criminal enforcement mechanisms of environmental law at both the national and regional level .  
Does anyone in this Hall believe that they might read on the Internet or in a newspaper in the foreseeable future that a South-East Asian country has requested or received a mandate from the Security Council to intervene , without the consent of the White House , in a civil conflict in Michigan that the White House has been unable to control , a conflict resulting from wild actions of the famous local militias ? 
Aware of the adverse environmental , economic , social and scientific repercussions of transnational organized criminal activities devoted to illicit trafficking in species of wild flora and fauna and to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
Aware also that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that the eradication of poverty in developing countries depends on the implementation of policies directed towards conservation and the sustainable use of biological resources ,  
Taking into account General Assembly resolution 55 / 25 of 15 November 2000 , in which it is stated that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime [ 3 ] constitutes an effective tool and the necessary legal framework for international cooperation in combating such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in endangered species of wild flora and fauna ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the bilateral , regional and multilateral legal instruments and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in species of wild flora and fauna and of illicit access to genetic resources , and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .
