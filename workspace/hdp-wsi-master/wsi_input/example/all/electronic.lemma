Based on the urban planning and the specific context of the city , Beijing will in the coming years focus on the development of small and medium-sized , non-polluting , technology / knowledge-intensive and environment-friendly enterprises , in particular , modern manufacturing enterprises equipped with optical-machinery / electronic integration .  It also hopes to train a number of high level " blue-collar skilled workers . "  
Lu Xinshe said the State has incorporated the system of geological disaster forewarning and forecast and contingency command , the national monitoring system of farmland protection , and the national safety assurance system of mineral resources into the three major network systems that are to be completed in the coming four years of building electronic administration for land and resources .  
Guangdong 's electronic industry has realized the strategic shift " from a domestic sales focus to an overseas sales focus " , and product exports increased swiftly .  In 1995 , 7.325-million telephones , 3.19-million TV sets , 10.65-million radio tape recorders , and nearly 3-million sets of hi-fi equipment were exported .  The export volume accounted for 50% - 90% of the total output respectively and the export deliveries have ranked first in China for many years running .  
The areas in which Liaoning utilizes foreign investment have been expanded from medium and small-sized processing projects to the four pillar industries for old industrial base transformation purposes : the petrochemical industry , the metallurgical industry , the mechanical industry , the electronic industry , etc . and such industries as agriculture , real estate , infrastructure , energy , finance , etc .  
It is known that major Indian exports to China are aquatic products , iron sand , and cotton yarn , while major imports from China are organic chemical products , electronic products , coal , and cotton thread .  The volume of bilateral trade between China and India for 1999 totaled about $ 2-billion .  
In the fields of electronic information , new materials , biological engineering , integration of light , machines , and electricity [ guang ji dian yi ti hua , 0342-2623-7193-0001-7555-0553 ] , new energy sources , and environmental protection , the high-tech zones are more and more becoming important bases for the development of China 's high-tech industries and have played a active role in promoting industrial restructuring and in leading forward sustained economic development .  
Along with the popularization and application of computer networks , the operation between different customs and between customs and relevant departments has been integrated into one .  So , customs and departments may exchange information through electronic records and may simultaneously read real information .  In this way , unlawful activities of cheating with false certificates will immediately be exposed .  
On the one hand , hostile forces in the West are still bent on " Westernizing " and " dividing " us and they try their utmost to step up ideological and cultural infiltration through a multitude of channels .  They publicize capitalist values in the large volumes of imported publications , film and television products , electronic games , computer software , and other spiritual and cultural products in an effort to compete with us for the younger generation .  
It can be anticipated that in a period to come , the huge demand of the Western Region for building materials , engineering machinery , industrial equipment , electronic products and other supplies will greatly stimulate the production of relevant industries and make a large number of enterprises free themselves from their current situation of operating under capacity .  
The electronic business is to bring electronic technology to the overall trade activities , and has the characteristics of low operational costs , a wide spread of electronic service subscribers , no limit on time and space , and direct interaction and exchange between electronic service providers and subscribers .  In addition , the capacity to make warehouses , goods shelves , and stores virtual has reduced the intermediate links , which in turn greatly reduces trade cost and trade cycle .  
Third , to have the right of contributing to industrial development .  As the technical and safety standards are formulated by ourselves , they will contribute to the industrial development of the broadcast and television network , pager , cellular phone , electronic notebook , computer , public screen , and household electrical appliances , among other things .  
At the drilling ground this correspondent saw professional support team members carry out emergency repair work on telecommunication optical fiber cables that had been destroyed by the " enemy , " and use modern telecommunication equipment , such as maritime-type portable satellite telephones and VSAT small-sized satellite ground stations , under electronic jamming condition , to serve the purpose of war-time mobile telecommunication support .  
In deciding on a strategic goal , we should try to meet our national security needs and comply with at once the needs of our national economic development and electronic information industry development and the needs of increasingly fierce competition on the domestic and international markets .  
Instructions , requirements , and working plans from superiors are transmitted through computers , entrusted tasks and work arrangements for the lower levels are received and processed by computers , work implementation progress reports and proposals are also submitted through computer systems , and electronic mail is gradually replacing official documents and the telephone .  Network mechanisms have become an indispensable unified operating method for integrating the American military .  
Now , the battalion has built 12 modern teaching sites with coordinated equipment , such as electronic classrooms , rooms for simulation of animated images , and rooms for simulation of traffic rules .  In addition , it has incorporated use of three-dimensional animated pictures in teaching of basic theories , use of multi-media in explaining the technological structures , and use of simulation in practical application and operation .  As a result , the effectiveness of basic training of trainee soldiers has been improved by three times .  
For the last few days , some 340 party-member cadres in a certain regiment under the Beijing Military Region , which is currently engaged in electronic warfare exercises , have formed 20 " party-member squads for tackling key issues . "  Holding high the bright red party flag , they have practiced the requirement of the " three represents " with their exemplary deeds , thus forming a unique northern-frontier scene on the plateau training grounds .  
In line with the special features that reconnaissance means should be applied to the future operational space - - air , sea , and ground - - in all weathers , this battalion launched a massive scientific and technological trailblazing campaign .  In accordance with the ways and means suggested by the officers and men , it worked out more than 30 new methods of operation to defend modern air raids , high-tech reconnaissance , and electronic welfare ; and transformed 108 camouflage devices .  
During the continuous cooperation of an electronic warfare exercise , the naval , air , and marine troops staged coordinated exercises and training on dozens of scenarios , including such naval training scenarios as firing at surface targets , launching anti-submarine rockets , launching air defense missiles , and launching an underwater anti-submarine operation , a surface interception operation , a surface search operation , a surface rescue operation , or a surface fire support operation , and so on ; 
The computer-assisted evaluation system that was established at the combined tactical training base has enabled the mechanized division that participated in the exercise to know for sure where they stood in terms of combat effectiveness .  The modern computer-assisted evaluation system uses a tree-structured computer theory to carry out automated processing of electronic mail , positioning , and imagery information compiled from the direct-and-dispatch monitoring and control system ;  
On site , the writer saw a series of situations being sent to the directorial center in real time and promptly .  They included whether the commanders could rapidly and accurately make judgments on enemy situations , whether they could make scientific decisions , whether instructions could be sent to affiliated combat troops amid electronic interference , whether troops could trust deep into the enemy force and take up position as scheduled and according to instructions , and whether information on the enemy could be handled effectively .  
The general drilling site commander , with a sun-tanned face , declared : This combat drill indicates that , as a number of effective methods of scientific and technological troops training have been converted into combat strength , our army has made substantial progress in rapid barrier-breaking landing , operations to hit strongly built enemy targets , operations to counter precision strikes , camouflage of important military facilities , electronic countermeasure , and computer network protection .  
A new tactics research team organized by the detachment has thoroughly analyzed the carrier battle group with respect to its tactical organization , electronic early warning system , sonar system , fire control system , and the performances of its high-tech equipment ; drawn experience from the high-tech local war fought in recent years in the world , and followed the trends of tactical and technological development ; and made repeated comparisons between the enemy and ourselves in terms of technology and equipment , and found out each other 's strength and weakness .  
During recent years , they " sharpened " themselves with the tasks of dealing with the priorities and difficulties in information operations and electronic countermeasures , established more than 20 tasks to tackle difficult problems in science-technology military training , including acquiring new knowledge , mastering new equipment , studying new military tactics and training high-quality personnel .  Through taking specific measures such as fixing the training content , measures , levels , and steps , they institutionalized and standardized science-technology military training .  
The regiment successively built a comprehensive military tactics training ground which integrated the strategy of railway loading and unloading tactics , shooting with light weapons , and positional defense training , and a military officer training center with all functions , built a language teaching room and a simulation training room , introduced a simulation training system with electronic countermeasures and provided a good service guarantee and technical support for reforming the training methods and studying operational methods .  
During the exercise , this group army employed most of its new weapons , on the basis of a rational disposition and a flexible marshaling ; and by making a simultaneous use of technological means and tactical means and by integrating new and high technological means with traditional means , they successfully gave shape to a fairly complete electronic warfare system .  
As compared with the same period last year , among 14 major trades , metallurgical , petrochemical , machinery , electronic , light , textile , pharmaceutical , tobacco , and gold industries experienced increased profits .  Power industry continuously maintained a fairly high level of profit .  
Beyond controversy , electronic warfare , military deception , operation secrecy , and psychological warfare are the typical " soft " methods of attack .  And real object destruction is a goal of firepower warfare , in which adjusted firepower weapons are used to hit the enemy 's command posts , command control centers , intelligence centers , and other key places .  
Besides , it has taken into consideration that providing long distance logistic support is prone to air raids by the enemy and has used abandoned vehicles to set up fake car parks , fake oil refueling stations , fake rear commanding posts , fake medical centers , and used camouflage in the air to hide the real and show the fake .  It has developed , through exploration , various means and methods to " guard against precision attacks , electronic attacks , reconnaissance and monitoring so that the overall logistic protection capability has been remarkably increased " .  
In light of characteristics of a hi-tech war in future , the unit had decided to hold in an unfamiliar water area a training exercise centered on several highly difficult training topics , such as rapid camouflage on the sea , protecting itself against an enemy 's electronic jamming , countering an enemy 's hi-tech reconnaissance , and so on .  
On the one hand , when the Russian planes suddenly entered the defense zone , the aircraft carrier 's onboard could be subjected to electronic interference from the Russian fighters which made the target display indistinct ; on the other hand , personnel manning the radar could be overly negligent , overlook the suspicious target , did away with effective tracking and monitoring , which enabled the Russian planes to fly extremely low when coming near the aircraft carrier and entered the radar 's blind spot .  
Looking into the future , we can vaguely see a great blueprint of even greater grandeur : The Chinese Navy will be able to achieve a qualitative leap in its early warning , mobile , anti-submarine , air defense , electronic warfare , rapid response and other capabilities , and will be able to achieve a new improvement in its comprehensive combat capability under modern conditions .  
The mass troop trainings in science and technology are developing in breadth and depth , the research of key subjects like combined operation , electronic warfare , airstrike countermeasure , new " three hittings and three defenses , and so on have made new breakthroughs , the study of high-tech knowledge , cultivation of talented people , training in new equipment , and so on , have all acquired remarkable effects , thus the fighting capacity of troops being further improved .  
He said that , in line with the international trend and existing domestic precedent , using high-tech principles to mix electronic sound with natural sound could unite the opera house and concert hall into one .  That would mean building only an opera house and a Beijing Opera playhouse , or one cultural square with two structures , which would save much investment .  
- - US officials are not at all concerned about the missing Chinese pilot and the destroyed Chinese fighter , endlessly stressing instead : The EP-3 electronic reconnaisance plant is covered by US sovereignty , and the Chinese side can not send people to board the plane and still less carry out a search .  They also demand that China provide assistance for repairing the plane as soon as possible , so that the crew can fly back to base as soon as possible .  
It was reported that before the Chinese personnel entered the landed aircraft at Hainan airfield , many electronic equipment inside the aircraft had already been destroyed .  However , before the US surveillance aircraft bumped against and damaged the Chinese fighter plane and landed at the airfield on Hainan Island , the Chinese side had already intercepted the frequency and signals used by this US surveillance aircraft to communicate with its rear during the process .  Reportedly , these signals are very valuable .  
The United States has for many years kept conducting military reconnaissance activities along China 's southeast coastal areas , and US military planes have repeatedly appeared in the skies of China 's coastal areas and have even intruded into the line of China 's territorial waters for reconnaissance .  The US plane that bombed into and destroyed China 's fighter this time is a US military reconnaissance plane equipped with sophisticated electronic reconnaissance devices as well as military intelligence gathering professionals .  
The key reason is that the plane is equipped with some expensive and most advanced wide-band and fully digitized receivers instead of ordinary electronic surveillance equipment , and its all-frequency and all-band receivers are capable of intercepting or monitoring signals transmitted by the Chinese Communist forces through all frequencies .  
Some British intelligence experts believe that due to such an " unexpected windfall , " the Chinese Communists ' electronic experts will be able to learn about the US forces ' reconnaissance system , counter-reconnaissance system , confrontation system , as well as other relevant technologies in a more comprehensive and in-depth way , or at least be able to broaden their mind or accumulate advance understanding about some weapons after studying the most advanced reconnaissance equipment in modern times .  
Wang has conducted surveys of some joint venture enterprises in the coastal region of southern China , an area which is seen by many domestic and foreign companies as an excellent processing base , and as long as the design and standards for electronic products are provided , there are various ready-made associated facilities there , from raw materials and parts / components to assembly , etc .  
Then , Wang Wei disclosed his secret to me : " There are many electronic instruments on a plane .  I come here not for the purpose of looking for a stable job after I graduate , but to lay a foundation for my future flying career . "  
Wang Zhile surveyed some joint venture enterprises in southern China 's coastal area , which is regarded by many domestic and foreign corporations as the best processing base .  One only has to provide the designs and standards for electronic products , because all kinds of necessary factories , from raw materials , spare parts , to assembly , are already there .  
While performing the flying duty of tracking and monitoring the US military electronic reconnaissance plane this time , he displayed determination , courage , calmness , cool-headedness , heroism , and tenacity .  By sacrificing his life , he composed a glorious victorious song of patriotism and revolutionary heroism .  
Taking the " Pine Gap joint air defense research facility " electronic reconnaisance base as an example , this is located in a remote site in central Australia , well screened by trees , and equipped with large antennae ; it can receive signals from US satellites through infrared sensors , collect many signals from radar , radio , and telephone signals from Asia and the Middle East , and can also detect the great heat produced by ballistic missile launches in any place on the Eurasian land mass .  
and it is also feasible to cooperate with the electronic confrontation squad of our side to mock an SOS sent by the pilot of the enemy plane in such a way that the enemy can not distinguish whether the signal is genuine or fake , and once the enemy 's military strength is dispersed , our side can annihilate the enemy .  
While conducting a search operation , search and rescue teams may be shielded by a number of planes , including an early warning plane , an electronic jamming plane , an assault plane , and a fighter plane , and some warplanes conducting a search operation may also be armed with high-speed anti-radiation missiles in light of actual conditions so as to suppress an enemy surface-to-air missile base and guard against a sudden attack by the enemy .  
Our campaign commanders and command organs should not only learn how to operate a bank , a cannon , and other arms under their command , for this is far from sufficient , but should also learn about the principal arms of naval , air , and second artillery units and master the basic knowledge about an electronic confrontation , a networked offensive , a networked defensive operation , and other operations .  
On the battlefield of a combined operation , electronic confrontation is becoming increasingly intense , the degree of command control automation is growing higher and higher , and the battlefield situation is undergoing instantaneous changes ; and all these have constituted a severe challenge to the quality of commanding officers .  
The current forum - - " Next Generation Asia " - - devoted to discussions on such issues as corporate management , competition advantages , information infrastructure construction , and electronic commerce , will be conducive to improving the management level of enterprises in Asia , promoting the development of the Asia economy , and benefiting all the parties concerned in seeking business opportunities .  
At the ongoing Beijing International Week , the Great Wall Rocket Company is a very eye-catching exhibitor .  Visitors are amazed by the gigantic models of the advanced carrier rockets of the Long March series , electronic traffic maps , sensors , satellite positioning and navigation instruments , TV receivers that can receive high-resolution pictures via satellites , and other high-tech civilian products on display at the company 's booths .  
Since the beginning of the second half of 2000 , the economies of some APEC developed members have undergone major readjustments ; economic growth has remarkably slowed down ; the demand of the global information technology and electronic industry has been sluggish , and the financial market unstable ; export has begun to slow down ; and trade protectionism has raised its head .  These trends will bring about some uncertainties to APEC economic cooperation .  
Due to the continuous decline and notable shrink in the transactions of Taipei 's stock market in the previous week , the influence of the upcoming PLA military exercise on Dongshan Island , and the upcoming publication of the various industries ' business income in May , electronic shares did not perform well on 4 June , and Taipei 's stock market opened low and remained low .  Except for financial shares , which registered growth thanks to the support of specific funds , all shares declined .  
Besides , a belligerent will have to mount both a " soft " strike and a " hard " strike at the enemy 's most threatening and vulnerable points , in order to destroy with information weapons , the enemy 's vital electronic equipment , which seem virtually immune to an electromagnetic strike , and damage with non-information weapons , the enemy 's electronic information carriers , through a " hard " strike .  
The military branches of other NATO nations , at the same time as they are reforming and strengthening their geographic information assurance , also want to increase the number of equipment retrofit kits adaptable to the NAVSTAR GPS on their missiles , bombs , weapon-launching platforms , electronic surveillance and intelligence systems - - in accordance with the demands of United States military joint combat - - to heighten the global positioning and navigation level of various kinds of munitions .  
Meanwhile , a number of transportation projects were completed one after another , including the Dalian-Qinhuangdao railway , China 's first electrified coal-transporting railroad , and the Changyuan Dongming railroad bridge , the longest such bridge in Asia . The completion of a number of large cutting-edge scientific research projects which meet advanced international standards , such as the positive-negative electronic collider , heavy ion accelerator , and national radiation laboratory , has demonstrated China 's scientific and technological ( S &amp; T ) prowess .  
By guiding foreign investment toward infrastructural construction , the exploration of mineral resources , the development of tourist resources , the ecological environmental protection , the agricultural and livestock products processing , the transformation of existing production capacities , and to such scientific and technological projects as the development and manufacturing of new-type electronic components in its western region , China will provide a host of investment and trade opportunities for foreign investors , said Deng Zhan .  
In the current trend of staff reduction in the domestic electronic sector , all factors and all personnel from the grass-roots level upward at home and abroad , who generated poor economic benefits , were strictly examined by enterprise owners .  
The US military has also assisted the Army to establish an " electronic warfare battalion " in secret .  It has leased all the necessary electronic warfare equipment and delivered to the Army a set of mobile equipment , which is the most advanced equipment in service .  The US military plans to deliver five sets of such equipment to Taiwan .  
Many large-scale military exercises have shown the newest achievements that China 's military has obtained from the traditional " three attacks and three defenses " - - attacking tanks , planes , and airborne troops , and defending against nuclear , chemical , and biological attacks - - to the " new three attacks and three defenses " of attacking stealth aircraft , cruise missiles , and helicopter gun ships , and defending against precision strikes , electronic jamming , and reconnaissance and surveillance .  
The psychological and electronic warfare troops established recently by the PLA coordinated for the first time the operations of military reconnaissance satellites over the Taiwan Strait . The second stage was " combined forces of the navy , the army and the air force crossing the Strait and carrying out landing operations , " which mostly consisted of guided missile attacks and other methods .  This illustrates the fact that the manner adopted by the PLA to attack Taiwan has switched from one of a " sea-borne landing " to " airborne raids " and other varieties .  
At the same time , in line with the features of the establishment of external units , the base has provided the " Blue Army " with infantry , artillery , armored , engineering , chemical , communication , electronic confrontation , and helicopter troops - - which form a joint training command headquarters with the air force and the army aviation unit - - and has copied military drills and training conducted by powerful adversaries . 
Experts set the physical target as follows : Carry out physical study on the filters and scraping levels in the Tokamak Device ; promote improving and restricting technology of plasma under near-reactor core condition ; and develop plasma heating technology , electronic current driving technology , feeding technology , and plasma diagnostic and measure technology under reactor core plasma condition .  
Borrowing from the military region signal regiment 's achievements in the scientific and technical training of troops , the group army 's signal elements overcame the difficulty of insufficient amounts of equipment and materials , and scientifically conducted " three defenses " training in defending against enemy reconnaissance and surveillance , defending against enemy electronic jamming , and defending against an enemy 's precise attacks .  
The key part of the exercise is beach landing , which includes topics of anti-landing , air raids and anti-air raids , parachuting , electronic jamming and anti-jamming , satellite surveillance and tracking , blockading and anti-blockading , attacking with tactical and strategic missiles , hitting aircraft carriers , hitting invisible aircraft , hitting cruise missiles , hitting helicopters , anti-precision attacks , anti-surveillance and anti-monitoring , and so on .  
During the current military exercises underway at Dongshan island and the southeast coast , the special electronic countermeasures unit which has just been organized has for the first time been operating in coordination with military reconnaisance satellites ;  
This is specifically expressed in the following ways : The special electronic countermeasures unit which has just been organized is for the first time operating in the Taiwan strait in coordination with military satellite reconnaisance ;  
During the current military exercises underway at the Dongshan Island and the southeast coast , the special electronic countermeasures unit , which has just been organized , has for the first time been operating in coordination with military reconnaissance satellites in the Taiwan Strait ;  
Banking , financial and taxation , customs , scientific research , educational , and cultural and public health departments and all government organizations should use electronic and information technologies and communications networks to set up and improve high-efficiency , reliable , applicable management and social service information systems .  
Banking , financial and taxation , customs , scientific research , educational , and cultural and public health departments and all government organizations should use electronic and information technologies and communications networks to set up and improve high-efficiency , reliable , applicable management and social service information systems .  
The aircraft is equipped with advanced comprehensive navigation electronic systems and weapons ; it can cruise at supersonic speed , has stealth capability , is highly maneuverable , and possesses superior features in being able to find , fire at , and destroy an enemy without being detected itself ; it represents the orientation for future fighter development , and so its research and development have aroused attention in military circles the world over .  
US Army General ( Greg Hackett ) announced on 4 April that in the next 20 years the US Army will spend $ 38 billion on procuring 1,213 RAH-66 Comanche armed helicopters ; this is the world 's first helicopter of high intelligence capacity , fully digitized and electronic ; it has good stealth capability , advanced electronic equipment , and a high degree of automation , with strong ground attack capability and relatively strong aerial fighting capability ;  
It is necessary to pay close attention to the construction of recreational facilities for young people , resolutely ban electronic game rooms , singing and dancing parlors , and video show rooms which have a harmful impact on the growth of youngsters , and mete out more severe punishments to those who run such unhealthy undertakings , thus creating a benign social environment for the comprehensive implementation of quality education .  
Further , it has readjusted the national military strategy and military concepts ; stressed local wars under high-tech conditions and rapid response capability ; emphasized the task of strengthening the military through science and technology such as electronic warfare , information warfare , network warfare , and modern communication ;  
By exercising strict control , it is necessary to ban all illegal electronic game arcades that have seriously violated regulations and to further define the conditions that such arcades must meet , and greatly reduce the number of such arcades .  Efforts must be made to resolutely strengthen our supervision and ensure that all electronic game arcades are operating according to relevant laws and regulations .  
The department for foreign trade and economic affairs must earnestly carry out its works well in examining and approving applications from the processing industry to process electronic game equipment and its parts and accessories and overseeing the re-export of the processed equipment , parts , and accessories out of the country .  It must coordinate with the customs houses to crack down on illicit activities in smuggling electronic game equipment , parts and accessories .  
Moreover , since Taiwan bought advanced weapons from many countries and their quality , function , and operation procedures vary from country to country , the fire control system , electronic warfare system , and command control systems of the weapons are mostly uncoordinated or imperfect .  This has a direct bearing on the normal performance of the planes ' fighting function .  
In economic restructuring , there have been marked improvements in the aggregate control of some surplus and obsolete productive capacities and products , such as the textile , coal , metallurgical industries , and the electronic information industry is becoming a new impetus to economic growth .  
This reporter has learned from a relevant department today that a fire expert from the Public Security Ministry and an expert team composed of officers from the provincial and city public security organs and fire brigade , conducted a thorough investigation of the fire site , tested the evidence , and reached a consensus that the cause of the serious fire in the Shantou Guesthouse on 15 July was the overheated electronic vacuum flask in room 204 on the second floor , that burned the plastic part of the bottle and led to the serious fire .  
In order to raise the survival capability of missile weapons in actual war , Xu Guangfeng and his comrades-in-arm studied and developed a radar signal radiation simulator that can be used as an electronic interference source or as a chaff device to lure attack by enemy 's anti-radiation missiles .  It has effectively solved a major tactical difficulty for missile weaponry system and greatly raised the survival capability of this kind of weapon in time of war .  
The secret national defense budget for next fiscal year will total more than 58 billion yuan .  To strengthen their combat readiness in the electronic and communications arenas , the plans proposed by the armed forces include completion of an electronic counterattack shelter network and an online defense system .  Geared against Chicom 's active efforts to develop electromagnetic impulse attack , there will also be a " project to protect against electromagnetic impulse . "  
As a far as output value is concerned , the volume of the electronic and electrical machinery industry ranks first , with annual export volume at 1.54 trillion yuan , representing half of total foreign sales .  
Podrov , general manager of Russia Aeronautical and Astronautical Equipment Corporation , which is the manufacturer of Su-27 ' s electronic equipment , was attending an aviation exhibition in Zhuhai . Podrov said : The day before yesterday , I held talks with the relevant aviation and aerospace departments of China and learned that half of China 's Su-27 fighter planes purchased or imported several years ago are unable to conduct normal flight due to damaged electronic equipment on board .  
The Russian experts believed that China 's civil aviation strength and scientific and technological strength for national defense , including China 's ship management equipment , electronic products , and so on , are already among the most advanced in the world .  After visiting some academies of sciences and aircraft production plants in China , the Russian experts concluded that China has already attained the standard required for cooperating with Russia .  
During the July-September period , public security organs across the country , with close coordination of other departments , launched a campaign to tighten the management of places of entertainment and service .  They carried out a severe crackdown on prostitution , gambling , drug trafficking , and other social evils .  They also tightened the management of places where electronic games were available .  They have made contributions to improving the social environment and promoting a socialist spiritual civilization .  
Hubei will concentrate on the development of six major industries , including high-tech industries in " Wuhan - - China 's Optical Valley , " with electronic information industry at the core , modern manufacturing industries with automotive industry at the core , raw materials industries with iron and steel industry at the core , energy industries with hydropower generation at the core , modern agricultural industries with the production of green food at the core , and tertiary industries with tourism at the core .  
In his letter , Wu Bangguo said : Beginning from 2001 , the Three Gorges Project will enter the most arduous construction period .  The concrete pouring work will be more difficult than before .  In addition , the work of installing heavy metal components as well as mechanical and electronic equipment will enter a peak period .  
According to incomplete statistics , during the campaign , a total of over 530,000 law-enforcement and inspection personnel were sent to investigate over 120,000 electronic games centers and computer bars , over 100,000 sets of gambling machines and over 60,000 circuit cards were confiscated and destroyed , and most of illegal business and illegal businessmen were sternly punished .  As a result , the problem which the people are generally concerned about was solved .  
By 0002 , Pan Qing , a reporter , had filed the following report from the Road Traffic Control Center of the Traffic Patrol Police Unit of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau : Though it is late night , a hall of 250 square meters is still brightly lit , and some police officers on duty here are still concentrating on a super screen , which is formed by about 40 smaller screens and monitors each and every " electronic eye " located on major streets or key sites in the city .

Convinced that the establishment of a model law facilitating the use of electronic commerce that is acceptable to States with different legal , social and economic systems could contribute significantly to the development of harmonious international economic relations ,  
Public-sector ICT applications include distance learning and continuing professional development ; road traffic management ; disabled support services ; air-traffic control ; health-care networks ; electronic tendering for contracts ; and public administration applications .  ICT applications are increasing the efficiency of public services in areas such as automated or computer-assisted translation ; one stop shopping for government information ; applications designed to limit environmental degradation ; citizens and emergency support services ; and services to support inter-community meetings .  
It was said that it would be very important to direct such an effort towards the development of international norms and standards for commercial conduct in the field , with the intent of supporting trade through electronic media , and not have as a goal the establishment of a regulatory regime for service providers , or other rules which could create costs unacceptable for market applications of electronic data interchange ( EDI ) ( ibid . , para .  117 ) .  
However , one of the difficulties of undertaking work in the area of electronic signatures stemmed from the fact that , if the uniform rules to be prepared were to provide the level of guidance that might be required to implement the principles embodied in article 7 of the Model Law , they might have to deviate from a purely functional approach , and to address in some detail the manner in which specific techniques could perform the above-mentioned functions .  
In the context of the discussion of paragraph ( 3 ) , a question was raised as to whether the reference to keys of natural and legal persons provided sufficient guidance in situations where cryptographic keys were issued directly to electronic devices , or used by such devices , in the absence of direct human intervention .  
It was decided that the general definition of certification authority should be based on the text of paragraph ( 3 ) of draft article B . It was agreed that the reference to natural and legal persons should be complemented by a reference to electronic devices , which should be placed between square brackets , pending future consideration by the Working Group .  
Another proposal was that a definition should be based on the elements of a certificate contained in the note by the Secretariat , which referred to the certificate as being an electronic record that listed a public key together with the name of the certificate subscriber as the subject of the certificate , and confirmed that the prospective signer identified in the certificate held the corresponding private key ( A / CN . 9 / WG.IV / WP . 71 , para .  36 ) .  
While existing rules prepared by organizations such as the Comit maritime international ( CMI ) could provide detailed guidance on the use of electronic messages to create bills of lading , they could not provide a legal basis for such bills since the rules were voluntary .  
Difficult and painful reform lies ahead if Albania is to succeed in fostering political and social reconciliation , economic development , consolidation of a fully functioning and independent judiciary and electronic media , and the creation of active civil-society institutions .  
A further challenge to effective enforcement and regulatory procedures to counter money-laundering is posed by the growth of payment facilities , based on high technology , that enable global financial transactions to be made by coded electronic means .  
It was agreed that inter-agency coordination could be pursued by creating an interactive electronic mail network for information-sharing to serve as the medium for inter-agency contacts ; preparing an inventory of social programmes and projects ; conducting joint human resource training activities ; expanding to the rest of the region the system developed by CEFIR for observing the behaviour of social actors in integration ; and comparing the various work programmes in order to identify issues appropriate for inter-agency cooperation .  
The principal topics covered were the following : electromagnetic radiation , the reflective properties of various types of materials on the surface of the Earth , and elementary optics ; electronic imaging ; georeferencing of objects in the field , on maps and on satellite imagery ; and Earth resources and environmental satellites .  
In view of potential as well as proved advantages of the use of advanced technologies , including electronic publishing , the increased use of such technologies for the publishing process should be enhanced by the Secretariat and a general shift towards the various forms of electronic publishing should be intensified and due regard paid to cost recovery and access to such electronic products in developing countries .  
The Commission recognizes the value of the recommendations made by the experts , and stresses the specific needs of developing countries , especially LDCs , regarding access to international networks in general and to electronic commerce in particular ; the development of physical infrastructure and human resources , as well as the use of existing or foreseen low-cost solutions ( e.g . Internet , low earth orbit satellites ) , should be enhanced .  
Consultation and information exchange , including through the use of interactive electronic networks , among existing NCPCs and with other parts of the local or national EST support structure ( for example , information systems and sources related to ESTs , technical advisory and consultation services , marketing support and legal advice services , and institutions of research and development ) , are important .  
Since UNCTAD did not have the resources to handle all the legal issues relevant to international trade and trade-related services , it could focus on a number of priority areas such as assisting developing countries in the modernization of trade-related national legislation , organization of educational programmes , preparation of information handbooks on legal aspects of international trade , advising Governments on measures to overcome legal impediments to the use of EDI , disseminating information on legislative reforms on issues such as electronic commerce and trade-related services , and legal assistance to Trade Points .  
Given the fact that , on the one hand , legal rules were largely non-existent while existing rules were at times contradictory and , on the other hand , the use of electronic media had gained such overwhelming importance in international trade , it was clear that reliable and binding rules were badly needed .  
For some of its most active participants , this is an asset , since it will allow rapid development of international electronic trade flows with a minimum of legal , regulatory and fiscal obstacles .  
Further attention was drawn to the need to establish arrangements for special investigative techniques , such as electronic surveillance , undercover operations and controlled deliveries , as practical tools to penetrate criminal organizations .  
However , wider use of digital signatures requires adaptation in national legal frameworks so as to enable such technologies to achieve the intended objective of providing a truly reliable and trustworthy electronic environment .  
Reinforcing international dialogue in the appropriate multilateral and bilateral forums to achieve an adequate global regulatory framework for electronic commerce , in particular in data security , data protection , intellectual property rights , and taxation .  
It is for this reason that the logistic regression model was developed from , compared to and tested with the electronic claims for which the type of loss had been ascertained before being applied to the set of claims for which the type of loss was unknown .  
Since then , the international community had started to devote more attention to the main policy , regulatory , legal , economic and technical issues underlying electronic commerce .  
The potential use of diamond and DLC films in electronic circuits , where their high thermal conductivity and electrical insulation make them unique , as well as in cutting and grinding tool surfaces has led to increased commercial interest and activity .  
The secretariat noted that electronic commerce had become a major component of international trade ; the technology was well established and the remaining barriers to its use lay in institutional issues , in particular those of a regulatory and cultural nature .  
One of the key factors driving this dramatic growth in electronic commerce among the industrialized economies has been the achievement of a critical mass of online users .  
The meeting addressed the workshops logistic arrangements and its substantive content , including technical cooperation activities to be considered and proposed , and identified numerous issues of criminal procedure that the workshop could address , such as those relating to data storage , transaction and analysis , electronic communications , trans-border search and seizure , mutual legal assistance , human rights and safeguarding privacy rights .  
While welcoming the Departments efforts and noting its enormous advances in the electronic information field , his delegation believed it necessary to point out that , because of the manifold economic and financial problems faced by countries with economies in transition , the traditional mass media were still the principal sources of information there .  
It was noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
If , for those reasons , such specific form requirements were to remain outside the scope of the Uniform Rules , the additional benefit to be expected from using an enhanced electronic signature as opposed to a mere electronic signature might need to be further clarified , possibly in the context of draft article B . The Working Group agreed that discussion as to that issue might need to be reopened at a later stage . 
The Working Group agreed that a future draft of subparagraph ( b ) should reflect the changes discussed : notice should be given without undue delay ; the two standards of knew or ought to have known and is or might have been compromised should be included in square brackets as alternative texts ; and the words and could be used to create unauthorized enhanced electronic signatures should be deleted .  
It was pointed out , however , that the obligation to operate a CRL might be appropriate for high-value transactions and certificates ( i.e . , for those enhanced electronic signatures that were intended to produce legal effect ) but would be overly burdensome ( and contrary to existing practice ) if it were to be imposed with respect to all certificates ( including cheap certificates used in the context of significant numbers of digital signatures ) .  
The Commission noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
The specialized agencies should seek innovative ways of communicating ideas that reinforced democratic processes and spurred development initiatives ; utilizing communication networks , particularly radio and electronic networks , to increase public access to information and facilitate free and fair participation in decision-making processes ; and enhancing participation by people at the grass roots level , who were the hardest hit by poverty .  
At its sixth session , on 7 October 1998 , a working group on buildings and electronic systems was established as a standing body and replaced an informal group which had been appointed at the fourth session . 4 The composition of the working group and the terms of reference will be determined at the seventh session . 
Priority is being given , therefore , to establishing links with radio stations worldwide , which will enable instantaneous use of the Departments radio programmes , through the most effective delivery system available in each region or subregion , including short wave , satellite , digital audio , telephone feeds , electronic audio-file transfer and other Internet-based mechanisms .  
Missions , in response to ad hoc requests from Governments , on electronic data processing and development ; updating of main economic and social databases ; designing and conducting integrated household surveys ; and improving the existing systems of national accounts , related systems and classification requirements ; ( ii ) Group training .  
Non-recurrent publications on : studies on transport efficiency ( 2 ) ; global framework for electronic commerce and development ; legal guidelines on electronic commerce for trade points ( 2 ) ; regional and international institutional framework for trade points ; major developments in international trade law ; studies on human resources development issues in trade-supporting services ( 2 ) ; trade facilitation handbook ;  
Areas that have been identified as involving legal issues relevant to electronic commerce include data protection , taxation , customs duties , security and authentication , intellectual property rights , liability of Internet service providers , illegal and harmful content , Internet governance ( more specifically , domain names ) , electronic payments systems , and consumer protection .  
The main objective of the Model Law was to offer national legislators a set of internationally acceptable rules allowing a number of legal obstacles to be removed and a more secure legal environment created for electronic commerce .  
In this regard , it is instructive to note that the international organizations and public or private sector entities that have studied electronic commerce from a variety of perspectives have tended to focus on certain common elements that would be present in any favourable legal environment .  
However , it is possible to ( i ) take stock of recent trends relevant to this issue , ( ii ) identify some key issues requiring immediate international attention , and ( iii ) outline possible priority areas for future work on the relationship between electronic commerce , globalization and development .  
In making these recommendations , the Commission stressed the importance of analytical documentation in raising awareness among member States of the potential benefits and obstacles specific to the development dimension of electronic commerce and in deepening understanding of policy implications .  
Activities include coordination meetings and electronic discussions on the planning of cooperative activities and sharing of experience , support for subregional training courses , pilot projects on the application of telematics for development in sectors of public concern , and promotion of the African content of the World Wide Web for educational , scientific , social and cultural development .  
It is also keeping the U . S . marine units based in Okinawa , Japan , and the aircraft carrier Constellation , F-15 tactical fighters , B-52 strategic bombers and EA-6B electronic warfare aircraft based in its mainland on standby for rapid deployment in south Korea .  
It was noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
While it was generally agreed that significant progress had been made at those sessions in the understanding of the legal issues of electronic signatures , it was also felt that the Working Group had been faced with difficulties in the building of a consensus as to the legislative policy on which the uniform rules should be based .  
While it was generally agreed that significant progress had been made at those sessions in the understanding of the legal issues of electronic signatures , it was also felt that the Working Group had been faced with difficulties in the building of a consensus as to the legislative policy on which the uniform rules should be based .  
Since this was likely to prove particularly difficult at the international level and be of limited relevance to international commercial transactions , the additional benefit to be expected from using an enhanced electronic signature as opposed to a mere electronic signature might need to be clarified .  
Signature device means unique information , such as codes , algorithms , letters , numbers , private keys , or personal identification numbers ( PINS ) , or a uniquely configured physical device , that is required , alone or in conjunction with other information or devices , in order to create an electronic signature attributable to a specific person .  
employ personnel which possesses the expert knowledge , experience , and qualifications necessary for the offered services , in particular competence at the managerial level , expertise in electronic signature technology and familiarity with proper security procedures ; they must also exercise administrative and management procedures and processes that are adequate and which correspond to recognised standards ;  
While the increased use of advanced electronic communication , including the Internet , was welcomed and supported , views were expressed that , given the level of technological development in developing countries , emphasis should continue to be given to the traditional forms of mass media , including radio , television and print media , in order to reach a wider audience in the developing countries .  
The combination of those three dimensions would be increasingly valuable as electronic commerce moved away from the areas in which it was first developed ( i.e . business-to-consumer and service activities ) to areas in which developing countries had a good chance of building or restoring a competitive advantage ( i.e . business-to-business , commodities , and manufactured and semi-manufactured goods ) .  
Wide-ranging applications being planned include distance learning , corporate training , collaborative work groups , telecommuting , telemedicine , electronic commerce , direct-to-home video and satellite news-gathering , as well as the distribution of music , software , scientific data and global financial and weather information .  
By the end of the first phase of this project , TPPR will have been registered , its Website will have become functional , its client base will have been expanded , a Guide to trade-support services in Palestine will have been published , training will have been provided to TPPR staff in cooperation with other Trade Points in the region and arrangements for wide and systematic dissemination of electronic trading opportunities ( ETOs ) will have been established .  
It provides a basic set of contractual provisions which can ensure that electronic commercial transactions may subsequently be concluded by commercial partners within a sound legal framework .  
It was considered to have been an important occasion for taking stock of legal and regulatory developments at the national and international level , enabling experts to give consideration to all legal aspects of electronic commerce , including their impact , problem areas and possible solutions .  
The combination of those three dimensions would be increasingly valuable as electronic commerce moved away from the areas in which it was first developed ( i.e . business-to-consumer and service activities ) to areas in which developing countries had a good chance of building or restoring a competitive advantage ( i.e . business-to-business , commodities , and manufactured and semi-manufactured goods ) .  
" 17 .  UNCTAD , in cooperation with other relevant international organizations and within existing human and financial resources , should seek to assist developing countries , upon request , in understanding the implications of various legislative approaches to accommodating electronic commerce ; "  
Paragraph 6 : as electronic commerce is rapidly spreading to many sectors of activity and regions , concerted action is required in order to allow all potential traders to rely on simplified , compatible procedures and practices , and to make the best possible use of modern technologies to lower costs of international trade transactions worldwide ;  
It was noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
In contrast , the benefit expected from the Uniform Rules in favour of certain techniques , which were recognized as particularly reliable , irrespective of the circumstance in which they were used , was to create certainty ( through either a presumption or a substantive rule ) , at or before the time any such technique of electronic signature was used ( ex ante ) , that it would result in legal effects equivalent to those of a handwritten signature .  
Widespread concern was expressed that an enhanced electronic signature would be considered as if it were a distinct legal concept , rather than just a description of a collection of technical criteria , the use of which made a method of signing particularly reliable .  
A view was expressed that the reference to article 7 of the Model Law in paragraph ( 2 ) of draft article 6 ( which was also useful as a reminder of the conceptual origin of the Uniform Rules ) was to be interpreted as limiting the scope of the Uniform Rules to situations where an electronic signature was used to meet a mandatory requirement of law that certain documents had to be signed for validity purposes .  
The view was expressed that , irrespective of whether draft article 6 established a presumption that the data was signed or a mere presumption that the electronic signature was technically reliable and linked to a given message , the burden of rebutting such presumptions might be too onerous in the context of consumer transactions , which might need to be excluded from the scope of draft article 6 .  
Examples were given of national laws specifically geared to electronic signatures , which dealt with the issue of liability of information certifiers simply by establishing that contractual clauses limiting the liability of such information certifiers should be treated as null and void .  
In the absence of minimal harmonization at the international level , national laws applicable through conflicts rules might thus impose extremely harsh standards that could potentially affect the growth and the global availability of electronic commerce techniques .  
For the purpose of investigating the crimes [ covered by this Convention ] [ established in articles . . . of this Convention ] , if permitted by the basic principles of domestic legal systems , States Parties shall take appropriate measures , when necessary , to permit their competent authorities to use special investigative techniques such as controlled delivery and electronic surveillance within their own territories .  
Policy-oriented analytical work should be carried out by UNCTAD on : ( 1 ) the impact of electronic commerce on trade policies ; ( 2 ) the fiscal and financial implications of electronic commerce ; ( 3 ) the implications for developing countries of the legal and regulatory aspects of electronic commerce ; and ( 4 ) the impact of electronic commerce on employment , productivity and economic growth .  
Each State Party shall , within its possibilities and under the conditions prescribed by its domestic law , take the necessary measures to allow for the appropriate use of special investigative techniques , in particular controlled delivery , electronic or other forms of surveillance , and undercover operations ( by its competent authorities in its territory ) for the purpose of effectively combating organized crime . 
The principal topics covered were the following : electromagnetic radiation , the reflective properties of various types of materials on the surface of the Earth and elementary optics ; electronic imaging ; georeferencing of objects in the field , on maps and on satellite imagery ; remote sensing for land use planning and environmental monitoring ; and Earth resources and environmental satellites .  
Funds means assets of every kind , whether tangible or intangible , movable or immovable , however acquired , and legal documents or instruments in any form , including electronic or digital , evidencing title to , or interest in , such assets , including , but not limited to , bank credits , travellers cheques , bank cheques , money orders , shares , securities , bonds , drafts , letters of credit .  
It was noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
While it was generally agreed that significant progress had been made at those sessions in the understanding of the legal issues of electronic signatures , it was also felt that the Working Group had been faced with difficulties in the building of a consensus as to the legislative policy on which the uniform rules should be based .

Transnational organized crime includes tax evasion , the forgery of clothes and electronic equipment , fraud against international financial institutions , unfair competition on international markets , industrial espionage , the import and export of protected plants and animals , trafficking in works of art and the illegal dumping of toxic industrial waste .  
To ensure the authenticity of all certificates , attachments and authorizations and any other documentation required to be submitted to authorities under these regulations , only original and certified copies shall be accepted or , if agreed to by the competent authorities of the countries concerned , the documentation may be transmitted by electronic means ;  
Furthermore , the efforts of UNESCO to link existing databases and identification systems to allow for electronic transmission of information concerning stolen cultural property , including those removed from areas of conflict and occupied territories , is viewed by my delegation as a primary weapon in the ongoing struggle to achieve an advantage over those engaged in the smuggling trade .  
The Commission had expressed its appreciation for the work accomplished by the Working Group in its preparation of draft uniform rules on electronic signatures , and at the same time had noted that the Working Group had experienced difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues arising from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures , and on how those issues might be addressed in an internationally acceptable legal framework .  
The participation of developing countries - in particular the least developed countries , and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies - and countries with economies in transition , and in particular of their enterprise sectors , in electronic commerce will be an essential ingredient for growth and wealth creation at the global level .  
Since then , the international community had started to devote more attention to the main policy , regulatory , legal , economic and technical issues underlying electronic commerce .  
The representative of India , speaking on behalf of the Asian Group and China , said that UNCTAD was a vital link in the chain of trust and mutual understanding that needed to be built and strengthened in the area of electronic commerce .  
Although not yet directly involved in electronic commerce , Mongolia , as a vast country located far from world markets and major trade routes , was eager to develop that promising form of trade and therefore welcomed the progress made on the draft uniform rules on electronic signatures .  
To some , it is an inevitable process driven by new technologies in electronic communication and transport , enabling information , persons , capital and goods to cross borders and reach the most remote corners of the globe at unprecedented speed .  
The need to adapt the provisions of domestic and international legal instruments to the specific requirements of electronic commerce has been emerging for some 15 years both at the national level and at the international level .  
A Bolero Bill of Lading is designed to replicate the essential business functions of a bill of lading via fast , efficient electronic messaging tracked in a central database operated by a trustworthy third party .  
The internal barriers to SME adoption of ecommerce include limited understanding of the complexity of electronic operations , inadequate skills and high initial investment required to develop a viable ecommerce strategy .  
Takes note with interest of the electronic mail-based news alert service distributed worldwide by the Department of Public Information , and emphasizes that extra care needs to be taken to ensure that news breaking stories and news alerts are accurate , impartial and free of any bias ;  
Three major issues have emerged from the workshops and consultations held and the feedback from country teams that have been involved in consultations with the World Bank as well as from the joint learning group on the CDF and PRSPs , which meets periodically and maintains continual electronic contact among its members : ( a ) enhancing national ownership of processes ; ( b ) improving participation of different actors , particularly civil society ; and ( c ) ensuring a substantive contribution of UNDP and the other United Nations agencies and entities .  
While UNAMSIL took over the substantive civilian and military components of UNOMSIL , as well as its assets , the significant expansion of the Mission necessitated commensurate strengthening of its civilian staffing establishment , logistical and technical support structures , the provision of additional communications , electronic data-processing and other equipment , acquisition of vehicles and contracting additional air assets .  
During the biennium 2002-2003 , emphasis will be placed on better utilization of interpretation capacity ; further integration of the text-processing and electronic publishing functions into a single electronically supported work process through the more versatile utilization of staff resources , leading to greater efficiency ; and improvement of composition and graphic work by increasing in-house productivity through the use of new technologies and through contractual arrangements .  
Concern was expressed that , depending on the decisions to be made by the Working Group with respect to articles 2 and 13 , the remainder of the draft provisions might need to be re-examined to avoid creating a situation where the standard set by the uniform rules would apply equally to electronic signatures that ensured a high level of security and to low-value certificates that might be used in the context of electronic communications that were not intended to carry significant legal effect .  
It was noted that the Working Group on Arbitration had already begun discussing ways in which current legal instruments of a statutory nature might need to be amended or interpreted to authorize the use of electronic documentation and , in particular , to do away with existing requirements regarding the written form of arbitration agreements .  
The view was expressed that technical interoperability , while it constituted a desirable objective , should not be regarded as a theoretical prerequisite for cross-border use of electronic signatures .  
It was noted that the Working Group on Arbitration was considering ways in which current legal instruments of a statutory nature might need to be amended or interpreted to authorize the use of electronic documentation and , in particular , to liberalize existing requirements regarding the written form of arbitration agreements .  
The prevailing view within the Working Group , however , was that , although the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce was a useful basis for modernizing domestic legislation or interpreting international instruments , the legal barriers to the development of electronic commerce posed by international instruments , in particular multilateral treaties and conventions , required special attention .  
Thus , an analysis by the Working Group of legal issues related to the creation of electronic substitutes for paper-based transport documents would be a meaningful contribution to that other project , as it might result in the development of specific electronic commerce-focused provisions that might , at an appropriate time , become an integral part of that new international regime expected to be developed by the Commission .  
In view of the urgent need for the introduction of the legal rules that would be needed to bring certainty and predictability to the international regime governing Internet-based and other electronic commerce transactions , the view was expressed that the Working Group should initially focus its attention on issues raised by electronic contracting in the area of international sales of tangible goods .  
As regards the particular issue under consideration , the Working Group agreed , however , that the place of conclusion of a contract , as traditionally understood in private international law , might not provide sufficient basis for a workable solution in an electronic environment and that other , more modern concepts , such as the notion of centre of gravity of a contract or other related notions , might also be considered .  
Takes note with interest of the electronic mail-based news alert service distributed worldwide by the Department of Public Information , and emphasizes that extra care needs to be taken to ensure that news breaking stories and news alerts are accurate , impartial and free of any bias ;  
In fact , many applications being developed to benefit citizens , such as digital libraries , electronic museums , distance education and training , distance medical services and other public social services , must be based on the development of local content industry .  
Under the direct supervision of the Chief , GIS Cell ( GISC ) , the incumbent would be responsible for the overall operating , developing and implementing of the GIS-related matters in terms of logistics in peacekeeping operations ; provide geographic / terrain analysis using GIS technology , produce terrain studies and predict the effects of weather , terrain and logistics situations in peacekeeping operations , compile textual , graphic products from text , electronic format of geographic data ( vector , raster , satellite images ) and other sources of data .  
Urges States and encourages the private sector to promote the development by the media , including the print and electronic media , including the Internet and advertising , taking into account their independence , through their relevant associations and organizations at the national , regional and international levels , of a voluntary ethical code of conduct and self-regulatory measures , in order : ( a ) To combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and do away with stereotypes ;

Influencing information resources in the area of credit and finance , for example by the unauthorized transfer or outright theft of bank resources , the closing of accounts and , in particular , mounting electronic attacks to block the computer networks of central banking institutions , could obviously not only create crisis situations in that particular area but also bring about the countrys total economic collapse and , inevitably , cause serious complications in its international relations .  
The unprecedented development of corporate , State and international information systems and the simultaneous expansion of opportunities of access to them have attained such a level that today practically every member of the international community will be exposed to a real risk of electronic attack by criminals or terrorists .  
The advent of electronic data interchange , enabling documents such as customs declarations to be transmitted in advance of arrivals ( by ship , train , aircraft etc . ) , has facilitated forward planning by transport operators , port authorities , customs and other agencies , leading to fast customs clearance of goods and to improving transit times of ships and other means of transport , thereby reducing the overall cost of international trade .  
Regarding the economic situation in Asia one panellist expressed the view that pessimism was exaggerated despite the regions dependence on exports of electronic goods , a still incomplete process of banking and corporate restructuring , and a decline in the stock markets steeper than in most developed countries .  
His Government would be giving top priority in the coming four years to creating an information society based on science and new technologies , by , inter alia , introducing computer education for students , teachers and civil servants , and using computer networks to centralize access to government services ; developing a long-term science and technology strategy ; promoting electronic business ; and using an integrated communications network to fight organized crime , drug-dealing and illegal immigration .  
The Expert Meeting on Electronic Commerce and International Transport Services : Best Practices for Enhancing the Competitiveness of Developing Countries examined the impact of electronic commerce on international transport services , including economic and operational as well as legal and documentary aspects thereof , and decided to bring the following conclusions and recommendations to the attention of the Commission on Enterprise , Business Facilitation and Development at its sixth session .  
It was further stressed that a number of legal questions raised by electronic commerce could be addressed through contractual arrangements as preliminary measures pending adjustments to the legal framework .  
Being of the opinion that the establishment of model legislation to facilitate the use of electronic signatures in a manner acceptable to States with different legal , social and economic systems could contribute to the development of harmonious international economic relations ,  
Because of the expansion and the increase in travel within the Mission area it also planned to replace obsolete or faulty mobile phone sets provided to political and civil affairs units , and , therefore , the electronic voice mail system known as CarLog is requested in 2002 .  
Data received from the SAC-C satellite are used to study the terrestrial and marine environment , assess desertification , monitor flooding , forecast agricultural production , monitor the atmospheric temperature and vapour content of water with a view to determining the variability of the atmospheric structure , perform measurements of the geomagnetic field with the same level of accuracy attained by observatories , measure atmospheric space radiation and its effects on advanced electronic components , determine the migratory route of the southern right whale and verify methods used in determining satellite attitude and velocity .  
Creating a technology-neutral e-commerce and e-finance friendly regulatory environment and developing secure methods of electronic transmission of commercial messages , e-signatures and e-contracts , which should be considered as legally binding by contracting parties ;  
Creating a technology-neutral e-commerce and e-finance friendly regulatory environment and developing secure methods of electronic transmission of commercial messages , e-signatures and e-contracts , which should be considered as legally binding by contracting parties ;  
Based on the urban planning and the specific context of the city , Beijing will in the coming years focus on the development of small and medium-sized , non-polluting , technology / knowledge-intensive and environment-friendly enterprises , in particular , modern manufacturing enterprises equipped with optical-machinery / electronic integration .  It also hopes to train a number of high level " blue-collar skilled workers . "  
Lu Xinshe said the State has incorporated the system of geological disaster forewarning and forecast and contingency command , the national monitoring system of farmland protection , and the national safety assurance system of mineral resources into the three major network systems that are to be completed in the coming four years of building electronic administration for land and resources .  
Guangdong 's electronic industry has realized the strategic shift " from a domestic sales focus to an overseas sales focus " , and product exports increased swiftly .  In 1995 , 7.325-million telephones , 3.19-million TV sets , 10.65-million radio tape recorders , and nearly 3-million sets of hi-fi equipment were exported .  The export volume accounted for 50% - 90% of the total output respectively and the export deliveries have ranked first in China for many years running .  
The areas in which Liaoning utilizes foreign investment have been expanded from medium and small-sized processing projects to the four pillar industries for old industrial base transformation purposes : the petrochemical industry , the metallurgical industry , the mechanical industry , the electronic industry , etc . and such industries as agriculture , real estate , infrastructure , energy , finance , etc .  
It is known that major Indian exports to China are aquatic products , iron sand , and cotton yarn , while major imports from China are organic chemical products , electronic products , coal , and cotton thread .  The volume of bilateral trade between China and India for 1999 totaled about $ 2-billion .  
In the fields of electronic information , new materials , biological engineering , integration of light , machines , and electricity [ guang ji dian yi ti hua , 0342-2623-7193-0001-7555-0553 ] , new energy sources , and environmental protection , the high-tech zones are more and more becoming important bases for the development of China 's high-tech industries and have played a active role in promoting industrial restructuring and in leading forward sustained economic development .  
Along with the popularization and application of computer networks , the operation between different customs and between customs and relevant departments has been integrated into one .  So , customs and departments may exchange information through electronic records and may simultaneously read real information .  In this way , unlawful activities of cheating with false certificates will immediately be exposed .  
On the one hand , hostile forces in the West are still bent on " Westernizing " and " dividing " us and they try their utmost to step up ideological and cultural infiltration through a multitude of channels .  They publicize capitalist values in the large volumes of imported publications , film and television products , electronic games , computer software , and other spiritual and cultural products in an effort to compete with us for the younger generation .  
It can be anticipated that in a period to come , the huge demand of the Western Region for building materials , engineering machinery , industrial equipment , electronic products and other supplies will greatly stimulate the production of relevant industries and make a large number of enterprises free themselves from their current situation of operating under capacity .  
The electronic business is to bring electronic technology to the overall trade activities , and has the characteristics of low operational costs , a wide spread of electronic service subscribers , no limit on time and space , and direct interaction and exchange between electronic service providers and subscribers .  In addition , the capacity to make warehouses , goods shelves , and stores virtual has reduced the intermediate links , which in turn greatly reduces trade cost and trade cycle .  
Third , to have the right of contributing to industrial development .  As the technical and safety standards are formulated by ourselves , they will contribute to the industrial development of the broadcast and television network , pager , cellular phone , electronic notebook , computer , public screen , and household electrical appliances , among other things .  
At the drilling ground this correspondent saw professional support team members carry out emergency repair work on telecommunication optical fiber cables that had been destroyed by the " enemy , " and use modern telecommunication equipment , such as maritime-type portable satellite telephones and VSAT small-sized satellite ground stations , under electronic jamming condition , to serve the purpose of war-time mobile telecommunication support .  
In deciding on a strategic goal , we should try to meet our national security needs and comply with at once the needs of our national economic development and electronic information industry development and the needs of increasingly fierce competition on the domestic and international markets .  
Instructions , requirements , and working plans from superiors are transmitted through computers , entrusted tasks and work arrangements for the lower levels are received and processed by computers , work implementation progress reports and proposals are also submitted through computer systems , and electronic mail is gradually replacing official documents and the telephone .  Network mechanisms have become an indispensable unified operating method for integrating the American military .  
Now , the battalion has built 12 modern teaching sites with coordinated equipment , such as electronic classrooms , rooms for simulation of animated images , and rooms for simulation of traffic rules .  In addition , it has incorporated use of three-dimensional animated pictures in teaching of basic theories , use of multi-media in explaining the technological structures , and use of simulation in practical application and operation .  As a result , the effectiveness of basic training of trainee soldiers has been improved by three times .  
For the last few days , some 340 party-member cadres in a certain regiment under the Beijing Military Region , which is currently engaged in electronic warfare exercises , have formed 20 " party-member squads for tackling key issues . "  Holding high the bright red party flag , they have practiced the requirement of the " three represents " with their exemplary deeds , thus forming a unique northern-frontier scene on the plateau training grounds .  
In line with the special features that reconnaissance means should be applied to the future operational space - - air , sea , and ground - - in all weathers , this battalion launched a massive scientific and technological trailblazing campaign .  In accordance with the ways and means suggested by the officers and men , it worked out more than 30 new methods of operation to defend modern air raids , high-tech reconnaissance , and electronic welfare ; and transformed 108 camouflage devices .  
During the continuous cooperation of an electronic warfare exercise , the naval , air , and marine troops staged coordinated exercises and training on dozens of scenarios , including such naval training scenarios as firing at surface targets , launching anti-submarine rockets , launching air defense missiles , and launching an underwater anti-submarine operation , a surface interception operation , a surface search operation , a surface rescue operation , or a surface fire support operation , and so on ; 
The computer-assisted evaluation system that was established at the combined tactical training base has enabled the mechanized division that participated in the exercise to know for sure where they stood in terms of combat effectiveness .  The modern computer-assisted evaluation system uses a tree-structured computer theory to carry out automated processing of electronic mail , positioning , and imagery information compiled from the direct-and-dispatch monitoring and control system ;  
On site , the writer saw a series of situations being sent to the directorial center in real time and promptly .  They included whether the commanders could rapidly and accurately make judgments on enemy situations , whether they could make scientific decisions , whether instructions could be sent to affiliated combat troops amid electronic interference , whether troops could trust deep into the enemy force and take up position as scheduled and according to instructions , and whether information on the enemy could be handled effectively .  
The general drilling site commander , with a sun-tanned face , declared : This combat drill indicates that , as a number of effective methods of scientific and technological troops training have been converted into combat strength , our army has made substantial progress in rapid barrier-breaking landing , operations to hit strongly built enemy targets , operations to counter precision strikes , camouflage of important military facilities , electronic countermeasure , and computer network protection .  
A new tactics research team organized by the detachment has thoroughly analyzed the carrier battle group with respect to its tactical organization , electronic early warning system , sonar system , fire control system , and the performances of its high-tech equipment ; drawn experience from the high-tech local war fought in recent years in the world , and followed the trends of tactical and technological development ; and made repeated comparisons between the enemy and ourselves in terms of technology and equipment , and found out each other 's strength and weakness .  
During recent years , they " sharpened " themselves with the tasks of dealing with the priorities and difficulties in information operations and electronic countermeasures , established more than 20 tasks to tackle difficult problems in science-technology military training , including acquiring new knowledge , mastering new equipment , studying new military tactics and training high-quality personnel .  Through taking specific measures such as fixing the training content , measures , levels , and steps , they institutionalized and standardized science-technology military training .  
The regiment successively built a comprehensive military tactics training ground which integrated the strategy of railway loading and unloading tactics , shooting with light weapons , and positional defense training , and a military officer training center with all functions , built a language teaching room and a simulation training room , introduced a simulation training system with electronic countermeasures and provided a good service guarantee and technical support for reforming the training methods and studying operational methods .  
During the exercise , this group army employed most of its new weapons , on the basis of a rational disposition and a flexible marshaling ; and by making a simultaneous use of technological means and tactical means and by integrating new and high technological means with traditional means , they successfully gave shape to a fairly complete electronic warfare system .  
As compared with the same period last year , among 14 major trades , metallurgical , petrochemical , machinery , electronic , light , textile , pharmaceutical , tobacco , and gold industries experienced increased profits .  Power industry continuously maintained a fairly high level of profit .  
Beyond controversy , electronic warfare , military deception , operation secrecy , and psychological warfare are the typical " soft " methods of attack .  And real object destruction is a goal of firepower warfare , in which adjusted firepower weapons are used to hit the enemy 's command posts , command control centers , intelligence centers , and other key places .  
Besides , it has taken into consideration that providing long distance logistic support is prone to air raids by the enemy and has used abandoned vehicles to set up fake car parks , fake oil refueling stations , fake rear commanding posts , fake medical centers , and used camouflage in the air to hide the real and show the fake .  It has developed , through exploration , various means and methods to " guard against precision attacks , electronic attacks , reconnaissance and monitoring so that the overall logistic protection capability has been remarkably increased " .  
In light of characteristics of a hi-tech war in future , the unit had decided to hold in an unfamiliar water area a training exercise centered on several highly difficult training topics , such as rapid camouflage on the sea , protecting itself against an enemy 's electronic jamming , countering an enemy 's hi-tech reconnaissance , and so on .  
On the one hand , when the Russian planes suddenly entered the defense zone , the aircraft carrier 's onboard could be subjected to electronic interference from the Russian fighters which made the target display indistinct ; on the other hand , personnel manning the radar could be overly negligent , overlook the suspicious target , did away with effective tracking and monitoring , which enabled the Russian planes to fly extremely low when coming near the aircraft carrier and entered the radar 's blind spot .  
Looking into the future , we can vaguely see a great blueprint of even greater grandeur : The Chinese Navy will be able to achieve a qualitative leap in its early warning , mobile , anti-submarine , air defense , electronic warfare , rapid response and other capabilities , and will be able to achieve a new improvement in its comprehensive combat capability under modern conditions .  
The mass troop trainings in science and technology are developing in breadth and depth , the research of key subjects like combined operation , electronic warfare , airstrike countermeasure , new " three hittings and three defenses , and so on have made new breakthroughs , the study of high-tech knowledge , cultivation of talented people , training in new equipment , and so on , have all acquired remarkable effects , thus the fighting capacity of troops being further improved .  
He said that , in line with the international trend and existing domestic precedent , using high-tech principles to mix electronic sound with natural sound could unite the opera house and concert hall into one .  That would mean building only an opera house and a Beijing Opera playhouse , or one cultural square with two structures , which would save much investment .  
- - US officials are not at all concerned about the missing Chinese pilot and the destroyed Chinese fighter , endlessly stressing instead : The EP-3 electronic reconnaisance plant is covered by US sovereignty , and the Chinese side can not send people to board the plane and still less carry out a search .  They also demand that China provide assistance for repairing the plane as soon as possible , so that the crew can fly back to base as soon as possible .  
It was reported that before the Chinese personnel entered the landed aircraft at Hainan airfield , many electronic equipment inside the aircraft had already been destroyed .  However , before the US surveillance aircraft bumped against and damaged the Chinese fighter plane and landed at the airfield on Hainan Island , the Chinese side had already intercepted the frequency and signals used by this US surveillance aircraft to communicate with its rear during the process .  Reportedly , these signals are very valuable .  
The United States has for many years kept conducting military reconnaissance activities along China 's southeast coastal areas , and US military planes have repeatedly appeared in the skies of China 's coastal areas and have even intruded into the line of China 's territorial waters for reconnaissance .  The US plane that bombed into and destroyed China 's fighter this time is a US military reconnaissance plane equipped with sophisticated electronic reconnaissance devices as well as military intelligence gathering professionals .  
The key reason is that the plane is equipped with some expensive and most advanced wide-band and fully digitized receivers instead of ordinary electronic surveillance equipment , and its all-frequency and all-band receivers are capable of intercepting or monitoring signals transmitted by the Chinese Communist forces through all frequencies .  
Some British intelligence experts believe that due to such an " unexpected windfall , " the Chinese Communists ' electronic experts will be able to learn about the US forces ' reconnaissance system , counter-reconnaissance system , confrontation system , as well as other relevant technologies in a more comprehensive and in-depth way , or at least be able to broaden their mind or accumulate advance understanding about some weapons after studying the most advanced reconnaissance equipment in modern times .  
Wang has conducted surveys of some joint venture enterprises in the coastal region of southern China , an area which is seen by many domestic and foreign companies as an excellent processing base , and as long as the design and standards for electronic products are provided , there are various ready-made associated facilities there , from raw materials and parts / components to assembly , etc .  
Then , Wang Wei disclosed his secret to me : " There are many electronic instruments on a plane .  I come here not for the purpose of looking for a stable job after I graduate , but to lay a foundation for my future flying career . "  
Wang Zhile surveyed some joint venture enterprises in southern China 's coastal area , which is regarded by many domestic and foreign corporations as the best processing base .  One only has to provide the designs and standards for electronic products , because all kinds of necessary factories , from raw materials , spare parts , to assembly , are already there .  
While performing the flying duty of tracking and monitoring the US military electronic reconnaissance plane this time , he displayed determination , courage , calmness , cool-headedness , heroism , and tenacity .  By sacrificing his life , he composed a glorious victorious song of patriotism and revolutionary heroism .  
Taking the " Pine Gap joint air defense research facility " electronic reconnaisance base as an example , this is located in a remote site in central Australia , well screened by trees , and equipped with large antennae ; it can receive signals from US satellites through infrared sensors , collect many signals from radar , radio , and telephone signals from Asia and the Middle East , and can also detect the great heat produced by ballistic missile launches in any place on the Eurasian land mass .  
and it is also feasible to cooperate with the electronic confrontation squad of our side to mock an SOS sent by the pilot of the enemy plane in such a way that the enemy can not distinguish whether the signal is genuine or fake , and once the enemy 's military strength is dispersed , our side can annihilate the enemy .  
While conducting a search operation , search and rescue teams may be shielded by a number of planes , including an early warning plane , an electronic jamming plane , an assault plane , and a fighter plane , and some warplanes conducting a search operation may also be armed with high-speed anti-radiation missiles in light of actual conditions so as to suppress an enemy surface-to-air missile base and guard against a sudden attack by the enemy .  
Our campaign commanders and command organs should not only learn how to operate a bank , a cannon , and other arms under their command , for this is far from sufficient , but should also learn about the principal arms of naval , air , and second artillery units and master the basic knowledge about an electronic confrontation , a networked offensive , a networked defensive operation , and other operations .  
On the battlefield of a combined operation , electronic confrontation is becoming increasingly intense , the degree of command control automation is growing higher and higher , and the battlefield situation is undergoing instantaneous changes ; and all these have constituted a severe challenge to the quality of commanding officers .  
The current forum - - " Next Generation Asia " - - devoted to discussions on such issues as corporate management , competition advantages , information infrastructure construction , and electronic commerce , will be conducive to improving the management level of enterprises in Asia , promoting the development of the Asia economy , and benefiting all the parties concerned in seeking business opportunities .  
At the ongoing Beijing International Week , the Great Wall Rocket Company is a very eye-catching exhibitor .  Visitors are amazed by the gigantic models of the advanced carrier rockets of the Long March series , electronic traffic maps , sensors , satellite positioning and navigation instruments , TV receivers that can receive high-resolution pictures via satellites , and other high-tech civilian products on display at the company 's booths .  
Since the beginning of the second half of 2000 , the economies of some APEC developed members have undergone major readjustments ; economic growth has remarkably slowed down ; the demand of the global information technology and electronic industry has been sluggish , and the financial market unstable ; export has begun to slow down ; and trade protectionism has raised its head .  These trends will bring about some uncertainties to APEC economic cooperation .  
Due to the continuous decline and notable shrink in the transactions of Taipei 's stock market in the previous week , the influence of the upcoming PLA military exercise on Dongshan Island , and the upcoming publication of the various industries ' business income in May , electronic shares did not perform well on 4 June , and Taipei 's stock market opened low and remained low .  Except for financial shares , which registered growth thanks to the support of specific funds , all shares declined .  
Besides , a belligerent will have to mount both a " soft " strike and a " hard " strike at the enemy 's most threatening and vulnerable points , in order to destroy with information weapons , the enemy 's vital electronic equipment , which seem virtually immune to an electromagnetic strike , and damage with non-information weapons , the enemy 's electronic information carriers , through a " hard " strike .  
The military branches of other NATO nations , at the same time as they are reforming and strengthening their geographic information assurance , also want to increase the number of equipment retrofit kits adaptable to the NAVSTAR GPS on their missiles , bombs , weapon-launching platforms , electronic surveillance and intelligence systems - - in accordance with the demands of United States military joint combat - - to heighten the global positioning and navigation level of various kinds of munitions .  
Meanwhile , a number of transportation projects were completed one after another , including the Dalian-Qinhuangdao railway , China 's first electrified coal-transporting railroad , and the Changyuan Dongming railroad bridge , the longest such bridge in Asia . The completion of a number of large cutting-edge scientific research projects which meet advanced international standards , such as the positive-negative electronic collider , heavy ion accelerator , and national radiation laboratory , has demonstrated China 's scientific and technological ( S &amp; T ) prowess .  
By guiding foreign investment toward infrastructural construction , the exploration of mineral resources , the development of tourist resources , the ecological environmental protection , the agricultural and livestock products processing , the transformation of existing production capacities , and to such scientific and technological projects as the development and manufacturing of new-type electronic components in its western region , China will provide a host of investment and trade opportunities for foreign investors , said Deng Zhan .  
In the current trend of staff reduction in the domestic electronic sector , all factors and all personnel from the grass-roots level upward at home and abroad , who generated poor economic benefits , were strictly examined by enterprise owners .  
The US military has also assisted the Army to establish an " electronic warfare battalion " in secret .  It has leased all the necessary electronic warfare equipment and delivered to the Army a set of mobile equipment , which is the most advanced equipment in service .  The US military plans to deliver five sets of such equipment to Taiwan .  
Many large-scale military exercises have shown the newest achievements that China 's military has obtained from the traditional " three attacks and three defenses " - - attacking tanks , planes , and airborne troops , and defending against nuclear , chemical , and biological attacks - - to the " new three attacks and three defenses " of attacking stealth aircraft , cruise missiles , and helicopter gun ships , and defending against precision strikes , electronic jamming , and reconnaissance and surveillance .  
The psychological and electronic warfare troops established recently by the PLA coordinated for the first time the operations of military reconnaissance satellites over the Taiwan Strait . The second stage was " combined forces of the navy , the army and the air force crossing the Strait and carrying out landing operations , " which mostly consisted of guided missile attacks and other methods .  This illustrates the fact that the manner adopted by the PLA to attack Taiwan has switched from one of a " sea-borne landing " to " airborne raids " and other varieties .  
At the same time , in line with the features of the establishment of external units , the base has provided the " Blue Army " with infantry , artillery , armored , engineering , chemical , communication , electronic confrontation , and helicopter troops - - which form a joint training command headquarters with the air force and the army aviation unit - - and has copied military drills and training conducted by powerful adversaries . 
Experts set the physical target as follows : Carry out physical study on the filters and scraping levels in the Tokamak Device ; promote improving and restricting technology of plasma under near-reactor core condition ; and develop plasma heating technology , electronic current driving technology , feeding technology , and plasma diagnostic and measure technology under reactor core plasma condition .  
Borrowing from the military region signal regiment 's achievements in the scientific and technical training of troops , the group army 's signal elements overcame the difficulty of insufficient amounts of equipment and materials , and scientifically conducted " three defenses " training in defending against enemy reconnaissance and surveillance , defending against enemy electronic jamming , and defending against an enemy 's precise attacks .  
The key part of the exercise is beach landing , which includes topics of anti-landing , air raids and anti-air raids , parachuting , electronic jamming and anti-jamming , satellite surveillance and tracking , blockading and anti-blockading , attacking with tactical and strategic missiles , hitting aircraft carriers , hitting invisible aircraft , hitting cruise missiles , hitting helicopters , anti-precision attacks , anti-surveillance and anti-monitoring , and so on .  
During the current military exercises underway at Dongshan island and the southeast coast , the special electronic countermeasures unit which has just been organized has for the first time been operating in coordination with military reconnaisance satellites ;  
This is specifically expressed in the following ways : The special electronic countermeasures unit which has just been organized is for the first time operating in the Taiwan strait in coordination with military satellite reconnaisance ;  
During the current military exercises underway at the Dongshan Island and the southeast coast , the special electronic countermeasures unit , which has just been organized , has for the first time been operating in coordination with military reconnaissance satellites in the Taiwan Strait ;  
Banking , financial and taxation , customs , scientific research , educational , and cultural and public health departments and all government organizations should use electronic and information technologies and communications networks to set up and improve high-efficiency , reliable , applicable management and social service information systems .  
Banking , financial and taxation , customs , scientific research , educational , and cultural and public health departments and all government organizations should use electronic and information technologies and communications networks to set up and improve high-efficiency , reliable , applicable management and social service information systems .  
The aircraft is equipped with advanced comprehensive navigation electronic systems and weapons ; it can cruise at supersonic speed , has stealth capability , is highly maneuverable , and possesses superior features in being able to find , fire at , and destroy an enemy without being detected itself ; it represents the orientation for future fighter development , and so its research and development have aroused attention in military circles the world over .  
US Army General ( Greg Hackett ) announced on 4 April that in the next 20 years the US Army will spend $ 38 billion on procuring 1,213 RAH-66 Comanche armed helicopters ; this is the world 's first helicopter of high intelligence capacity , fully digitized and electronic ; it has good stealth capability , advanced electronic equipment , and a high degree of automation , with strong ground attack capability and relatively strong aerial fighting capability ;  
It is necessary to pay close attention to the construction of recreational facilities for young people , resolutely ban electronic game rooms , singing and dancing parlors , and video show rooms which have a harmful impact on the growth of youngsters , and mete out more severe punishments to those who run such unhealthy undertakings , thus creating a benign social environment for the comprehensive implementation of quality education .  
Further , it has readjusted the national military strategy and military concepts ; stressed local wars under high-tech conditions and rapid response capability ; emphasized the task of strengthening the military through science and technology such as electronic warfare , information warfare , network warfare , and modern communication ;  
By exercising strict control , it is necessary to ban all illegal electronic game arcades that have seriously violated regulations and to further define the conditions that such arcades must meet , and greatly reduce the number of such arcades .  Efforts must be made to resolutely strengthen our supervision and ensure that all electronic game arcades are operating according to relevant laws and regulations .  
The department for foreign trade and economic affairs must earnestly carry out its works well in examining and approving applications from the processing industry to process electronic game equipment and its parts and accessories and overseeing the re-export of the processed equipment , parts , and accessories out of the country .  It must coordinate with the customs houses to crack down on illicit activities in smuggling electronic game equipment , parts and accessories .  
Moreover , since Taiwan bought advanced weapons from many countries and their quality , function , and operation procedures vary from country to country , the fire control system , electronic warfare system , and command control systems of the weapons are mostly uncoordinated or imperfect .  This has a direct bearing on the normal performance of the planes ' fighting function .  
In economic restructuring , there have been marked improvements in the aggregate control of some surplus and obsolete productive capacities and products , such as the textile , coal , metallurgical industries , and the electronic information industry is becoming a new impetus to economic growth .  
This reporter has learned from a relevant department today that a fire expert from the Public Security Ministry and an expert team composed of officers from the provincial and city public security organs and fire brigade , conducted a thorough investigation of the fire site , tested the evidence , and reached a consensus that the cause of the serious fire in the Shantou Guesthouse on 15 July was the overheated electronic vacuum flask in room 204 on the second floor , that burned the plastic part of the bottle and led to the serious fire .  
In order to raise the survival capability of missile weapons in actual war , Xu Guangfeng and his comrades-in-arm studied and developed a radar signal radiation simulator that can be used as an electronic interference source or as a chaff device to lure attack by enemy 's anti-radiation missiles .  It has effectively solved a major tactical difficulty for missile weaponry system and greatly raised the survival capability of this kind of weapon in time of war .  
The secret national defense budget for next fiscal year will total more than 58 billion yuan .  To strengthen their combat readiness in the electronic and communications arenas , the plans proposed by the armed forces include completion of an electronic counterattack shelter network and an online defense system .  Geared against Chicom 's active efforts to develop electromagnetic impulse attack , there will also be a " project to protect against electromagnetic impulse . "  
As a far as output value is concerned , the volume of the electronic and electrical machinery industry ranks first , with annual export volume at 1.54 trillion yuan , representing half of total foreign sales .  
Podrov , general manager of Russia Aeronautical and Astronautical Equipment Corporation , which is the manufacturer of Su-27 ' s electronic equipment , was attending an aviation exhibition in Zhuhai . Podrov said : The day before yesterday , I held talks with the relevant aviation and aerospace departments of China and learned that half of China 's Su-27 fighter planes purchased or imported several years ago are unable to conduct normal flight due to damaged electronic equipment on board .  
The Russian experts believed that China 's civil aviation strength and scientific and technological strength for national defense , including China 's ship management equipment , electronic products , and so on , are already among the most advanced in the world .  After visiting some academies of sciences and aircraft production plants in China , the Russian experts concluded that China has already attained the standard required for cooperating with Russia .  
During the July-September period , public security organs across the country , with close coordination of other departments , launched a campaign to tighten the management of places of entertainment and service .  They carried out a severe crackdown on prostitution , gambling , drug trafficking , and other social evils .  They also tightened the management of places where electronic games were available .  They have made contributions to improving the social environment and promoting a socialist spiritual civilization .

Cheng Shu-min , manager of program planning at Chinese Television System , also says that when you look at examples from overseas , audiences tend to identify with their native culture and we have yet to see terrestrial television stations closing down due to competition from satellite . Yet the rise of new electronic media technology has still made the networks aware of a change in the domestic market , a change which has seen a breaking up of the tripartite world of the three television channels and a movement towards audience fragmentation . "  
Because the liberalization of the electronic media has followed on the tails of the graphic media , many people compare it to the profligate development of political magazines during the 1980s . During the era when there was a ban on publishing , dissidents operated " non-partisan magazines " to strive for freedom of speech . After censorship was lifted , the scope of subjects in magazines vastly expanded , and public opinion forums and discussion exchange sections increased . The previous form of magazine exited the battlefield .

So what is the current situation in the broadcast media in Taiwan ? The extent of involvement of political actors is indeed serious . Recently the Government Information Office announced the results of an investigation into the running of electronic media by holders of public office . It shows that among 366 such media outlets , 67 elected or executive branch officials are board members , managers , stockholders , or founders .

It was said that it would be very important to direct such an effort towards the development of international norms and standards for commercial conduct in the field , with the intent of supporting trade through electronic media , and not have as a goal the establishment of a regulatory regime for service providers , or other rules which could create costs unacceptable for market applications of electronic data interchange ( EDI ) ( ibid . , para .  117 ) .  
However , one of the difficulties of undertaking work in the area of electronic signatures stemmed from the fact that , if the uniform rules to be prepared were to provide the level of guidance that might be required to implement the principles embodied in article 7 of the Model Law , they might have to deviate from a purely functional approach , and to address in some detail the manner in which specific techniques could perform the above-mentioned functions .  
In the context of the discussion of paragraph ( 3 ) , a question was raised as to whether the reference to keys of natural and legal persons provided sufficient guidance in situations where cryptographic keys were issued directly to electronic devices , or used by such devices , in the absence of direct human intervention .  
It was decided that the general definition of certification authority should be based on the text of paragraph ( 3 ) of draft article B . It was agreed that the reference to natural and legal persons should be complemented by a reference to electronic devices , which should be placed between square brackets , pending future consideration by the Working Group .  
Another proposal was that a definition should be based on the elements of a certificate contained in the note by the Secretariat , which referred to the certificate as being an electronic record that listed a public key together with the name of the certificate subscriber as the subject of the certificate , and confirmed that the prospective signer identified in the certificate held the corresponding private key ( A / CN . 9 / WG.IV / WP . 71 , para .  36 ) .  
While existing rules prepared by organizations such as the Comit maritime international ( CMI ) could provide detailed guidance on the use of electronic messages to create bills of lading , they could not provide a legal basis for such bills since the rules were voluntary .  
Difficult and painful reform lies ahead if Albania is to succeed in fostering political and social reconciliation , economic development , consolidation of a fully functioning and independent judiciary and electronic media , and the creation of active civil-society institutions .  
A further challenge to effective enforcement and regulatory procedures to counter money-laundering is posed by the growth of payment facilities , based on high technology , that enable global financial transactions to be made by coded electronic means .  
It was agreed that inter-agency coordination could be pursued by creating an interactive electronic mail network for information-sharing to serve as the medium for inter-agency contacts ; preparing an inventory of social programmes and projects ; conducting joint human resource training activities ; expanding to the rest of the region the system developed by CEFIR for observing the behaviour of social actors in integration ; and comparing the various work programmes in order to identify issues appropriate for inter-agency cooperation .  
The principal topics covered were the following : electromagnetic radiation , the reflective properties of various types of materials on the surface of the Earth , and elementary optics ; electronic imaging ; georeferencing of objects in the field , on maps and on satellite imagery ; and Earth resources and environmental satellites .  
In view of potential as well as proved advantages of the use of advanced technologies , including electronic publishing , the increased use of such technologies for the publishing process should be enhanced by the Secretariat and a general shift towards the various forms of electronic publishing should be intensified and due regard paid to cost recovery and access to such electronic products in developing countries .  
The Commission recognizes the value of the recommendations made by the experts , and stresses the specific needs of developing countries , especially LDCs , regarding access to international networks in general and to electronic commerce in particular ; the development of physical infrastructure and human resources , as well as the use of existing or foreseen low-cost solutions ( e.g . Internet , low earth orbit satellites ) , should be enhanced .  
Consultation and information exchange , including through the use of interactive electronic networks , among existing NCPCs and with other parts of the local or national EST support structure ( for example , information systems and sources related to ESTs , technical advisory and consultation services , marketing support and legal advice services , and institutions of research and development ) , are important .  
Since UNCTAD did not have the resources to handle all the legal issues relevant to international trade and trade-related services , it could focus on a number of priority areas such as assisting developing countries in the modernization of trade-related national legislation , organization of educational programmes , preparation of information handbooks on legal aspects of international trade , advising Governments on measures to overcome legal impediments to the use of EDI , disseminating information on legislative reforms on issues such as electronic commerce and trade-related services , and legal assistance to Trade Points .  
Given the fact that , on the one hand , legal rules were largely non-existent while existing rules were at times contradictory and , on the other hand , the use of electronic media had gained such overwhelming importance in international trade , it was clear that reliable and binding rules were badly needed .  
For some of its most active participants , this is an asset , since it will allow rapid development of international electronic trade flows with a minimum of legal , regulatory and fiscal obstacles .  
Further attention was drawn to the need to establish arrangements for special investigative techniques , such as electronic surveillance , undercover operations and controlled deliveries , as practical tools to penetrate criminal organizations .  
However , wider use of digital signatures requires adaptation in national legal frameworks so as to enable such technologies to achieve the intended objective of providing a truly reliable and trustworthy electronic environment .  
Reinforcing international dialogue in the appropriate multilateral and bilateral forums to achieve an adequate global regulatory framework for electronic commerce , in particular in data security , data protection , intellectual property rights , and taxation .  
It is for this reason that the logistic regression model was developed from , compared to and tested with the electronic claims for which the type of loss had been ascertained before being applied to the set of claims for which the type of loss was unknown .  
Since then , the international community had started to devote more attention to the main policy , regulatory , legal , economic and technical issues underlying electronic commerce .  
The potential use of diamond and DLC films in electronic circuits , where their high thermal conductivity and electrical insulation make them unique , as well as in cutting and grinding tool surfaces has led to increased commercial interest and activity .  
The secretariat noted that electronic commerce had become a major component of international trade ; the technology was well established and the remaining barriers to its use lay in institutional issues , in particular those of a regulatory and cultural nature .  
One of the key factors driving this dramatic growth in electronic commerce among the industrialized economies has been the achievement of a critical mass of online users .  
The meeting addressed the workshops logistic arrangements and its substantive content , including technical cooperation activities to be considered and proposed , and identified numerous issues of criminal procedure that the workshop could address , such as those relating to data storage , transaction and analysis , electronic communications , trans-border search and seizure , mutual legal assistance , human rights and safeguarding privacy rights .  
While welcoming the Departments efforts and noting its enormous advances in the electronic information field , his delegation believed it necessary to point out that , because of the manifold economic and financial problems faced by countries with economies in transition , the traditional mass media were still the principal sources of information there .  
It was noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
If , for those reasons , such specific form requirements were to remain outside the scope of the Uniform Rules , the additional benefit to be expected from using an enhanced electronic signature as opposed to a mere electronic signature might need to be further clarified , possibly in the context of draft article B . The Working Group agreed that discussion as to that issue might need to be reopened at a later stage . 
The Working Group agreed that a future draft of subparagraph ( b ) should reflect the changes discussed : notice should be given without undue delay ; the two standards of knew or ought to have known and is or might have been compromised should be included in square brackets as alternative texts ; and the words and could be used to create unauthorized enhanced electronic signatures should be deleted .  
It was pointed out , however , that the obligation to operate a CRL might be appropriate for high-value transactions and certificates ( i.e . , for those enhanced electronic signatures that were intended to produce legal effect ) but would be overly burdensome ( and contrary to existing practice ) if it were to be imposed with respect to all certificates ( including cheap certificates used in the context of significant numbers of digital signatures ) .  
The Commission noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
The specialized agencies should seek innovative ways of communicating ideas that reinforced democratic processes and spurred development initiatives ; utilizing communication networks , particularly radio and electronic networks , to increase public access to information and facilitate free and fair participation in decision-making processes ; and enhancing participation by people at the grass roots level , who were the hardest hit by poverty .  
At its sixth session , on 7 October 1998 , a working group on buildings and electronic systems was established as a standing body and replaced an informal group which had been appointed at the fourth session . 4 The composition of the working group and the terms of reference will be determined at the seventh session . 
Priority is being given , therefore , to establishing links with radio stations worldwide , which will enable instantaneous use of the Departments radio programmes , through the most effective delivery system available in each region or subregion , including short wave , satellite , digital audio , telephone feeds , electronic audio-file transfer and other Internet-based mechanisms .  
Missions , in response to ad hoc requests from Governments , on electronic data processing and development ; updating of main economic and social databases ; designing and conducting integrated household surveys ; and improving the existing systems of national accounts , related systems and classification requirements ; ( ii ) Group training .  
Non-recurrent publications on : studies on transport efficiency ( 2 ) ; global framework for electronic commerce and development ; legal guidelines on electronic commerce for trade points ( 2 ) ; regional and international institutional framework for trade points ; major developments in international trade law ; studies on human resources development issues in trade-supporting services ( 2 ) ; trade facilitation handbook ;  
Areas that have been identified as involving legal issues relevant to electronic commerce include data protection , taxation , customs duties , security and authentication , intellectual property rights , liability of Internet service providers , illegal and harmful content , Internet governance ( more specifically , domain names ) , electronic payments systems , and consumer protection .  
The main objective of the Model Law was to offer national legislators a set of internationally acceptable rules allowing a number of legal obstacles to be removed and a more secure legal environment created for electronic commerce .  
In this regard , it is instructive to note that the international organizations and public or private sector entities that have studied electronic commerce from a variety of perspectives have tended to focus on certain common elements that would be present in any favourable legal environment .  
However , it is possible to ( i ) take stock of recent trends relevant to this issue , ( ii ) identify some key issues requiring immediate international attention , and ( iii ) outline possible priority areas for future work on the relationship between electronic commerce , globalization and development .  
In making these recommendations , the Commission stressed the importance of analytical documentation in raising awareness among member States of the potential benefits and obstacles specific to the development dimension of electronic commerce and in deepening understanding of policy implications .  
Activities include coordination meetings and electronic discussions on the planning of cooperative activities and sharing of experience , support for subregional training courses , pilot projects on the application of telematics for development in sectors of public concern , and promotion of the African content of the World Wide Web for educational , scientific , social and cultural development .  
It is also keeping the U . S . marine units based in Okinawa , Japan , and the aircraft carrier Constellation , F-15 tactical fighters , B-52 strategic bombers and EA-6B electronic warfare aircraft based in its mainland on standby for rapid deployment in south Korea .  
It was noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
While it was generally agreed that significant progress had been made at those sessions in the understanding of the legal issues of electronic signatures , it was also felt that the Working Group had been faced with difficulties in the building of a consensus as to the legislative policy on which the uniform rules should be based .  
While it was generally agreed that significant progress had been made at those sessions in the understanding of the legal issues of electronic signatures , it was also felt that the Working Group had been faced with difficulties in the building of a consensus as to the legislative policy on which the uniform rules should be based .  
Since this was likely to prove particularly difficult at the international level and be of limited relevance to international commercial transactions , the additional benefit to be expected from using an enhanced electronic signature as opposed to a mere electronic signature might need to be clarified .  
Signature device means unique information , such as codes , algorithms , letters , numbers , private keys , or personal identification numbers ( PINS ) , or a uniquely configured physical device , that is required , alone or in conjunction with other information or devices , in order to create an electronic signature attributable to a specific person .  
employ personnel which possesses the expert knowledge , experience , and qualifications necessary for the offered services , in particular competence at the managerial level , expertise in electronic signature technology and familiarity with proper security procedures ; they must also exercise administrative and management procedures and processes that are adequate and which correspond to recognised standards ;  
While the increased use of advanced electronic communication , including the Internet , was welcomed and supported , views were expressed that , given the level of technological development in developing countries , emphasis should continue to be given to the traditional forms of mass media , including radio , television and print media , in order to reach a wider audience in the developing countries .  
The combination of those three dimensions would be increasingly valuable as electronic commerce moved away from the areas in which it was first developed ( i.e . business-to-consumer and service activities ) to areas in which developing countries had a good chance of building or restoring a competitive advantage ( i.e . business-to-business , commodities , and manufactured and semi-manufactured goods ) .  
Wide-ranging applications being planned include distance learning , corporate training , collaborative work groups , telecommuting , telemedicine , electronic commerce , direct-to-home video and satellite news-gathering , as well as the distribution of music , software , scientific data and global financial and weather information .  
By the end of the first phase of this project , TPPR will have been registered , its Website will have become functional , its client base will have been expanded , a Guide to trade-support services in Palestine will have been published , training will have been provided to TPPR staff in cooperation with other Trade Points in the region and arrangements for wide and systematic dissemination of electronic trading opportunities ( ETOs ) will have been established .  
It provides a basic set of contractual provisions which can ensure that electronic commercial transactions may subsequently be concluded by commercial partners within a sound legal framework .  
It was considered to have been an important occasion for taking stock of legal and regulatory developments at the national and international level , enabling experts to give consideration to all legal aspects of electronic commerce , including their impact , problem areas and possible solutions .  
The combination of those three dimensions would be increasingly valuable as electronic commerce moved away from the areas in which it was first developed ( i.e . business-to-consumer and service activities ) to areas in which developing countries had a good chance of building or restoring a competitive advantage ( i.e . business-to-business , commodities , and manufactured and semi-manufactured goods ) .  
" 17 .  UNCTAD , in cooperation with other relevant international organizations and within existing human and financial resources , should seek to assist developing countries , upon request , in understanding the implications of various legislative approaches to accommodating electronic commerce ; "  
Paragraph 6 : as electronic commerce is rapidly spreading to many sectors of activity and regions , concerted action is required in order to allow all potential traders to rely on simplified , compatible procedures and practices , and to make the best possible use of modern technologies to lower costs of international trade transactions worldwide ;  
It was noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
In contrast , the benefit expected from the Uniform Rules in favour of certain techniques , which were recognized as particularly reliable , irrespective of the circumstance in which they were used , was to create certainty ( through either a presumption or a substantive rule ) , at or before the time any such technique of electronic signature was used ( ex ante ) , that it would result in legal effects equivalent to those of a handwritten signature .  
Widespread concern was expressed that an enhanced electronic signature would be considered as if it were a distinct legal concept , rather than just a description of a collection of technical criteria , the use of which made a method of signing particularly reliable .  
A view was expressed that the reference to article 7 of the Model Law in paragraph ( 2 ) of draft article 6 ( which was also useful as a reminder of the conceptual origin of the Uniform Rules ) was to be interpreted as limiting the scope of the Uniform Rules to situations where an electronic signature was used to meet a mandatory requirement of law that certain documents had to be signed for validity purposes .  
The view was expressed that , irrespective of whether draft article 6 established a presumption that the data was signed or a mere presumption that the electronic signature was technically reliable and linked to a given message , the burden of rebutting such presumptions might be too onerous in the context of consumer transactions , which might need to be excluded from the scope of draft article 6 .  
Examples were given of national laws specifically geared to electronic signatures , which dealt with the issue of liability of information certifiers simply by establishing that contractual clauses limiting the liability of such information certifiers should be treated as null and void .  
In the absence of minimal harmonization at the international level , national laws applicable through conflicts rules might thus impose extremely harsh standards that could potentially affect the growth and the global availability of electronic commerce techniques .  
For the purpose of investigating the crimes [ covered by this Convention ] [ established in articles . . . of this Convention ] , if permitted by the basic principles of domestic legal systems , States Parties shall take appropriate measures , when necessary , to permit their competent authorities to use special investigative techniques such as controlled delivery and electronic surveillance within their own territories .  
Policy-oriented analytical work should be carried out by UNCTAD on : ( 1 ) the impact of electronic commerce on trade policies ; ( 2 ) the fiscal and financial implications of electronic commerce ; ( 3 ) the implications for developing countries of the legal and regulatory aspects of electronic commerce ; and ( 4 ) the impact of electronic commerce on employment , productivity and economic growth .  
Each State Party shall , within its possibilities and under the conditions prescribed by its domestic law , take the necessary measures to allow for the appropriate use of special investigative techniques , in particular controlled delivery , electronic or other forms of surveillance , and undercover operations ( by its competent authorities in its territory ) for the purpose of effectively combating organized crime . 
The principal topics covered were the following : electromagnetic radiation , the reflective properties of various types of materials on the surface of the Earth and elementary optics ; electronic imaging ; georeferencing of objects in the field , on maps and on satellite imagery ; remote sensing for land use planning and environmental monitoring ; and Earth resources and environmental satellites .  
Funds means assets of every kind , whether tangible or intangible , movable or immovable , however acquired , and legal documents or instruments in any form , including electronic or digital , evidencing title to , or interest in , such assets , including , but not limited to , bank credits , travellers cheques , bank cheques , money orders , shares , securities , bonds , drafts , letters of credit .  
It was noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .

Transnational organized crime includes tax evasion , the forgery of clothes and electronic equipment , fraud against international financial institutions , unfair competition on international markets , industrial espionage , the import and export of protected plants and animals , trafficking in works of art and the illegal dumping of toxic industrial waste .  
To ensure the authenticity of all certificates , attachments and authorizations and any other documentation required to be submitted to authorities under these regulations , only original and certified copies shall be accepted or , if agreed to by the competent authorities of the countries concerned , the documentation may be transmitted by electronic means ;  
Furthermore , the efforts of UNESCO to link existing databases and identification systems to allow for electronic transmission of information concerning stolen cultural property , including those removed from areas of conflict and occupied territories , is viewed by my delegation as a primary weapon in the ongoing struggle to achieve an advantage over those engaged in the smuggling trade .  
The Commission had expressed its appreciation for the work accomplished by the Working Group in its preparation of draft uniform rules on electronic signatures , and at the same time had noted that the Working Group had experienced difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues arising from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures , and on how those issues might be addressed in an internationally acceptable legal framework .  
The participation of developing countries - in particular the least developed countries , and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies - and countries with economies in transition , and in particular of their enterprise sectors , in electronic commerce will be an essential ingredient for growth and wealth creation at the global level .  
Since then , the international community had started to devote more attention to the main policy , regulatory , legal , economic and technical issues underlying electronic commerce .  
The representative of India , speaking on behalf of the Asian Group and China , said that UNCTAD was a vital link in the chain of trust and mutual understanding that needed to be built and strengthened in the area of electronic commerce .  
Although not yet directly involved in electronic commerce , Mongolia , as a vast country located far from world markets and major trade routes , was eager to develop that promising form of trade and therefore welcomed the progress made on the draft uniform rules on electronic signatures .  
To some , it is an inevitable process driven by new technologies in electronic communication and transport , enabling information , persons , capital and goods to cross borders and reach the most remote corners of the globe at unprecedented speed .  
The need to adapt the provisions of domestic and international legal instruments to the specific requirements of electronic commerce has been emerging for some 15 years both at the national level and at the international level .  
A Bolero Bill of Lading is designed to replicate the essential business functions of a bill of lading via fast , efficient electronic messaging tracked in a central database operated by a trustworthy third party .  
The internal barriers to SME adoption of ecommerce include limited understanding of the complexity of electronic operations , inadequate skills and high initial investment required to develop a viable ecommerce strategy .  
Takes note with interest of the electronic mail-based news alert service distributed worldwide by the Department of Public Information , and emphasizes that extra care needs to be taken to ensure that news breaking stories and news alerts are accurate , impartial and free of any bias ;  
Three major issues have emerged from the workshops and consultations held and the feedback from country teams that have been involved in consultations with the World Bank as well as from the joint learning group on the CDF and PRSPs , which meets periodically and maintains continual electronic contact among its members : ( a ) enhancing national ownership of processes ; ( b ) improving participation of different actors , particularly civil society ; and ( c ) ensuring a substantive contribution of UNDP and the other United Nations agencies and entities .  
While UNAMSIL took over the substantive civilian and military components of UNOMSIL , as well as its assets , the significant expansion of the Mission necessitated commensurate strengthening of its civilian staffing establishment , logistical and technical support structures , the provision of additional communications , electronic data-processing and other equipment , acquisition of vehicles and contracting additional air assets .  
During the biennium 2002-2003 , emphasis will be placed on better utilization of interpretation capacity ; further integration of the text-processing and electronic publishing functions into a single electronically supported work process through the more versatile utilization of staff resources , leading to greater efficiency ; and improvement of composition and graphic work by increasing in-house productivity through the use of new technologies and through contractual arrangements .  
Concern was expressed that , depending on the decisions to be made by the Working Group with respect to articles 2 and 13 , the remainder of the draft provisions might need to be re-examined to avoid creating a situation where the standard set by the uniform rules would apply equally to electronic signatures that ensured a high level of security and to low-value certificates that might be used in the context of electronic communications that were not intended to carry significant legal effect .  
It was noted that the Working Group on Arbitration had already begun discussing ways in which current legal instruments of a statutory nature might need to be amended or interpreted to authorize the use of electronic documentation and , in particular , to do away with existing requirements regarding the written form of arbitration agreements .  
The view was expressed that technical interoperability , while it constituted a desirable objective , should not be regarded as a theoretical prerequisite for cross-border use of electronic signatures .  
It was noted that the Working Group on Arbitration was considering ways in which current legal instruments of a statutory nature might need to be amended or interpreted to authorize the use of electronic documentation and , in particular , to liberalize existing requirements regarding the written form of arbitration agreements .  
The prevailing view within the Working Group , however , was that , although the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce was a useful basis for modernizing domestic legislation or interpreting international instruments , the legal barriers to the development of electronic commerce posed by international instruments , in particular multilateral treaties and conventions , required special attention .  
Thus , an analysis by the Working Group of legal issues related to the creation of electronic substitutes for paper-based transport documents would be a meaningful contribution to that other project , as it might result in the development of specific electronic commerce-focused provisions that might , at an appropriate time , become an integral part of that new international regime expected to be developed by the Commission .  
In view of the urgent need for the introduction of the legal rules that would be needed to bring certainty and predictability to the international regime governing Internet-based and other electronic commerce transactions , the view was expressed that the Working Group should initially focus its attention on issues raised by electronic contracting in the area of international sales of tangible goods .  
As regards the particular issue under consideration , the Working Group agreed , however , that the place of conclusion of a contract , as traditionally understood in private international law , might not provide sufficient basis for a workable solution in an electronic environment and that other , more modern concepts , such as the notion of centre of gravity of a contract or other related notions , might also be considered .  
Takes note with interest of the electronic mail-based news alert service distributed worldwide by the Department of Public Information , and emphasizes that extra care needs to be taken to ensure that news breaking stories and news alerts are accurate , impartial and free of any bias ;  
In fact , many applications being developed to benefit citizens , such as digital libraries , electronic museums , distance education and training , distance medical services and other public social services , must be based on the development of local content industry .  
Under the direct supervision of the Chief , GIS Cell ( GISC ) , the incumbent would be responsible for the overall operating , developing and implementing of the GIS-related matters in terms of logistics in peacekeeping operations ; provide geographic / terrain analysis using GIS technology , produce terrain studies and predict the effects of weather , terrain and logistics situations in peacekeeping operations , compile textual , graphic products from text , electronic format of geographic data ( vector , raster , satellite images ) and other sources of data .  
Urges States and encourages the private sector to promote the development by the media , including the print and electronic media , including the Internet and advertising , taking into account their independence , through their relevant associations and organizations at the national , regional and international levels , of a voluntary ethical code of conduct and self-regulatory measures , in order : ( a ) To combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and do away with stereotypes ;

Influencing information resources in the area of credit and finance , for example by the unauthorized transfer or outright theft of bank resources , the closing of accounts and , in particular , mounting electronic attacks to block the computer networks of central banking institutions , could obviously not only create crisis situations in that particular area but also bring about the countrys total economic collapse and , inevitably , cause serious complications in its international relations .  
The unprecedented development of corporate , State and international information systems and the simultaneous expansion of opportunities of access to them have attained such a level that today practically every member of the international community will be exposed to a real risk of electronic attack by criminals or terrorists .  
The advent of electronic data interchange , enabling documents such as customs declarations to be transmitted in advance of arrivals ( by ship , train , aircraft etc . ) , has facilitated forward planning by transport operators , port authorities , customs and other agencies , leading to fast customs clearance of goods and to improving transit times of ships and other means of transport , thereby reducing the overall cost of international trade .  
Regarding the economic situation in Asia one panellist expressed the view that pessimism was exaggerated despite the regions dependence on exports of electronic goods , a still incomplete process of banking and corporate restructuring , and a decline in the stock markets steeper than in most developed countries .  
His Government would be giving top priority in the coming four years to creating an information society based on science and new technologies , by , inter alia , introducing computer education for students , teachers and civil servants , and using computer networks to centralize access to government services ; developing a long-term science and technology strategy ; promoting electronic business ; and using an integrated communications network to fight organized crime , drug-dealing and illegal immigration .  
The Expert Meeting on Electronic Commerce and International Transport Services : Best Practices for Enhancing the Competitiveness of Developing Countries examined the impact of electronic commerce on international transport services , including economic and operational as well as legal and documentary aspects thereof , and decided to bring the following conclusions and recommendations to the attention of the Commission on Enterprise , Business Facilitation and Development at its sixth session .  
It was further stressed that a number of legal questions raised by electronic commerce could be addressed through contractual arrangements as preliminary measures pending adjustments to the legal framework .  
Being of the opinion that the establishment of model legislation to facilitate the use of electronic signatures in a manner acceptable to States with different legal , social and economic systems could contribute to the development of harmonious international economic relations ,  
Because of the expansion and the increase in travel within the Mission area it also planned to replace obsolete or faulty mobile phone sets provided to political and civil affairs units , and , therefore , the electronic voice mail system known as CarLog is requested in 2002 .  
Data received from the SAC-C satellite are used to study the terrestrial and marine environment , assess desertification , monitor flooding , forecast agricultural production , monitor the atmospheric temperature and vapour content of water with a view to determining the variability of the atmospheric structure , perform measurements of the geomagnetic field with the same level of accuracy attained by observatories , measure atmospheric space radiation and its effects on advanced electronic components , determine the migratory route of the southern right whale and verify methods used in determining satellite attitude and velocity .
