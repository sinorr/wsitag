" All industrial nations should implement sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that are necessary to sustain robust domestic demands and hence , create multiple engines to promote economic growth , " he said . 
The official said that since last year the central government had requested a strengthening of macroeconomic regulation but due to the misunderstanding of some local governments and firms the first quarter of the year still saw an obvious surge in new projects and a comparatively large amount of fixed assets investment , resulting in a fast growth in monetary credit .  
The central bank has introduced a number of policies recently .  The comprehensive utilization of various monetary policies is identical to the aforementioned " slow braking " currently required for macroeconomic regulation .  
For the last two years , aimed at the changed international and domestic economic situation and the domestic deflation trend that has appeared , the Chinese Government has sized up the time , adjusting its policy promptly , making the key decision to expand domestic demand , and taking a series of macroeconomic regulation and control steps , the main substance of which is pursuing an active fiscal policy . 
Having coolly analyzed the economic situation at the time , carried out thorough investigation and study , and extensively listened to the suggestions and views of experts and scholars , the central authorities held a timely meeting , looked into and set out a policy of further strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control , and readjusted the intensity and specific measures of the fiscal policy .  
main measures to be taken should meet the requirements of strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control , optimizing the economic structure , properly scheduling key state projects , truly improving the people 's livelihood , actively increasing employment , ensuring social insurance work , and ensuring sustainable development .  
and the major measures should meet the requirements for strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control , optimizing the economic structure , planning state key construction projects well , effectively improving people 's living standards , actively promoting employment , and succeeding in social security work and sustainable development .  
With the establishment of the market economic system , the change of the macroeconomic situation and , the increase of the total national economic strength , the not high enough quality of the economy in Beijing 's suburbs , its weak ability to adapt to changes , and its insufficient staying power for development are manifesting themselves ever more clearly , and they are becoming the important factors restricting Beijing 's agricultural and rural development .  1 .  
Second , the Financial and Economic Commission holds that the draft of the 2000 plan for national economic and social development and the general requirements for the economic work are proper , the main targets and tasks set forth in the plan are positive , the macroeconomic control policy is in line with the actual conditions of economic development , and the main measures are feasible .  
In the fields of comprehensive supporting reforms , they set up the system for the common development of multiple economic sectors , the system for the operations of state-owned assets , the system for macroeconomic regulation and control , the market system , the social security system , and so on .  
In the face of the new situation of insufficient effective demand in the last two years , the central government put forward the fundamental policy of expanding demand and implemented a proactive fiscal policy and other supporting macroeconomic policies .  It issued additional treasury bonds and increased investment in infrastructure construction and technological transformation to bring along bank lending and nongovernmental investment and expand investment demand .  
Since the western countries instituted capitalist market economy , pollution , unemployment , and polarization between rich and poor have occurred all the time ; hence their governments have no alternative but to undertake the functions of improving efficiency , regulating income distribution , and stimulating macroeconomic stability and growth .  
It must be noted that with the end of the economy of shortage , low-standard surpluses are reflected in most fields of merchandise , that our economic structure does not meet the needs of the new macroeconomic situation , and that if the economic structure is not promptly readjusted and optimized , it will be difficult to maintain sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development .  
In general , economic issues have been relatively outstanding subjects discussed at G-7 and G-8 summits .  Examples are macroeconomic management , international trade , and relations with developing countries .  Meanwhile , however , the summits have preserved a very clear political and ideological tradition .  
In order to increase domestic demand and stimulate economic growth , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council pursued a proactive fiscal policy for three consecutive years , thus creating a fine macroeconomic environment for the process of reforming state enterprises and lifting them out of difficulty .  
During the early period of the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan , in the light of the outstanding issues in the economic life , containing inflation was regarded as the priority task of macroeconomic control and moderately tight financial and monetary policies were implemented , and measures for comprehensive control were adopted , thus reversing the situation of high inflation .  Under the circumstance of still maintaining a relatively high level of economic growth rate , the soaring prices have returned to a relatively low level , thus the national economy smoothly realizing a " soft landing . "  
However , the party central leadership and the State Council displayed its strategic insight , grasped the trend in the development and changes of the domestic and foreign economic situation , resolutely readjusted the orientation of macroeconomic control , and made a timely decision on shifting the primary task in macroeconomic control from curbing inflation to expanding domestic demand and overcoming deflation .  
In dealing with both inflation and deflation , the party central leadership and the State Council consistently gave play to the role of the market as the foundation for distributing resources , comprehensively employed various economic levers , employed necessary legal and administrative means as supplements , and accumulated rich experience in conducting macroeconomic readjustment and control .  
APEC should make great efforts to promote economic and technological cooperation and add new dimensions to such cooperation .  In addition , based on the lessons learned from the financial crisis , it should further enhance macroeconomic coordination among its members .  The meeting of finance ministers should serve as a major mechanism for its member economies to exchange views on the economic situation , publish important economy-guiding information , and coordinate economic-development policies .  Similarly , work should be done to make the meeting of central bank governors a mechanism for coordinating banking activities .  
Examples are building early-warning and preventive mechanisms , forming an APEC financial early-warning group ( composed of finance ministers of major economies and financial experts ) , enhancing macroeconomic coordination , establishing emergency financial assistance mechanisms , enacting APEC rules for financial activities , supervising the flow of large amounts of capital in the region , and setting up financial personnel training organizations to raise the financial operational and management ability of developing economies .  
China sustained , rapid , healthy development during the period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan must first be attributed to the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the center .  Their outstanding leadership skill in economic control and in flexible economic adjustment brought about the success , as did the incisive reforms by the macroeconomic adjustment departments .  The increased pace of the change of functions provided the beneficial conditions .  
The main role of the government is to create a favorable macroeconomic environment for structural readjustment by improving macroeconomic regulation and control , pressing ahead with reform , restoring market order through economic policy , providing public services , and concentrating its energies on major projects .  
Fourth , optimize the organizational structure of the enterprises , appropriately merging enterprises in the same industries through the market mechanism which maintain the good and eliminate the bad and through macroeconomic regulation , ensure full competition among enterprises , form a pattern dominated by large enterprises and suited to the coordinated development of enterprises of all sizes .  
First , macroeconomic regulation and control will be intensified and improved in a bid to maintain macroeconomic stability , push forward the strategic economic structural adjustment , and guarantee the country 's economic security through working out economic and social development plans and macroeconomic policies that primarily depend on the application of economic and legal means . 
During the period of the 10th Five-Year Plan , we should work closely around the goal of expanding domestic demand and adopt practical and effective macroeconomic fiscal policy and monetary policy to stimulate domestic market demand for investment and consumption in order to promote economic growth and upgrade the industrial structure .  
The recently published " Blue Paper on Chinese Economic Forecasting , " which was put together by several well-known economists , predicts that China 's GDP will grow about 7.8 percent this year , barring a major deterioration in the international economic environment and provided that the Chinese government continues to base macroeconomic regulation and control on an active fiscal policy , properly coordinates the various macroeconomic regulatory and control measures , and further stimulates domestic demand .  
On 29 April , Li Ruogu , assistant president of the People 's Bank of China and deputy Chinese director of the IMF , called on developed countries to make greater effort to coordinate their macroeconomic policies , maintain the stability of exchange rates between major currencies , and thus create a better external environment for economic growth in developing countries .  
Ding Jiye : Mainly in three aspects : First , we institute categorized budget management , that is , military expenditure is divided into two main categories , sustained expenditure and construction expenditure , according to the nature of the use of the funds ; these two categories are budgeted separately , macroeconomic regulation and control is stepped up , and different focal points to be ensured are set down ;  
He said : China has successfully completed the Ninth Five-Year Plan . During that period , China built a preliminary socialist market economic system , further improved its macroeconomic regulatory system , and continued to push forward the program of opening up wider to the outside world ; and the country 's foreign trade and investments from abroad continued to grow noticeably .  
Through practicing macroeconomic regulation and control measures , with the focus on expansionist fiscal policy , in the past three years China has successfully withstood the blow of the Asian financial crisis and maintained the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
Some countries that were affected by the 1997 financial crisis have learned experience and a lesson from the financial crisis , and , therefore , in recovering their economies , have placed greater importance on adopting a macroeconomic policy tailored to meet the actual situations .  The current ADB annual meeting also stressed the need to assist developing countries to carry out economic restructuring , enhance their macroeconomic regulation and control ability , and build and refine a social security system , in order to ensure relatively high economic growth in this region .  
Liu Fuyuan pointed out : To perfect China 's macroeconomic monitoring system , it is necessary to set up a whole set of statistical systems aligned with international standards , fully use advanced networking technologies , and further enhance the level of data processing .  
Speaking of their visit in France , Xiang Huaicheng indicated that he and French Financial Minister Laurent Fabius had held a fruitful meeting at which they discussed ways to strengthen mutual financial and monetary cooperation , and exchanged views , and reached an extensive consensus , on many issues , including the international macroeconomic situation , social security issues , and multilateral and regional cooperation .  
Xiang Huaicheng said : " The fact that China is strengthening its financial and monetary exchange and cooperation with Germany and France is not only conducive to a smooth development in the friendly relations of our two sides ; but is all the more significant to promoting coordination between advanced countries and developing countries against the background of an economic globalization , to maintaining a stable global macroeconomic situation with joint efforts , and to establishing a rational international monetary framework as well as global economic rules . "  
Huang Qingyi said : Xu Rongkai has worked in both local and central departments and committees , including organs of the State Council . He is familiar with the work of macroeconomic management and social development and has rather rich practical experience in these fields .  He has a good knowledge of theories and policies , strong writing skills , and remarkable organizing and coordinating ability .  
Last year industrial enterprises owned by the state and those in which the state held a dominant stake of shares registered a profit exceeding the preceding year by 137.7-billion yuan .  According to estimates , 48 percent of this increase in profit was attributable to the improvement of the macroeconomic environment , and 23 percent was due to the direct effects of the policies adopted by the government to enable the enterprises to stop losses and earn profits .  
The latest issue of the Hong Kong journal Economic Reporter carries an article by Yuan Gangming , Director of the Macroeconomic Research Office of the Institute of Economics in the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences expressing the belief that strong domestic demand during the first half of the year supported China 's continued economic upswing , while the slowdown in exports threatened the macroeconomic upswing , estimating that policy options for encouraging exports in the second half of the year will encounter difficulties , and therefore proposing that China seek accelerated growth led by domestic demand .  
The article expresses the belief that China will join the WTO before the end of the year , the openness of the domestic market will be increased , and the traditional means used to control import growth will be reduced , so there may be a rather significant growth in imports , while net exports will decline further , perhaps to the point where the trade surplus becomes a trade deficit , which would have a fairly serious adverse effect on macroeconomic stability .  
We can still expect the national economic growth rate for the whole year to reach or exceed the 7 percent target that was determined early this year , provided that the global economy does not deteriorate further , weather conditions are basically normal , and the policy for macroeconomic regulation and control is implemented rather well .  
The informed person said that in a situation report submitted earlier to the State Council , the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation held that in the current circumstances , the macroeconomic policy has little impact on stopping the slide in exports because the root cause of the deteriorating export situation this year is the slide of the US economy , that has led to a global economic slowdown .  In China , it is unsuitable to adopt such measure as the devaluation of the renminbi to stimulate exports .  
Since the beginning of this year , our economy has continued to maintain a positive momentum of development .  This is a result of the fact that the central authorities keenly sensed the new changes in the world economy and , in good time , adopted a correct macroeconomic policy accordingly , and the whole nation worked as one in a down-to-earth manner .  It is also connected to the energetic endeavor to rectify and regulate the market economic order .  
and should build up and perfect a macroeconomic control and regulation system that can effectively resist the impacts of international economic fluctuations , and build up a whole set of operable and effective mechanisms for macroeconomic control and regulation that comply with international standards .  
Government departments must concentrate their energy in doing well macroeconomic control and creating a fine market environment .  In accordance with the demands of government operations laws and economic development laws , we must adjust the direct intervention of government in economic activities , changing the scope of this involvement to a more rational level , such as primarily organizing the production of public goods , developing public benefit undertakings , and providing public services .  
These successes , however , were mainly achieved because the central authorities increased market demand by adopting effective macroeconomic regulation and control policies , and at the same time compressed and knocked out surplus and backward productive capacity , thus creating a favorable market environment for enterprise development .  
We should no longer solidify the previous examination and approval system and the industrial policies of mercantilism , and the government should change its keynote of public policies to more open-minded industrial policies , which include steady and sound macroeconomic policies , transparent legal system , and better external public conditions and facilities .  
Judging from these situations , the overall environment of this year 's economic work is good .  The negative factors are that currently demand for essential goods is insufficient and the employment pressure has increased and probably will be quite reduced as the international economic situation has further turned for the better and as the effect and results of the state 's macroeconomic regulation and control measures gradually come into play .  
Its major achievements include increasing domestic demands through macroeconomic regulation and control , helping state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises turn losses into profits , increasing export , implementing the strategy for developing the vast western region , and reaching accords with the United States on China 's accession to the World Trade Organization [ WTO ] .  
While giving less attention to economic growth target , the government will give macroeconomic guidance to the major problems in economic development from an even higher level .  For instance , in vigorous promoting economic restructuring , the government will give consideration to the changes at the present stage of the domestic economic development and to the increasingly sharpened international competition .  Meanwhile , the government will not only manage to resolve immediate problems but also lay eyes on long-term development .  
In supply , China has abundant manpower and a fairly high savings rate .  Through primary industrialization , the material and technical basis for growth has been greatly enhanced .  The readjustment of the economic structure will further improve the growth mode of China 's economy and raise microeconomic and macroeconomic efficiencies .

In supply , China has abundant manpower and a fairly high savings rate .  Through primary industrialization , the material and technical basis for growth has been greatly enhanced .  The readjustment of the economic structure will further improve the growth mode of China 's economy and raise microeconomic and macroeconomic efficiencies .  
In accordance with the spirit of the relevant central decisions and the provisions of the relevant laws , central macroeconomic regulation and control matters such as currency issue , the fixing of standard interest rates , foreign exchange rate regulation , and readjustments of the main tax forms and rates , unified market activities regulations , and legal systems regarding foreign trade and investment by foreign companies must all be regulated in a unified way by the central authorities , and the localities are not permitted to lay down regulations on them .  
If the Chinese macroeconomic regulation and control departments ' recommendation of issuing additional treasury bonds is approved by the State Council and adopted by the National People 's Congress , it will be the third time running for the Chinese Government to issue additional treasury bonds in the second half year following the issuance of 100 billion yuan worth of additional treasury bonds in the second half of 1998 and 60 billion yuan worth of additional treasury bonds in the second half of last year .  
It is noteworthy that China experienced economic overheating from 1992 to 1993 .  From the summer of 1993 , the central authorities intensified and improved macroeconomic regulation and control , gradually cooling down economic overheating .  GDP growth was down from 14.2 percent in 1992 to 13.5 percent in 1993 , 12.6 percent in 1994 , 10.5 percent in 1995 , and 9.6 percent in 1996 .  
Such favorable turns and changes were mainly the results of effectively promoting economic growth through the implementation by the state of a proactive fiscal policy , a moderate monetary policy , a policy on industrial restructuring , and a series of measures for macroeconomic regulation and control ;  
Seen from the experiences of other countries in the world , to liberalize capital account management , it is generally necessary to have a stable macroeconomic environment , a sound financial system , effective supervisory capability , and immense , comprehensive national strength .  Presently China does not have all such conditions , and therefore it is still necessary to maintain capital account management .  
Judging from China 's economic development since 1993 , the central authorities have become more mature in macroeconomic regulation and control .  In addition to accumulating rich experience in controlling inflation , China has gained initial experience in vigorously checking the deflation trend .  
In view of this situation , the central authorities resolutely worked out major policy decisions to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control , and started with consolidating the financial and economic order .  To meet the demand of the new situation of building a socialist market economy system and of reform and opening up , they mainly adopted economic and legal means supplemented by essential administrative measures and adopted the " soft landing " method to deal with the overheated economy and inflation .  
To deal with the buffet brought by Asian financial crisis , China has shifted its attention from macroeconomic regulation and control to expansion of domestic demands since 1998 , implemented the proactive financial policy , striven to give play to the role of monetary policy , and comprehensively applied such economic levers as finance , banking , taxation , price , and income distribution to promote investment , consumption and export demands and bring along economic growth .  
We should build the state finance by making it secure , balanced , and strong and should give scope to finance 's macroeconomic regulation and control role , this being an objective and necessary requirement for steadily and healthily developing both the national economy and various social undertakings .  
Since the Asian financial crisis broke out in 1997 , in light of changes in the macroeconomic situation , by judging the hour and sizing up the situation , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council firmly came up with such a major policy decision as expanding the domestic demand and implementing a positive financial policy .  Expanding the domestic demand and implementing a positive financial policy have since played a crucial and key role in sustaining stable economic growth ;  
This year , our country 's economic operation has picked up with a strong momentum , for our major economic indices , such as investment , export , and so on , have risen quickly ; our consumption temperature has gone up ; and our macroeconomic situation has witnessed a continued turn for the better , which has further attested to the results of expanding the domestic demand and implementing a positive financial policy . 
Li Lanqing finally stressed : We should continue to work hard and ensure that all this year 's budgetary tasks will be fulfilled .  In the first half of this year , our country 's macroeconomic situation witnessed a significant turn for the better and our financial revenue tended to rise rapidly , and this has laid a sound basis for us to fulfill this year 's tasks .  
Since 1999 , the state has been pursuing a series of active fiscal and macroeconomic regulation and control policies to drive domestic demand and expand consumption .  For instance , it has issued an additional 60 billion yuan in treasury bonds , raised the income level of low-income urban residents , extended holidays , and taken steps to stimulate exports .  
While the economy has taken a key turn and the stock market is skyrocketing , we also need to clearly recognize that deflation remains the key limiting factor to a macroeconomic rebound , with our inherent economic growth grounds remaining quite weak .  
The Japanese personalities attending the meeting universally expressed their admiration for the macroeconomic policies adopted by the Chinese government and the national economy that has maintained a sustained and rapid growth .  They also showed intense interest in the new situation that China will soon accede to the WTO and implement its strategy of developing the western region on a large scale .  
Statistics show that , during the first six months , China 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) grew 8.2% , industrial added value increased 9.9% , the total retail value of social consumables was up 10.1% , investments in fixed assets grew 12.1% , and foreign trade exports increased by 38.3% , so each of the macroeconomic indicators continues to develop in a good direction .  
Recently , individuals in economic circles have pointed out that the major turnaround we are seeing in macroeconomic operations shows that the various macroeconomic regulatory measures - - primarily the aggressive fiscal policies - - implemented by China are having a significant positive effect , creating a golden historical opportunity for China 's economic development .  
Zeng Peiyan said : For over two years now , we have been acting under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core to insist on pursuing an active fiscal policy and stable monetary policy , which has effectively brought into full play the role of all macroeconomic regulation and control policies .  
In addition to the macroeconomic situation and relevant policies , the main factors bearing on the trend of the automobile market in the second half of the year are as follows : First , the state is determined to screen and rectify various consumption-restricting policies , which will be conductive to stimulating domestic automobile consumption .  
In the second half of the year , the macroeconomic situation is taking a turn for the better , and the competitive environment of the telecommunications market is continuously improved ; telecommunications rates will undergo structural readjustment , and their general level will drop , which will greatly stimulate the demand for communication business .  The communication business can be expected to continue its rapid increase .  
As a matter of fact , we did not make any substantive adjustment to the tax preferential policies toward foreign investors .  In 1997 , we intended to adjust the tax referential policy in terms of import equipment , but owing to the changes in macroeconomic situation such as the Asian financial crisis , we suspended the policy adjustment .  
For many years , the NPC and its standing committee have formulated a large number of laws to standardize the main body of the markets , maintain the market order , and practice macroeconomic regulation and control , thereby safeguarding the healthy and orderly development of the socialist market economy .  
An analysis from the macroeconomic point of view shows that China 's economy will be growing at an average annual growth rate of over 7 percent in the next five years .  Investment , consumption , and export , which form the " troika " that pulls the economy forward , have close , mutually complementary , and mutually supporting relations with foreign investments .  
Today , when being interviewed by Xinhua , Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng said that in the period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , China positively and actively applied the financial policies to conduct macroeconomic readjustment and control , and this played a major role in maintaining the sustained , high-speed , and healthy development of the national economy , promoting reforms in all fields , and safeguarding social stability .  
He pointed out : The positive financial policy being put into practice since 1998 has effectively driven economic growth , promoted the increase in financial revenues , successfully brought about a major turning point in the national economy in the first months of this year , created a favorable environment for reform and development , and also enriched our experience in macroeconomic management .  
Recently , Japan 's business circles have expressed their optimism in the correct macroeconomic policies adopted by the Chinese government to maintain the sustainable and rapid growth of the national economy and have shown keen interest in the new situation of China 's imminent entry into the WTO and its implementation of the strategy of developing the western region .  
The Chinese government made flexible use of fiscal policies in light of changes in the macroeconomic situation to promote the sustainable , rapid and sound development of the national economy during the Ninth FYP period , thus making an important contribution to the enrichment of experience in macro-control .  
The great development of the western region requires the combination of the government 's macroeconomic control and regulation with the functioning of the market mechanisms , and requires active exploration of new ideas , new methods , and new mechanisms for the development of the western region , which will be carried out and pushed forward in an orderly way with priority given to selected key fields . 
He said , viewed from the industry , state-owned enterprises depend heavily on the high international oil prices , the low interest rates of banks , the conversion of debts into shares , the relief of their social functions , and other measures at the macroeconomic level .  Internal factors at the microeconomic level , such as the lowering of the costs of enterprises , the improvement in quality , and the readjustment and optimization of structure are still insufficient .  
The meeting maintained that , like cracking down on smuggling and foreign exchange fraud , the crackdown on export rebate fraud is an important political assignment as well as an urgent economic struggle ; and that this struggle is greatly significant for tightening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control , increasing revenues , and promoting a healthy economic development , as well as for managing the country according to the law and for consolidating and regulating the markets ' economic order and stamping out corruption in society .  
Uphold the guideline of expanding domestic demand , continue to practice an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy , and make comprehensive use of various means of macroeconomic regulation and control , to consolidate and develop the good momentum of economic growth .  
Li Lanqing said in his letter that under the leadership of the party 's central committee and the State Council , significant headway has been made in financial reforms and tremendous achievements have been scored in the financial work over the past few years , as a result of practicing the proactive financial policies and intensifying and improving the macroeconomic regulation and control in finance , which have promoted the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
At present , financial departments at all levels should foster the idea of managing the public finance in a conscientious way and change their financial management model from the old tradition of laying more weight on distribution than on management , more weight on examination and approval than on supervision , and more weight on microeconomy than on macroeconomy to the practice of intensifying macroeconomic regulation and control , macroscopic management , and financial supervision .  
We must adhere to the principle of expanding domestic demand , continue to implement a proactive financial policy and a moderate monetary policy , comprehensively use all means of macroeconomic regulation and control to consolidate and develop the good situation of economic growth and promote the sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy and comprehensive social progress , and strive to make a good start in fulfilling the Tenth Five-year Plan .  
Wu Yi said , under the " Ninth Five-year Plan , " China successfully overcame a series of foreign economic and trade problems , especially those created by the Asian financial crises ; the many undertakings continued to expand to become an important driving force behind the nation 's economic development , playing an important role in promoting macroeconomic stability and increasing the country 's comprehensive national strength .  
Facts have proved that implementation of a proactive fiscal policy and issuance of government bonds for long-term development to increase investment is a correct policy decision adopted by the party Central Committee . It represents a successful practice of ours in resolving problems that we encounter on the way forward through continued development and in adjusting our macroeconomic control policies in a timely manner in light of changes at home and abroad .  
With development over the years , the organization has established a five-level work mechanism - - informal meeting of APEC leaders , ministerial meeting , senior officials meeting , and the committees and work group and secretariat under senior officials meeting .  The organization 's work involves cooperation in a broad area , including trade and investment liberalization , economic and technological cooperation , and dialogue on macroeconomic policy .  
This round of institutional reform and reorganization in the State Economic and Trade Commission and its subordinate state bureaus is another major step for forming a streamlined , unified , and highly efficient administrative structure .  This step is of great significance for achieving the goal of completely separating government institutions from enterprise management , transforming government functions , establishing and improving the socialist market economic system , enhancing the work efficiency of the government institutions , and enhancing macroeconomic control .  
Being a developing country , China can not afford to send an excessive amount of capital abroad at this stage .  Having considered changes in our macroeconomic situation , we decided to raise a new topic , namely , allowing mainland residents to invest in the B-share market with legitimate earnings in foreign exchange .  
The improvement of the state 's macroeconomic environment mainly included the adoption of a proactive financial policy and moderate monetary policy , the expansion of domestic demands , and the promotion of economic growth by means of investment , consumption , and export , which have played an excellent role in improving the external environment for enterprises ' production and operation .  
Presently , excessive export of capital is still unsuited for China , being a developing country .  Allowing domestic residents to invest in B shares with their legally owned foreign currencies , therefore , is a new subject stemming from the changes in the macroeconomic situation .  
A person in charge of the CSRC said that the current policy readjustment was made mainly due to the consideration that marked changes have taken place in the macroeconomic situation regarding the capital movement of foreign exchange in China , and corresponding adjustments to the market orientation , rules , functions , and so on have been put forward in line with the requirements of the national economic development .  
This is because we have initially established the socialist market economy structure , and accumulated more experience in macroeconomic management and in regulation and control ; and we have overcome difficulties caused by insufficient effective domestic demand through implementing the guideline of expanding domestic demand and practicing an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy .  
In the arrangement of contents , every effort has been made to reflect the requirements of the socialist market economy , and highlight its strategic , macroeconomic , and policy-related character , the spheres where the government should play a principal role , the major issues that have a bearing on the overall situation of the immediate and long-term development , the new domains and new tasks of economic and social development , as well as its operability .  
from investment to consumption and to other fields , a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy have been implemented flexibly , the policy of expanding domestic demand has been resolutely pursued , and measures for macroeconomic regulation and control have been highly effective .  
Decision-making power for monetary policy must be vested in an agency that is both independent but accountable ; other macroeconomic policies must be harmonised ; and structural policies must support the flexible adjustment needed to accommodate shocks .  
Despite the uncertain macroeconomic outlook , credible fiscal consolidation has to begin in fiscal year 2003 .  This will require the implementation of sizeable structural deficit reduction measures in fiscal year 2003 and a commitment to more substantial consolidation , supported by concrete measures , in the next three years . "  
More broadly , Directors emphasized that Hong Kong SAR 's traditional strengths-flexible labor and product markets and strong legal and institutional frameworks-would need to be complemented by sound macroeconomic policies and productivity-increasing structural reforms .  
To be efficient , public expenditure planning needs a coherent macroeconomic framework in which the institutional capability is shared between the ministries of finance and planning , the central bank and the statistical office .  
To improve this coordination at a technical level , some countries have established joint task forces of senior officials of these ministries and agencies to undertake key economic projections of the main macroeconomic variables .  
A suitable regulatory , legal and supervisory environment is a crucial element in effective private sector development , macroeconomic structural programmes , development of entrepreneurship and effective capital market development .  
Reforms have concentrated on promoting sound macroeconomic policies , price liberalization , an increased role for the private sector coupled with a more focused role for the public sector , as well as measures to increase agricultural production .  
To the extent that foreign direct investment frameworks became similar , other factors assumed great significance ; these included appropriate legal framework good governance , and a stable political and sound macroeconomic environment .  
The usual policies to bring about domestic economic stabilization and adjustment included standard macroeconomic management components , as well as shifting to more liberal trade and investment regimes .  
Sound macroeconomic policies , a strong fiscal system , the development of human resources in environmental management and administrative efficiency are essential for successful internalization .  
Sound and sustainable macroeconomic policies , political stability , good governance , physical and institutional infrastructure and human resource development are a prerequisite for encouraging increased investment in Africa ;  
Development planning and project evaluation should seek to droughtproof vulnerable areas , strengthen coping strategies , foster effective local , national and international institutions , and adopt sound macroeconomic policies ;  
Instead of coordinating their macroeconomic policies , however , the industrialized countries had sought to resolve their domestic problems in a purely national or restricted multilateral context .  
A conducive external environment was essential , and the developed countries should employ sound macroeconomic policies , particularly in the area of trade liberalization , financial flows and monetary stability .  
The rational and efficient administration of macroeconomic and sectoral policies , as well as the application of clear , relevant and consistent rules , are indispensable prerequisites for achieving and maintaining economic and social stability .  
The Islamic Republic of Mauritania which , since 1984 , has been engaged in a determined battle that aims at restructuring the Mauritanian economy despite difficult domestic , regional and international conditions , has made tangible progress towards restoring the macroeconomic balance and reducing its foreign debt , a fact that is attested to by international financial institutions . 
We are pleased to report that our Government has assigned the highest priority to the maintenance of macroeconomic stability through the implementation of a consistent and coherent set of monetary , exchange-rate and fiscal policies .  
The objective of these reforms is the removal of structural rigidities in order to correct the existing macroeconomic imbalances and lay the foundation for sustained economic growth .  
As clearly stated in the report in document A / 50 / 490 , financial systems in Africa are unsophisticated , narrow and shallow , due mainly to general underdevelopment , inappropriate macroeconomic policies and pervasive Government intervention in credit allocation .  
Invites Governments to undertake systematic reviews of each major component of their macroeconomic policy frameworks and to take measures to address any unwarranted disincentives for healthy and progressive informal and small and medium-sized productive sectors , and to create an enabling environment for the scientific and technological community to take initiatives to link technologies , in a participatory manner , with entrepreneurs from those sectors ;  
The subjects and emerging issues to be addressed in greater detail , both globally and for major countries and groups of countries , will include the following : output and income , macroeconomic policy-making , the world energy situation , international trade and trade policy , international transfers of financial resources and financial cooperation , and other selected social and economic issues of a more structural nature .  
Implementing sound and stable macroeconomic and sectoral policies which encourage broad-based , sustained economic growth and development that is sustainable and equitable , generate jobs , and that are geared towards eradicating poverty , reducing social and economic inequalities and exclusion ;  
Pursuing the coordination of macroeconomic policies so that they are mutually reinforcing and conducive to broad-based and sustained economic growth and sustainable development , as well as substantial increases in productive employment expansion and a decline in unemployment worldwide ;  
Implementing macroeconomic and microeconomic policies in accordance with national priorities and policies , aimed at encouraging greater domestic savings and investment required for public spending , through progressive , fair and economically efficient taxes which are cognizant of sustainable development concerns , and through cutting back on subsidies that do not benefit the poor ;  
With regard to part I of the report , dealing with the country 's general , economic , political and legal framework , she noted that although Bolivia had historically faced problems of extreme poverty and instability , in its first decade of democracy progress had been made towards the macroeconomic stability that was essential to social policy .  
It is suggested that macroeconomic frameworks conducive to mobilizing financial resources be developed and that the allocation of significant resources through partnership agreements and bilateral or multilateral arrangements be continued and enhanced .  
Adjustment programmes are designed to promote both macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform , and thereby to lay the foundations for high quality growth - a prerequisite for a sustainable and equitable improvement in living standards .  
Analysis of the major factors behind the observed behaviour of commodity prices reveals that conventional factors , such as the prevailing macroeconomic conditions in industrialized countries , are estimated to have contributed in only a limited way to the recent weakness in real commodity prices and that the expansion in the supply of commodities played a fundamental role .  
Positive and negative developments in the external and national policy environments as well as successful and unsuccessful macroeconomic and microeconomic policies are reflected in the amount of resources available for the financing of cross-sectoral issues and sectoral finance .  
Pursue and implement sound and stable macroeconomic and sectoral policies , designed with the full and equal participation of women , that encourage broad-based sustained economic growth [ in the context of people-centred sustainable development ] [ sustainable development centred on human beings ] , address the structural causes of poverty and are geared towards eradicating poverty and reducing gender-based inequality ;  
Implement sound macroeconomic and sectoral policies , designed and monitored with the full participation of women , that encourage broad-based sustained economic growth in the context of [ people-centred ] sustainable development [ centred on human beings ] , address the structural causes of poverty and are geared towards eradicating poverty and reducing gender-based inequality . 
It was considered that good governance , including accountability and transparency , a sound and stable macroeconomic policy framework , consistent and effective policies for reform and structural adjustment , taking into account the social dimension , creation of favourable conditions for market-oriented development and foreign direct investment were equally critical to success ;  
Colombia is a unique case in Latin America , a country in which moderate and persistent inflation has attracted the attention of important national and international analysts who have been able to provide sound macroeconomic explanations for that inflation ; such experts have never resorted to the explanation contained in the DEA report .  
The subjects and emerging issues to be addressed in greater detail , both globally and for major countries and groups of countries , will include the following : output and income , macroeconomic policy-making , the world energy situation , international trade and trade policy , international transfers of financial resources and financial cooperation , and other selected social and economic issues of a more structural nature .  
The main reasons included a shortage of resources , both domestic and external , the lack of an appropriate macroeconomic framework in several countries and , in some cases , various crises - political and / or natural - that interrupted economic activity .  
" Pursue and implement sound and stable macroeconomic and sectoral policies that are designed and monitored with the full and equal participation of women , encourage broad-based sustained economic growth , address the structural causes of poverty and are geared towards eradicating poverty and reducing gender-based inequality within the overall framework of achieving people-centred sustainable development . "  Paragraph 60 ( d ) .  
One can not emphasize enough the importance of debtor countries ' adherence to policies that will correct macroeconomic disequilibria , maintain a stable economic environment and make relative prices reflect real resource costs .  But these policies are not sufficient in themselves to promote fast and sustainable growth in the countries concerned , and that is the key to any strategy - as for middle-income countries - that envisions growing out from under a debt overhang .  
For most developing economies in Asia , success in maintaining their growth rates lies in continuing their high levels of domestic savings , in broadly based human capital development , in improving the competitiveness of domestic markets , in their openness to foreign capital and technology , and in improved macroeconomic management .  
Pursue and implement sound and stable macroeconomic and sectoral policies that are designed and monitored with the full and equal participation of women , encourage broad-based sustained economic growth , address the structural causes of poverty and are geared towards eradicating poverty and reducing gender-based inequality within the overall framework of achieving people-centred sustainable development ;  
Implicit in this approach is that women 's ability to compensate at the household level for the decline in output and for changes in the composition and level of aggregate demand is treated as infinitely elastic , obscuring the impact of macroeconomic policy on the human resource base of economic activity .  
This in turn is likely to have a negative impact on international economic competitiveness , balance of payments and economic growth , as the shortfall in human skills resulting from the adverse impact of macroeconomic policy remains unaccounted for and unplanned for in terms of appropriate supportive measures and resources , thus rendering the policy unsustainable .

The first question raises macroeconomic issues concerning domestic saving and the net transfer of foreign saving to developing countries ; the second question raises microeconomic issues concerning the role of government and the financial sector in intermediating between savers and investors .  
It was noted that the effect of sound and efficient policies at the micro-economic level as well as the impact on individual and small group initiatives can be blunted by inconsistent or unbalanced macroeconomic policies .  
Successful countries have been those that have been capable of attracting a high level of external capital inflows while , through active macroeconomic policies , avoiding the over-heating of domestic demand , excessive exchange rate appreciation and volatile interest rates .  
NULLThe Working Group also concluded that foreign direct investment was attracted most strongly to those countries that had adopted measures to strengthen their domestic technological capability and created an overall policy framework conducive to innovation , investment in infrastructure , intellectual property protection , human capital formation and a stable macroeconomic and regulatory environment .  
NULLIn the light of those findings , the Working Group , in its general conclusions , confirmed that efforts towards promoting technology transfer and technological capability-building in developing countries and countries in transition need to be coupled with market-based trade and investment policy and pricing systems , and with a stable macroeconomic environment for business activity conducive to overall economic growth and employment . 
The formal financial system in Africa has faced a number of internal and external constraints , including inadequate technical and managerial capacity , antiquated legal and regulatory frameworks , inappropriate macroeconomic policies and pronounced government intervention , that not only hampered its growth but actually caused significant disintermediation in a number of countries .  
While historic factors such as the low level of African incomes and inadequate domestic technical expertise and capacity explain a part of this situation , it is also the general perception that inappropriate macroeconomic policies , combined with an antiquated and ineffective legal , regulatory and prudential framework , have been the main impediments .  
The implementation of a sound macroeconomic policy framework is seen as a key determinant of future financial stability and rapid economic recovery .  
Among the key issues which should be addressed were poverty eradication , global macroeconomic policy coordination , industrial development , economic diversification and the development of infrastructures , improved resource flows , including debt relief ; commodities policy ; human resource development and capacity-building .  
Urges the international community to promote a supportive international economic environment by adopting favourable macroeconomic policies for promoting sustained economic growth and sustainable development , so as to allow and sustain the full and effective implementation of the Programme of Action by the developing countries ;  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Governments bore the primary responsibility for formulating appropriate strategies , policies , programmes and actions to combat poverty ; the effort required sound macroeconomic policies , structural changes and the mobilization of domestic resources , inter alia , through more equitable tax regimes and a reduction in military expenditures .  
Urges the international community to promote a supportive international economic environment by adopting favourable macroeconomic policies for promoting sustained economic growth and sustainable development , so as to allow and sustain the full and effective implementation of the Programme of Action by the developing countries ;  
concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of drought followed by excessive rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,  
Urges the international community to promote a supportive international economic environment by adopting favourable macroeconomic policies for promoting sustained economic growth and sustainable development , so as to allow and sustain the full and effective implementation of the Programme of Action by the developing countries ;

The macroeconomic reforms and adjustment programmes of a wide range of least developed countries had not been successful during the first half of the current decade owing to an overall unfavourable external environment .  
macroeconomic factors which lay beyond the control of the countries of the southern hemisphere , where the vast majority of refugee populations were to be found , had impoverished those countries even further , leading to massive outflows of people seeking better living conditions .  
Although these models have generated deceptive , apparently attractive macroeconomic indicators , in practice they go hand in hand with an increase in poverty , marginalization , environmental degradation , disease , ignorance , social conflict , a loss of national resources and sovereignty in short , with the most brutal and increasingly irreversible underdevelopment .  
The core objectives of the programme were , inter alia , to create and adjust the country 's macroeconomic policy , ensure a correct legal and regulatory framework for the development of a strong market economy , provide a transparent and accountable policy framework aimed at promoting investment , allocate adequate budgetary resources for social programmes , create the necessary conditions for the establishment and consolidation of democratic institutions and support good governance and political stability .  
The definitive solution to the problem of the external debt , of ownership and of a considerable improvement in national , foreign and private investment , in the framework of a sound and responsible macroeconomic policy favouring internal savings and contributing to improving the standard of living of the Nicaraguan people , must be our goal .  
The efforts of developing countries in carrying out trade and macroeconomic reforms aimed at sustained economic growth can be impeded by the use of unilateral actions by major economies , in particular those with extraterritorial effects .  
This is being achieved through the pursuit of a sound and stable macroeconomic policy , supported by a prudent and disciplined fiscal and monetary stance , and the delivery of an investor-friendly institutional legal framework .  
Emphasizes the need to implement sound and stable macroeconomic , micro-economic and sectoral policies that encourage broad-based economic growth and development that is sustainable and equitable , that generate jobs and that are geared towards eradicating poverty and reducing social and economic inequalities and exclusion ;  
The favourable risk assessment was based on the generally sound macroeconomic policies and continued economic liberalization pursued by most Governments as well as the high rates of domestic investment and savings .  
Stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Emphasizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
Deeply concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of drought followed by excessive rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,  
The technical analysis , along with policy proposals reflecting a set of priorities at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels , should help in the elaboration of objectives for the rehabilitation and restructuring of the economy with a view to absorbing the surplus labour force , diversifying trade , achieving an adequate rate of growth in income and ensuring its equal distribution among regions .  
The eradication of poverty requires , inter alia , sound macroeconomic policies aimed at creating employment opportunities , equal and universal access to economic opportunities ( and special efforts to facilitate such access for the disadvantaged ) ; education and training that will promote sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen productive employment and work , and basic social services , including health facilities . 
The coordination of macroeconomic policies at all levels so as to achieve an international financial system that is conducive to stable and sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
In addition to their direct social and local economic consequences , natural disasters affected the macroeconomic standing of countries , increasing debt , reducing foreign income due to loss of exports and reducing overall production outputs .  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
The policies and measures in support of these objectives set out in the Programme of Action revolve around the following major areas : establishment of a macroeconomic policy framework conducive to sustained economic growth and long-term development ; development and mobilization of human resources ; development , expansion and modernization of the productive base ; reversing the trend towards environmental degradation ; promotion of an integrated policy of rural development aimed at increasing food production , enhancing rural income and enhancing non-agricultural sector activities ; and the provision of adequate external support .  
The domestic factors include : civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some LDCs and the resulting social and economic burdens , political instability , macroeconomic imbalances , manifested in large fiscal and balance-of-payments deficits , in many cases the unfavourable short-term impact of macroeconomic policy adjustments on specific areas , in particular the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of the population , and poor performance of the productive sectors including lack of adequate physical infrastructure .  
However , while most developing countries and countries in transition are enthusiastic about encouraging foreign investment in mining , not all are capable of making the necessary macroeconomic changes and implementing the necessary legal and fiscal regimes that would be acceptable to the international mining community in a timely manner .  
That has required close coordination of macroeconomic policies among major industrial countries to prevent the harmful effects on national economies of any adverse market reactions to actual or perceived changes in national economic situations and associated policies . 
However , the success of the policies followed depends on the underlying preconditions for private sector development , including stable and credible political conditions , law and order , and the continuity of policies which in themselves must be credible , consistent and transparent , as well as stable macroeconomic conditions .  
Most of them continued progressing towards macroeconomic stability with growth , but with notable weak spots , and in many cases their growth was not sufficient to reduce the social deficits accumulated in earlier years .  
But the most important prerequisites for the successful mobilization of foreign and domestic resources are confidence in the financial system and appropriate macroeconomic policies , a well-established and clear legal and regulatory framework , a transparent and non-distortionary taxation system , a stable domestic financial system , and adequate infrastructure .  
In developing further the orientation and objectives of national strategies , the Commission may wish to focus on the identification of characteristics of poverty which could be common to most countries , regardless of their definition of poverty and which could be used to measure progress ; the identification of elements for elaborating national strategies comprising macroeconomic , structural , distributional and regulatory policies , together with specific short - and long-term objectives ; and the further identification of specific international actions .  
An appropriate economic framework based on sound macroeconomic policies , a well-developed infrastructure , strengthened institutions and capacity , as well as meeting basic human needs such as shelter , and providing social welfare , were recognized as key factors for addressing the poverty problem .  
The ESCAP secretariat continued to monitor , review and analyse the economic and social development situation in the region and disseminated relevant information to policy makers and others to make possible better understanding of the macroeconomic policies conducive to sustained economic growth , poverty alleviation and the integration of environmental concerns into macroeconomic decision - and policy-making processes .  
Throughout the year , the ESCAP Pacific Operations Centre offered advisory and technical assistance to Pacific island countries in development programming , central banking , macroeconomic policy formulation , financial systems , trade promotion , development of port infrastructure and macroeconomic management , and provided short consultancies upon specific requests .  
Although most of the countries in Latin America continued progressing towards macroeconomic stability with growth , which is so essential for creating an atmosphere conducive to strengthening regional cooperation , in many areas their growth was not sufficient to reduce the " social deficits " accumulated in earlier years . 
Measures to enhance socio-political stability and good governance and to secure sound macroeconomic policies that will be conducive to private foreign and domestic investment should be strongly encouraged .  
With regard to the external debt , it is also relevant to point out the Declaration of the Support Group for Nicaragua of 16 April 1996 , which considers that , within the framework of a sound and responsible macroeconomic policy that encourages domestic savings , resources released as a result of a comprehensive approach to the debt problem should be used to support productive and social development .  Alleviation of the external debt burden would thus help to eliminate widespread poverty among the Nicaraguan population .  
This is a sign that confidence in at least the medium run is being restored and that key institutional reforms , as well as a reasonable degree of macroeconomic and political stability , are being attained .  
Comprehensive national forest strategies that are consistent with and integrated into macroeconomic planning and policy and take into account the strategic value of forests as a capital base for national sustainable development need to be developed in order to facilitate mobilizing funds for sustainable forest development from various sources .  
It stressed the need to implement sound and stable macroeconomic , microeconomic and sectoral policies that encouraged broad-based , sustained economic growth and development , and called upon the international community to seek to mobilize additional financial resources that were both adequate and predictable to contribute to poverty eradication .  
The objective of eradicating absolute poverty required a broad range of policies and actions at all levels : an appropriate economic framework based on sound macroeconomic policies ; a well-developed infrastructure ; strengthened institutions and capacity ; as well as programmes designed to meet basic human needs ;  
The Government 's development efforts in the last three months have centred on encouraging passage by Parliament of two key laws related to the structural adjustment programme - civil service reform and modernization of public enterprises , maintaining the macroeconomic balance necessary to attract private investment and reactivating externally financed public investment to improve the country 's infrastructure and provide a much-needed stimulus to domestic demand .  
The major tasks to be addressed in the post-election phase of Bosnia and Herzegovina 's economic development include , inter alia , rapid installation of State institutions , implementation of sound macroeconomic policies , adoption of a legislative framework conducive to the transition to a market economy and continuing the reconstruction efforts .  
Cancelled : ( ii ) role and implications of macroeconomic policies for promotion of regional economic cooperation ; ( viii ) one issue on new and innovative ways to develop and strengthen industrial and technological skills : and ( x ) one issue on technology indicators and directories of selected research and development institutions , experts and technologies .  
They called upon the developed countries to make every effort to coordinate their macroeconomic policies , including through multilateral institutions in which developing countries are represented , so as to stimulate the world economy through increased demand , stabilized markets and further liberalized trade , and thereby provide a conducive international economic environment for development .  
Deeply concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,  
But it should be noted that , while innovation and competitiveness are activities of enterprises , success in innovation depends on a wide range of external factors , including the domestic institutional and social environments , national macroeconomic policies , incentive structures , the availability of skills , the local supply base , and the level of investment and linkages .  
The Government has the power to establish the right macroeconomic environment , as well as a transparent , stable and predictable legal , regulatory and tax framework , and thus create favourable conditions for entrepreneurial and enterprise development .  By acting as a catalytic or intermediating agent , including through appropriate policies and a supportive business infrastructure , it can stimulate , facilitate or support the development of enterprises , particularly SMEs , and of inter-firm cooperation , both internally and with foreign firms .  
Accordingly , the Governments role should be confined to its core functions , namely creating a sound legal and macroeconomic framework , protecting the environment , ensuring order and security and providing infrastructure , education , social protection and essential public services .  
Deeply concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,  
Notes that while sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country to promote macroeconomic stability are essential elements for determining the volume and structure of private capital flows , international macroeconomic policies play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness , and should contribute to creating a favourable international economic environment ;  
Proposals aimed at enhancing broader cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policies among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , as a means of promoting a stable international economic environment conducive to sustained economic growth , particularly in developing countries ;  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Emphasizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly of developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
These included macroeconomic stability , high rates of domestic saving , maintenance of sound financial intermediaries , high priority given to human resource development ( especially to high _ quality primary and secondary education ) , competitive exchange rates , export orientation , a supportive environment which rewarded entrepreneurship and allowed open and constructive dialogue between government and the private sector regarding objectives and policies , and governance which balanced the promotion of social cohesion and consensus with that of competition between individuals and companies .  
In his view , the role of Governments was to create a stable macroeconomic and political environment , to put in place a competent and effective administration , and to create a juridical framework that favoured private investment and guaranteed the maximum development of human resources .  
While such authoritarianism on the political front should not be replicated in other developing countries , the East Asian experience did show the positive role which Governments could play in development by providing not only a good macroeconomic environment but also policies giving appropriate importance to agriculture and basic social services , as well as to the establishment of effective and secure financial systems . 
Notes that while sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country to promote macroeconomic stability are essential elements for determining the volume and structure of private capital flows , international macroeconomic policies play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness , and should contribute to creating a favourable international economic environment ;  
Proposals aimed at enhancing broader cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policies among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , as a means of promoting a stable international economic environment conducive to sustained economic growth , particularly in developing countries ;  
This climate - amounting to a virtual social psychosis - is aggravated by the stringent economic pressures felt by ordinary people as a result of macroeconomic structural readjustment measures .  
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society and the creation of more and better jobs requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
In this context , the international community should explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact on the international financial system .  
The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including , inter alia , macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .  
As Mali sees it , any work towards sustainable development is above all a national responsibility , through the effective definition and application of sound macroeconomic policies , based on transparency , the pre-eminent rule of law , the practice of democracy , respect for human rights , social justice , and the participation of all in the effort of national development .  
I have already stated that the United Nations must play a constructive and catalytic role , within its macroeconomic policies to facilitate economic growth for sustained development , thereby enabling developing countries , which constitute the vast majority of the Members of the Organization , to have an equal share in the opportunities for wealth creation .  
Nevertheless , the prudent advice for policy makers in capital-importing countries would be , first , to seek to build and retain investor confidence through their own cautious macroeconomic policy-making and , second , to remember that international financial markets can become highly volatile and subject to herd instincts and thus capable of moving vast volumes of funds out of , as well as into , countries on short notice .  
Briefly , almost all the capacity-building initiatives supporting the themes mentioned in Agenda 21 can be grouped into eight main areas - environmental strategy and policy , macroeconomic strategy , consensus-building , environmental management capacity , normative and legal frameworks , scientific and socioeconomic research , technology transfer and public outreach .  
Against this backdrop , the Survey is organized as follows : chapter I briefly describes how the developing ESCAP region fares in the emerging global scene ; chapter II shows the recent performance of individual countries in terms of selected macroeconomic and social development indicators which impinge on participation in the globalization and regionalization processes ; chapters III and IV analyse the benefits and risks of integration into the international and regional economy focusing on foreign trade and external finance ( including FDI ) . 
The elements of macroeconomic balance and stability , such as inflation , fiscal deficits and current account deficits ( which reflect the gap between domestic savings and investment ) are widely acknowledged to affect foreign trade and external financial inflows through their effects on interest rates , exchange rates , rates of return on investments and credit ratings , among others .  Sources : ESCAP , 1995 ESCAP Population Data Sheet ( Bangkok , 1995 ) ; United Nations , World Population Prospects : The 1994 Revision ( United Nations publication , Sales No .  
Overall Socioeconomic Perspective for the World Economy ; six working papers on selected macroeconomic issues , including changing world patterns in income distribution , relationships between economic growth and trade , the relationship between economic growth and merchandise trade , financing the social safety net in services , emerging issues in development finance in the twenty-first century and possible strategies for international development in the twenty-first century ;  
The deferral of two expert group meetings , one on the macroeconomic effects of drug trafficking in selected developing countries and economies in transition and the other on new forms of international cooperation in law enforcement with particular reference to the problems of transit States , has affected the level of understanding of drug trafficking patterns in the geographic areas in question . 
In addition , the Committee will promote the implementation of measures designed to strengthen economic cooperation and integration among African countries ; assist African countries and their intergovernmental organizations in making the policy instruments for economic cooperation and integration of the African region more effective ; and identify measures to coordinate and harmonize micro - and macroeconomic policies among African countries as a prerequisite for accelerating regional economic integration . 
Noting that much of the environmental degradation results from unsustainable lifestyles in the industrialized world or poverty and underdevelopment in developing countries , which itself is the result of inequitable growth patterns , unfavourable terms of trade and investment flows , and a global macroeconomic environment that is not supportive of the development of developing countries ,  
An international enabling environment also requires coordination of macroeconomic policies by the international community which foster conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and low fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments , technologies and knowledge to developing countries , and new and additional financial resources from all sources .  
An essential component of an enabling environment for development is sound national macroeconomic policies and the creation of favourable conditions for investment and increased domestic savings , including through the creation of a sound banking system .  
These include weak domestic employment capacity , uneven sectoral growth , weak intersectoral articulation , severe marketing bottlenecks , poorly coordinated and fragmented new investments in both public and private ventures and structural imbalances among macroeconomic aggregates .  
As they moved along the path of reform , their objectives became more complex and ambitious , shifting from the limited concerns of macroeconomic imbalances and stabilization to the promotion of development by a plethora of market-oriented reforms , including the improvement of economic efficiency , curbing of public sector intervention , encouragement of the private sector and liberalization of the external trade sector .  
The resulting improved and sustained macroeconomic stability in several least developed countries and the good weather conditions and strength in the international demand for the exports of African least developed countries are the main reasons for the third year of relatively strong growth and rising per capita output in the least developed countries .  
The General Assembly is encouraged to direct all of its committees and bodies and draw the attention of other bodies of the United Nations system to the need to mainstream a gender perspective systematically into all areas of their work , in particular in areas such as macroeconomic questions , operational activities for development , poverty eradication , human rights , humanitarian assistance , budgeting , disarmament , peace and security , and legal and political matters ( para .  12 ) .  
Whilst a sound and stable macroeconomic and microeconomic policy was essential , basic transport , power and telecommunications infrastructure were identified as the most important physical elements , coupled with mechanisms for encouraging investment in the processing industries , for promoting the provision of export credit and trade finance , for ensuring the control of product quality and for building managerial capacity .  
Successful enterprise development is affected by a conducive economic environment in terms of the macroeconomic , regulatory and legal frameworks , the structural characteristics of the national economy , the degree of market development , the institutional framework , the infrastructural and human resource base and the quality and coherence of government policies .  
For developing countries , the primary motivation is the formation and consolidation of viable economic spaces that would create dynamic trade and investment growth , develop viable , integrated and competitive productive systems to serve regional and international markets , strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination and enhance infrastructural linkages .  
In Madrid in October 1994 , the Interim Committee of IMF adopted a declaration on a partnership for sustainable global growth , 4 which the Committee updated and broadened at its autumn ( northern hemisphere ) meeting in 1996.5 This set of international guidelines for macroeconomic and financial policy was intended as a framework for policy-making by all IMF members and to guide the Funds policy discussions with members . 
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies in each country for promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty and the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society , and the creation of more and better jobs , requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
In this context , the international community should explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries and monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact on the international financial system .  
The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .  
Development called for the private sector to act as the engine of sustained economic growth , in partnership with the public sector , which played a crucial role in basic infrastructure and services and in establishing and maintaining sound macroeconomic policies , protecting human rights and the environment and creating a conducive legal environment for private investment and entrepreneurship .  
In order for developing countries to be able to attract private capital flows , they must maintain good governance , sound macroeconomic policies and close , cooperative working relations with international financial organizations .  
The problem of the widening industrialization and technology gap is acknowledged to be particularly acute in sub-Saharan Africa , with 33 of the world 's 48 least developed countries , while macroeconomic stabilization programmes have been adopted by most African countries since the early 1980s in an attempt to create an enabling environment for long-term growth , they have usually not included any specific measures to promote industrial development .  
In an indicative list , the Council identified macroeconomic questions , operational activities for development , poverty eradication , human rights , humanitarian assistance , budgeting , disarmament , peace and security , and legal and political matters as areas where gender mainstreaming needs to be pursued systematically .  
Expressing its concern that a number of developing countries , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , have become more vulnerable to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate of private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Recognizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries and monetary and financial authorities and institutions so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly of developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
Recognizes the benefit of exchange rate stability and a stable financial environment , and the potential impact on all countries of lack of stability in the foreign exchange markets , and in that regard invites the International Monetary Fund to fully exercise its mandate to sustain effective surveillance over the underlying macroeconomic policies of its member countries , in particular those countries whose economies are particularly relevant for the stability of the international monetary and financial system ;  
This encouraging trend has been achieved through the adoption and pursuit by Governments of policies and measures aimed at ensuring , among others , macroeconomic stability , inflows of foreign direct investment , open and free markets and stable and transparent legal and regulatory frameworks .  
In the area of macroeconomic policy , we have proceeded to liberalize the trade and exchange regimes to foster enhanced competitiveness ; streamline the incentive framework ; privatize State-owned enterprises to promote increasing levels of private investment ; promote entrepreneurial activity through , among other measures , a venture capital regime ; and to modernize and strengthen intellectual property legislation to encourage investment and the transfer of technology .  
A growing number of countries on our continent , including my own country , Ethiopia , have taken decisive measures to liberalize their economies , to cut Government spending , to institute sound macroeconomic policies and to enhance the role of the private sector and civil society .  
For meaningful development to take root in the developing countries , an enabling international environment should be established which can address such issues as macroeconomic stability , more open trade regimes in developed countries , stable financial systems , reasonable debt initiatives , such as those proposed under the World Bank 's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and greater financial flows from developed countries to the developing countries .  
Thus , he introduced Agenda Venezuela , which contained a comprehensive and coherent set of policies that include programmes of macroeconomic stabilization , institutional reforms , social benefits and productive restructuring .  
Without a supportive external economic environment that includes cooperation in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies , trade liberalization , mobilization of new and additional financial resources , financial stability , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , and productive investment in technologies , our efforts would be akin to trying to roll uphill .  
In the face of the tendency of global financial markets and international financial institutions to demand fiscal and monetary austerity , especially of the weaker economies , constraining both national and international economic growth , there is a need to develop new national and international policy instruments to promote growth and employment while maintaining macroeconomic stability . 
Economic , social and political stability , including stable macroeconomic policies , have been a major factor in encouraging domestic savings and investment and attracting FDI in the more successful developing countries .  
In view of the increasing importance of trade and international investment as engines of growth , developed countries must provide comprehensive support , including macroeconomic support , to the efforts of developing countries , as agreed at various OECD ministerial meetings and the summits convened by the seven major industrial countries .  
Developing countries are concerned that private capital flows are concentrated in a few developing countries ( 12 countries accounted for about 80 per cent of total private flows and three quarters of FDI in developing countries during the first half of the 1990s ) , mostly middle-income countries in Asia ( which accounted for about two thirds of the expansion of total private flows ) and Latin America that have adopted outward-looking strategies and sound macroeconomic policies .  
Thus , adopting an integrated treatment of the bases of economic growth , by not only ensuring macroeconomic balance and stability but also directing attention to the industrial base and incentive structures , may do much to enhance the viability of policies that address the environmental and social aspects of sustainable development in individual countries .  
At the end of the three-year period , it would be possible to evaluate the degree to which the objectives had been attained and on that basis decide whether work on enterprise development represented an important contribution to development and therefore whether it should form part of the elements presented for ministerial consideration at UNCTAD X . In short , work on an enterprise development strategy must be based on a strategic vision , the elements of the strategy must contribute to growth and development without jeopardizing macroeconomic stability , and the strategy must be amenable to evaluation . 
This role was manifested at two levels : at the macro level in terms of creating an enabling environment , good macroeconomic policies , a sound legal , regulatory and tax framework and political stability ; and at the micro level inter alia through providing appropriate support measures and structures and investing in capacity _ building , including in the areas of education , training and health .  It could create an environment in which the private sector knew what was happening .  
However , while macroeconomic stabilization was a necessary but not sufficient condition for enterprise development , structural adjustment and liberalization measures had produced encouraging positive results such as the emergence of an enterprise culture and increased entrepreneurial activities to take advantage of the enlarged economic opportunities for the private sector arising from such measures .  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Emphasizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly of developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
Policies for promoting domestic resources mobilization should include macroeconomic and structural reforms , public expenditure reforms , the promotion of environmental taxes and charges , a review of existing subsidy policies , and financial sector development to promote personal saving and access to credit , taking into account the characteristics and capabilities of individual countries .  
The two major crises that broke out in Bulgaria and Albania in 1996 - and which are still unresolved , although progress has been made in Bulgaria - underlined in a dramatic fashion the fragility of the transition process in some countries and demonstrated how misleading and dangerous it can be to focus on changes in a few macroeconomic variables such as indicators of progress and success .  
The most effective means of reducing poverty is the adoption of national development strategies , including sound macroeconomic and structural policies , which encourage sustainable growth that increases income-earning opportunities for the poor and develop the human resources of the poor , particularly through broad access to education , health and family planning services .  
The top-down approach seeks to create an enabling or " fostering " environment , which provides the right incentives for small firms , together with enough positive support and protection ( e.g . against unfair practices of larger competitors ) to allow such firms to make the best of their potential . 4 The top-down approach seeks to improve the business environment by operating on macroeconomic variables such as prices , government regulations and policies , by providing legislation and enforcement , and by building up the physical infrastructure . 
Missions , in response to ad hoc requests from Governments , on issues of economic reform ; improving macroeconomic stability ; restructuring government budgets and designing taxation and public expenditure policies ; facilitating the transition to a market-based economy ; and efficient management of public enterprises and creation of viable public institutions ; ( ii ) Group training .  
The above calls for coordination in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies by major industrialized countries to create and sustain conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments and technologies and appropriate knowledge to developing countries , as well as new and additional financial resources .  
The objective of the case studies was to examine the role of the United Nations system agencies in assisting countries to create an appropriate macroeconomic and social framework , which would entail exploring instances where the successful development of an enabling environment had been enhanced through United Nations system agency support and inter-agency coordination , or where the lack of such coordination proved to be detrimental . 
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society and the creation of more and better jobs requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
In this context , the international community should explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact on the international financial system .  
The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including , inter alia , macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .  
In this regard , the Netherlands stated that institutional and human capacity , a reliable regulatory and a supportive legal system , as well as stable and sound macroeconomic policies , were among the central building blocks to attract domestic and international capital to finance development .  
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 49 / 122 of 19 December 1994 , the analytical work and technical cooperation of UNCTAD related to small developing States , which also supports the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , is aimed at preventing the phenomenon of marginalization faced by those countries in the global economy , and involves assistance to national macroeconomic policies and improving their micro-economic trade environment .  
In order to attract FDI , countries were invited to continue initiatives in such areas as a stable macroeconomic environment , transparent and accountable public administration , respect for property rights and the rule of law , the quality of labour , improvement of infrastructure , entrepreneurial and institutional capabilities and simplified administrative and regulatory frameworks .  
This performance reflected the combined effects of a variety of factors : the results of most countries efforts to control severe macroeconomic imbalances in 1995 , adverse climate conditions which affected primary production , and the drop in the international prices of the main export goods .  
A number of comprehensive country-level employment reviews were undertaken , the framework of which encompassed the major features affecting the level and quality of employment , including national macroeconomic and sectoral policies covering such issues as savings , investment and enterprise development ; labour market policies and institutions ; democratic policy-making and social dialogue ; gender discrimination and child labour ; and trade and capital flows and migratory movements .  
Among the recommendations made in the report were an emphasis on the importance of increasing economic growth rates in order to increase the rate of employment growth , and a recognition that this would require political and social as well as macroeconomic stability ; the importance of moderating the excesses of structural adjustment strategies ; an acknowledgement that for certain countries , a more gradual and selective approach to trade liberalization may be warranted ( ibid . , para . 25 ) ; and the value of policy incentives to offset market failure .  
At the national level , that decision had been expressed in the processes of trade liberalization , privatization , macroeconomic stabilization , modernization of the public sector , combating corruption , reduction or elimination of public deficits and more efficient use of public resources .  At the international level , MERCOSUR was a basic element in the strategy for dynamic integration of the economies of its members into the global context and for peace-building in the region .  
The explanation for that situation lay in the accumulation of such factors as poor physical infrastructure , a generally unskilled labour force , high levels of indebtedness , high inflation and small domestic markets , problems which the African countries must face up to by seeking to establish sound macroeconomic equilibrium and suitable infrastructure , and by investing in social programmes to promote the integration of their people in the global system .  
Each developing country should adopt macroeconomic policies conducive to domestic savings and investment , which had more impact on growth than external contributions , and should stress human resources development , education and health at the social level and respect for the rule of law at the political level .  
That measure was important for what could be called a sound macroeconomic policy ; however , coordination proper , in the sense that countries jointly established monetary or fiscal policies , was a thing of the past , since it had proved to be ineffective , as had been indicated in the World Economic and Social Study , 1995 .  
Experts identified five main areas of potential policy incoherence : between macroeconomic policy and microeconomic policy ; between public and private sector bodies involved in SME support services ; between the federal and local levels ; between implementation and design ; and between internal and external policies .  
Recognizing the potentially adverse impact of large fluctuations among the major international currencies on developing countries , Ministers consider it imperative that the Fund fully exercise its powers to ensure effective surveillance over the macroeconomic policies of the countries involved in the management of these currencies .  
Fourth , the content of international development cooperation must be constantly revised in the light of the new characteristics and needs of the world economy , and the effective participation of developing countries in macroeconomic policies must be strengthened . 
The treatment of the interrelated subjects of trade , finance , technology and investment , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies and their social impact in the international context , should be substantive issues in the political debate conducted in the Committee , since the General Assembly was not only the supreme political body at the intergovernmental level but , above all , the most democratic body in existence .  
But these bold reforms , whose positive macroeconomic results can already be measured , have rarely been accompanied by an improvement in the international environment and therefore have not allowed for a genuine economic take-off .  
They should pursue sound macroeconomic policies , strive to increase domestic savings and investment , strengthen institutional , legal , regulatory and supervisory capacities and improve economic management in the public and private sectors .  
A stable macroeconomic environment when accompanied by low inflation , competitive exchange rates , manageable public debt , democratic institutions and principles of good governance was conducive to increased domestic and foreign investment .  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
Sound macroeconomic policies and a legal and economic framework that enhanced the growth of a dynamic private sector were seen as essential in improving countries capacity to trade .  
The Committee noted that the improved economic performance of LDCs in recent years was mainly attributable to their own sound macroeconomic policy reforms , undertaken under most difficult domestic and external conditions .  
The Board noted that the improved economic performance of LDCs in recent years was mainly attributable to their own sound macroeconomic policy reforms , undertaken under most difficult domestic and external conditions .  
The Board noted that the improved economic performance of LDCs in recent years was mainly attributable to their own sound macroeconomic policy reforms , undertaken under most difficult domestic and external conditions .  
In terms of national strategies , many countries had undertaken policies aimed at strengthening fiscal performance , increasing domestic savings , strengthening financial sectors by improved regulation and monitoring and greater capital requirements , and increasing macroeconomic stability .  
To be most effective in achieving sustainable forest management , economic instruments should be designed with a specific policy objective in mind ; they should also be well integrated into the broader macroeconomic and multisectoral policy context .  
Recognizes also the importance of appropriate policy responses to the challenges of globalization at the national level , in particular by pursuing sound and stable domestic policies , including , inter alia , sound macroeconomic and social policies , so as to realize the objective of the eradication of poverty ;  
The continuing Asian crisis , which was taking place in countries considered to have dynamic economies based on sound fundamental macroeconomic variables , had clearly shown that macroeconomic stability could not by itself ensure the level of stability that a sustained development-oriented industrial strategy required .  
The report of the Director-General of UNIDO ( A / 53 / 254 ) included a highly justified critique of the so-called gradual approach to economic and industrial development , which posited a first stage of macroeconomic reforms , followed by a second stage of socio-economic , institutional and legal reforms .  
Until the causes of the current vulnerability of the international economy were determined , it should not be forgotten that the adoption of sound macroeconomic policies and the implementation of far-reaching institutional reforms were essential for the achievement of comprehensive and equitable social and economic progress .  
In that framework , the State played a central role , in cooperation with civil society and economic agents , in counter-balancing the adverse effects on the poor of structural adjustment and macroeconomic policies .  
The recent financial turmoil had shown that countries must maintain constant vigilance over all economic , financial and institutional parameters in order to guard against the volatility of other markets and contagion effects , and that each country needed not only sound macroeconomic fundamentals , but also a strong financial and banking system with adequate supervisory and regulatory mechanisms , transparency and good governance .  
The leaders of the MERCOSUR countries had been stressing for some time the need to promote closer cooperation between monetary authorities at the global level , better coordination of the macroeconomic policies of countries which had the greatest impact on international finances , proper supervision of agents in international financial markets and stabilization of currencies that were the subject of speculation .  
These activities are expected to contribute to the deepening of the regional cooperation and integration process in Africa , including effective trade liberalization , coordinated and convergent macroeconomic and sectoral policies , and to the promotion of increased investments in infrastructure development in the areas of transport and communication , energy and water and the exploration and exploitation of minerals through enhanced regional cooperation .  
Only 82 of the 185 States Members of the United Nations reported the full set of major macroeconomic aggregates in the last five years . 19 This is despite the fact that economic statistics , and in particular national accounts , are well-established statistical areas , with internationally agreed upon standards and methodologies and with a history of data collection . 
As noted in document E / CN . 5 / 1999 / 4 , although the multilateral financial institutions have acknowledged the importance of protecting or compensating the poor for the adverse effects of adjustment measures , the poor nevertheless continue to bear the brunt of hardships arising from macroeconomic and structural adjustment .  
More contemporary national and international discussion of how to achieve a balanced approach to macroeconomic policy could be very valuable , focusing on how to simultaneously address economic and social goals , such as full employment , low inflation and development in the fullest sense , including both efficient economic growth and an effective strategy for increasing equity .  
Indeed , in the future , investors will look more carefully at macro - and microeconomic policies [ 24 ] , most particularly at : high economic growth rate , the degree of exchange rate stability , level of foreign exchange reserves , general macroeconomic stability , health of domestic banking system , quality of stock market regulatory framework , quality of domestic accounting / disclosure standards and degree of investors rights protection .  
Four advisory missions each on macroeconomic policy and economic reform in countries with economies in transition ; policy responses to social impacts of the economic crisis ; institution-building for integrating environmental considerations into economic decision-making processes ; macroeconomic policy and related institution-building in least developed and Pacific island developing countries ; and promotion of sustainable development in small island developing States ; ( ii ) Group training .  
Enhance the capacity of institutions in developing countries to formulate development strategies by strengthening their ability to monitor national subregional , regional and international macroeconomic trends and incorporate them into the national framework for economic and social policy-making ;  
ACC stressed the critical importance of sound macroeconomic policies as well as economic reforms that balance growth with social investment for achieving accelerated and sustained economic growth , without which a sustained reduction in poverty is not possible .  
Internal enabling environment : policy framework incentives for domestic private savings , equitable tax systems ( development and enforcement of ) , macroeconomic policies , disincentives to corruption ; good governance ; transparency ; effective regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector ; banking infrastructure , pension funds ; corporate governance ; internationally accepted accounting standards , and a sound legal system ( land and property rights ) ;  
They also continue a good record of cooperation with the Department in the area of research and policy analyses , and collaborate in monitoring and analysing the emerging global and regional trends and macroeconomic policies in their respective major publications , namely , the World Economic Survey and the regional economic and social surveys .  
Having reviewed and shared experiences with tax reforms in their various countries , the Ministers agreed to reinforce macroeconomic stability and deepen financial market and institutional reforms , as well as to ensure sound interest and exchange-rate policy management so as to enhance private and public savings .  
They resolved to take the necessary steps to stem and reverse capital flight , focusing on policies that create and sustain a consistent and stable macroeconomic policy environment , and promoting capital and financial markets development , as well as resolving the problem of unsustainably high external debts .  
Projects aimed at the strengthening of macroeconomic management capacity , legislative systems , the legal framework , the judiciary , civilian police and election management capacity , along with mechanisms for political reconciliation , public administration and civil service reform , inter alia , must be explored , particularly in Kosovo , taking advantage of national human resources , experience and skills .  
The coordinated cuts in interest rates in late 1998 proved effective in avoiding a further deterioration in the global economy at that time , but the global consequences of a move in the opposite direction are untested under the prevailing macroeconomic environment where a number of largely intangible factors , such as investor confidence , play such a critical role .  
We welcome the progress made through the chairmanship of the European Commission and the World Bank towards establishing a donor coordination process to develop a coherent international assistance strategy for the region , opening the door for all donor opportunities , as well as to mobilize additional financial support for reconstruction , regional integration , economic recovery and reform and to promote sound macroeconomic and structural policies by the countries concerned .  
In this era of heightened financial volatility , the importance of sound macroeconomic fundamentals has become paramount : a sustainable fiscal position and current-account balance , a low or moderate rate of inflation , and consistency between the rate of inflation and the exchange rate are indispensable for any economy , as all economies are open ( albeit to different degrees ) .  
It is now increasingly recognized that the response to crises has to address the domestic social consequences of any economic measures that are adopted and should not be restricted to restoring macroeconomic stability and international financial confidence .  
The current IMF-monitored economic programme put in place in November 1998 as a follow-up to the 1997 / 98 programme is designed to maintain macroeconomic stability and make further progress in the area of structural reform while the political situation settles , and while a possible new enhanced structural adjustment facility programme is being considered .  
These include ( a ) strengthening macroeconomic stability and reducing distortions so as to encourage private sector investment ; ( b ) improving the quality of government spending in order to invest in basic social services and raise the level of human capital ; and ( c ) rationalizing the assistance provided by external donors .  
Governments should create an enabling environment for SMEs through stable macroeconomic policies and an open and flexible regulatory framework in order to stimulate free competition , research and development , and to create neutral conditions that fostered entrepreneurial activity , developed competitive advantages and created access to both national and foreign financial resources and new technologies .  
Governments are invited to intensify their efforts to create an enabling environment , including stable macroeconomic policies , a coherent and flexible regulatory framework that encourages free competition , efficient physical infrastructure and the necessary improvement in education and human resource development in order to promote SME upgrading and business and technological capability development .  
The experience of developing countries during the past several years has also demonstrated that financial crises are contagious ; that is , once difficulties emerge , markets do not adequately discriminate between countries with strong and weak fundamentals , or between those with strong and weak economic structures and macroeconomic management . 
The pursuit of sound , growth-oriented macroeconomic policies , moreover , needs to be complemented by a general social , legal and political environment conducive to the efficient functioning of markets and , in particular , to the development of the private sector , whose investment decisions are at the centre of growth .  
For developing countries to achieve the best results from domestic and international agricultural liberalization , for example , they needed to have a stable macroeconomic environment and a basic level of infrastructure ( e.g . transport , storage , communications and finance ) in place .  
There is also concern that the recent emphasis in financial and economic policies has not always been development-oriented , that the dominance of a limited set of macroeconomic targets and parameters over the social , political , cultural and environmental domains has gone too far , and that social and economic policies and objectives must be fully integrated .  
Governments are invited to intensify their efforts to create an enabling environment , including stable macroeconomic policies , a coherent and flexible regulatory framework that encourages free competition , efficient physical infrastructure and the necessary improvement in education and human resource development in order to promote SME upgrading and business and technological capability development .  
Governments should create an enabling environment for SMEs through stable macroeconomic policies and an open and flexible regulatory framework in order to stimulate free competition , research and development , and to create neutral conditions that fostered entrepreneurial activity , developed competitive advantages and created access to both national and foreign financial resources and new technologies .  
The sustainability of the recent growth performance of the least developed countries would also depend on increasing the level of gross domestic saving and gross domestic investment , the supply of critical skills and consolidation of political and macroeconomic stability .  
It noted the importance of strengthening an entrepreneurial environment , privatization and restructuring of state assets , the rule of law , the pursuit of sound macroeconomic policies and regulatory regimes , and the role regional integration plays in attracting new investment and improving economic efficiency .  It emphasized the creation of a free trade area in SADC and focused on the issue of non-tariff barriers .  
To achieve greater coherence in global economic policy-making , which is one of the functions of WTO , and make it more operational , WTO rules and disciplines should be taken fully into account by the international financial institutions when designing macroeconomic programmes and rescue packages for individual countries .  
For example , the ability of developing countries to achieve their growth potential , to close the gap in per capita income with the developed world and to maintain macroeconomic stability is significantly determined by macroeconomic policies pursued by the major industrial countries .  
A policy framework that integrates macroeconomic , financial , structural , social and human issues is imperative if there is to be equitable and sustainable development .  
The critical issue to be put on the development agenda for Africa is why macroeconomic reforms in Africa have not generated the expected microeconomic responses and have not promoted significant changes in technological capability , improvements in factory-wide skill levels , higher productivity , better manufactured export performance and greater value added in the domestic economies .  These are the elements that determine a countrys or regions successful integration into the global economy .  
For example , the ability of developing countries to achieve their growth potential , to close the gap in per capita incomes with the developed world and to maintain macroeconomic stability is significantly determined by macroeconomic policies pursued by the major industrial countries .  
Combined efforts of the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions , should help countries to enhance the performance of macroeconomic management , achieve greater coherence in the policies affecting economic , financial , social and environmental aspects , and protect the most vulnerable groups , and thus give the concerned country an opportunity to use this support to further its national goals while integrating better into the global economy .  
At the start of a new millennium , therefore , a fundamental challenge for the international community is to enhance the coherence and consistency of macroeconomic policies at the intergovernmental level and at the level of international institutions , as well as to implement concrete measures and initiatives designed to secure the integration of developing countries into the globalizing world economy on an equitable basis .  
Moreover , these strategies and policies should be formulated with a view to greater coherence between the structural , macroeconomic , trade , financial and development aspects of economic policy so as to increase the effectiveness of these policies , and help secure an open and stable economic policy framework conducive to developing countries integration into world trade , their economic and social development and poverty reduction .  
The Asian financial crisis has accelerated initiatives to improve the timeliness and quality of information concerning key macroeconomic variables as well as the financial reporting of banks and non-financial firms . 8 These are viewed as essential for better decision-taking by private lenders and investors , greater market discipline over policy makers , more effective policy surveillance by multilateral financial institutions , and strengthened financial regulation and supervision . 
Regarding key macroeconomic variables , an initiative had already been taken after the Mexican crisis when IMF established the Special Data Dissemination Standard ( SDDS ) in April 1996 to guide member countries in the public dissemination of economic and financial information in the context of seeking or maintaining access to international financial markets .  
Secondly , debtor Governments and international institutions could agree on a multi-year fiscal scenario that addressed , inter alia , macroeconomic stability consistent with non-inflationary financing ; domestic rates of taxation consistent with rapid growth ; and adequate financing for core public goods , including education , public health and basic infrastructure .  
Economic growth was strongly correlated with poverty alleviation , and thus the most useful approach lay in the creation of a sound macroeconomic foundation for sustainable growth , with open markets , transparent regulatory systems , strong financial oversight and participatory decision-making .  
Conditions which might assist developing countries in addressing poverty issues at the macroeconomic , institutional and policy levels were , respectively , globalization ; the awareness-building role of civil society and the role of the private sector , particularly in creating jobs and spurring rapid economic growth ; and the achievement of a balance between the economic and financial aspects of development and social , cultural and institutional concerns .  
As national governments had the primary responsibility for setting macroeconomic , structural and social policies that would generate growth and contribute to poverty reduction , such comprehensive strategies should be country-driven and elaborated in close cooperation with the international financial institutions . 
Recognizes the importance of adopting appropriate policy responses to the challenges of globalization at the national level , in particular by pursuing sound and stable domestic policies , including sound macroeconomic and social policies , in order to realize the objective of eradicating poverty ;  
Urges Governments and international institutions to create an enabling environment for business and investment , including through sound macroeconomic and fiscal policies , the rule of law , sound judicial procedures , anti-corruption and bribery efforts , and transparent business practices that enhance efficiency , fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions ;  
Besides sound macroeconomic fundamentals , a strong domestic financial and banking system with adequate supervisory and regulatory mechanisms , transparency and good governance were extremely important in order to guard against vulnerability to shifts in market sentiment and to contagion effects from policy weaknesses in other countries . 
Recognizes the importance of international financial stability , and in this context calls on developed countries , in particular major industrialized countries , to ensure that their macroeconomic policies are consistent with the priorities of growth and development , in particular of developing countries ;  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including adequate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
First were matters relating to the macroeconomic management of the world economy : institution of more effective macroeconomic coordination and of improved monitoring and surveillance of international financial flows , arrangements for quicker response to crises , and ending of a system where the private sector was too readily rescued from the risks attendant on its own imprudence .  
Urges all Governments to create an enabling environment for business and investment , including through sound macroeconomic , fiscal and development policies , the rule of law , anti-corruption and anti-bribery efforts , and transparent business practices that promote efficiency , fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions , taking into account the needs of developing countries ;  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including appropriate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Adequate and timely information on the macroeconomic situation in different parts of the world was essential for early warning efforts , and sound macroeconomic policies to strengthen institutional capacity and regulatory frameworks , as well as domestic banking systems , were also essential .  
So , references to wider macroeconomic concerns , i.e . debt relief and calls for increased official development assistance ( ODA ) levels by developed countries should be balanced by acknowledgement of the primary duty of all States to provide the conditions for the realization of the right to development , via good governance and the effective use of existing resources .  
For purposes of creating the single economic space , the participating States shall take coordinated measures to bring the main social and macroeconomic indicators of development gradually closer together , and shall pursue a single structural policy .  
In these trajectories , interdependent phenomena of political change , institutional shift , macroeconomic trends and social tendencies have generally reinforced each other and produced specific configuration of cumulative causation processes .  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources , so as to realize the mutually reinforcing objectives of poverty eradication and development , including through national poverty reduction strategies and enhanced policy coherence ;  
Recognizes the importance of international financial stability , and in this context calls on developed countries , in particular major industrialized countries , to ensure that their macroeconomic policies are consistent with the priorities of growth and development , in particular of developing countries ;  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including adequate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , inter alia , through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including appropriate institutional arrangements in the countries of both origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Urges Governments and international institutions to create an enabling environment for business and investment , including through sound macroeconomic and fiscal policies , the rule of law , sound judicial procedures , anti-corruption and bribery efforts , and transparent business practices that enhance efficiency , fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions ;  
Urges all Governments to create an enabling environment for business and investment , including through sound macroeconomic , fiscal and development policies , the rule of law , anti-corruption and anti-bribery efforts , and transparent business practices that promote efficiency , fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions , taking into account the needs of developing countries ;  
The new guidelines , intended for use by statistical compilers , data users and policy officials , will provide methodological standards for the compilation of statistics on external debt based on the international investment position framework and concept ; practical guidance for the compilation of these statistics ; and selected topics on the use of external debt data in the analysis of macroeconomic sustainability and external vulnerability .  
Internal enabling environment : policy framework incentives for domestic private savings , equitable tax systems ( development and enforcement of ) , macroeconomic policies , disincentives to corruption ; good governance ; transparency ; effective regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector ; banking infrastructure , pension funds ; corporate governance ; internationally accepted accounting standards , and a sound legal system ( land and property rights ) ;  
At the domestic level , there is a particular responsibility to maintain a constant balance between fiscal austerity measures and the need to find the resources required to fund social policies , while not ignoring other issues , especially the lack of fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stability , inadequate social policies and difficulties in broadening the participation of the various sectors of society .  
The latter will direct part of the surplus revenue flowing from our fiscal policies and will balance social investment with macroeconomic stabilization and the amortization of the foreign debt as a budgetary priority .  
In order to identify the adjustments to macroeconomic and sectoral policies that will ensure better integration of the employment objective and growth strategy , the decision-makers and the economic and social partners need thorough research , particularly in the spheres of cost evaluation , jobs and unemployment , fiscal , monetary and budgetary measures , and foreign trade .  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
The resumption of dialogue with the international financial institutions and with private and official bilateral partners could enable these objectives to be met through the sound macroeconomic policies to which the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is committed .  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening institutional capacities and regulatory frameworks , especially the regulatory and supervisory systems of the domestic financial and banking sectors ;  
Stresses the need to endow the International Monetary Fund with adequate resources to provide emergency financing to countries affected by financial crises as a result , among others , of the high volatility of international capital flows , and in this context also stresses the importance of sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the institutional capacities and regulatory frameworks ;  
A number of small island developing States have not yet accorded high priority to institution - and capacity-building ; some of them have had to deal with more pressing problems such as natural disasters and macroeconomic imbalances ; the recent economic crisis has had direct impact on some small island developing States where deteriorations in economic performance have further reduced scope for action for institutional and administrative capacity-building ;  
Also noteworthy was another triangular initiative in support of Cuba ' s economic recovery , under which expertise was transferred from Brazil , Chile and Mexico , with triangular support provided by Norway , in macroeconomic policy formulation , national budgeting , central banking accounting , treasury functions , commercial banking and external debt management .  
Operations approved in 1999 reflect the planned shift in emphasis from emergency reconstruction to ensuring the sustainability of economic institutions and sound macroeconomic management , as well as the medium - to longer-term viability of policies aimed at stimulating private investment , banking reform and privatization .  
A consensus was emerging on the fundamentals of sustainable human development , as illustrated by the fact that the Bretton Woods institutions had adopted an approach to development inspired by the United Nations , while the United Nations had moved far in supporting responsible macroeconomic policies on the part of Member States .  
Her delegation supported the decision to focus the activities of the Organization and , in particular , of UNDP , on the difficult balance between macroeconomic reform and the need for a credible State capable not only of supporting market development , but also of creating legal structures , institutions and regulatory frameworks .  
Recognizes the importance of the adoption of appropriate policy responses to the challenges of globalization at the national level , in particular by pursuing sound and stable domestic policies , including , inter alia , sound macroeconomic and social policies , in order to realize the objective of the eradication of poverty ;  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources , so as to realize the mutually reinforcing objectives of poverty eradication and development , inter alia through national poverty reduction strategies and enhanced policy coherence ;  
First , we have set an ambitious objective of cutting in half the percentage of people living in extreme poverty , stressing the necessary links between social and macroeconomic policies .  
At the national level , UNCTAD could contribute to sound domestic macroeconomic and financial policies , administrative reforms and continuing efforts to promote a stable and transparent national legal and regulatory framework favourable to development .  
At the international level , this could be achieved through coherent international macroeconomic and financial policies and continuing efforts to promote stable international economic growth favourable to development .  
This initiative , launched in 1998 by the World Bank , is based on the principle that an appropriate financial and macroeconomic framework is essential to any action , but that the social , structural and human aspects are essential too .  
To promote the mobilization of domestic financial resources and to establish the basis for an enabling environment through , inter alia , a sound macroeconomic framework , a dynamic private sector , improved governance , and participatory development ;  
In other countries , social and economic progress has been thwarted by narrowly focused economies , underdeveloped national macroeconomic management institutions and a shortage of trained personnel .  
Stability , the rule of law and predictable macroeconomic policies , in conjunction with the necessary structural reforms , are essential for fostering a climate conducive to equitable social and economic growth .  
Polands solid growth , macroeconomic stability , sound monetary policy , established banking system , modernized industry and reformed pension system had attracted foreign investors and helped it to withstand the global economic turbulence of recent years . 
The development of a strong domestic construction services sector should be supported by instruments of industrial policy , human resource development and macroeconomic policies , and by removing unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles internally .  
Economic , social and environmental linkages essential for achieving SHD have been widely acknowledged yet applied methodologies and practical tools to address these linkages are not fully reflected in macroeconomic reform processes and framework setting .  
This requires an environment conducive to private savings , the consolidation of public finances , efficient and effective mechanisms for the allocation of public expenditure , and adequate room for private initiative in short , sound macroeconomic policies .  
The development of a strong domestic construction services sector should be supported by instruments of industrial policy , human resource development and macroeconomic policies , and by removing unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles internally .  
Enabling domestic environments : governance issues ; sound macroeconomic policies , including fiscal and private savings policies ; special needs of Africa , the least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked and transit developing countries and other developing countries as well as countries with economies in transition with special difficulties in attracting financing for development .  
The discussion revolved around providing specific time frames towards meeting the internationally agreed ODA target of 0.7 per cent of GNP to counter the declines in past years ; developing each countrys own comprehensive strategy , including the establishment of sound macroeconomic policies and national partnerships in an effort to use ODA most effectively ; and the growing concerns regarding global public goods .  
Underlying the immediate concern over oil prices were the global macroeconomic imbalances and systemic weaknesses exposed by the Asian crisis , and failure to resolve economic imbalances in an orderly manner would be most damaging to growth in developing countries .  
In his view , the most interesting aspect of the Report was the diagnosis which he summarized in three main points : the poor implementation of some policy prescriptions reflected the impossibility of religiously enforcing conditionality ; social policies in favour of the poor needed to be integrated with macroeconomic policies ; and thirdly , aid effectiveness could be enhanced by improving coordination between the Bretton Woods institutions and bilateral donors .  
He explained that ESAF and PRGF were similar in the sense that they identified and supported sound and appropriate macroeconomic policies , but the fundamental difference was that the new PRGF emphasized consensus-building and participatory approaches driven by a country-owned process with an explicit focus on poverty reduction .  
At the national level these pertained to a regulatory framework , legal security , combating corruption , political and macroeconomic stability , market size ( through regional economic cooperation ) , growth potential and the availability of infrastructure and human resources .  
Elements of such an environment were considered to include sound macroeconomic policies , accountable and transparent governance , a sound domestic legal and regulatory framework , incentives for investment , the involvement of civil society in public decision-making and the strengthening of civil , political , economic and financial institutions .  
Stresses the need for the economic programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven and for their macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated , on an equal footing and a consistent way , with the realization of the broader social development goals , taking into account the specific characteristics , conditions and needs of the debtor countries ;  
At the tenth session of UNCTAD , held in Bangkok in February 2000 , Governments recognized that ensuring that all countries enjoy the benefits of globalization requires meeting complex policy challenges which arise , particularly at the macroeconomic level , from the growing interdependence of the various spheres of economic activity , including particularly trade , finance and investment , and the downside risks that this interdependence sometimes carries . 
Another pillar of an enabling domestic environment is a sound macroeconomic framework , including , for example , sound budget priorities for health , education and agriculture / food security , and transparent and accountable public expenditure management and an efficient tax system .  
All countries must realize that the mobilization of domestic resources for development calls for a supportive environment in which sound macroeconomic policies are applied ( stabilization of public finance , control of inflation , use of effective and efficient mechanisms for the distribution of public expenditure ) and favourable conditions in which the private sector can grow .  
Stresses the need for the economic programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven and for their macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated , on an equal footing and a consistent way , with the realization of the broader social development goals , taking into account the specific characteristics , conditions and needs of the debtor countries ;  
National efforts to mobilize domestic financial resources should consolidate enabling domestic environments geared to promote growth with equity , through good governance , effective domestic institutions , the rule of law and sound macroeconomic , structural and social development policies that are gender - and environment-sensitive .  
What kind of awareness-raising and specific policy coordination effort could major industrialized countries undertake to fulfil their special responsibility in ensuring that their macroeconomic policies , including exchange rate policies , take into account their effects in creating an international economic environment favourable to equitable growth and development , international financial stability and enhanced financial flows for development ? 
At the same time , the efforts of the system to promote more integrated approaches to development for example , a more effective integration of environmental and social dimensions in macroeconomic policies should contribute over time to better balanced decision-making processes also at the national level .  
Economic sustainability requires action on four fronts : ( i ) macroeconomic policy measures ; ( ii ) efficient resource allocation at the sectoral level to effect economic transformation , ( iii ) more equitable access to resources , and ( iv ) enhancing the opportunities of the poor .  
Economic sustainability requires action on four fronts : ( a ) macroeconomic policy measures and structural adjustment ; ( b ) efficient resource allocation at the sectoral level ; ( c ) more equitable access to resources , including improving income distribution and striving for gender equity ; and ( d ) increasing the productivity of the poor , partly through investments in basic health and education .  
Equally , it requires the definition of a clear and consistent set of public objectives , sound macroeconomic policies , efficient management of public revenue and expenditure , better allocation of resources and incentives to prevent capital flight and to encourage private savings and tax reforms , and a solid framework to implement stabilization or economic reform programmes .  
We also recognize that , despite the positive effects that an enabling environment with good governance , sound macroeconomic policies and efficient management of public revenue and expenditure , can achieve in terms of mobilization of local resources , external finance , in particular ODA , will remain , for African countries , a critical resource for achieving the international development goals . 
Without macroeconomic stability , sustained structural reforms , effective and transparent use of public resources , improvements in the provision of public services and infrastructure to the poor , and actions to reduce vulnerability and give the poor more voice in development choices , the pattern of sustained , inclusive growth that underlies the best scenario will not be realized and millions more people will remain enslaved in poverty .  
In addition , it is important to create an enabling policy environment for improving the situation of rural women , which would include the design and implementation of a gender-sensitive macroeconomic policy framework and social support systems which would accommodate womens productive and reproductive roles and encourage a more equal gender division of labour in the household . 
However , the actual benefits may be quite limited as the delivery of the main components of debt relief packages , including debt stock reduction from the Paris Club , remains conditional on the finalization and successful implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers ( PRSPs ) , which set out the countrys macroeconomic and structural reform policies , as well as concrete poverty-reduction goals .  
Poor management of finances and public corporations has not been conducive to the creation of a favourable macroeconomic and institutional environment for stimulating the economic and social activities of households and enterprises .  
The actions to be undertaken by least developed countries focus , inter alia , on : strengthening efforts to integrate trade policies into national development policies towards poverty eradication , improving economic openness and policy predictability , as well as sound macroeconomic policy , and developing human and institutional capacities for effective and informed participation in the multilateral trading system and for effective negotiations on trade , finance , technology transfer and related areas .  
The promotion of a conducive macroeconomic environment , good governance and democracy , as well as strengthening structural aspects of the economy and improved institutional and human capacities , was regarded as important also in the context of attracting FDI and other private external flows .  
Effective development strategies and economic and social sustainability depended on enhanced national capacity to operate within a comprehensive framework that reflected the interdependence of macroeconomic and financial issues with structural , social and human concerns , including environment and health . 
Human rights must be respected and an adequate legal framework developed ; there was a need to apply sound macroeconomic policies , combat corruption and strengthen human and institutional capacities , both nationally and on the basis of international cooperation .  
Recognizes the importance of the adoption of appropriate policy responses to the challenges of globalization at the national level , in particular by pursuing sound and stable domestic policies , including sound macroeconomic and social policies , inter alia , those contributing to increased income of the poor , in order to realize the objective of the eradication of poverty ;  
Recognizes the importance of the adoption of appropriate policy responses to the challenges of globalization at the national level , in particular by pursuing sound and stable domestic policies , including sound macroeconomic and social policies , inter alia , those contributing to increased income of the poor , in order to realize the objective of the eradication of poverty ;  
The necessary elements of a policy mix would address optimal instruments of industrial policy , human resource development and macroeconomic policies , including fiscal policies which avoid onerous internal taxation of construction firms and high tariffs on essential equipment .  
To provide an enabling business environment characterized by stable macroeconomic policies ; a sound legal , regulatory and tax framework ; adequate physical infrastructure , including for transport and telecommunications ; and an available pool of a skilled labour , particularly engineering skills ;  
Creation of a database of regional level indicators that would make it possible to evaluate and diagnose the current state of the environment in the region ; gauge the environmental consequences of existing macroeconomic policies ; measure the economic , social and environmental costs of maintaining current development patterns ; and supply orientation for policy decisions , especially in regard to public and private investment .  
" All industrial nations should implement sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that are necessary to sustain robust domestic demands and hence , create multiple engines to promote economic growth , " he said . 
The official said that since last year the central government had requested a strengthening of macroeconomic regulation but due to the misunderstanding of some local governments and firms the first quarter of the year still saw an obvious surge in new projects and a comparatively large amount of fixed assets investment , resulting in a fast growth in monetary credit .  
The central bank has introduced a number of policies recently .  The comprehensive utilization of various monetary policies is identical to the aforementioned " slow braking " currently required for macroeconomic regulation .  
For the last two years , aimed at the changed international and domestic economic situation and the domestic deflation trend that has appeared , the Chinese Government has sized up the time , adjusting its policy promptly , making the key decision to expand domestic demand , and taking a series of macroeconomic regulation and control steps , the main substance of which is pursuing an active fiscal policy . 
Having coolly analyzed the economic situation at the time , carried out thorough investigation and study , and extensively listened to the suggestions and views of experts and scholars , the central authorities held a timely meeting , looked into and set out a policy of further strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control , and readjusted the intensity and specific measures of the fiscal policy .  
main measures to be taken should meet the requirements of strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control , optimizing the economic structure , properly scheduling key state projects , truly improving the people 's livelihood , actively increasing employment , ensuring social insurance work , and ensuring sustainable development .  
and the major measures should meet the requirements for strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control , optimizing the economic structure , planning state key construction projects well , effectively improving people 's living standards , actively promoting employment , and succeeding in social security work and sustainable development .  
With the establishment of the market economic system , the change of the macroeconomic situation and , the increase of the total national economic strength , the not high enough quality of the economy in Beijing 's suburbs , its weak ability to adapt to changes , and its insufficient staying power for development are manifesting themselves ever more clearly , and they are becoming the important factors restricting Beijing 's agricultural and rural development .  1 .  
Second , the Financial and Economic Commission holds that the draft of the 2000 plan for national economic and social development and the general requirements for the economic work are proper , the main targets and tasks set forth in the plan are positive , the macroeconomic control policy is in line with the actual conditions of economic development , and the main measures are feasible .  
In the fields of comprehensive supporting reforms , they set up the system for the common development of multiple economic sectors , the system for the operations of state-owned assets , the system for macroeconomic regulation and control , the market system , the social security system , and so on .  
In the face of the new situation of insufficient effective demand in the last two years , the central government put forward the fundamental policy of expanding demand and implemented a proactive fiscal policy and other supporting macroeconomic policies .  It issued additional treasury bonds and increased investment in infrastructure construction and technological transformation to bring along bank lending and nongovernmental investment and expand investment demand .  
Since the western countries instituted capitalist market economy , pollution , unemployment , and polarization between rich and poor have occurred all the time ; hence their governments have no alternative but to undertake the functions of improving efficiency , regulating income distribution , and stimulating macroeconomic stability and growth .  
It must be noted that with the end of the economy of shortage , low-standard surpluses are reflected in most fields of merchandise , that our economic structure does not meet the needs of the new macroeconomic situation , and that if the economic structure is not promptly readjusted and optimized , it will be difficult to maintain sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development .  
In general , economic issues have been relatively outstanding subjects discussed at G-7 and G-8 summits .  Examples are macroeconomic management , international trade , and relations with developing countries .  Meanwhile , however , the summits have preserved a very clear political and ideological tradition .  
In order to increase domestic demand and stimulate economic growth , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council pursued a proactive fiscal policy for three consecutive years , thus creating a fine macroeconomic environment for the process of reforming state enterprises and lifting them out of difficulty .  
During the early period of the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan , in the light of the outstanding issues in the economic life , containing inflation was regarded as the priority task of macroeconomic control and moderately tight financial and monetary policies were implemented , and measures for comprehensive control were adopted , thus reversing the situation of high inflation .  Under the circumstance of still maintaining a relatively high level of economic growth rate , the soaring prices have returned to a relatively low level , thus the national economy smoothly realizing a " soft landing . "  
However , the party central leadership and the State Council displayed its strategic insight , grasped the trend in the development and changes of the domestic and foreign economic situation , resolutely readjusted the orientation of macroeconomic control , and made a timely decision on shifting the primary task in macroeconomic control from curbing inflation to expanding domestic demand and overcoming deflation .  
In dealing with both inflation and deflation , the party central leadership and the State Council consistently gave play to the role of the market as the foundation for distributing resources , comprehensively employed various economic levers , employed necessary legal and administrative means as supplements , and accumulated rich experience in conducting macroeconomic readjustment and control .  
APEC should make great efforts to promote economic and technological cooperation and add new dimensions to such cooperation .  In addition , based on the lessons learned from the financial crisis , it should further enhance macroeconomic coordination among its members .  The meeting of finance ministers should serve as a major mechanism for its member economies to exchange views on the economic situation , publish important economy-guiding information , and coordinate economic-development policies .  Similarly , work should be done to make the meeting of central bank governors a mechanism for coordinating banking activities .  
Examples are building early-warning and preventive mechanisms , forming an APEC financial early-warning group ( composed of finance ministers of major economies and financial experts ) , enhancing macroeconomic coordination , establishing emergency financial assistance mechanisms , enacting APEC rules for financial activities , supervising the flow of large amounts of capital in the region , and setting up financial personnel training organizations to raise the financial operational and management ability of developing economies .  
China sustained , rapid , healthy development during the period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan must first be attributed to the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the center .  Their outstanding leadership skill in economic control and in flexible economic adjustment brought about the success , as did the incisive reforms by the macroeconomic adjustment departments .  The increased pace of the change of functions provided the beneficial conditions .  
The main role of the government is to create a favorable macroeconomic environment for structural readjustment by improving macroeconomic regulation and control , pressing ahead with reform , restoring market order through economic policy , providing public services , and concentrating its energies on major projects .  
Fourth , optimize the organizational structure of the enterprises , appropriately merging enterprises in the same industries through the market mechanism which maintain the good and eliminate the bad and through macroeconomic regulation , ensure full competition among enterprises , form a pattern dominated by large enterprises and suited to the coordinated development of enterprises of all sizes .  
First , macroeconomic regulation and control will be intensified and improved in a bid to maintain macroeconomic stability , push forward the strategic economic structural adjustment , and guarantee the country 's economic security through working out economic and social development plans and macroeconomic policies that primarily depend on the application of economic and legal means . 
During the period of the 10th Five-Year Plan , we should work closely around the goal of expanding domestic demand and adopt practical and effective macroeconomic fiscal policy and monetary policy to stimulate domestic market demand for investment and consumption in order to promote economic growth and upgrade the industrial structure .  
The recently published " Blue Paper on Chinese Economic Forecasting , " which was put together by several well-known economists , predicts that China 's GDP will grow about 7.8 percent this year , barring a major deterioration in the international economic environment and provided that the Chinese government continues to base macroeconomic regulation and control on an active fiscal policy , properly coordinates the various macroeconomic regulatory and control measures , and further stimulates domestic demand .  
On 29 April , Li Ruogu , assistant president of the People 's Bank of China and deputy Chinese director of the IMF , called on developed countries to make greater effort to coordinate their macroeconomic policies , maintain the stability of exchange rates between major currencies , and thus create a better external environment for economic growth in developing countries .  
Ding Jiye : Mainly in three aspects : First , we institute categorized budget management , that is , military expenditure is divided into two main categories , sustained expenditure and construction expenditure , according to the nature of the use of the funds ; these two categories are budgeted separately , macroeconomic regulation and control is stepped up , and different focal points to be ensured are set down ;  
He said : China has successfully completed the Ninth Five-Year Plan . During that period , China built a preliminary socialist market economic system , further improved its macroeconomic regulatory system , and continued to push forward the program of opening up wider to the outside world ; and the country 's foreign trade and investments from abroad continued to grow noticeably .  
Through practicing macroeconomic regulation and control measures , with the focus on expansionist fiscal policy , in the past three years China has successfully withstood the blow of the Asian financial crisis and maintained the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
Some countries that were affected by the 1997 financial crisis have learned experience and a lesson from the financial crisis , and , therefore , in recovering their economies , have placed greater importance on adopting a macroeconomic policy tailored to meet the actual situations .  The current ADB annual meeting also stressed the need to assist developing countries to carry out economic restructuring , enhance their macroeconomic regulation and control ability , and build and refine a social security system , in order to ensure relatively high economic growth in this region .  
Liu Fuyuan pointed out : To perfect China 's macroeconomic monitoring system , it is necessary to set up a whole set of statistical systems aligned with international standards , fully use advanced networking technologies , and further enhance the level of data processing .  
Speaking of their visit in France , Xiang Huaicheng indicated that he and French Financial Minister Laurent Fabius had held a fruitful meeting at which they discussed ways to strengthen mutual financial and monetary cooperation , and exchanged views , and reached an extensive consensus , on many issues , including the international macroeconomic situation , social security issues , and multilateral and regional cooperation .  
Xiang Huaicheng said : " The fact that China is strengthening its financial and monetary exchange and cooperation with Germany and France is not only conducive to a smooth development in the friendly relations of our two sides ; but is all the more significant to promoting coordination between advanced countries and developing countries against the background of an economic globalization , to maintaining a stable global macroeconomic situation with joint efforts , and to establishing a rational international monetary framework as well as global economic rules . "  
Huang Qingyi said : Xu Rongkai has worked in both local and central departments and committees , including organs of the State Council . He is familiar with the work of macroeconomic management and social development and has rather rich practical experience in these fields .  He has a good knowledge of theories and policies , strong writing skills , and remarkable organizing and coordinating ability .  
Last year industrial enterprises owned by the state and those in which the state held a dominant stake of shares registered a profit exceeding the preceding year by 137.7-billion yuan .  According to estimates , 48 percent of this increase in profit was attributable to the improvement of the macroeconomic environment , and 23 percent was due to the direct effects of the policies adopted by the government to enable the enterprises to stop losses and earn profits .  
The latest issue of the Hong Kong journal Economic Reporter carries an article by Yuan Gangming , Director of the Macroeconomic Research Office of the Institute of Economics in the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences expressing the belief that strong domestic demand during the first half of the year supported China 's continued economic upswing , while the slowdown in exports threatened the macroeconomic upswing , estimating that policy options for encouraging exports in the second half of the year will encounter difficulties , and therefore proposing that China seek accelerated growth led by domestic demand .  
The article expresses the belief that China will join the WTO before the end of the year , the openness of the domestic market will be increased , and the traditional means used to control import growth will be reduced , so there may be a rather significant growth in imports , while net exports will decline further , perhaps to the point where the trade surplus becomes a trade deficit , which would have a fairly serious adverse effect on macroeconomic stability .  
We can still expect the national economic growth rate for the whole year to reach or exceed the 7 percent target that was determined early this year , provided that the global economy does not deteriorate further , weather conditions are basically normal , and the policy for macroeconomic regulation and control is implemented rather well .  
The informed person said that in a situation report submitted earlier to the State Council , the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation held that in the current circumstances , the macroeconomic policy has little impact on stopping the slide in exports because the root cause of the deteriorating export situation this year is the slide of the US economy , that has led to a global economic slowdown .  In China , it is unsuitable to adopt such measure as the devaluation of the renminbi to stimulate exports .  
Since the beginning of this year , our economy has continued to maintain a positive momentum of development .  This is a result of the fact that the central authorities keenly sensed the new changes in the world economy and , in good time , adopted a correct macroeconomic policy accordingly , and the whole nation worked as one in a down-to-earth manner .  It is also connected to the energetic endeavor to rectify and regulate the market economic order .  
and should build up and perfect a macroeconomic control and regulation system that can effectively resist the impacts of international economic fluctuations , and build up a whole set of operable and effective mechanisms for macroeconomic control and regulation that comply with international standards .  
Government departments must concentrate their energy in doing well macroeconomic control and creating a fine market environment .  In accordance with the demands of government operations laws and economic development laws , we must adjust the direct intervention of government in economic activities , changing the scope of this involvement to a more rational level , such as primarily organizing the production of public goods , developing public benefit undertakings , and providing public services .  
These successes , however , were mainly achieved because the central authorities increased market demand by adopting effective macroeconomic regulation and control policies , and at the same time compressed and knocked out surplus and backward productive capacity , thus creating a favorable market environment for enterprise development .  
We should no longer solidify the previous examination and approval system and the industrial policies of mercantilism , and the government should change its keynote of public policies to more open-minded industrial policies , which include steady and sound macroeconomic policies , transparent legal system , and better external public conditions and facilities .  
Judging from these situations , the overall environment of this year 's economic work is good .  The negative factors are that currently demand for essential goods is insufficient and the employment pressure has increased and probably will be quite reduced as the international economic situation has further turned for the better and as the effect and results of the state 's macroeconomic regulation and control measures gradually come into play .  
Its major achievements include increasing domestic demands through macroeconomic regulation and control , helping state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises turn losses into profits , increasing export , implementing the strategy for developing the vast western region , and reaching accords with the United States on China 's accession to the World Trade Organization [ WTO ] .  
While giving less attention to economic growth target , the government will give macroeconomic guidance to the major problems in economic development from an even higher level .  For instance , in vigorous promoting economic restructuring , the government will give consideration to the changes at the present stage of the domestic economic development and to the increasingly sharpened international competition .  Meanwhile , the government will not only manage to resolve immediate problems but also lay eyes on long-term development .  
In supply , China has abundant manpower and a fairly high savings rate .  Through primary industrialization , the material and technical basis for growth has been greatly enhanced .  The readjustment of the economic structure will further improve the growth mode of China 's economy and raise microeconomic and macroeconomic efficiencies .

The readjustment of the economic structure will further improve the growth mode of China 's economy and raise microeconomic and macroeconomic efficiencies .  
In accordance with the spirit of the relevant central decisions and the provisions of the relevant laws , central macroeconomic regulation and control matters such as currency issue , the fixing of standard interest rates , foreign exchange rate regulation , and readjustments of the main tax forms and rates , unified market activities regulations , and legal systems regarding foreign trade and investment by foreign companies must all be regulated in a unified way by the central authorities , and the localities are not permitted to lay down regulations on them .  
If the Chinese macroeconomic regulation and control departments ' recommendation of issuing additional treasury bonds is approved by the State Council and adopted by the National People 's Congress , it will be the third time running for the Chinese Government to issue additional treasury bonds in the second half year following the issuance of 100 billion yuan worth of additional treasury bonds in the second half of 1998 and 60 billion yuan worth of additional treasury bonds in the second half of last year .  
It is noteworthy that China experienced economic overheating from 1992 to 1993 .  From the summer of 1993 , the central authorities intensified and improved macroeconomic regulation and control , gradually cooling down economic overheating .  GDP growth was down from 14.2 percent in 1992 to 13.5 percent in 1993 , 12.6 percent in 1994 , 10.5 percent in 1995 , and 9.6 percent in 1996 .  
Such favorable turns and changes were mainly the results of effectively promoting economic growth through the implementation by the state of a proactive fiscal policy , a moderate monetary policy , a policy on industrial restructuring , and a series of measures for macroeconomic regulation and control ;  
Seen from the experiences of other countries in the world , to liberalize capital account management , it is generally necessary to have a stable macroeconomic environment , a sound financial system , effective supervisory capability , and immense , comprehensive national strength .  Presently China does not have all such conditions , and therefore it is still necessary to maintain capital account management .  
Judging from China 's economic development since 1993 , the central authorities have become more mature in macroeconomic regulation and control .  In addition to accumulating rich experience in controlling inflation , China has gained initial experience in vigorously checking the deflation trend .  
In view of this situation , the central authorities resolutely worked out major policy decisions to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control , and started with consolidating the financial and economic order .  To meet the demand of the new situation of building a socialist market economy system and of reform and opening up , they mainly adopted economic and legal means supplemented by essential administrative measures and adopted the " soft landing " method to deal with the overheated economy and inflation .  
To deal with the buffet brought by Asian financial crisis , China has shifted its attention from macroeconomic regulation and control to expansion of domestic demands since 1998 , implemented the proactive financial policy , striven to give play to the role of monetary policy , and comprehensively applied such economic levers as finance , banking , taxation , price , and income distribution to promote investment , consumption and export demands and bring along economic growth .  
We should build the state finance by making it secure , balanced , and strong and should give scope to finance 's macroeconomic regulation and control role , this being an objective and necessary requirement for steadily and healthily developing both the national economy and various social undertakings .  
Since the Asian financial crisis broke out in 1997 , in light of changes in the macroeconomic situation , by judging the hour and sizing up the situation , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council firmly came up with such a major policy decision as expanding the domestic demand and implementing a positive financial policy .  Expanding the domestic demand and implementing a positive financial policy have since played a crucial and key role in sustaining stable economic growth ;  
This year , our country 's economic operation has picked up with a strong momentum , for our major economic indices , such as investment , export , and so on , have risen quickly ; our consumption temperature has gone up ; and our macroeconomic situation has witnessed a continued turn for the better , which has further attested to the results of expanding the domestic demand and implementing a positive financial policy . 
Li Lanqing finally stressed : We should continue to work hard and ensure that all this year 's budgetary tasks will be fulfilled .  In the first half of this year , our country 's macroeconomic situation witnessed a significant turn for the better and our financial revenue tended to rise rapidly , and this has laid a sound basis for us to fulfill this year 's tasks .  
Since 1999 , the state has been pursuing a series of active fiscal and macroeconomic regulation and control policies to drive domestic demand and expand consumption .  For instance , it has issued an additional 60 billion yuan in treasury bonds , raised the income level of low-income urban residents , extended holidays , and taken steps to stimulate exports .  
While the economy has taken a key turn and the stock market is skyrocketing , we also need to clearly recognize that deflation remains the key limiting factor to a macroeconomic rebound , with our inherent economic growth grounds remaining quite weak .  
The Japanese personalities attending the meeting universally expressed their admiration for the macroeconomic policies adopted by the Chinese government and the national economy that has maintained a sustained and rapid growth .  They also showed intense interest in the new situation that China will soon accede to the WTO and implement its strategy of developing the western region on a large scale .  
Statistics show that , during the first six months , China 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) grew 8.2% , industrial added value increased 9.9% , the total retail value of social consumables was up 10.1% , investments in fixed assets grew 12.1% , and foreign trade exports increased by 38.3% , so each of the macroeconomic indicators continues to develop in a good direction .  
Recently , individuals in economic circles have pointed out that the major turnaround we are seeing in macroeconomic operations shows that the various macroeconomic regulatory measures - - primarily the aggressive fiscal policies - - implemented by China are having a significant positive effect , creating a golden historical opportunity for China 's economic development .  
Zeng Peiyan said : For over two years now , we have been acting under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core to insist on pursuing an active fiscal policy and stable monetary policy , which has effectively brought into full play the role of all macroeconomic regulation and control policies .  
In addition to the macroeconomic situation and relevant policies , the main factors bearing on the trend of the automobile market in the second half of the year are as follows : First , the state is determined to screen and rectify various consumption-restricting policies , which will be conductive to stimulating domestic automobile consumption .  
In the second half of the year , the macroeconomic situation is taking a turn for the better , and the competitive environment of the telecommunications market is continuously improved ; telecommunications rates will undergo structural readjustment , and their general level will drop , which will greatly stimulate the demand for communication business .  The communication business can be expected to continue its rapid increase .  
As a matter of fact , we did not make any substantive adjustment to the tax preferential policies toward foreign investors .  In 1997 , we intended to adjust the tax referential policy in terms of import equipment , but owing to the changes in macroeconomic situation such as the Asian financial crisis , we suspended the policy adjustment .  
For many years , the NPC and its standing committee have formulated a large number of laws to standardize the main body of the markets , maintain the market order , and practice macroeconomic regulation and control , thereby safeguarding the healthy and orderly development of the socialist market economy .  
An analysis from the macroeconomic point of view shows that China 's economy will be growing at an average annual growth rate of over 7 percent in the next five years .  Investment , consumption , and export , which form the " troika " that pulls the economy forward , have close , mutually complementary , and mutually supporting relations with foreign investments .  
Today , when being interviewed by Xinhua , Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng said that in the period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , China positively and actively applied the financial policies to conduct macroeconomic readjustment and control , and this played a major role in maintaining the sustained , high-speed , and healthy development of the national economy , promoting reforms in all fields , and safeguarding social stability .  
He pointed out : The positive financial policy being put into practice since 1998 has effectively driven economic growth , promoted the increase in financial revenues , successfully brought about a major turning point in the national economy in the first months of this year , created a favorable environment for reform and development , and also enriched our experience in macroeconomic management .  
Recently , Japan 's business circles have expressed their optimism in the correct macroeconomic policies adopted by the Chinese government to maintain the sustainable and rapid growth of the national economy and have shown keen interest in the new situation of China 's imminent entry into the WTO and its implementation of the strategy of developing the western region .  
The Chinese government made flexible use of fiscal policies in light of changes in the macroeconomic situation to promote the sustainable , rapid and sound development of the national economy during the Ninth FYP period , thus making an important contribution to the enrichment of experience in macro-control .  
The great development of the western region requires the combination of the government 's macroeconomic control and regulation with the functioning of the market mechanisms , and requires active exploration of new ideas , new methods , and new mechanisms for the development of the western region , which will be carried out and pushed forward in an orderly way with priority given to selected key fields . 
He said , viewed from the industry , state-owned enterprises depend heavily on the high international oil prices , the low interest rates of banks , the conversion of debts into shares , the relief of their social functions , and other measures at the macroeconomic level .  Internal factors at the microeconomic level , such as the lowering of the costs of enterprises , the improvement in quality , and the readjustment and optimization of structure are still insufficient .  
The meeting maintained that , like cracking down on smuggling and foreign exchange fraud , the crackdown on export rebate fraud is an important political assignment as well as an urgent economic struggle ; and that this struggle is greatly significant for tightening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control , increasing revenues , and promoting a healthy economic development , as well as for managing the country according to the law and for consolidating and regulating the markets ' economic order and stamping out corruption in society .  
Uphold the guideline of expanding domestic demand , continue to practice an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy , and make comprehensive use of various means of macroeconomic regulation and control , to consolidate and develop the good momentum of economic growth .  
Li Lanqing said in his letter that under the leadership of the party 's central committee and the State Council , significant headway has been made in financial reforms and tremendous achievements have been scored in the financial work over the past few years , as a result of practicing the proactive financial policies and intensifying and improving the macroeconomic regulation and control in finance , which have promoted the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
At present , financial departments at all levels should foster the idea of managing the public finance in a conscientious way and change their financial management model from the old tradition of laying more weight on distribution than on management , more weight on examination and approval than on supervision , and more weight on microeconomy than on macroeconomy to the practice of intensifying macroeconomic regulation and control , macroscopic management , and financial supervision .  
We must adhere to the principle of expanding domestic demand , continue to implement a proactive financial policy and a moderate monetary policy , comprehensively use all means of macroeconomic regulation and control to consolidate and develop the good situation of economic growth and promote the sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy and comprehensive social progress , and strive to make a good start in fulfilling the Tenth Five-year Plan .  
Wu Yi said , under the " Ninth Five-year Plan , " China successfully overcame a series of foreign economic and trade problems , especially those created by the Asian financial crises ; the many undertakings continued to expand to become an important driving force behind the nation 's economic development , playing an important role in promoting macroeconomic stability and increasing the country 's comprehensive national strength .  
Facts have proved that implementation of a proactive fiscal policy and issuance of government bonds for long-term development to increase investment is a correct policy decision adopted by the party Central Committee . It represents a successful practice of ours in resolving problems that we encounter on the way forward through continued development and in adjusting our macroeconomic control policies in a timely manner in light of changes at home and abroad .  
With development over the years , the organization has established a five-level work mechanism - - informal meeting of APEC leaders , ministerial meeting , senior officials meeting , and the committees and work group and secretariat under senior officials meeting .  The organization 's work involves cooperation in a broad area , including trade and investment liberalization , economic and technological cooperation , and dialogue on macroeconomic policy .  
This round of institutional reform and reorganization in the State Economic and Trade Commission and its subordinate state bureaus is another major step for forming a streamlined , unified , and highly efficient administrative structure .  This step is of great significance for achieving the goal of completely separating government institutions from enterprise management , transforming government functions , establishing and improving the socialist market economic system , enhancing the work efficiency of the government institutions , and enhancing macroeconomic control .  
Being a developing country , China can not afford to send an excessive amount of capital abroad at this stage .  Having considered changes in our macroeconomic situation , we decided to raise a new topic , namely , allowing mainland residents to invest in the B-share market with legitimate earnings in foreign exchange .  
The improvement of the state 's macroeconomic environment mainly included the adoption of a proactive financial policy and moderate monetary policy , the expansion of domestic demands , and the promotion of economic growth by means of investment , consumption , and export , which have played an excellent role in improving the external environment for enterprises ' production and operation .  
Presently , excessive export of capital is still unsuited for China , being a developing country .  Allowing domestic residents to invest in B shares with their legally owned foreign currencies , therefore , is a new subject stemming from the changes in the macroeconomic situation .  
A person in charge of the CSRC said that the current policy readjustment was made mainly due to the consideration that marked changes have taken place in the macroeconomic situation regarding the capital movement of foreign exchange in China , and corresponding adjustments to the market orientation , rules , functions , and so on have been put forward in line with the requirements of the national economic development .  
This is because we have initially established the socialist market economy structure , and accumulated more experience in macroeconomic management and in regulation and control ; and we have overcome difficulties caused by insufficient effective domestic demand through implementing the guideline of expanding domestic demand and practicing an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy .  
In the arrangement of contents , every effort has been made to reflect the requirements of the socialist market economy , and highlight its strategic , macroeconomic , and policy-related character , the spheres where the government should play a principal role , the major issues that have a bearing on the overall situation of the immediate and long-term development , the new domains and new tasks of economic and social development , as well as its operability .  
from investment to consumption and to other fields , a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy have been implemented flexibly , the policy of expanding domestic demand has been resolutely pursued , and measures for macroeconomic regulation and control have been highly effective .  
Decision-making power for monetary policy must be vested in an agency that is both independent but accountable ; other macroeconomic policies must be harmonised ; and structural policies must support the flexible adjustment needed to accommodate shocks .  
Despite the uncertain macroeconomic outlook , credible fiscal consolidation has to begin in fiscal year 2003 .  This will require the implementation of sizeable structural deficit reduction measures in fiscal year 2003 and a commitment to more substantial consolidation , supported by concrete measures , in the next three years . "  
More broadly , Directors emphasized that Hong Kong SAR 's traditional strengths-flexible labor and product markets and strong legal and institutional frameworks-would need to be complemented by sound macroeconomic policies and productivity-increasing structural reforms .  
To be efficient , public expenditure planning needs a coherent macroeconomic framework in which the institutional capability is shared between the ministries of finance and planning , the central bank and the statistical office .  
To improve this coordination at a technical level , some countries have established joint task forces of senior officials of these ministries and agencies to undertake key economic projections of the main macroeconomic variables .  
A suitable regulatory , legal and supervisory environment is a crucial element in effective private sector development , macroeconomic structural programmes , development of entrepreneurship and effective capital market development .  
Reforms have concentrated on promoting sound macroeconomic policies , price liberalization , an increased role for the private sector coupled with a more focused role for the public sector , as well as measures to increase agricultural production .  
To the extent that foreign direct investment frameworks became similar , other factors assumed great significance ; these included appropriate legal framework good governance , and a stable political and sound macroeconomic environment .  
The usual policies to bring about domestic economic stabilization and adjustment included standard macroeconomic management components , as well as shifting to more liberal trade and investment regimes .  
Sound macroeconomic policies , a strong fiscal system , the development of human resources in environmental management and administrative efficiency are essential for successful internalization .  
Sound and sustainable macroeconomic policies , political stability , good governance , physical and institutional infrastructure and human resource development are a prerequisite for encouraging increased investment in Africa ;  
Development planning and project evaluation should seek to droughtproof vulnerable areas , strengthen coping strategies , foster effective local , national and international institutions , and adopt sound macroeconomic policies ;  
Instead of coordinating their macroeconomic policies , however , the industrialized countries had sought to resolve their domestic problems in a purely national or restricted multilateral context .  
A conducive external environment was essential , and the developed countries should employ sound macroeconomic policies , particularly in the area of trade liberalization , financial flows and monetary stability .  
The rational and efficient administration of macroeconomic and sectoral policies , as well as the application of clear , relevant and consistent rules , are indispensable prerequisites for achieving and maintaining economic and social stability .  
The Islamic Republic of Mauritania which , since 1984 , has been engaged in a determined battle that aims at restructuring the Mauritanian economy despite difficult domestic , regional and international conditions , has made tangible progress towards restoring the macroeconomic balance and reducing its foreign debt , a fact that is attested to by international financial institutions . 
We are pleased to report that our Government has assigned the highest priority to the maintenance of macroeconomic stability through the implementation of a consistent and coherent set of monetary , exchange-rate and fiscal policies .  
The objective of these reforms is the removal of structural rigidities in order to correct the existing macroeconomic imbalances and lay the foundation for sustained economic growth .  
As clearly stated in the report in document A / 50 / 490 , financial systems in Africa are unsophisticated , narrow and shallow , due mainly to general underdevelopment , inappropriate macroeconomic policies and pervasive Government intervention in credit allocation .  
Invites Governments to undertake systematic reviews of each major component of their macroeconomic policy frameworks and to take measures to address any unwarranted disincentives for healthy and progressive informal and small and medium-sized productive sectors , and to create an enabling environment for the scientific and technological community to take initiatives to link technologies , in a participatory manner , with entrepreneurs from those sectors ;  
The subjects and emerging issues to be addressed in greater detail , both globally and for major countries and groups of countries , will include the following : output and income , macroeconomic policy-making , the world energy situation , international trade and trade policy , international transfers of financial resources and financial cooperation , and other selected social and economic issues of a more structural nature .  
Implementing sound and stable macroeconomic and sectoral policies which encourage broad-based , sustained economic growth and development that is sustainable and equitable , generate jobs , and that are geared towards eradicating poverty , reducing social and economic inequalities and exclusion ;  
Pursuing the coordination of macroeconomic policies so that they are mutually reinforcing and conducive to broad-based and sustained economic growth and sustainable development , as well as substantial increases in productive employment expansion and a decline in unemployment worldwide ;  
Implementing macroeconomic and microeconomic policies in accordance with national priorities and policies , aimed at encouraging greater domestic savings and investment required for public spending , through progressive , fair and economically efficient taxes which are cognizant of sustainable development concerns , and through cutting back on subsidies that do not benefit the poor ;  
With regard to part I of the report , dealing with the country 's general , economic , political and legal framework , she noted that although Bolivia had historically faced problems of extreme poverty and instability , in its first decade of democracy progress had been made towards the macroeconomic stability that was essential to social policy .  
It is suggested that macroeconomic frameworks conducive to mobilizing financial resources be developed and that the allocation of significant resources through partnership agreements and bilateral or multilateral arrangements be continued and enhanced .  
Adjustment programmes are designed to promote both macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform , and thereby to lay the foundations for high quality growth - a prerequisite for a sustainable and equitable improvement in living standards .  
Analysis of the major factors behind the observed behaviour of commodity prices reveals that conventional factors , such as the prevailing macroeconomic conditions in industrialized countries , are estimated to have contributed in only a limited way to the recent weakness in real commodity prices and that the expansion in the supply of commodities played a fundamental role .  
Positive and negative developments in the external and national policy environments as well as successful and unsuccessful macroeconomic and microeconomic policies are reflected in the amount of resources available for the financing of cross-sectoral issues and sectoral finance .  
Pursue and implement sound and stable macroeconomic and sectoral policies , designed with the full and equal participation of women , that encourage broad-based sustained economic growth [ in the context of people-centred sustainable development ] [ sustainable development centred on human beings ] , address the structural causes of poverty and are geared towards eradicating poverty and reducing gender-based inequality ;  
Implement sound macroeconomic and sectoral policies , designed and monitored with the full participation of women , that encourage broad-based sustained economic growth in the context of [ people-centred ] sustainable development [ centred on human beings ] , address the structural causes of poverty and are geared towards eradicating poverty and reducing gender-based inequality . 
It was considered that good governance , including accountability and transparency , a sound and stable macroeconomic policy framework , consistent and effective policies for reform and structural adjustment , taking into account the social dimension , creation of favourable conditions for market-oriented development and foreign direct investment were equally critical to success ;  
Colombia is a unique case in Latin America , a country in which moderate and persistent inflation has attracted the attention of important national and international analysts who have been able to provide sound macroeconomic explanations for that inflation ; such experts have never resorted to the explanation contained in the DEA report .  
The subjects and emerging issues to be addressed in greater detail , both globally and for major countries and groups of countries , will include the following : output and income , macroeconomic policy-making , the world energy situation , international trade and trade policy , international transfers of financial resources and financial cooperation , and other selected social and economic issues of a more structural nature .  
The main reasons included a shortage of resources , both domestic and external , the lack of an appropriate macroeconomic framework in several countries and , in some cases , various crises - political and / or natural - that interrupted economic activity .  
" Pursue and implement sound and stable macroeconomic and sectoral policies that are designed and monitored with the full and equal participation of women , encourage broad-based sustained economic growth , address the structural causes of poverty and are geared towards eradicating poverty and reducing gender-based inequality within the overall framework of achieving people-centred sustainable development . "  Paragraph 60 ( d ) .  
One can not emphasize enough the importance of debtor countries ' adherence to policies that will correct macroeconomic disequilibria , maintain a stable economic environment and make relative prices reflect real resource costs .  But these policies are not sufficient in themselves to promote fast and sustainable growth in the countries concerned , and that is the key to any strategy - as for middle-income countries - that envisions growing out from under a debt overhang .  
For most developing economies in Asia , success in maintaining their growth rates lies in continuing their high levels of domestic savings , in broadly based human capital development , in improving the competitiveness of domestic markets , in their openness to foreign capital and technology , and in improved macroeconomic management .  
Pursue and implement sound and stable macroeconomic and sectoral policies that are designed and monitored with the full and equal participation of women , encourage broad-based sustained economic growth , address the structural causes of poverty and are geared towards eradicating poverty and reducing gender-based inequality within the overall framework of achieving people-centred sustainable development ;  
Implicit in this approach is that women 's ability to compensate at the household level for the decline in output and for changes in the composition and level of aggregate demand is treated as infinitely elastic , obscuring the impact of macroeconomic policy on the human resource base of economic activity .  
This in turn is likely to have a negative impact on international economic competitiveness , balance of payments and economic growth , as the shortfall in human skills resulting from the adverse impact of macroeconomic policy remains unaccounted for and unplanned for in terms of appropriate supportive measures and resources , thus rendering the policy unsustainable .

The first question raises macroeconomic issues concerning domestic saving and the net transfer of foreign saving to developing countries ; the second question raises microeconomic issues concerning the role of government and the financial sector in intermediating between savers and investors .  
It was noted that the effect of sound and efficient policies at the micro-economic level as well as the impact on individual and small group initiatives can be blunted by inconsistent or unbalanced macroeconomic policies .  
Successful countries have been those that have been capable of attracting a high level of external capital inflows while , through active macroeconomic policies , avoiding the over-heating of domestic demand , excessive exchange rate appreciation and volatile interest rates .  
NULLThe Working Group also concluded that foreign direct investment was attracted most strongly to those countries that had adopted measures to strengthen their domestic technological capability and created an overall policy framework conducive to innovation , investment in infrastructure , intellectual property protection , human capital formation and a stable macroeconomic and regulatory environment .  
NULLIn the light of those findings , the Working Group , in its general conclusions , confirmed that efforts towards promoting technology transfer and technological capability-building in developing countries and countries in transition need to be coupled with market-based trade and investment policy and pricing systems , and with a stable macroeconomic environment for business activity conducive to overall economic growth and employment . 
The formal financial system in Africa has faced a number of internal and external constraints , including inadequate technical and managerial capacity , antiquated legal and regulatory frameworks , inappropriate macroeconomic policies and pronounced government intervention , that not only hampered its growth but actually caused significant disintermediation in a number of countries .  
While historic factors such as the low level of African incomes and inadequate domestic technical expertise and capacity explain a part of this situation , it is also the general perception that inappropriate macroeconomic policies , combined with an antiquated and ineffective legal , regulatory and prudential framework , have been the main impediments .  
The implementation of a sound macroeconomic policy framework is seen as a key determinant of future financial stability and rapid economic recovery .  
Among the key issues which should be addressed were poverty eradication , global macroeconomic policy coordination , industrial development , economic diversification and the development of infrastructures , improved resource flows , including debt relief ; commodities policy ; human resource development and capacity-building .  
Urges the international community to promote a supportive international economic environment by adopting favourable macroeconomic policies for promoting sustained economic growth and sustainable development , so as to allow and sustain the full and effective implementation of the Programme of Action by the developing countries ;  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Governments bore the primary responsibility for formulating appropriate strategies , policies , programmes and actions to combat poverty ; the effort required sound macroeconomic policies , structural changes and the mobilization of domestic resources , inter alia , through more equitable tax regimes and a reduction in military expenditures .  
Urges the international community to promote a supportive international economic environment by adopting favourable macroeconomic policies for promoting sustained economic growth and sustainable development , so as to allow and sustain the full and effective implementation of the Programme of Action by the developing countries ;  
concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of drought followed by excessive rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,

The macroeconomic reforms and adjustment programmes of a wide range of least developed countries had not been successful during the first half of the current decade owing to an overall unfavourable external environment .  
macroeconomic factors which lay beyond the control of the countries of the southern hemisphere , where the vast majority of refugee populations were to be found , had impoverished those countries even further , leading to massive outflows of people seeking better living conditions .  
Although these models have generated deceptive , apparently attractive macroeconomic indicators , in practice they go hand in hand with an increase in poverty , marginalization , environmental degradation , disease , ignorance , social conflict , a loss of national resources and sovereignty in short , with the most brutal and increasingly irreversible underdevelopment .  
The core objectives of the programme were , inter alia , to create and adjust the country 's macroeconomic policy , ensure a correct legal and regulatory framework for the development of a strong market economy , provide a transparent and accountable policy framework aimed at promoting investment , allocate adequate budgetary resources for social programmes , create the necessary conditions for the establishment and consolidation of democratic institutions and support good governance and political stability .  
The definitive solution to the problem of the external debt , of ownership and of a considerable improvement in national , foreign and private investment , in the framework of a sound and responsible macroeconomic policy favouring internal savings and contributing to improving the standard of living of the Nicaraguan people , must be our goal .  
The efforts of developing countries in carrying out trade and macroeconomic reforms aimed at sustained economic growth can be impeded by the use of unilateral actions by major economies , in particular those with extraterritorial effects .  
This is being achieved through the pursuit of a sound and stable macroeconomic policy , supported by a prudent and disciplined fiscal and monetary stance , and the delivery of an investor-friendly institutional legal framework .  
Emphasizes the need to implement sound and stable macroeconomic , micro-economic and sectoral policies that encourage broad-based economic growth and development that is sustainable and equitable , that generate jobs and that are geared towards eradicating poverty and reducing social and economic inequalities and exclusion ;  
The favourable risk assessment was based on the generally sound macroeconomic policies and continued economic liberalization pursued by most Governments as well as the high rates of domestic investment and savings .  
Stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Emphasizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
Deeply concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of drought followed by excessive rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,  
The technical analysis , along with policy proposals reflecting a set of priorities at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels , should help in the elaboration of objectives for the rehabilitation and restructuring of the economy with a view to absorbing the surplus labour force , diversifying trade , achieving an adequate rate of growth in income and ensuring its equal distribution among regions .  
The eradication of poverty requires , inter alia , sound macroeconomic policies aimed at creating employment opportunities , equal and universal access to economic opportunities ( and special efforts to facilitate such access for the disadvantaged ) ; education and training that will promote sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen productive employment and work , and basic social services , including health facilities . 
The coordination of macroeconomic policies at all levels so as to achieve an international financial system that is conducive to stable and sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
In addition to their direct social and local economic consequences , natural disasters affected the macroeconomic standing of countries , increasing debt , reducing foreign income due to loss of exports and reducing overall production outputs .  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
The policies and measures in support of these objectives set out in the Programme of Action revolve around the following major areas : establishment of a macroeconomic policy framework conducive to sustained economic growth and long-term development ; development and mobilization of human resources ; development , expansion and modernization of the productive base ; reversing the trend towards environmental degradation ; promotion of an integrated policy of rural development aimed at increasing food production , enhancing rural income and enhancing non-agricultural sector activities ; and the provision of adequate external support .  
The domestic factors include : civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some LDCs and the resulting social and economic burdens , political instability , macroeconomic imbalances , manifested in large fiscal and balance-of-payments deficits , in many cases the unfavourable short-term impact of macroeconomic policy adjustments on specific areas , in particular the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of the population , and poor performance of the productive sectors including lack of adequate physical infrastructure .  
However , while most developing countries and countries in transition are enthusiastic about encouraging foreign investment in mining , not all are capable of making the necessary macroeconomic changes and implementing the necessary legal and fiscal regimes that would be acceptable to the international mining community in a timely manner .  
That has required close coordination of macroeconomic policies among major industrial countries to prevent the harmful effects on national economies of any adverse market reactions to actual or perceived changes in national economic situations and associated policies . 
However , the success of the policies followed depends on the underlying preconditions for private sector development , including stable and credible political conditions , law and order , and the continuity of policies which in themselves must be credible , consistent and transparent , as well as stable macroeconomic conditions .  
Most of them continued progressing towards macroeconomic stability with growth , but with notable weak spots , and in many cases their growth was not sufficient to reduce the social deficits accumulated in earlier years .  
But the most important prerequisites for the successful mobilization of foreign and domestic resources are confidence in the financial system and appropriate macroeconomic policies , a well-established and clear legal and regulatory framework , a transparent and non-distortionary taxation system , a stable domestic financial system , and adequate infrastructure .  
In developing further the orientation and objectives of national strategies , the Commission may wish to focus on the identification of characteristics of poverty which could be common to most countries , regardless of their definition of poverty and which could be used to measure progress ; the identification of elements for elaborating national strategies comprising macroeconomic , structural , distributional and regulatory policies , together with specific short - and long-term objectives ; and the further identification of specific international actions .  
An appropriate economic framework based on sound macroeconomic policies , a well-developed infrastructure , strengthened institutions and capacity , as well as meeting basic human needs such as shelter , and providing social welfare , were recognized as key factors for addressing the poverty problem .  
The ESCAP secretariat continued to monitor , review and analyse the economic and social development situation in the region and disseminated relevant information to policy makers and others to make possible better understanding of the macroeconomic policies conducive to sustained economic growth , poverty alleviation and the integration of environmental concerns into macroeconomic decision - and policy-making processes .  
Throughout the year , the ESCAP Pacific Operations Centre offered advisory and technical assistance to Pacific island countries in development programming , central banking , macroeconomic policy formulation , financial systems , trade promotion , development of port infrastructure and macroeconomic management , and provided short consultancies upon specific requests .  
Although most of the countries in Latin America continued progressing towards macroeconomic stability with growth , which is so essential for creating an atmosphere conducive to strengthening regional cooperation , in many areas their growth was not sufficient to reduce the " social deficits " accumulated in earlier years . 
Measures to enhance socio-political stability and good governance and to secure sound macroeconomic policies that will be conducive to private foreign and domestic investment should be strongly encouraged .  
With regard to the external debt , it is also relevant to point out the Declaration of the Support Group for Nicaragua of 16 April 1996 , which considers that , within the framework of a sound and responsible macroeconomic policy that encourages domestic savings , resources released as a result of a comprehensive approach to the debt problem should be used to support productive and social development .  Alleviation of the external debt burden would thus help to eliminate widespread poverty among the Nicaraguan population .  
This is a sign that confidence in at least the medium run is being restored and that key institutional reforms , as well as a reasonable degree of macroeconomic and political stability , are being attained .  
Comprehensive national forest strategies that are consistent with and integrated into macroeconomic planning and policy and take into account the strategic value of forests as a capital base for national sustainable development need to be developed in order to facilitate mobilizing funds for sustainable forest development from various sources .  
It stressed the need to implement sound and stable macroeconomic , microeconomic and sectoral policies that encouraged broad-based , sustained economic growth and development , and called upon the international community to seek to mobilize additional financial resources that were both adequate and predictable to contribute to poverty eradication .  
The objective of eradicating absolute poverty required a broad range of policies and actions at all levels : an appropriate economic framework based on sound macroeconomic policies ; a well-developed infrastructure ; strengthened institutions and capacity ; as well as programmes designed to meet basic human needs ;  
The Government 's development efforts in the last three months have centred on encouraging passage by Parliament of two key laws related to the structural adjustment programme - civil service reform and modernization of public enterprises , maintaining the macroeconomic balance necessary to attract private investment and reactivating externally financed public investment to improve the country 's infrastructure and provide a much-needed stimulus to domestic demand .  
The major tasks to be addressed in the post-election phase of Bosnia and Herzegovina 's economic development include , inter alia , rapid installation of State institutions , implementation of sound macroeconomic policies , adoption of a legislative framework conducive to the transition to a market economy and continuing the reconstruction efforts .  
Cancelled : ( ii ) role and implications of macroeconomic policies for promotion of regional economic cooperation ; ( viii ) one issue on new and innovative ways to develop and strengthen industrial and technological skills : and ( x ) one issue on technology indicators and directories of selected research and development institutions , experts and technologies .  
They called upon the developed countries to make every effort to coordinate their macroeconomic policies , including through multilateral institutions in which developing countries are represented , so as to stimulate the world economy through increased demand , stabilized markets and further liberalized trade , and thereby provide a conducive international economic environment for development .  
Deeply concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,  
But it should be noted that , while innovation and competitiveness are activities of enterprises , success in innovation depends on a wide range of external factors , including the domestic institutional and social environments , national macroeconomic policies , incentive structures , the availability of skills , the local supply base , and the level of investment and linkages .  
The Government has the power to establish the right macroeconomic environment , as well as a transparent , stable and predictable legal , regulatory and tax framework , and thus create favourable conditions for entrepreneurial and enterprise development .  By acting as a catalytic or intermediating agent , including through appropriate policies and a supportive business infrastructure , it can stimulate , facilitate or support the development of enterprises , particularly SMEs , and of inter-firm cooperation , both internally and with foreign firms .  
Accordingly , the Governments role should be confined to its core functions , namely creating a sound legal and macroeconomic framework , protecting the environment , ensuring order and security and providing infrastructure , education , social protection and essential public services .  
Deeply concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,  
Notes that while sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country to promote macroeconomic stability are essential elements for determining the volume and structure of private capital flows , international macroeconomic policies play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness , and should contribute to creating a favourable international economic environment ;  
Proposals aimed at enhancing broader cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policies among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , as a means of promoting a stable international economic environment conducive to sustained economic growth , particularly in developing countries ;  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Emphasizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly of developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
These included macroeconomic stability , high rates of domestic saving , maintenance of sound financial intermediaries , high priority given to human resource development ( especially to high _ quality primary and secondary education ) , competitive exchange rates , export orientation , a supportive environment which rewarded entrepreneurship and allowed open and constructive dialogue between government and the private sector regarding objectives and policies , and governance which balanced the promotion of social cohesion and consensus with that of competition between individuals and companies .  
In his view , the role of Governments was to create a stable macroeconomic and political environment , to put in place a competent and effective administration , and to create a juridical framework that favoured private investment and guaranteed the maximum development of human resources .  
While such authoritarianism on the political front should not be replicated in other developing countries , the East Asian experience did show the positive role which Governments could play in development by providing not only a good macroeconomic environment but also policies giving appropriate importance to agriculture and basic social services , as well as to the establishment of effective and secure financial systems .

Proposals aimed at enhancing broader cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policies among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , as a means of promoting a stable international economic environment conducive to sustained economic growth , particularly in developing countries ;  
This climate - amounting to a virtual social psychosis - is aggravated by the stringent economic pressures felt by ordinary people as a result of macroeconomic structural readjustment measures .  
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society and the creation of more and better jobs requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
In this context , the international community should explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact on the international financial system .  
The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including , inter alia , macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .  
As Mali sees it , any work towards sustainable development is above all a national responsibility , through the effective definition and application of sound macroeconomic policies , based on transparency , the pre-eminent rule of law , the practice of democracy , respect for human rights , social justice , and the participation of all in the effort of national development .  
I have already stated that the United Nations must play a constructive and catalytic role , within its macroeconomic policies to facilitate economic growth for sustained development , thereby enabling developing countries , which constitute the vast majority of the Members of the Organization , to have an equal share in the opportunities for wealth creation .  
Nevertheless , the prudent advice for policy makers in capital-importing countries would be , first , to seek to build and retain investor confidence through their own cautious macroeconomic policy-making and , second , to remember that international financial markets can become highly volatile and subject to herd instincts and thus capable of moving vast volumes of funds out of , as well as into , countries on short notice .  
Briefly , almost all the capacity-building initiatives supporting the themes mentioned in Agenda 21 can be grouped into eight main areas - environmental strategy and policy , macroeconomic strategy , consensus-building , environmental management capacity , normative and legal frameworks , scientific and socioeconomic research , technology transfer and public outreach .  
Against this backdrop , the Survey is organized as follows : chapter I briefly describes how the developing ESCAP region fares in the emerging global scene ; chapter II shows the recent performance of individual countries in terms of selected macroeconomic and social development indicators which impinge on participation in the globalization and regionalization processes ; chapters III and IV analyse the benefits and risks of integration into the international and regional economy focusing on foreign trade and external finance ( including FDI ) . 
The elements of macroeconomic balance and stability , such as inflation , fiscal deficits and current account deficits ( which reflect the gap between domestic savings and investment ) are widely acknowledged to affect foreign trade and external financial inflows through their effects on interest rates , exchange rates , rates of return on investments and credit ratings , among others .

Overall Socioeconomic Perspective for the World Economy ; six working papers on selected macroeconomic issues , including changing world patterns in income distribution , relationships between economic growth and trade , the relationship between economic growth and merchandise trade , financing the social safety net in services , emerging issues in development finance in the twenty-first century and possible strategies for international development in the twenty-first century ;  
The deferral of two expert group meetings , one on the macroeconomic effects of drug trafficking in selected developing countries and economies in transition and the other on new forms of international cooperation in law enforcement with particular reference to the problems of transit States , has affected the level of understanding of drug trafficking patterns in the geographic areas in question . 
In addition , the Committee will promote the implementation of measures designed to strengthen economic cooperation and integration among African countries ; assist African countries and their intergovernmental organizations in making the policy instruments for economic cooperation and integration of the African region more effective ; and identify measures to coordinate and harmonize micro - and macroeconomic policies among African countries as a prerequisite for accelerating regional economic integration . 
Noting that much of the environmental degradation results from unsustainable lifestyles in the industrialized world or poverty and underdevelopment in developing countries , which itself is the result of inequitable growth patterns , unfavourable terms of trade and investment flows , and a global macroeconomic environment that is not supportive of the development of developing countries ,  
An international enabling environment also requires coordination of macroeconomic policies by the international community which foster conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and low fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments , technologies and knowledge to developing countries , and new and additional financial resources from all sources .  
An essential component of an enabling environment for development is sound national macroeconomic policies and the creation of favourable conditions for investment and increased domestic savings , including through the creation of a sound banking system .  
These include weak domestic employment capacity , uneven sectoral growth , weak intersectoral articulation , severe marketing bottlenecks , poorly coordinated and fragmented new investments in both public and private ventures and structural imbalances among macroeconomic aggregates .  
As they moved along the path of reform , their objectives became more complex and ambitious , shifting from the limited concerns of macroeconomic imbalances and stabilization to the promotion of development by a plethora of market-oriented reforms , including the improvement of economic efficiency , curbing of public sector intervention , encouragement of the private sector and liberalization of the external trade sector .  
The resulting improved and sustained macroeconomic stability in several least developed countries and the good weather conditions and strength in the international demand for the exports of African least developed countries are the main reasons for the third year of relatively strong growth and rising per capita output in the least developed countries .  
The General Assembly is encouraged to direct all of its committees and bodies and draw the attention of other bodies of the United Nations system to the need to mainstream a gender perspective systematically into all areas of their work , in particular in areas such as macroeconomic questions , operational activities for development , poverty eradication , human rights , humanitarian assistance , budgeting , disarmament , peace and security , and legal and political matters ( para .  12 ) .  
Whilst a sound and stable macroeconomic and microeconomic policy was essential , basic transport , power and telecommunications infrastructure were identified as the most important physical elements , coupled with mechanisms for encouraging investment in the processing industries , for promoting the provision of export credit and trade finance , for ensuring the control of product quality and for building managerial capacity .  
Successful enterprise development is affected by a conducive economic environment in terms of the macroeconomic , regulatory and legal frameworks , the structural characteristics of the national economy , the degree of market development , the institutional framework , the infrastructural and human resource base and the quality and coherence of government policies .  
For developing countries , the primary motivation is the formation and consolidation of viable economic spaces that would create dynamic trade and investment growth , develop viable , integrated and competitive productive systems to serve regional and international markets , strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination and enhance infrastructural linkages .  
In Madrid in October 1994 , the Interim Committee of IMF adopted a declaration on a partnership for sustainable global growth , 4 which the Committee updated and broadened at its autumn ( northern hemisphere ) meeting in 1996.5 This set of international guidelines for macroeconomic and financial policy was intended as a framework for policy-making by all IMF members and to guide the Funds policy discussions with members . 
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies in each country for promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
Addressing the needs of people living in poverty and the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of society , and the creation of more and better jobs , requires attention to be given to conducive macroeconomic policies and to such issues as human resources development , gender equality , public participation and social integration .  
In this context , the international community should explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries and monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact on the international financial system .  
The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .  
Development called for the private sector to act as the engine of sustained economic growth , in partnership with the public sector , which played a crucial role in basic infrastructure and services and in establishing and maintaining sound macroeconomic policies , protecting human rights and the environment and creating a conducive legal environment for private investment and entrepreneurship .  
In order for developing countries to be able to attract private capital flows , they must maintain good governance , sound macroeconomic policies and close , cooperative working relations with international financial organizations .  
The problem of the widening industrialization and technology gap is acknowledged to be particularly acute in sub-Saharan Africa , with 33 of the world 's 48 least developed countries , while macroeconomic stabilization programmes have been adopted by most African countries since the early 1980s in an attempt to create an enabling environment for long-term growth , they have usually not included any specific measures to promote industrial development .  
In an indicative list , the Council identified macroeconomic questions , operational activities for development , poverty eradication , human rights , humanitarian assistance , budgeting , disarmament , peace and security , and legal and political matters as areas where gender mainstreaming needs to be pursued systematically .  
Expressing its concern that a number of developing countries , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , have become more vulnerable to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate of private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Recognizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries and monetary and financial authorities and institutions so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly of developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
Recognizes the benefit of exchange rate stability and a stable financial environment , and the potential impact on all countries of lack of stability in the foreign exchange markets , and in that regard invites the International Monetary Fund to fully exercise its mandate to sustain effective surveillance over the underlying macroeconomic policies of its member countries , in particular those countries whose economies are particularly relevant for the stability of the international monetary and financial system ;  
This encouraging trend has been achieved through the adoption and pursuit by Governments of policies and measures aimed at ensuring , among others , macroeconomic stability , inflows of foreign direct investment , open and free markets and stable and transparent legal and regulatory frameworks .  
In the area of macroeconomic policy , we have proceeded to liberalize the trade and exchange regimes to foster enhanced competitiveness ; streamline the incentive framework ; privatize State-owned enterprises to promote increasing levels of private investment ; promote entrepreneurial activity through , among other measures , a venture capital regime ; and to modernize and strengthen intellectual property legislation to encourage investment and the transfer of technology .  
A growing number of countries on our continent , including my own country , Ethiopia , have taken decisive measures to liberalize their economies , to cut Government spending , to institute sound macroeconomic policies and to enhance the role of the private sector and civil society .  
For meaningful development to take root in the developing countries , an enabling international environment should be established which can address such issues as macroeconomic stability , more open trade regimes in developed countries , stable financial systems , reasonable debt initiatives , such as those proposed under the World Bank 's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and greater financial flows from developed countries to the developing countries .  
Thus , he introduced Agenda Venezuela , which contained a comprehensive and coherent set of policies that include programmes of macroeconomic stabilization , institutional reforms , social benefits and productive restructuring .  
Without a supportive external economic environment that includes cooperation in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies , trade liberalization , mobilization of new and additional financial resources , financial stability , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , and productive investment in technologies , our efforts would be akin to trying to roll uphill .  
In the face of the tendency of global financial markets and international financial institutions to demand fiscal and monetary austerity , especially of the weaker economies , constraining both national and international economic growth , there is a need to develop new national and international policy instruments to promote growth and employment while maintaining macroeconomic stability . 
Economic , social and political stability , including stable macroeconomic policies , have been a major factor in encouraging domestic savings and investment and attracting FDI in the more successful developing countries .  
In view of the increasing importance of trade and international investment as engines of growth , developed countries must provide comprehensive support , including macroeconomic support , to the efforts of developing countries , as agreed at various OECD ministerial meetings and the summits convened by the seven major industrial countries .  
Developing countries are concerned that private capital flows are concentrated in a few developing countries ( 12 countries accounted for about 80 per cent of total private flows and three quarters of FDI in developing countries during the first half of the 1990s ) , mostly middle-income countries in Asia ( which accounted for about two thirds of the expansion of total private flows ) and Latin America that have adopted outward-looking strategies and sound macroeconomic policies .  
Thus , adopting an integrated treatment of the bases of economic growth , by not only ensuring macroeconomic balance and stability but also directing attention to the industrial base and incentive structures , may do much to enhance the viability of policies that address the environmental and social aspects of sustainable development in individual countries .  
At the end of the three-year period , it would be possible to evaluate the degree to which the objectives had been attained and on that basis decide whether work on enterprise development represented an important contribution to development and therefore whether it should form part of the elements presented for ministerial consideration at UNCTAD X . In short , work on an enterprise development strategy must be based on a strategic vision , the elements of the strategy must contribute to growth and development without jeopardizing macroeconomic stability , and the strategy must be amenable to evaluation . 
This role was manifested at two levels : at the macro level in terms of creating an enabling environment , good macroeconomic policies , a sound legal , regulatory and tax framework and political stability ; and at the micro level inter alia through providing appropriate support measures and structures and investing in capacity _ building , including in the areas of education , training and health .  It could create an environment in which the private sector knew what was happening .  
However , while macroeconomic stabilization was a necessary but not sufficient condition for enterprise development , structural adjustment and liberalization measures had produced encouraging positive results such as the emergence of an enterprise culture and increased entrepreneurial activities to take advantage of the enlarged economic opportunities for the private sector arising from such measures .  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;

Policies for promoting domestic resources mobilization should include macroeconomic and structural reforms , public expenditure reforms , the promotion of environmental taxes and charges , a review of existing subsidy policies , and financial sector development to promote personal saving and access to credit , taking into account the characteristics and capabilities of individual countries .  
The two major crises that broke out in Bulgaria and Albania in 1996 - and which are still unresolved , although progress has been made in Bulgaria - underlined in a dramatic fashion the fragility of the transition process in some countries and demonstrated how misleading and dangerous it can be to focus on changes in a few macroeconomic variables such as indicators of progress and success .  
The most effective means of reducing poverty is the adoption of national development strategies , including sound macroeconomic and structural policies , which encourage sustainable growth that increases income-earning opportunities for the poor and develop the human resources of the poor , particularly through broad access to education , health and family planning services .  
The top-down approach seeks to create an enabling or " fostering " environment , which provides the right incentives for small firms , together with enough positive support and protection ( e.g . against unfair practices of larger competitors ) to allow such firms to make the best of their potential . 4 The top-down approach seeks to improve the business environment by operating on macroeconomic variables such as prices , government regulations and policies , by providing legislation and enforcement , and by building up the physical infrastructure . 
Missions , in response to ad hoc requests from Governments , on issues of economic reform ; improving macroeconomic stability ; restructuring government budgets and designing taxation and public expenditure policies ; facilitating the transition to a market-based economy ; and efficient management of public enterprises and creation of viable public institutions ; ( ii ) Group training .  
The above calls for coordination in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies by major industrialized countries to create and sustain conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments and technologies and appropriate knowledge to developing countries , as well as new and additional financial resources .  
The objective of the case studies was to examine the role of the United Nations system agencies in assisting countries to create an appropriate macroeconomic and social framework , which would entail exploring instances where the successful development of an enabling environment had been enhanced through United Nations system agency support and inter-agency coordination , or where the lack of such coordination proved to be detrimental .

The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including , inter alia , macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .  
In this regard , the Netherlands stated that institutional and human capacity , a reliable regulatory and a supportive legal system , as well as stable and sound macroeconomic policies , were among the central building blocks to attract domestic and international capital to finance development .  
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 49 / 122 of 19 December 1994 , the analytical work and technical cooperation of UNCTAD related to small developing States , which also supports the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , is aimed at preventing the phenomenon of marginalization faced by those countries in the global economy , and involves assistance to national macroeconomic policies and improving their micro-economic trade environment .  
In order to attract FDI , countries were invited to continue initiatives in such areas as a stable macroeconomic environment , transparent and accountable public administration , respect for property rights and the rule of law , the quality of labour , improvement of infrastructure , entrepreneurial and institutional capabilities and simplified administrative and regulatory frameworks .  
This performance reflected the combined effects of a variety of factors : the results of most countries efforts to control severe macroeconomic imbalances in 1995 , adverse climate conditions which affected primary production , and the drop in the international prices of the main export goods .  
A number of comprehensive country-level employment reviews were undertaken , the framework of which encompassed the major features affecting the level and quality of employment , including national macroeconomic and sectoral policies covering such issues as savings , investment and enterprise development ; labour market policies and institutions ; democratic policy-making and social dialogue ; gender discrimination and child labour ; and trade and capital flows and migratory movements .  
Among the recommendations made in the report were an emphasis on the importance of increasing economic growth rates in order to increase the rate of employment growth , and a recognition that this would require political and social as well as macroeconomic stability ; the importance of moderating the excesses of structural adjustment strategies ; an acknowledgement that for certain countries , a more gradual and selective approach to trade liberalization may be warranted ( ibid . , para . 25 ) ; and the value of policy incentives to offset market failure .  
At the national level , that decision had been expressed in the processes of trade liberalization , privatization , macroeconomic stabilization , modernization of the public sector , combating corruption , reduction or elimination of public deficits and more efficient use of public resources .  At the international level , MERCOSUR was a basic element in the strategy for dynamic integration of the economies of its members into the global context and for peace-building in the region .  
The explanation for that situation lay in the accumulation of such factors as poor physical infrastructure , a generally unskilled labour force , high levels of indebtedness , high inflation and small domestic markets , problems which the African countries must face up to by seeking to establish sound macroeconomic equilibrium and suitable infrastructure , and by investing in social programmes to promote the integration of their people in the global system .  
Each developing country should adopt macroeconomic policies conducive to domestic savings and investment , which had more impact on growth than external contributions , and should stress human resources development , education and health at the social level and respect for the rule of law at the political level .  
That measure was important for what could be called a sound macroeconomic policy ; however , coordination proper , in the sense that countries jointly established monetary or fiscal policies , was a thing of the past , since it had proved to be ineffective , as had been indicated in the World Economic and Social Study , 1995 .  
Experts identified five main areas of potential policy incoherence : between macroeconomic policy and microeconomic policy ; between public and private sector bodies involved in SME support services ; between the federal and local levels ; between implementation and design ; and between internal and external policies .  
Recognizing the potentially adverse impact of large fluctuations among the major international currencies on developing countries , Ministers consider it imperative that the Fund fully exercise its powers to ensure effective surveillance over the macroeconomic policies of the countries involved in the management of these currencies .  
Fourth , the content of international development cooperation must be constantly revised in the light of the new characteristics and needs of the world economy , and the effective participation of developing countries in macroeconomic policies must be strengthened . 
The treatment of the interrelated subjects of trade , finance , technology and investment , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies and their social impact in the international context , should be substantive issues in the political debate conducted in the Committee , since the General Assembly was not only the supreme political body at the intergovernmental level but , above all , the most democratic body in existence .  
But these bold reforms , whose positive macroeconomic results can already be measured , have rarely been accompanied by an improvement in the international environment and therefore have not allowed for a genuine economic take-off .  
They should pursue sound macroeconomic policies , strive to increase domestic savings and investment , strengthen institutional , legal , regulatory and supervisory capacities and improve economic management in the public and private sectors .  
A stable macroeconomic environment when accompanied by low inflation , competitive exchange rates , manageable public debt , democratic institutions and principles of good governance was conducive to increased domestic and foreign investment .  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
Sound macroeconomic policies and a legal and economic framework that enhanced the growth of a dynamic private sector were seen as essential in improving countries capacity to trade .  
The Committee noted that the improved economic performance of LDCs in recent years was mainly attributable to their own sound macroeconomic policy reforms , undertaken under most difficult domestic and external conditions .  
The Board noted that the improved economic performance of LDCs in recent years was mainly attributable to their own sound macroeconomic policy reforms , undertaken under most difficult domestic and external conditions .  
The Board noted that the improved economic performance of LDCs in recent years was mainly attributable to their own sound macroeconomic policy reforms , undertaken under most difficult domestic and external conditions .  
In terms of national strategies , many countries had undertaken policies aimed at strengthening fiscal performance , increasing domestic savings , strengthening financial sectors by improved regulation and monitoring and greater capital requirements , and increasing macroeconomic stability .  
To be most effective in achieving sustainable forest management , economic instruments should be designed with a specific policy objective in mind ; they should also be well integrated into the broader macroeconomic and multisectoral policy context .  
Recognizes also the importance of appropriate policy responses to the challenges of globalization at the national level , in particular by pursuing sound and stable domestic policies , including , inter alia , sound macroeconomic and social policies , so as to realize the objective of the eradication of poverty ;  
The continuing Asian crisis , which was taking place in countries considered to have dynamic economies based on sound fundamental macroeconomic variables , had clearly shown that macroeconomic stability could not by itself ensure the level of stability that a sustained development-oriented industrial strategy required .  
The report of the Director-General of UNIDO ( A / 53 / 254 ) included a highly justified critique of the so-called gradual approach to economic and industrial development , which posited a first stage of macroeconomic reforms , followed by a second stage of socio-economic , institutional and legal reforms .  
Until the causes of the current vulnerability of the international economy were determined , it should not be forgotten that the adoption of sound macroeconomic policies and the implementation of far-reaching institutional reforms were essential for the achievement of comprehensive and equitable social and economic progress .  
In that framework , the State played a central role , in cooperation with civil society and economic agents , in counter-balancing the adverse effects on the poor of structural adjustment and macroeconomic policies .  
The recent financial turmoil had shown that countries must maintain constant vigilance over all economic , financial and institutional parameters in order to guard against the volatility of other markets and contagion effects , and that each country needed not only sound macroeconomic fundamentals , but also a strong financial and banking system with adequate supervisory and regulatory mechanisms , transparency and good governance .  
The leaders of the MERCOSUR countries had been stressing for some time the need to promote closer cooperation between monetary authorities at the global level , better coordination of the macroeconomic policies of countries which had the greatest impact on international finances , proper supervision of agents in international financial markets and stabilization of currencies that were the subject of speculation .  
These activities are expected to contribute to the deepening of the regional cooperation and integration process in Africa , including effective trade liberalization , coordinated and convergent macroeconomic and sectoral policies , and to the promotion of increased investments in infrastructure development in the areas of transport and communication , energy and water and the exploration and exploitation of minerals through enhanced regional cooperation .  
Only 82 of the 185 States Members of the United Nations reported the full set of major macroeconomic aggregates in the last five years . 19 This is despite the fact that economic statistics , and in particular national accounts , are well-established statistical areas , with internationally agreed upon standards and methodologies and with a history of data collection . 
As noted in document E / CN . 5 / 1999 / 4 , although the multilateral financial institutions have acknowledged the importance of protecting or compensating the poor for the adverse effects of adjustment measures , the poor nevertheless continue to bear the brunt of hardships arising from macroeconomic and structural adjustment .  
More contemporary national and international discussion of how to achieve a balanced approach to macroeconomic policy could be very valuable , focusing on how to simultaneously address economic and social goals , such as full employment , low inflation and development in the fullest sense , including both efficient economic growth and an effective strategy for increasing equity .  
Indeed , in the future , investors will look more carefully at macro - and microeconomic policies [ 24 ] , most particularly at : high economic growth rate , the degree of exchange rate stability , level of foreign exchange reserves , general macroeconomic stability , health of domestic banking system , quality of stock market regulatory framework , quality of domestic accounting / disclosure standards and degree of investors rights protection .  
Four advisory missions each on macroeconomic policy and economic reform in countries with economies in transition ; policy responses to social impacts of the economic crisis ; institution-building for integrating environmental considerations into economic decision-making processes ; macroeconomic policy and related institution-building in least developed and Pacific island developing countries ; and promotion of sustainable development in small island developing States ; ( ii ) Group training .  
Enhance the capacity of institutions in developing countries to formulate development strategies by strengthening their ability to monitor national subregional , regional and international macroeconomic trends and incorporate them into the national framework for economic and social policy-making ;  
ACC stressed the critical importance of sound macroeconomic policies as well as economic reforms that balance growth with social investment for achieving accelerated and sustained economic growth , without which a sustained reduction in poverty is not possible .  
Internal enabling environment : policy framework incentives for domestic private savings , equitable tax systems ( development and enforcement of ) , macroeconomic policies , disincentives to corruption ; good governance ; transparency ; effective regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector ; banking infrastructure , pension funds ; corporate governance ; internationally accepted accounting standards , and a sound legal system ( land and property rights ) ;  
They also continue a good record of cooperation with the Department in the area of research and policy analyses , and collaborate in monitoring and analysing the emerging global and regional trends and macroeconomic policies in their respective major publications , namely , the World Economic Survey and the regional economic and social surveys .  
Having reviewed and shared experiences with tax reforms in their various countries , the Ministers agreed to reinforce macroeconomic stability and deepen financial market and institutional reforms , as well as to ensure sound interest and exchange-rate policy management so as to enhance private and public savings .  
They resolved to take the necessary steps to stem and reverse capital flight , focusing on policies that create and sustain a consistent and stable macroeconomic policy environment , and promoting capital and financial markets development , as well as resolving the problem of unsustainably high external debts .  
Projects aimed at the strengthening of macroeconomic management capacity , legislative systems , the legal framework , the judiciary , civilian police and election management capacity , along with mechanisms for political reconciliation , public administration and civil service reform , inter alia , must be explored , particularly in Kosovo , taking advantage of national human resources , experience and skills .  
The coordinated cuts in interest rates in late 1998 proved effective in avoiding a further deterioration in the global economy at that time , but the global consequences of a move in the opposite direction are untested under the prevailing macroeconomic environment where a number of largely intangible factors , such as investor confidence , play such a critical role .  
We welcome the progress made through the chairmanship of the European Commission and the World Bank towards establishing a donor coordination process to develop a coherent international assistance strategy for the region , opening the door for all donor opportunities , as well as to mobilize additional financial support for reconstruction , regional integration , economic recovery and reform and to promote sound macroeconomic and structural policies by the countries concerned .  
In this era of heightened financial volatility , the importance of sound macroeconomic fundamentals has become paramount : a sustainable fiscal position and current-account balance , a low or moderate rate of inflation , and consistency between the rate of inflation and the exchange rate are indispensable for any economy , as all economies are open ( albeit to different degrees ) .  
It is now increasingly recognized that the response to crises has to address the domestic social consequences of any economic measures that are adopted and should not be restricted to restoring macroeconomic stability and international financial confidence .  
The current IMF-monitored economic programme put in place in November 1998 as a follow-up to the 1997 / 98 programme is designed to maintain macroeconomic stability and make further progress in the area of structural reform while the political situation settles , and while a possible new enhanced structural adjustment facility programme is being considered .  
These include ( a ) strengthening macroeconomic stability and reducing distortions so as to encourage private sector investment ; ( b ) improving the quality of government spending in order to invest in basic social services and raise the level of human capital ; and ( c ) rationalizing the assistance provided by external donors .  
Governments should create an enabling environment for SMEs through stable macroeconomic policies and an open and flexible regulatory framework in order to stimulate free competition , research and development , and to create neutral conditions that fostered entrepreneurial activity , developed competitive advantages and created access to both national and foreign financial resources and new technologies .  
Governments are invited to intensify their efforts to create an enabling environment , including stable macroeconomic policies , a coherent and flexible regulatory framework that encourages free competition , efficient physical infrastructure and the necessary improvement in education and human resource development in order to promote SME upgrading and business and technological capability development .  
The experience of developing countries during the past several years has also demonstrated that financial crises are contagious ; that is , once difficulties emerge , markets do not adequately discriminate between countries with strong and weak fundamentals , or between those with strong and weak economic structures and macroeconomic management . 
The pursuit of sound , growth-oriented macroeconomic policies , moreover , needs to be complemented by a general social , legal and political environment conducive to the efficient functioning of markets and , in particular , to the development of the private sector , whose investment decisions are at the centre of growth .  
For developing countries to achieve the best results from domestic and international agricultural liberalization , for example , they needed to have a stable macroeconomic environment and a basic level of infrastructure ( e.g . transport , storage , communications and finance ) in place .  
There is also concern that the recent emphasis in financial and economic policies has not always been development-oriented , that the dominance of a limited set of macroeconomic targets and parameters over the social , political , cultural and environmental domains has gone too far , and that social and economic policies and objectives must be fully integrated .  
Governments are invited to intensify their efforts to create an enabling environment , including stable macroeconomic policies , a coherent and flexible regulatory framework that encourages free competition , efficient physical infrastructure and the necessary improvement in education and human resource development in order to promote SME upgrading and business and technological capability development .  
Governments should create an enabling environment for SMEs through stable macroeconomic policies and an open and flexible regulatory framework in order to stimulate free competition , research and development , and to create neutral conditions that fostered entrepreneurial activity , developed competitive advantages and created access to both national and foreign financial resources and new technologies .  
The sustainability of the recent growth performance of the least developed countries would also depend on increasing the level of gross domestic saving and gross domestic investment , the supply of critical skills and consolidation of political and macroeconomic stability .  
It noted the importance of strengthening an entrepreneurial environment , privatization and restructuring of state assets , the rule of law , the pursuit of sound macroeconomic policies and regulatory regimes , and the role regional integration plays in attracting new investment and improving economic efficiency .  It emphasized the creation of a free trade area in SADC and focused on the issue of non-tariff barriers .  
To achieve greater coherence in global economic policy-making , which is one of the functions of WTO , and make it more operational , WTO rules and disciplines should be taken fully into account by the international financial institutions when designing macroeconomic programmes and rescue packages for individual countries .  
For example , the ability of developing countries to achieve their growth potential , to close the gap in per capita income with the developed world and to maintain macroeconomic stability is significantly determined by macroeconomic policies pursued by the major industrial countries .  
A policy framework that integrates macroeconomic , financial , structural , social and human issues is imperative if there is to be equitable and sustainable development .  
The critical issue to be put on the development agenda for Africa is why macroeconomic reforms in Africa have not generated the expected microeconomic responses and have not promoted significant changes in technological capability , improvements in factory-wide skill levels , higher productivity , better manufactured export performance and greater value added in the domestic economies .  These are the elements that determine a countrys or regions successful integration into the global economy .  
For example , the ability of developing countries to achieve their growth potential , to close the gap in per capita incomes with the developed world and to maintain macroeconomic stability is significantly determined by macroeconomic policies pursued by the major industrial countries .  
Combined efforts of the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions , should help countries to enhance the performance of macroeconomic management , achieve greater coherence in the policies affecting economic , financial , social and environmental aspects , and protect the most vulnerable groups , and thus give the concerned country an opportunity to use this support to further its national goals while integrating better into the global economy .  
At the start of a new millennium , therefore , a fundamental challenge for the international community is to enhance the coherence and consistency of macroeconomic policies at the intergovernmental level and at the level of international institutions , as well as to implement concrete measures and initiatives designed to secure the integration of developing countries into the globalizing world economy on an equitable basis .  
Moreover , these strategies and policies should be formulated with a view to greater coherence between the structural , macroeconomic , trade , financial and development aspects of economic policy so as to increase the effectiveness of these policies , and help secure an open and stable economic policy framework conducive to developing countries integration into world trade , their economic and social development and poverty reduction .  
The Asian financial crisis has accelerated initiatives to improve the timeliness and quality of information concerning key macroeconomic variables as well as the financial reporting of banks and non-financial firms . 8 These are viewed as essential for better decision-taking by private lenders and investors , greater market discipline over policy makers , more effective policy surveillance by multilateral financial institutions , and strengthened financial regulation and supervision . 
Regarding key macroeconomic variables , an initiative had already been taken after the Mexican crisis when IMF established the Special Data Dissemination Standard ( SDDS ) in April 1996 to guide member countries in the public dissemination of economic and financial information in the context of seeking or maintaining access to international financial markets .  
Secondly , debtor Governments and international institutions could agree on a multi-year fiscal scenario that addressed , inter alia , macroeconomic stability consistent with non-inflationary financing ; domestic rates of taxation consistent with rapid growth ; and adequate financing for core public goods , including education , public health and basic infrastructure .  
Economic growth was strongly correlated with poverty alleviation , and thus the most useful approach lay in the creation of a sound macroeconomic foundation for sustainable growth , with open markets , transparent regulatory systems , strong financial oversight and participatory decision-making .  
Conditions which might assist developing countries in addressing poverty issues at the macroeconomic , institutional and policy levels were , respectively , globalization ; the awareness-building role of civil society and the role of the private sector , particularly in creating jobs and spurring rapid economic growth ; and the achievement of a balance between the economic and financial aspects of development and social , cultural and institutional concerns .  
As national governments had the primary responsibility for setting macroeconomic , structural and social policies that would generate growth and contribute to poverty reduction , such comprehensive strategies should be country-driven and elaborated in close cooperation with the international financial institutions . 
Recognizes the importance of adopting appropriate policy responses to the challenges of globalization at the national level , in particular by pursuing sound and stable domestic policies , including sound macroeconomic and social policies , in order to realize the objective of eradicating poverty ;  
Urges Governments and international institutions to create an enabling environment for business and investment , including through sound macroeconomic and fiscal policies , the rule of law , sound judicial procedures , anti-corruption and bribery efforts , and transparent business practices that enhance efficiency , fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions ;  
Besides sound macroeconomic fundamentals , a strong domestic financial and banking system with adequate supervisory and regulatory mechanisms , transparency and good governance were extremely important in order to guard against vulnerability to shifts in market sentiment and to contagion effects from policy weaknesses in other countries . 
Recognizes the importance of international financial stability , and in this context calls on developed countries , in particular major industrialized countries , to ensure that their macroeconomic policies are consistent with the priorities of growth and development , in particular of developing countries ;  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including adequate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
First were matters relating to the macroeconomic management of the world economy : institution of more effective macroeconomic coordination and of improved monitoring and surveillance of international financial flows , arrangements for quicker response to crises , and ending of a system where the private sector was too readily rescued from the risks attendant on its own imprudence .  
Urges all Governments to create an enabling environment for business and investment , including through sound macroeconomic , fiscal and development policies , the rule of law , anti-corruption and anti-bribery efforts , and transparent business practices that promote efficiency , fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions , taking into account the needs of developing countries ;  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including appropriate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Adequate and timely information on the macroeconomic situation in different parts of the world was essential for early warning efforts , and sound macroeconomic policies to strengthen institutional capacity and regulatory frameworks , as well as domestic banking systems , were also essential .  
So , references to wider macroeconomic concerns , i.e . debt relief and calls for increased official development assistance ( ODA ) levels by developed countries should be balanced by acknowledgement of the primary duty of all States to provide the conditions for the realization of the right to development , via good governance and the effective use of existing resources .  
For purposes of creating the single economic space , the participating States shall take coordinated measures to bring the main social and macroeconomic indicators of development gradually closer together , and shall pursue a single structural policy .  
In these trajectories , interdependent phenomena of political change , institutional shift , macroeconomic trends and social tendencies have generally reinforced each other and produced specific configuration of cumulative causation processes .  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources , so as to realize the mutually reinforcing objectives of poverty eradication and development , including through national poverty reduction strategies and enhanced policy coherence ;  
Recognizes the importance of international financial stability , and in this context calls on developed countries , in particular major industrialized countries , to ensure that their macroeconomic policies are consistent with the priorities of growth and development , in particular of developing countries ;  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including adequate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , inter alia , through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including appropriate institutional arrangements in the countries of both origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Urges Governments and international institutions to create an enabling environment for business and investment , including through sound macroeconomic and fiscal policies , the rule of law , sound judicial procedures , anti-corruption and bribery efforts , and transparent business practices that enhance efficiency , fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions ;  
Urges all Governments to create an enabling environment for business and investment , including through sound macroeconomic , fiscal and development policies , the rule of law , anti-corruption and anti-bribery efforts , and transparent business practices that promote efficiency , fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions , taking into account the needs of developing countries ;  
The new guidelines , intended for use by statistical compilers , data users and policy officials , will provide methodological standards for the compilation of statistics on external debt based on the international investment position framework and concept ; practical guidance for the compilation of these statistics ; and selected topics on the use of external debt data in the analysis of macroeconomic sustainability and external vulnerability .  
Internal enabling environment : policy framework incentives for domestic private savings , equitable tax systems ( development and enforcement of ) , macroeconomic policies , disincentives to corruption ; good governance ; transparency ; effective regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector ; banking infrastructure , pension funds ; corporate governance ; internationally accepted accounting standards , and a sound legal system ( land and property rights ) ;  
At the domestic level , there is a particular responsibility to maintain a constant balance between fiscal austerity measures and the need to find the resources required to fund social policies , while not ignoring other issues , especially the lack of fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stability , inadequate social policies and difficulties in broadening the participation of the various sectors of society .  
The latter will direct part of the surplus revenue flowing from our fiscal policies and will balance social investment with macroeconomic stabilization and the amortization of the foreign debt as a budgetary priority .  
In order to identify the adjustments to macroeconomic and sectoral policies that will ensure better integration of the employment objective and growth strategy , the decision-makers and the economic and social partners need thorough research , particularly in the spheres of cost evaluation , jobs and unemployment , fiscal , monetary and budgetary measures , and foreign trade .  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
The resumption of dialogue with the international financial institutions and with private and official bilateral partners could enable these objectives to be met through the sound macroeconomic policies to which the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is committed .  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening institutional capacities and regulatory frameworks , especially the regulatory and supervisory systems of the domestic financial and banking sectors ;  
Stresses the need to endow the International Monetary Fund with adequate resources to provide emergency financing to countries affected by financial crises as a result , among others , of the high volatility of international capital flows , and in this context also stresses the importance of sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the institutional capacities and regulatory frameworks ;  
A number of small island developing States have not yet accorded high priority to institution - and capacity-building ; some of them have had to deal with more pressing problems such as natural disasters and macroeconomic imbalances ; the recent economic crisis has had direct impact on some small island developing States where deteriorations in economic performance have further reduced scope for action for institutional and administrative capacity-building ;  
Also noteworthy was another triangular initiative in support of Cuba ' s economic recovery , under which expertise was transferred from Brazil , Chile and Mexico , with triangular support provided by Norway , in macroeconomic policy formulation , national budgeting , central banking accounting , treasury functions , commercial banking and external debt management .  
Operations approved in 1999 reflect the planned shift in emphasis from emergency reconstruction to ensuring the sustainability of economic institutions and sound macroeconomic management , as well as the medium - to longer-term viability of policies aimed at stimulating private investment , banking reform and privatization .  
A consensus was emerging on the fundamentals of sustainable human development , as illustrated by the fact that the Bretton Woods institutions had adopted an approach to development inspired by the United Nations , while the United Nations had moved far in supporting responsible macroeconomic policies on the part of Member States .  
Her delegation supported the decision to focus the activities of the Organization and , in particular , of UNDP , on the difficult balance between macroeconomic reform and the need for a credible State capable not only of supporting market development , but also of creating legal structures , institutions and regulatory frameworks .  
Recognizes the importance of the adoption of appropriate policy responses to the challenges of globalization at the national level , in particular by pursuing sound and stable domestic policies , including , inter alia , sound macroeconomic and social policies , in order to realize the objective of the eradication of poverty ;  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources , so as to realize the mutually reinforcing objectives of poverty eradication and development , inter alia through national poverty reduction strategies and enhanced policy coherence ;  
First , we have set an ambitious objective of cutting in half the percentage of people living in extreme poverty , stressing the necessary links between social and macroeconomic policies .  
At the national level , UNCTAD could contribute to sound domestic macroeconomic and financial policies , administrative reforms and continuing efforts to promote a stable and transparent national legal and regulatory framework favourable to development .  
At the international level , this could be achieved through coherent international macroeconomic and financial policies and continuing efforts to promote stable international economic growth favourable to development .  
This initiative , launched in 1998 by the World Bank , is based on the principle that an appropriate financial and macroeconomic framework is essential to any action , but that the social , structural and human aspects are essential too .  
To promote the mobilization of domestic financial resources and to establish the basis for an enabling environment through , inter alia , a sound macroeconomic framework , a dynamic private sector , improved governance , and participatory development ;  
In other countries , social and economic progress has been thwarted by narrowly focused economies , underdeveloped national macroeconomic management institutions and a shortage of trained personnel .  
Stability , the rule of law and predictable macroeconomic policies , in conjunction with the necessary structural reforms , are essential for fostering a climate conducive to equitable social and economic growth .  
Polands solid growth , macroeconomic stability , sound monetary policy , established banking system , modernized industry and reformed pension system had attracted foreign investors and helped it to withstand the global economic turbulence of recent years . 
The development of a strong domestic construction services sector should be supported by instruments of industrial policy , human resource development and macroeconomic policies , and by removing unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles internally .  
Economic , social and environmental linkages essential for achieving SHD have been widely acknowledged yet applied methodologies and practical tools to address these linkages are not fully reflected in macroeconomic reform processes and framework setting .  
This requires an environment conducive to private savings , the consolidation of public finances , efficient and effective mechanisms for the allocation of public expenditure , and adequate room for private initiative in short , sound macroeconomic policies .  
The development of a strong domestic construction services sector should be supported by instruments of industrial policy , human resource development and macroeconomic policies , and by removing unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles internally .  
Enabling domestic environments : governance issues ; sound macroeconomic policies , including fiscal and private savings policies ; special needs of Africa , the least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked and transit developing countries and other developing countries as well as countries with economies in transition with special difficulties in attracting financing for development .  
The discussion revolved around providing specific time frames towards meeting the internationally agreed ODA target of 0.7 per cent of GNP to counter the declines in past years ; developing each countrys own comprehensive strategy , including the establishment of sound macroeconomic policies and national partnerships in an effort to use ODA most effectively ; and the growing concerns regarding global public goods .  
Underlying the immediate concern over oil prices were the global macroeconomic imbalances and systemic weaknesses exposed by the Asian crisis , and failure to resolve economic imbalances in an orderly manner would be most damaging to growth in developing countries .  
In his view , the most interesting aspect of the Report was the diagnosis which he summarized in three main points : the poor implementation of some policy prescriptions reflected the impossibility of religiously enforcing conditionality ; social policies in favour of the poor needed to be integrated with macroeconomic policies ; and thirdly , aid effectiveness could be enhanced by improving coordination between the Bretton Woods institutions and bilateral donors .  
He explained that ESAF and PRGF were similar in the sense that they identified and supported sound and appropriate macroeconomic policies , but the fundamental difference was that the new PRGF emphasized consensus-building and participatory approaches driven by a country-owned process with an explicit focus on poverty reduction .  
At the national level these pertained to a regulatory framework , legal security , combating corruption , political and macroeconomic stability , market size ( through regional economic cooperation ) , growth potential and the availability of infrastructure and human resources .  
Elements of such an environment were considered to include sound macroeconomic policies , accountable and transparent governance , a sound domestic legal and regulatory framework , incentives for investment , the involvement of civil society in public decision-making and the strengthening of civil , political , economic and financial institutions .  
Stresses the need for the economic programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven and for their macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated , on an equal footing and a consistent way , with the realization of the broader social development goals , taking into account the specific characteristics , conditions and needs of the debtor countries ;  
At the tenth session of UNCTAD , held in Bangkok in February 2000 , Governments recognized that ensuring that all countries enjoy the benefits of globalization requires meeting complex policy challenges which arise , particularly at the macroeconomic level , from the growing interdependence of the various spheres of economic activity , including particularly trade , finance and investment , and the downside risks that this interdependence sometimes carries . 
Another pillar of an enabling domestic environment is a sound macroeconomic framework , including , for example , sound budget priorities for health , education and agriculture / food security , and transparent and accountable public expenditure management and an efficient tax system .  
All countries must realize that the mobilization of domestic resources for development calls for a supportive environment in which sound macroeconomic policies are applied ( stabilization of public finance , control of inflation , use of effective and efficient mechanisms for the distribution of public expenditure ) and favourable conditions in which the private sector can grow .  
Stresses the need for the economic programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven and for their macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated , on an equal footing and a consistent way , with the realization of the broader social development goals , taking into account the specific characteristics , conditions and needs of the debtor countries ;  
National efforts to mobilize domestic financial resources should consolidate enabling domestic environments geared to promote growth with equity , through good governance , effective domestic institutions , the rule of law and sound macroeconomic , structural and social development policies that are gender - and environment-sensitive .  
What kind of awareness-raising and specific policy coordination effort could major industrialized countries undertake to fulfil their special responsibility in ensuring that their macroeconomic policies , including exchange rate policies , take into account their effects in creating an international economic environment favourable to equitable growth and development , international financial stability and enhanced financial flows for development ? 
At the same time , the efforts of the system to promote more integrated approaches to development for example , a more effective integration of environmental and social dimensions in macroeconomic policies should contribute over time to better balanced decision-making processes also at the national level .  
Economic sustainability requires action on four fronts : ( i ) macroeconomic policy measures ; ( ii ) efficient resource allocation at the sectoral level to effect economic transformation , ( iii ) more equitable access to resources , and ( iv ) enhancing the opportunities of the poor .  
Economic sustainability requires action on four fronts : ( a ) macroeconomic policy measures and structural adjustment ; ( b ) efficient resource allocation at the sectoral level ; ( c ) more equitable access to resources , including improving income distribution and striving for gender equity ; and ( d ) increasing the productivity of the poor , partly through investments in basic health and education .  
Equally , it requires the definition of a clear and consistent set of public objectives , sound macroeconomic policies , efficient management of public revenue and expenditure , better allocation of resources and incentives to prevent capital flight and to encourage private savings and tax reforms , and a solid framework to implement stabilization or economic reform programmes .  
We also recognize that , despite the positive effects that an enabling environment with good governance , sound macroeconomic policies and efficient management of public revenue and expenditure , can achieve in terms of mobilization of local resources , external finance , in particular ODA , will remain , for African countries , a critical resource for achieving the international development goals . 
Without macroeconomic stability , sustained structural reforms , effective and transparent use of public resources , improvements in the provision of public services and infrastructure to the poor , and actions to reduce vulnerability and give the poor more voice in development choices , the pattern of sustained , inclusive growth that underlies the best scenario will not be realized and millions more people will remain enslaved in poverty .  
In addition , it is important to create an enabling policy environment for improving the situation of rural women , which would include the design and implementation of a gender-sensitive macroeconomic policy framework and social support systems which would accommodate womens productive and reproductive roles and encourage a more equal gender division of labour in the household . 
However , the actual benefits may be quite limited as the delivery of the main components of debt relief packages , including debt stock reduction from the Paris Club , remains conditional on the finalization and successful implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers ( PRSPs ) , which set out the countrys macroeconomic and structural reform policies , as well as concrete poverty-reduction goals .  
Poor management of finances and public corporations has not been conducive to the creation of a favourable macroeconomic and institutional environment for stimulating the economic and social activities of households and enterprises .  
The actions to be undertaken by least developed countries focus , inter alia , on : strengthening efforts to integrate trade policies into national development policies towards poverty eradication , improving economic openness and policy predictability , as well as sound macroeconomic policy , and developing human and institutional capacities for effective and informed participation in the multilateral trading system and for effective negotiations on trade , finance , technology transfer and related areas .  
The promotion of a conducive macroeconomic environment , good governance and democracy , as well as strengthening structural aspects of the economy and improved institutional and human capacities , was regarded as important also in the context of attracting FDI and other private external flows .  
Effective development strategies and economic and social sustainability depended on enhanced national capacity to operate within a comprehensive framework that reflected the interdependence of macroeconomic and financial issues with structural , social and human concerns , including environment and health . 
Human rights must be respected and an adequate legal framework developed ; there was a need to apply sound macroeconomic policies , combat corruption and strengthen human and institutional capacities , both nationally and on the basis of international cooperation .  
Recognizes the importance of the adoption of appropriate policy responses to the challenges of globalization at the national level , in particular by pursuing sound and stable domestic policies , including sound macroeconomic and social policies , inter alia , those contributing to increased income of the poor , in order to realize the objective of the eradication of poverty ;  
Recognizes the importance of the adoption of appropriate policy responses to the challenges of globalization at the national level , in particular by pursuing sound and stable domestic policies , including sound macroeconomic and social policies , inter alia , those contributing to increased income of the poor , in order to realize the objective of the eradication of poverty ;  
The necessary elements of a policy mix would address optimal instruments of industrial policy , human resource development and macroeconomic policies , including fiscal policies which avoid onerous internal taxation of construction firms and high tariffs on essential equipment .  
To provide an enabling business environment characterized by stable macroeconomic policies ; a sound legal , regulatory and tax framework ; adequate physical infrastructure , including for transport and telecommunications ; and an available pool of a skilled labour , particularly engineering skills ;  
Creation of a database of regional level indicators that would make it possible to evaluate and diagnose the current state of the environment in the region ; gauge the environmental consequences of existing macroeconomic policies ; measure the economic , social and environmental costs of maintaining current development patterns ; and supply orientation for policy decisions , especially in regard to public and private investment .
