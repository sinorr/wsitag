The European Union has taken a leading role in the strengthening of regulatory regimes , including in the establishment of the nuclear safety account , administered by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , the G 24 coordinating mechanism , the European Union 's Poland-Hungary Aid for the Reconstruction of the Economy ( PHARE ) and Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States ( TACIS ) programmes , the European Atomic Energy Community loan facility , coordinated support from the international financial institutions for the energy sector , and bilateral cooperation projects .  
The globalization of economic , social and political problems , the lack of coordinated management of interdependent issues , the increase in global challenges , and the weakening of national regulatory structures make it ever more necessary to establish new structures for global management within a framework of true democratization of international relations .  
Adopt an enabling legal and regulatory framework based on an enhanced knowledge , understanding and acceptance of existing practices and land delivery mechanisms so as to stimulate partnerships with the private business and community sectors , specifying recognized types of land tenure and prescribing procedures for the regularization of tenure , where needed ;  
A strong expansion of agricultural production , internal stability , strong government commitments , a sound political and regulatory framework for development , complemented by significant external support , among other factors , have contributed to raising economic growth rates .  
In the same resolution , the Council requested the Secretary-General to submit to Member States for their consideration at the fifth session of the Commission a proposal on the creation of a central repository for existing legislative and regulatory measures and information on organizational structures designed to combat organized transnational crime .  
Some of these specific issues being addressed include organizational structures ; systems and processes of government for decision-making , budgeting and financial management , personnel management and appropriate incentive systems ; adequate legal and regulatory frameworks ; managerial and technical skills ; and organizational capacity to learn from and adapt to the changing environment . 
While Governments , in the new context of the growing importance of the market and the private sector , have a diminished productive role in economic development , it is important to note that all Governments will retain responsibility for providing a regulatory framework for the effective operation of a competitive market system . 
The United Nations will assist Governments in creating and strengthening national capacities in fiscal policy analysis and economic management and in designing strategies aimed at creating and improving a proper environment and regulatory framework for capital flows for productive investments , promoting private sector development and increasing transparency and accountability . 
A decentralized system of information dissemination with outlets at national and regional level is therefore essential when dealing with inquiries about local environmental and regulatory conditions .  
In view of the strong international competition in automobile markets , and the relationship of national manufacturers to their government , effective action needs to be taken at the international level to develop more effective and stringent regulatory frameworks , such as internationally agreed standards for air quality , motor vehicle emissions and fuel economy , at least among OECD countries .  
In certain of the more advanced developing countries , the early introduction of radical reforms into mineral development policies and the associated fiscal and regulatory environments aimed at attracting private funds into the mining sector and at securing foreign expertise to improve the management and efficiency of State-owned , controlled and operated companies , are slowly starting to show benefits with respect to impact on the socio-economic area .  
Host Governments are expected to provide stable and transparent regulatory and fiscal environments including supportive administrative frameworks while at the same time providing acceptable socio-economic environments .  
In the same resolution , the Secretary-General was requested to seek cooperation and to join efforts with other international , global and regional organizations and mechanisms that have played an active role in combating money-laundering in order to reinforce common regulatory and enforcement strategies in that area .  
The United States strongly supported the efforts of the United Nations and other global and regional initiatives designed to promote the harmonization of the world 's financial , regulatory and legal regimes , thereby achieving more effective control of the laundering of the proceeds of serious crime .  
In the same resolution , the Council requested the Secretary-General to submit to Member States for their consideration at the fifth session of the Commission a proposal on the creation of a central repository for existing legislative and regulatory measures and information on organizational structures designed to combat organized transnational crime , taking into account the capabilities of the United Nations Crime and Justice Information Network .  
Such a programme might include comparative studies of the situation of organized transnational crime around the world and the establishment and maintenance of a central repository for information on legislation , regulatory measures , organizational structures designed to prevent and control organized transnational crime , and bilateral and multilateral cooperation arrangements .  
In view of the strong international competition in automobile markets and the relationship of national manufacturers to their Governments , effective action needs to be taken at the international level to develop more effective and stringent regulatory frameworks , such as internationally agreed standards for air quality , motor vehicle emissions and fuel economy , at least among OECD countries .  
In recent years , faced with a continuing decline in the quality of the environment , many Governments have adopted stronger environmental policies , enacted fresh legislation and regulations , and reorganized and expanded administrative agencies .  Special governmental departments for the environment , which have regulatory and promotional roles , have been set up in developing countries ( for example , India ) .  
Environmental conditions deteriorated further in many areas in the ESCWA region in 1995 .  The causes of environmental degradation included rapid population growth , inappropriate economic and social policies , weak regulatory and administrative systems , and insufficient public awareness .  
In developing demand management policy , a water agency must choose among combinations of numerous legislative , regulatory , technological and behavioral measures , each with a unique set of advantages and disadvantages .  
But the most important prerequisites for the successful mobilization of foreign and domestic resources are confidence in the financial system and appropriate macroeconomic policies , a well-established and clear legal and regulatory framework , a transparent and non-distortionary taxation system , a stable domestic financial system , and adequate infrastructure .  
In developing further the orientation and objectives of national strategies , the Commission may wish to focus on the identification of characteristics of poverty which could be common to most countries , regardless of their definition of poverty and which could be used to measure progress ; the identification of elements for elaborating national strategies comprising macroeconomic , structural , distributional and regulatory policies , together with specific short - and long-term objectives ; and the further identification of specific international actions .  
The major features of the strategy are to support private sector farming activities through improved legal , regulatory and institutional frameworks , to enhance the efficiency of traditional and domestic market-oriented agriculture , to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of intensive and export-oriented agriculture and to improve access to regional and international markets .  
It would also be acceptable if paragraph 2 , instead of remaining vague about the functions of the joint management mechanism , were to list them in detail ( data collection , project design and implementation , approval of activities planned by individual States , exercise of regulatory power , peaceful settlement of disputes and exploration of potential sources of financing , to name but a few ) .  
A careful balance must be maintained between , on the one hand , establishing priorities to make the best use of resources and avoid waste , and on the other hand the principle of adequate provision for alternatives as insurance against even the remote possibility of future political , monopoly , regulatory or efficiency difficulties on any of the main transit transport routes available to landlocked countries .  
The greatest pay-off in terms of increases in efficiency and lowered real costs of transport is likely to come about from a full-scale effort to improve a whole range of institutional , procedural , regulatory , managerial and other non-physical aspects of vital importance to the actual movement of goods to and from markets in the region or abroad .  
The following thematic areas were considered at the meeting : ( a ) policy development capacity and administrative restructuring , civil service reform and management training ; ( b ) financial management ; ( c ) human resources development ; ( d ) public-private interaction ; ( e ) public sector efficiency ; ( f ) social development ; ( g ) infrastructure and the environment ; ( h ) legal and regulatory framework ; ( i ) post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction of government machinery ; and ( j ) management of development programmes .  
Urges Member States carefully to consider the problems posed by the international aspects of corrupt practices , especially as regards international economic activities carried out by corporate entities , and to study appropriate legislative and regulatory measures to ensure the transparency and integrity of financial systems and transactions carried out by such corporate entities ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , to provide increased advisory services and technical assistance to requesting Member States , particularly in the elaboration of national strategies , the elaboration or improvement of legislative and regulatory measures , the establishment or strengthening of national capacities to prevent and control corruption , as well as in training and upgrading skills of relevant personnel ;  
The Council , in its resolution 1995 / 11 of 24 July 1995 , requested the Secretary-General to seek cooperation and to join efforts with other international , global and regional organizations and mechanisms that have played an active role in combating money laundering in order to reinforce common regulatory and enforcement strategies in that area .  
The specialized agencies also played an active role in the countries in transition : by supporting national efforts to improve management systems in public organizations ; by giving advice on the legislative and regulatory framework necessary for establishing a market economy ; by encouraging decentralization through support to local communities ; by consolidating the democratization process ; by supporting human resource programmes , social programmes and the creation of small and medium-size businesses ; by fostering integration between neighbouring countries , and by generating capital flows .  
The Fisheries Commission of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization ( NAFO ) , at its seventeenth annual meeting ( 11-15 September 1995 ) , adopted recommendations concerning control and enforcement measures as well as conservation of fish stocks . 147 It agreed on amendments which would introduce the following : objectivity in the distribution of inspections ; transmission of information from inspections to provide advance notification of apparent infringements ; reporting of catch on board fishing vessels entering and exiting the regulatory area ; establishment of minimum mesh size for capelin fishery ; 
Establishing a central repository for three categories of information and documentation , namely , ( i ) national legislation , including regulatory measures ; ( ii ) organizational structures ; and ( iii ) international cooperation arrangements , including bilateral and multilateral treaties , and implementing legislation , with a view to making the collected data available to Member States upon request . 
The Government has the power to establish the right macroeconomic environment , as well as a transparent , stable and predictable legal , regulatory and tax framework , and thus create favourable conditions for entrepreneurial and enterprise development .  By acting as a catalytic or intermediating agent , including through appropriate policies and a supportive business infrastructure , it can stimulate , facilitate or support the development of enterprises , particularly SMEs , and of inter-firm cooperation , both internally and with foreign firms .  
Urges Member States carefully to consider the problems posed by the international aspects of corrupt practices , especially as regards international economic activities carried out by corporate entities , and to study appropriate legislative and regulatory measures to ensure the transparency and integrity of financial systems and transactions carried out by such corporate entities ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , to provide increased advisory services and technical assistance to requesting Member States , in particular in the elaboration of national strategies , the elaboration or improvement of legislative and regulatory measures , the establishment or strengthening of national capacities to prevent and control corruption , as well as in training and upgrading skills of relevant personnel ;  
Special attention will be paid to measures designed to improve the whole range of institutional , procedural , regulatory managerial and other non-physical aspects of vital importance to the actual movement of goods .  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions , and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
As regards the prices charged by the project company , two basic approaches have been observed : in some cases the project company is free to determine its pricing and commercial policy , while in other cases the law subjects the initial price charged by the project company to some control mechanism ( e.g . approval by the competent regulatory body , or requirement that the prices be provided in the project agreement ) .  
The participation of international financial institutions or export credit agencies may facilitate the project sponsors task of raising funds in the international financial market by providing commercial banks with protection against a variety of political risks , including , inter alia , the failure of the host Government to make agreed payments , to make available sufficient foreign exchange or to grant necessary regulatory approvals . 
The provision of finance for shelter and urban development has been constrained by the absence of an attractive investment climate , a negative regulatory environment , a narrow housing finance base and low levels of savings due to low disposal incomes .  
The functions assigned by the Decree to the Commission relate to the implementation and enforcement of international humanitarian law on the basis of proposals submitted to the national authorities on legislative and regulatory provisions and measures to guarantee the implementation of the basic international instruments in this regard .  NULLAs to the wording of the resolution under consideration , it is important to draw attention to its authors ' awareness of the exclusion from the scope of Protocol II of situations of internal disturbances and tensions , as not being armed conflicts .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods , the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework . 
That exclusion was largely acceptable because insolvencies of financial services institutions usually required prompt and discrete action ( for instance to avoid massive withdrawals of deposits ) and were , for that reason , administered under special regulatory regimes in various States .  
In the past five years , in line with this policy , Colombia has set up a regulatory and institutional framework , ranging from the establishment of the Ministry for the Environment to the creation of an environmental network enabling the authorities and the community to take part in the national and local decision-making process relating to the environment .  
Armenia hopes that this special session will take decisions to further integrate environmental and social concerns into the day-to-day regulatory tools of the international economy , and thus ensure that quality of life issues are addressed in a way more likely to lead to their successful resolution .  
What is lacking is the development of the social and institutional structures that are needed to keep pace with the policy , regulatory and service demands arising from rapid population growth , increased complexity and the changes in technology ; and underlying this gap is the issue of good governance and its impact on building capacities and developing performance standards for sustainable development . 
The World Bank has estimated that electric power delivered to end-users equals only about 40 per cent of installed capacity in developing countries , compared to over 80 per cent of installed capacity in developed countries . 19 Establishing the principle of full ( or nearly full ) cost-recovery would permit much greater recourse to foreign financing as bond financing for either public or private national enterprises operating on fully commercial principles within an adequate regulatory environment . 
According to ICC , the private sector 's priorities for the next phase include increasing use of multilateral arrangements to resolve transboundary environmental issues ( instead of unilateral approaches ) ; incentive-based approaches , such as joint implementation ; greater involvement of business and industry in multilateral agreements and organizations through innovative consultative mechanisms ; and a more prominent role for international environmental technical and management standards and voluntary codes , as complements to regulatory frameworks .  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice , at its fifth session , proposed the establishment of a central repository for information on legislation , regulatory measures , organizational structures designed to prevent and control organized transnational crime and bilateral and multilateral cooperation agreements .  
The structure of a work programme on organized transnational crime should consist of three main elements : reliable knowledge for informed decision-making ; provision of assistance in the legislative and regulatory fields ; and advisory services and training . 
Activities include encouraging countries to create a conducive legal and regulatory climate for sustainable energy development ; supporting and financing innovative demonstration projects that promote key technologies ; and supporting the formulation and implementation of national energy action programmes .  
It was said that it would be very important to direct such an effort towards the development of international norms and standards for commercial conduct in the field , with the intent of supporting trade through electronic media , and not have as a goal the establishment of a regulatory regime for service providers , or other rules which could create costs unacceptable for market applications of electronic data interchange ( EDI ) ( ibid . , para .  117 ) .  
One way to introduce more rational pricing would be to eliminate politically motivated price controls , shifting the responsibility for determining and monitoring price guidelines to independent regulatory authorities , with consumer representation and acting within the framework of transparent rules .  
He also noted that the Secretariat , as requested by the Subcommittee at its previous session in 1996 , had submitted a working paper entitled An analysis of the compatibility of the approach contained in the working paper entitled Some considerations concerning the utilization of the geostationary satellite orbit with the existing regulatory procedures of the International Telecommunication Union relating to the use of the geostationary orbit ( A / AC . 105 / C . 2 / L . 205 ) .  
The vulnerability of the Palestinian economy to the interaction of such factors has been compounded by a range of inherent weaknesses coupled with the absence of an adequate regulatory and institutional framework at the public and private sector levels .  
A prominent example is the sensitive investment climate , which had begun to stabilize in 1995 following the adoption of a Law for the Promotion of Investment , the consolidation of the local banking system and related regulatory and institutional developments .  [ 1 ] / Events on the ground since 1996 have prompted caution on the part of investors and financial institutions , that remain in need of sustained political , legal and institutional stability .  
The study deals with : a review of major recent developments affecting private investment , including the regulatory framework , policy environment , trade and financial regimes and their recent performance ; an examination of the main supportive capacities and services important for private investment ; analysis of the scale , composition and impact of private investment in the economy ; and , prospects and policy options relevant to the future direction and magnitude of private investment in the Palestinian territory .  
A further challenge to effective enforcement and regulatory procedures to counter money-laundering is posed by the growth of payment facilities , based on high technology , that enable global financial transactions to be made by coded electronic means .  
Successful enterprise development is affected by a conducive economic environment in terms of the macroeconomic , regulatory and legal frameworks , the structural characteristics of the national economy , the degree of market development , the institutional framework , the infrastructural and human resource base and the quality and coherence of government policies .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods and the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework . 
Among the cross-cutting development constraints hampering the private sector were an ineffective or shallow financial sector ; lack of a legal and regulatory system ; weak infrastructure ; obsolete technology , poor on - and off-farm storage facilities , high taxation , and generally inadequate support services ; an inadequate policy framework ; an inefficient and overly dominant public enterprise sector ; misdirected development assistance ; high transaction costs ; and lack of trust in the interaction between the Government and the private sector .  
Also recognizes the importance of ensuring transparency and accountability at the national level to achieve policy credibility and confidence-building as well as sound regulatory and supervisory arrangements so as to strengthen the domestic financial system , and further recognizes the importance of a stable international economic environment and stability in the international monetary system ;  
This entails conducive macro and sectoral policies , as well as a transparent and simple regulatory framework ; provision of necessary infrastructure ; improved access to credit , technology and markets ; extension services geared towards improving product design and quality of goods produced ; and support services for improved linkages with other sectors of the economy .  
The provision of finance for shelter and urban development has been constrained by the absence of an attractive investment climate , a negative regulatory environment , a narrow housing finance base and low levels of savings owing to low disposal incomes .  
This encouraging trend has been achieved through the adoption and pursuit by Governments of policies and measures aimed at ensuring , among others , macroeconomic stability , inflows of foreign direct investment , open and free markets and stable and transparent legal and regulatory frameworks .  
For the East Asian region , which has been subjected to extreme volatility of currency and stock markets , the urgent need for critical regulatory safeguards in respect of international financial markets is unambiguous .  
Reducing budget deficits to manageable levels remains the major preoccupation of Governments , yet an inadequate legal basis , an unstable and exceedingly discretionary regulatory environment , high taxes and complicated tax systems and , in many cases , political uncertainties continue to force economic activity into the rapidly growing unregistered - and hence untaxed - shadow economy .  
IAEA has developed a computer-based record-keeping system to assist in achieving effective control of sealed radiation sources , the Sealed Radiation Sources ( SRS ) registry , designed for use by national regulatory bodies and regional centres for tracking sources from the cradle to the grave . 
Urges Member States carefully to consider the problems posed by the international aspects of corrupt practices , especially as regards international economic activities carried out by corporate entities , and to study appropriate legislative and regulatory measures to ensure the transparency and integrity of financial systems and transactions carried out by such corporate entities ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , to provide increased advisory services and technical assistance to Member States , at their request , in particular in the elaboration of national strategies , the elaboration or improvement of legislative and regulatory measures , the establishment or strengthening of national capacities to prevent and control corruption , as well as in training and upgrading skills of relevant personnel ;  
Further , the main focus of three OSCE seminars undertaken in the last two years was on global and regional partnership in the fields of environment management , environmental regulatory mechanisms and the transfer of environmentally safe technologies , international cooperation in protecting the environment , and promoting the economic and legal framework for environmentally sustainable development .  
This role was manifested at two levels : at the macro level in terms of creating an enabling environment , good macroeconomic policies , a sound legal , regulatory and tax framework and political stability ; and at the micro level inter alia through providing appropriate support measures and structures and investing in capacity _ building , including in the areas of education , training and health .  It could create an environment in which the private sector knew what was happening .  
The fact that a power company of Taiwan Province of China could attempt to export radioactive waste to a country where appropriate facilities are lacking , without being subject to any existing international regulatory mechanism , clearly testifies to the need to strengthen the current international regime controlling the transboundary movement of radioactive waste .  
Therefore , programmes composed of interrelated and carefully coordinated measures , including administrative , civil , procedural and criminal legislation , as well as various regulatory provisions and administrative action designed to prevent and control corruption , are of high priority .  
The underdevelopment of the financial sector is a particularly important example of this general problem : in the absence of an effective institutional and regulatory framework for banking and other financial activities , credit risks will not be undertaken on the basis of a commercial evaluation of risks and returns , and this lack of financial discipline leads to the financial sector being an obstacle rather than a support to sustained economic growth and the creation of a modern capitalist economy .  
While the private sector is the " engine of development " , the Government has to lay and maintain the " tracks " that is , create and maintain the legal and regulatory environment for private ownership and fair competition , correct appropriately for market failures , protect the disadvantaged and maintain economic stability , law and order .  
In fact , it is extremely difficult to establish a regulatory regime which is both expert and independent of capture by well-endowed enterprises ( who may be supported by strong ministers ) , nor perverted by short-term political interests .  
The current issues are concerned with choices between a cost-plus regime ( typified by many United States utilities ) or a price cap ( typified by the RPI-X formula started in the United Kingdom ) ; between a single regulator , a regulatory board , or sectoral regulatory agencies ; whether to break up a national monopoly into regional monopolies ; the rate at which competitors should be licensed , bearing in mind the need for the incumbent enterprise to finance major expansion as far as possible from internally generated surpluses ; etc .  
The key characteristics of an enabling environment are well understood and generally accepted : stability , predictability , adaptability , growth orientation , transparent legal and regulatory frameworks , and a strong base of social and physical infrastructures .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods , the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework . 
In this regard , the Netherlands stated that institutional and human capacity , a reliable regulatory and a supportive legal system , as well as stable and sound macroeconomic policies , were among the central building blocks to attract domestic and international capital to finance development .  
Practical solutions were offered in the areas of employment-intensive investment policies , harnessing the productive capacity of the urban informal sector , creating an enabling regulatory environment for enterprise development and forging new public and private-sector alliances for employment creation at the local level .  
In order to attract FDI , countries were invited to continue initiatives in such areas as a stable macroeconomic environment , transparent and accountable public administration , respect for property rights and the rule of law , the quality of labour , improvement of infrastructure , entrepreneurial and institutional capabilities and simplified administrative and regulatory frameworks .  
For that purpose , we intend to develop programmes composed of interrelated and carefully coordinated measures , including administrative , civil , procedural and criminal legislation , as well as various regulatory provisions and administrative action designed to prevent and control corruption and bribery , as a matter of high priority .  
Major impediments on the supply side are production and export structures that concentrate on only a few products , poor endowment with financial and human capital , weak technological capacity , inadequate legal and regulatory frameworks , and bottlenecks in physical infrastructure . 
To achieve successful sales of public enterprises to the private sector , it is necessary to have a strong legislative framework , a high degree of capital market development and , in many cases , sufficient persons with the capacity and integrity to develop an effective regulatory system .  
When the provision of such vital services as telecommunications , electricity supply , railways , freight transport , fuel distribution and so forth are acquired by private owners , whether through the acquisition of a State monopoly by a single large private corporation or through a widely distributed share ownership , it is appropriate that the Government set up an independent and effective regulatory body to look after consumer interests and wider national and environmental concerns .  
He believed that the key elements of an enabling environment for development were a growth-oriented economy with a transparent legal and regulatory framework , and strong social and physical infrastructure .  
For some of its most active participants , this is an asset , since it will allow rapid development of international electronic trade flows with a minimum of legal , regulatory and fiscal obstacles .  
It also emphasized the need to introduce a wide range of policy , legal , regulatory and institutional reforms which provide the private sector with a more favourable and competitive business environment .  
At the domestic level , we must promote higher standards of national government by strengthening our regulatory and supervisory frameworks , improving corporate governance , increasing transparency and lessening government interference in market decisions .  
They should pursue sound macroeconomic policies , strive to increase domestic savings and investment , strengthen institutional , legal , regulatory and supervisory capacities and improve economic management in the public and private sectors .  
An integrated approach to the efficient and equitable development and allocation of water resources requires the use of economic and regulatory instruments designed to maximize social net benefits .  
Its principal elements included political and economic stability , the rule of law , a strong institutional and regulatory framework providing intellectual property protection and protection against unfair expropriation , and dispute-resolution mechanisms .  
Liberalization needed to be combined with sound and coherent domestic economic policies , the creation of effective judicial systems , the promotion of the rule of law and respect for the regulatory responsibility of Governments .  
Reinforcing international dialogue in the appropriate multilateral and bilateral forums to achieve an adequate global regulatory framework for electronic commerce , in particular in data security , data protection , intellectual property rights , and taxation .  
However , to mobilize private investors , a legislative and regulatory framework will have to be established that is stable , predictable and transparent , making it possible for rational economic decisions to be taken .  
Since the market and other informational failures that lay behind their taking on such excessive aggregate market exposures in East Asia were massive , the required regulatory changes would have to be far-reaching and the early warning systems elaborate .  
Since then , the international community had started to devote more attention to the main policy , regulatory , legal , economic and technical issues underlying electronic commerce .  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
The secretariat noted that electronic commerce had become a major component of international trade ; the technology was well established and the remaining barriers to its use lay in institutional issues , in particular those of a regulatory and cultural nature .  
At the regional and local levels , IFAD is helping to build a cadre of microfinance technical experts , strengthen training centres and promote sustained linkages to commercial capital , while seeking to ensure a favourable regulatory environment .  
Full-scale effort to reform regulatory , procedural and managerial systems at a regional or subregional level requires effective institutional support arrangements and trained manpower at both the government and private sector levels .  
It also emphasized the need to introduce a wide range of policy , legal , regulatory and institutional reforms which would provide the private sector with a more favourable and competitive business environment .  
The view was expressed that the draft articles seemed to be premised upon a highly centralized State with comprehensive regulatory powers ; it would be difficult or even impossible to implement those principles effectively in federal States , where regulatory authority was shared .  
A significant portion of the forest area is unavailable for wood supply because it is in legally protected areas ( national parks , reserves etc . ) , it is not economically viable to harvest ( too far from markets , transport links , infrastructure etc . ) or otherwise constrained ( due to physical inaccessibility , such as steep slopes or swamps , or regulatory constraints , such as general logging or harvesting bans ) .  
The 1952 Convention establishes a formal regulatory system which can permit the arrest of a ship to secure the satisfaction of any judgment that may eventually be pronounced because the holder of a maritime lien can not , sometimes in a matter of hours , fulfil the standard procedural requirements ( likelihood of the claim alleged , valid title , precise value of the claim and risks of delay ) under formal national or domestic regulations for his application to proceed ;  
Therefore , while contractual arrangements may be agreed to by the parties to counter the adverse effects of subsequent regulatory changes ( see paras . 60-63 ) , regulatory bodies would be well advised to avoid excessive regulation or unreasonably frequent changes in existing rules .  
In that context , they outlined their respective measures to formulate national development strategies , action plans and policies , and to strengthen regulatory frameworks ; establish or strengthen national institutions to coordinate implementation of the Programme of Action at the national level ; and establish or strengthen regional institutions for effective regional coordination .  
The recent financial turmoil had shown that countries must maintain constant vigilance over all economic , financial and institutional parameters in order to guard against the volatility of other markets and contagion effects , and that each country needed not only sound macroeconomic fundamentals , but also a strong financial and banking system with adequate supervisory and regulatory mechanisms , transparency and good governance .  
New initiatives to meet the challenge of the informal sector could focus on increasing productivity through access to credit , basic infrastructure and social services , on a regulatory environment which is conducive to improving the quality of work without stifling the informal sectors employment creating capacity and on organizing informal sector employers and workers to defend their own interests .  
Indeed , in the future , investors will look more carefully at macro - and microeconomic policies [ 24 ] , most particularly at : high economic growth rate , the degree of exchange rate stability , level of foreign exchange reserves , general macroeconomic stability , health of domestic banking system , quality of stock market regulatory framework , quality of domestic accounting / disclosure standards and degree of investors rights protection .  
At the national level , this entails improving regulatory mechanisms and legislative frameworks , medium - and long-term integrated planning and strategy development , the use of economic instruments for sustainable consumption and production patterns and general awareness-raising and educational activities relating to sustainable development .  
Without prejudice to articles ( 14 and 19 ) of this Convention , ensure that administrative , regulatory , law enforcement and other authorities dedicated to combating money-laundering ( including , where appropriate under domestic law , judicial authorities ) have the ability to cooperate and exchange information at the national and international levels [ within the conditions prescribed by its domestic legislation1 ] .  
The existing voluntary initiatives were identified as being complementary to national and local regulatory compliance efforts , as these initiatives are designed to be cost-effective means of surpassing existing regulatory requirements .  
Without prejudice to articles [ 14 and 19 ] of this Convention , ensure that administrative , regulatory , law enforcement and other authorities dedicated to combating money-laundering ( including , where appropriate under domestic law , judicial authorities ) have the ability to cooperate and exchange information at the national and international levels [ within the conditions prescribed by its domestic legislation20 ] .  
In order for space exploration and development to benefit all United Nations Member States more effectively , greater international cooperation will be needed , not only on specific projects such as environmental monitoring and protection , but also in ensuring that international regulatory structures encourage commercial space activities in ways that are predictable , transparent and effective .  
The main orientations of such a policy would include improving market transparency ; enhancing information flows to local operators , and in particular the capacity of these operators to analyse this information ; providing a sound , stable policy environment and legal and regulatory framework ; stimulating the emergence of support services ; and enabling access to modern marketing , risk management and financing instruments .  
Without prejudice to articles [ 14 and 19 ] of this Convention , ensure that administrative , regulatory , law enforcement and other authorities dedicated to combating money-laundering ( including , where appropriate under domestic law , judicial authorities ) have the ability to cooperate and exchange information at the national and international levels [ within the conditions prescribed by its domestic legislation60 ] .  
Internal enabling environment : policy framework incentives for domestic private savings , equitable tax systems ( development and enforcement of ) , macroeconomic policies , disincentives to corruption ; good governance ; transparency ; effective regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector ; banking infrastructure , pension funds ; corporate governance ; internationally accepted accounting standards , and a sound legal system ( land and property rights ) ;  
In some cases , the small size of their public sectors makes it difficult to provide adequate regulation , particularly if the offshore sector has grown more rapidly than regulatory capacity .  
These included policy , legal and regulatory frameworks for sustained development of mineral resources best practices ; transnational corporations contribution in the mining and energy sectors ; new resources of capital for the development of Africas mineral resources : tapping capital markets ; and alternative approaches to financing energy and power development : case studies from African and other developing regions .  
In the statement , the Ministers agreed that one of the key lessons for Africa of the current crisis is the need to strengthen supervisory and regulatory mechanisms to ensure transparency in financial transaction and improve corporate governance , in consonance with the principles of financial liberalization and the development of financial and capital markets .  
The lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with conditions of inadequate infrastructure , imbalance of trade , inefficient transport organization , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems , poses serious constraints on the trade and economic development of landlocked developing countries .  
Measures to deal with the transit problems of such countries have to address a broad range of factors , such as inadequate infrastructure , imbalance of trade , inefficient transport organization , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
As regards protecting families and vulnerable social sectors , we could mention the development , now under way , of a national family code , the strengthening and continuation of a programme of education in responsible parenting and the establishment of regulatory and legislative measures to protect the elderly , the disabled , and marginal populations .

The core objectives of the programme were , inter alia , to create and adjust the country 's macroeconomic policy , ensure a correct legal and regulatory framework for the development of a strong market economy , provide a transparent and accountable policy framework aimed at promoting investment , allocate adequate budgetary resources for social programmes , create the necessary conditions for the establishment and consolidation of democratic institutions and support good governance and political stability .  
Working with partners in 18 countries , USAID is undertaking a learning process designed to explore and document new ways to build capacity and linkages among groups at the local level ; to forge solid society-to-society linkages between these local groups and their United States counterparts ; and to foster a legal , regulatory and fiscal environment conducive to citizen participation and community initiative .  
The European Union has taken a leading role in the strengthening of regulatory regimes , including in the establishment of the nuclear safety account , administered by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , the G 24 coordinating mechanism , the European Union 's Poland-Hungary Aid for the Reconstruction of the Economy ( PHARE ) and Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States ( TACIS ) programmes , the European Atomic Energy Community loan facility , coordinated support from the international financial institutions for the energy sector , and bilateral cooperation projects .  
The globalization of economic , social and political problems , the lack of coordinated management of interdependent issues , the increase in global challenges , and the weakening of national regulatory structures make it ever more necessary to establish new structures for global management within a framework of true democratization of international relations .  
Adopt an enabling legal and regulatory framework based on an enhanced knowledge , understanding and acceptance of existing practices and land delivery mechanisms so as to stimulate partnerships with the private business and community sectors , specifying recognized types of land tenure and prescribing procedures for the regularization of tenure , where needed ;  
A strong expansion of agricultural production , internal stability , strong government commitments , a sound political and regulatory framework for development , complemented by significant external support , among other factors , have contributed to raising economic growth rates .  
In the same resolution , the Council requested the Secretary-General to submit to Member States for their consideration at the fifth session of the Commission a proposal on the creation of a central repository for existing legislative and regulatory measures and information on organizational structures designed to combat organized transnational crime .  
Some of these specific issues being addressed include organizational structures ; systems and processes of government for decision-making , budgeting and financial management , personnel management and appropriate incentive systems ; adequate legal and regulatory frameworks ; managerial and technical skills ; and organizational capacity to learn from and adapt to the changing environment . 
While Governments , in the new context of the growing importance of the market and the private sector , have a diminished productive role in economic development , it is important to note that all Governments will retain responsibility for providing a regulatory framework for the effective operation of a competitive market system . 
The United Nations will assist Governments in creating and strengthening national capacities in fiscal policy analysis and economic management and in designing strategies aimed at creating and improving a proper environment and regulatory framework for capital flows for productive investments , promoting private sector development and increasing transparency and accountability . 
A decentralized system of information dissemination with outlets at national and regional level is therefore essential when dealing with inquiries about local environmental and regulatory conditions .  
In view of the strong international competition in automobile markets , and the relationship of national manufacturers to their government , effective action needs to be taken at the international level to develop more effective and stringent regulatory frameworks , such as internationally agreed standards for air quality , motor vehicle emissions and fuel economy , at least among OECD countries .  
In certain of the more advanced developing countries , the early introduction of radical reforms into mineral development policies and the associated fiscal and regulatory environments aimed at attracting private funds into the mining sector and at securing foreign expertise to improve the management and efficiency of State-owned , controlled and operated companies , are slowly starting to show benefits with respect to impact on the socio-economic area .  
Host Governments are expected to provide stable and transparent regulatory and fiscal environments including supportive administrative frameworks while at the same time providing acceptable socio-economic environments .  
In the same resolution , the Secretary-General was requested to seek cooperation and to join efforts with other international , global and regional organizations and mechanisms that have played an active role in combating money-laundering in order to reinforce common regulatory and enforcement strategies in that area .  
The United States strongly supported the efforts of the United Nations and other global and regional initiatives designed to promote the harmonization of the world 's financial , regulatory and legal regimes , thereby achieving more effective control of the laundering of the proceeds of serious crime .  
In the same resolution , the Council requested the Secretary-General to submit to Member States for their consideration at the fifth session of the Commission a proposal on the creation of a central repository for existing legislative and regulatory measures and information on organizational structures designed to combat organized transnational crime , taking into account the capabilities of the United Nations Crime and Justice Information Network .  
Such a programme might include comparative studies of the situation of organized transnational crime around the world and the establishment and maintenance of a central repository for information on legislation , regulatory measures , organizational structures designed to prevent and control organized transnational crime , and bilateral and multilateral cooperation arrangements .  
In view of the strong international competition in automobile markets and the relationship of national manufacturers to their Governments , effective action needs to be taken at the international level to develop more effective and stringent regulatory frameworks , such as internationally agreed standards for air quality , motor vehicle emissions and fuel economy , at least among OECD countries .  
In recent years , faced with a continuing decline in the quality of the environment , many Governments have adopted stronger environmental policies , enacted fresh legislation and regulations , and reorganized and expanded administrative agencies .  Special governmental departments for the environment , which have regulatory and promotional roles , have been set up in developing countries ( for example , India ) .  
Environmental conditions deteriorated further in many areas in the ESCWA region in 1995 .  The causes of environmental degradation included rapid population growth , inappropriate economic and social policies , weak regulatory and administrative systems , and insufficient public awareness .  
In developing demand management policy , a water agency must choose among combinations of numerous legislative , regulatory , technological and behavioral measures , each with a unique set of advantages and disadvantages .  
But the most important prerequisites for the successful mobilization of foreign and domestic resources are confidence in the financial system and appropriate macroeconomic policies , a well-established and clear legal and regulatory framework , a transparent and non-distortionary taxation system , a stable domestic financial system , and adequate infrastructure .  
In developing further the orientation and objectives of national strategies , the Commission may wish to focus on the identification of characteristics of poverty which could be common to most countries , regardless of their definition of poverty and which could be used to measure progress ; the identification of elements for elaborating national strategies comprising macroeconomic , structural , distributional and regulatory policies , together with specific short - and long-term objectives ; and the further identification of specific international actions .  
The major features of the strategy are to support private sector farming activities through improved legal , regulatory and institutional frameworks , to enhance the efficiency of traditional and domestic market-oriented agriculture , to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of intensive and export-oriented agriculture and to improve access to regional and international markets .  
It would also be acceptable if paragraph 2 , instead of remaining vague about the functions of the joint management mechanism , were to list them in detail ( data collection , project design and implementation , approval of activities planned by individual States , exercise of regulatory power , peaceful settlement of disputes and exploration of potential sources of financing , to name but a few ) .  
A careful balance must be maintained between , on the one hand , establishing priorities to make the best use of resources and avoid waste , and on the other hand the principle of adequate provision for alternatives as insurance against even the remote possibility of future political , monopoly , regulatory or efficiency difficulties on any of the main transit transport routes available to landlocked countries .  
The greatest pay-off in terms of increases in efficiency and lowered real costs of transport is likely to come about from a full-scale effort to improve a whole range of institutional , procedural , regulatory , managerial and other non-physical aspects of vital importance to the actual movement of goods to and from markets in the region or abroad .  
The following thematic areas were considered at the meeting : ( a ) policy development capacity and administrative restructuring , civil service reform and management training ; ( b ) financial management ; ( c ) human resources development ; ( d ) public-private interaction ; ( e ) public sector efficiency ; ( f ) social development ; ( g ) infrastructure and the environment ; ( h ) legal and regulatory framework ; ( i ) post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction of government machinery ; and ( j ) management of development programmes .  
Urges Member States carefully to consider the problems posed by the international aspects of corrupt practices , especially as regards international economic activities carried out by corporate entities , and to study appropriate legislative and regulatory measures to ensure the transparency and integrity of financial systems and transactions carried out by such corporate entities ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , to provide increased advisory services and technical assistance to requesting Member States , particularly in the elaboration of national strategies , the elaboration or improvement of legislative and regulatory measures , the establishment or strengthening of national capacities to prevent and control corruption , as well as in training and upgrading skills of relevant personnel ;  
The Council , in its resolution 1995 / 11 of 24 July 1995 , requested the Secretary-General to seek cooperation and to join efforts with other international , global and regional organizations and mechanisms that have played an active role in combating money laundering in order to reinforce common regulatory and enforcement strategies in that area .  
The specialized agencies also played an active role in the countries in transition : by supporting national efforts to improve management systems in public organizations ; by giving advice on the legislative and regulatory framework necessary for establishing a market economy ; by encouraging decentralization through support to local communities ; by consolidating the democratization process ; by supporting human resource programmes , social programmes and the creation of small and medium-size businesses ; by fostering integration between neighbouring countries , and by generating capital flows .  
The Fisheries Commission of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization ( NAFO ) , at its seventeenth annual meeting ( 11-15 September 1995 ) , adopted recommendations concerning control and enforcement measures as well as conservation of fish stocks . 147 It agreed on amendments which would introduce the following : objectivity in the distribution of inspections ; transmission of information from inspections to provide advance notification of apparent infringements ; reporting of catch on board fishing vessels entering and exiting the regulatory area ; establishment of minimum mesh size for capelin fishery ; 
Establishing a central repository for three categories of information and documentation , namely , ( i ) national legislation , including regulatory measures ; ( ii ) organizational structures ; and ( iii ) international cooperation arrangements , including bilateral and multilateral treaties , and implementing legislation , with a view to making the collected data available to Member States upon request . 
The Government has the power to establish the right macroeconomic environment , as well as a transparent , stable and predictable legal , regulatory and tax framework , and thus create favourable conditions for entrepreneurial and enterprise development .  By acting as a catalytic or intermediating agent , including through appropriate policies and a supportive business infrastructure , it can stimulate , facilitate or support the development of enterprises , particularly SMEs , and of inter-firm cooperation , both internally and with foreign firms .  
Urges Member States carefully to consider the problems posed by the international aspects of corrupt practices , especially as regards international economic activities carried out by corporate entities , and to study appropriate legislative and regulatory measures to ensure the transparency and integrity of financial systems and transactions carried out by such corporate entities ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , to provide increased advisory services and technical assistance to requesting Member States , in particular in the elaboration of national strategies , the elaboration or improvement of legislative and regulatory measures , the establishment or strengthening of national capacities to prevent and control corruption , as well as in training and upgrading skills of relevant personnel ;  
Special attention will be paid to measures designed to improve the whole range of institutional , procedural , regulatory managerial and other non-physical aspects of vital importance to the actual movement of goods .  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions , and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
As regards the prices charged by the project company , two basic approaches have been observed : in some cases the project company is free to determine its pricing and commercial policy , while in other cases the law subjects the initial price charged by the project company to some control mechanism ( e.g . approval by the competent regulatory body , or requirement that the prices be provided in the project agreement ) .  
The participation of international financial institutions or export credit agencies may facilitate the project sponsors task of raising funds in the international financial market by providing commercial banks with protection against a variety of political risks , including , inter alia , the failure of the host Government to make agreed payments , to make available sufficient foreign exchange or to grant necessary regulatory approvals . 
The provision of finance for shelter and urban development has been constrained by the absence of an attractive investment climate , a negative regulatory environment , a narrow housing finance base and low levels of savings due to low disposal incomes .  
The functions assigned by the Decree to the Commission relate to the implementation and enforcement of international humanitarian law on the basis of proposals submitted to the national authorities on legislative and regulatory provisions and measures to guarantee the implementation of the basic international instruments in this regard .  NULLAs to the wording of the resolution under consideration , it is important to draw attention to its authors ' awareness of the exclusion from the scope of Protocol II of situations of internal disturbances and tensions , as not being armed conflicts .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods , the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework . 
That exclusion was largely acceptable because insolvencies of financial services institutions usually required prompt and discrete action ( for instance to avoid massive withdrawals of deposits ) and were , for that reason , administered under special regulatory regimes in various States .  
In the past five years , in line with this policy , Colombia has set up a regulatory and institutional framework , ranging from the establishment of the Ministry for the Environment to the creation of an environmental network enabling the authorities and the community to take part in the national and local decision-making process relating to the environment .  
Armenia hopes that this special session will take decisions to further integrate environmental and social concerns into the day-to-day regulatory tools of the international economy , and thus ensure that quality of life issues are addressed in a way more likely to lead to their successful resolution .  
What is lacking is the development of the social and institutional structures that are needed to keep pace with the policy , regulatory and service demands arising from rapid population growth , increased complexity and the changes in technology ; and underlying this gap is the issue of good governance and its impact on building capacities and developing performance standards for sustainable development . 
The World Bank has estimated that electric power delivered to end-users equals only about 40 per cent of installed capacity in developing countries , compared to over 80 per cent of installed capacity in developed countries . 19 Establishing the principle of full ( or nearly full ) cost-recovery would permit much greater recourse to foreign financing as bond financing for either public or private national enterprises operating on fully commercial principles within an adequate regulatory environment . 
According to ICC , the private sector 's priorities for the next phase include increasing use of multilateral arrangements to resolve transboundary environmental issues ( instead of unilateral approaches ) ; incentive-based approaches , such as joint implementation ; greater involvement of business and industry in multilateral agreements and organizations through innovative consultative mechanisms ; and a more prominent role for international environmental technical and management standards and voluntary codes , as complements to regulatory frameworks .  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice , at its fifth session , proposed the establishment of a central repository for information on legislation , regulatory measures , organizational structures designed to prevent and control organized transnational crime and bilateral and multilateral cooperation agreements .  
The structure of a work programme on organized transnational crime should consist of three main elements : reliable knowledge for informed decision-making ; provision of assistance in the legislative and regulatory fields ; and advisory services and training . 
Activities include encouraging countries to create a conducive legal and regulatory climate for sustainable energy development ; supporting and financing innovative demonstration projects that promote key technologies ; and supporting the formulation and implementation of national energy action programmes .  
It was said that it would be very important to direct such an effort towards the development of international norms and standards for commercial conduct in the field , with the intent of supporting trade through electronic media , and not have as a goal the establishment of a regulatory regime for service providers , or other rules which could create costs unacceptable for market applications of electronic data interchange ( EDI ) ( ibid . , para .  117 ) .  
One way to introduce more rational pricing would be to eliminate politically motivated price controls , shifting the responsibility for determining and monitoring price guidelines to independent regulatory authorities , with consumer representation and acting within the framework of transparent rules .  
He also noted that the Secretariat , as requested by the Subcommittee at its previous session in 1996 , had submitted a working paper entitled An analysis of the compatibility of the approach contained in the working paper entitled Some considerations concerning the utilization of the geostationary satellite orbit with the existing regulatory procedures of the International Telecommunication Union relating to the use of the geostationary orbit ( A / AC . 105 / C . 2 / L . 205 ) .  
The vulnerability of the Palestinian economy to the interaction of such factors has been compounded by a range of inherent weaknesses coupled with the absence of an adequate regulatory and institutional framework at the public and private sector levels .  
A prominent example is the sensitive investment climate , which had begun to stabilize in 1995 following the adoption of a Law for the Promotion of Investment , the consolidation of the local banking system and related regulatory and institutional developments .  [ 1 ] / Events on the ground since 1996 have prompted caution on the part of investors and financial institutions , that remain in need of sustained political , legal and institutional stability .  
The study deals with : a review of major recent developments affecting private investment , including the regulatory framework , policy environment , trade and financial regimes and their recent performance ; an examination of the main supportive capacities and services important for private investment ; analysis of the scale , composition and impact of private investment in the economy ; and , prospects and policy options relevant to the future direction and magnitude of private investment in the Palestinian territory .  
A further challenge to effective enforcement and regulatory procedures to counter money-laundering is posed by the growth of payment facilities , based on high technology , that enable global financial transactions to be made by coded electronic means .  
Successful enterprise development is affected by a conducive economic environment in terms of the macroeconomic , regulatory and legal frameworks , the structural characteristics of the national economy , the degree of market development , the institutional framework , the infrastructural and human resource base and the quality and coherence of government policies .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods and the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework . 
Among the cross-cutting development constraints hampering the private sector were an ineffective or shallow financial sector ; lack of a legal and regulatory system ; weak infrastructure ; obsolete technology , poor on - and off-farm storage facilities , high taxation , and generally inadequate support services ; an inadequate policy framework ; an inefficient and overly dominant public enterprise sector ; misdirected development assistance ; high transaction costs ; and lack of trust in the interaction between the Government and the private sector .  
Also recognizes the importance of ensuring transparency and accountability at the national level to achieve policy credibility and confidence-building as well as sound regulatory and supervisory arrangements so as to strengthen the domestic financial system , and further recognizes the importance of a stable international economic environment and stability in the international monetary system ;  
This entails conducive macro and sectoral policies , as well as a transparent and simple regulatory framework ; provision of necessary infrastructure ; improved access to credit , technology and markets ; extension services geared towards improving product design and quality of goods produced ; and support services for improved linkages with other sectors of the economy .  
The provision of finance for shelter and urban development has been constrained by the absence of an attractive investment climate , a negative regulatory environment , a narrow housing finance base and low levels of savings owing to low disposal incomes .  
This encouraging trend has been achieved through the adoption and pursuit by Governments of policies and measures aimed at ensuring , among others , macroeconomic stability , inflows of foreign direct investment , open and free markets and stable and transparent legal and regulatory frameworks .  
For the East Asian region , which has been subjected to extreme volatility of currency and stock markets , the urgent need for critical regulatory safeguards in respect of international financial markets is unambiguous .  
Reducing budget deficits to manageable levels remains the major preoccupation of Governments , yet an inadequate legal basis , an unstable and exceedingly discretionary regulatory environment , high taxes and complicated tax systems and , in many cases , political uncertainties continue to force economic activity into the rapidly growing unregistered - and hence untaxed - shadow economy .  
IAEA has developed a computer-based record-keeping system to assist in achieving effective control of sealed radiation sources , the Sealed Radiation Sources ( SRS ) registry , designed for use by national regulatory bodies and regional centres for tracking sources from the cradle to the grave . 
Urges Member States carefully to consider the problems posed by the international aspects of corrupt practices , especially as regards international economic activities carried out by corporate entities , and to study appropriate legislative and regulatory measures to ensure the transparency and integrity of financial systems and transactions carried out by such corporate entities ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , to provide increased advisory services and technical assistance to Member States , at their request , in particular in the elaboration of national strategies , the elaboration or improvement of legislative and regulatory measures , the establishment or strengthening of national capacities to prevent and control corruption , as well as in training and upgrading skills of relevant personnel ;  
Further , the main focus of three OSCE seminars undertaken in the last two years was on global and regional partnership in the fields of environment management , environmental regulatory mechanisms and the transfer of environmentally safe technologies , international cooperation in protecting the environment , and promoting the economic and legal framework for environmentally sustainable development .  
This role was manifested at two levels : at the macro level in terms of creating an enabling environment , good macroeconomic policies , a sound legal , regulatory and tax framework and political stability ; and at the micro level inter alia through providing appropriate support measures and structures and investing in capacity _ building , including in the areas of education , training and health .  It could create an environment in which the private sector knew what was happening .  
The fact that a power company of Taiwan Province of China could attempt to export radioactive waste to a country where appropriate facilities are lacking , without being subject to any existing international regulatory mechanism , clearly testifies to the need to strengthen the current international regime controlling the transboundary movement of radioactive waste .  
Therefore , programmes composed of interrelated and carefully coordinated measures , including administrative , civil , procedural and criminal legislation , as well as various regulatory provisions and administrative action designed to prevent and control corruption , are of high priority .  
The underdevelopment of the financial sector is a particularly important example of this general problem : in the absence of an effective institutional and regulatory framework for banking and other financial activities , credit risks will not be undertaken on the basis of a commercial evaluation of risks and returns , and this lack of financial discipline leads to the financial sector being an obstacle rather than a support to sustained economic growth and the creation of a modern capitalist economy .  
While the private sector is the " engine of development " , the Government has to lay and maintain the " tracks " that is , create and maintain the legal and regulatory environment for private ownership and fair competition , correct appropriately for market failures , protect the disadvantaged and maintain economic stability , law and order .  
In fact , it is extremely difficult to establish a regulatory regime which is both expert and independent of capture by well-endowed enterprises ( who may be supported by strong ministers ) , nor perverted by short-term political interests .  
The current issues are concerned with choices between a cost-plus regime ( typified by many United States utilities ) or a price cap ( typified by the RPI-X formula started in the United Kingdom ) ; between a single regulator , a regulatory board , or sectoral regulatory agencies ; whether to break up a national monopoly into regional monopolies ; the rate at which competitors should be licensed , bearing in mind the need for the incumbent enterprise to finance major expansion as far as possible from internally generated surpluses ; etc .  
The key characteristics of an enabling environment are well understood and generally accepted : stability , predictability , adaptability , growth orientation , transparent legal and regulatory frameworks , and a strong base of social and physical infrastructures .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods , the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework . 
In this regard , the Netherlands stated that institutional and human capacity , a reliable regulatory and a supportive legal system , as well as stable and sound macroeconomic policies , were among the central building blocks to attract domestic and international capital to finance development .  
Practical solutions were offered in the areas of employment-intensive investment policies , harnessing the productive capacity of the urban informal sector , creating an enabling regulatory environment for enterprise development and forging new public and private-sector alliances for employment creation at the local level .  
In order to attract FDI , countries were invited to continue initiatives in such areas as a stable macroeconomic environment , transparent and accountable public administration , respect for property rights and the rule of law , the quality of labour , improvement of infrastructure , entrepreneurial and institutional capabilities and simplified administrative and regulatory frameworks .  
For that purpose , we intend to develop programmes composed of interrelated and carefully coordinated measures , including administrative , civil , procedural and criminal legislation , as well as various regulatory provisions and administrative action designed to prevent and control corruption and bribery , as a matter of high priority .  
Major impediments on the supply side are production and export structures that concentrate on only a few products , poor endowment with financial and human capital , weak technological capacity , inadequate legal and regulatory frameworks , and bottlenecks in physical infrastructure . 
To achieve successful sales of public enterprises to the private sector , it is necessary to have a strong legislative framework , a high degree of capital market development and , in many cases , sufficient persons with the capacity and integrity to develop an effective regulatory system .  
When the provision of such vital services as telecommunications , electricity supply , railways , freight transport , fuel distribution and so forth are acquired by private owners , whether through the acquisition of a State monopoly by a single large private corporation or through a widely distributed share ownership , it is appropriate that the Government set up an independent and effective regulatory body to look after consumer interests and wider national and environmental concerns .  
He believed that the key elements of an enabling environment for development were a growth-oriented economy with a transparent legal and regulatory framework , and strong social and physical infrastructure .  
For some of its most active participants , this is an asset , since it will allow rapid development of international electronic trade flows with a minimum of legal , regulatory and fiscal obstacles .  
It also emphasized the need to introduce a wide range of policy , legal , regulatory and institutional reforms which provide the private sector with a more favourable and competitive business environment .  
At the domestic level , we must promote higher standards of national government by strengthening our regulatory and supervisory frameworks , improving corporate governance , increasing transparency and lessening government interference in market decisions .  
They should pursue sound macroeconomic policies , strive to increase domestic savings and investment , strengthen institutional , legal , regulatory and supervisory capacities and improve economic management in the public and private sectors .  
An integrated approach to the efficient and equitable development and allocation of water resources requires the use of economic and regulatory instruments designed to maximize social net benefits .  
Its principal elements included political and economic stability , the rule of law , a strong institutional and regulatory framework providing intellectual property protection and protection against unfair expropriation , and dispute-resolution mechanisms .  
Liberalization needed to be combined with sound and coherent domestic economic policies , the creation of effective judicial systems , the promotion of the rule of law and respect for the regulatory responsibility of Governments .  
Reinforcing international dialogue in the appropriate multilateral and bilateral forums to achieve an adequate global regulatory framework for electronic commerce , in particular in data security , data protection , intellectual property rights , and taxation .  
However , to mobilize private investors , a legislative and regulatory framework will have to be established that is stable , predictable and transparent , making it possible for rational economic decisions to be taken .  
Since the market and other informational failures that lay behind their taking on such excessive aggregate market exposures in East Asia were massive , the required regulatory changes would have to be far-reaching and the early warning systems elaborate .  
Since then , the international community had started to devote more attention to the main policy , regulatory , legal , economic and technical issues underlying electronic commerce .  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
The secretariat noted that electronic commerce had become a major component of international trade ; the technology was well established and the remaining barriers to its use lay in institutional issues , in particular those of a regulatory and cultural nature .  
At the regional and local levels , IFAD is helping to build a cadre of microfinance technical experts , strengthen training centres and promote sustained linkages to commercial capital , while seeking to ensure a favourable regulatory environment .  
Full-scale effort to reform regulatory , procedural and managerial systems at a regional or subregional level requires effective institutional support arrangements and trained manpower at both the government and private sector levels .  
It also emphasized the need to introduce a wide range of policy , legal , regulatory and institutional reforms which would provide the private sector with a more favourable and competitive business environment .  
The view was expressed that the draft articles seemed to be premised upon a highly centralized State with comprehensive regulatory powers ; it would be difficult or even impossible to implement those principles effectively in federal States , where regulatory authority was shared .  
A significant portion of the forest area is unavailable for wood supply because it is in legally protected areas ( national parks , reserves etc . ) , it is not economically viable to harvest ( too far from markets , transport links , infrastructure etc . ) or otherwise constrained ( due to physical inaccessibility , such as steep slopes or swamps , or regulatory constraints , such as general logging or harvesting bans ) .  
The 1952 Convention establishes a formal regulatory system which can permit the arrest of a ship to secure the satisfaction of any judgment that may eventually be pronounced because the holder of a maritime lien can not , sometimes in a matter of hours , fulfil the standard procedural requirements ( likelihood of the claim alleged , valid title , precise value of the claim and risks of delay ) under formal national or domestic regulations for his application to proceed ;  
Therefore , while contractual arrangements may be agreed to by the parties to counter the adverse effects of subsequent regulatory changes ( see paras . 60-63 ) , regulatory bodies would be well advised to avoid excessive regulation or unreasonably frequent changes in existing rules .  
In that context , they outlined their respective measures to formulate national development strategies , action plans and policies , and to strengthen regulatory frameworks ; establish or strengthen national institutions to coordinate implementation of the Programme of Action at the national level ; and establish or strengthen regional institutions for effective regional coordination .  
The recent financial turmoil had shown that countries must maintain constant vigilance over all economic , financial and institutional parameters in order to guard against the volatility of other markets and contagion effects , and that each country needed not only sound macroeconomic fundamentals , but also a strong financial and banking system with adequate supervisory and regulatory mechanisms , transparency and good governance .  
New initiatives to meet the challenge of the informal sector could focus on increasing productivity through access to credit , basic infrastructure and social services , on a regulatory environment which is conducive to improving the quality of work without stifling the informal sectors employment creating capacity and on organizing informal sector employers and workers to defend their own interests .  
Indeed , in the future , investors will look more carefully at macro - and microeconomic policies [ 24 ] , most particularly at : high economic growth rate , the degree of exchange rate stability , level of foreign exchange reserves , general macroeconomic stability , health of domestic banking system , quality of stock market regulatory framework , quality of domestic accounting / disclosure standards and degree of investors rights protection .  
At the national level , this entails improving regulatory mechanisms and legislative frameworks , medium - and long-term integrated planning and strategy development , the use of economic instruments for sustainable consumption and production patterns and general awareness-raising and educational activities relating to sustainable development .  
Without prejudice to articles ( 14 and 19 ) of this Convention , ensure that administrative , regulatory , law enforcement and other authorities dedicated to combating money-laundering ( including , where appropriate under domestic law , judicial authorities ) have the ability to cooperate and exchange information at the national and international levels [ within the conditions prescribed by its domestic legislation1 ] .  
The existing voluntary initiatives were identified as being complementary to national and local regulatory compliance efforts , as these initiatives are designed to be cost-effective means of surpassing existing regulatory requirements .  
Without prejudice to articles [ 14 and 19 ] of this Convention , ensure that administrative , regulatory , law enforcement and other authorities dedicated to combating money-laundering ( including , where appropriate under domestic law , judicial authorities ) have the ability to cooperate and exchange information at the national and international levels [ within the conditions prescribed by its domestic legislation20 ] .  
In order for space exploration and development to benefit all United Nations Member States more effectively , greater international cooperation will be needed , not only on specific projects such as environmental monitoring and protection , but also in ensuring that international regulatory structures encourage commercial space activities in ways that are predictable , transparent and effective .  
The main orientations of such a policy would include improving market transparency ; enhancing information flows to local operators , and in particular the capacity of these operators to analyse this information ; providing a sound , stable policy environment and legal and regulatory framework ; stimulating the emergence of support services ; and enabling access to modern marketing , risk management and financing instruments .  
Without prejudice to articles [ 14 and 19 ] of this Convention , ensure that administrative , regulatory , law enforcement and other authorities dedicated to combating money-laundering ( including , where appropriate under domestic law , judicial authorities ) have the ability to cooperate and exchange information at the national and international levels [ within the conditions prescribed by its domestic legislation60 ] .  
Internal enabling environment : policy framework incentives for domestic private savings , equitable tax systems ( development and enforcement of ) , macroeconomic policies , disincentives to corruption ; good governance ; transparency ; effective regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector ; banking infrastructure , pension funds ; corporate governance ; internationally accepted accounting standards , and a sound legal system ( land and property rights ) ;  
In some cases , the small size of their public sectors makes it difficult to provide adequate regulation , particularly if the offshore sector has grown more rapidly than regulatory capacity .  
These included policy , legal and regulatory frameworks for sustained development of mineral resources best practices ; transnational corporations contribution in the mining and energy sectors ; new resources of capital for the development of Africas mineral resources : tapping capital markets ; and alternative approaches to financing energy and power development : case studies from African and other developing regions .  
In the statement , the Ministers agreed that one of the key lessons for Africa of the current crisis is the need to strengthen supervisory and regulatory mechanisms to ensure transparency in financial transaction and improve corporate governance , in consonance with the principles of financial liberalization and the development of financial and capital markets .  
The lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with conditions of inadequate infrastructure , imbalance of trade , inefficient transport organization , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems , poses serious constraints on the trade and economic development of landlocked developing countries .
