He stressed : Conducting the " Three Stresses " education at the county and city level is of great significance , because in our party 's organizational structure and the structure of state power , counties and cities are both leading organizations and basic units .  They play a pivotal role in forming a link between the provincial and central authorities on the one hand and the countryside , including townships and towns , on the other hand .  
Many deputies and committee members said that in the course of reform , opening up , and establishing a socialist market economy system , pluralistic trends have emerged in economic components and interests , ways of social life , and social organizational forms ; high technology has developed rapidly , new changes have occurred in people 's ideological concepts and value orientation , there are more social hot spots and difficult points , all kinds of ideas and cultures stir each other , and certain new situations and problems have arisen in social life .  
and the foundation of unity and stability has been further strengthened .  At the same time , with the continual deepening of reform and opening , there have emerged diverse economic elements and economic interests as well as diverse lifestyles and organizational forms in society , resulting in new changes in the economic structure and social relationships .  As a result , we are faced with many complicated issues entailing both benefits and harms and have encountered many tough and difficult contradictions .  
Meanwhile , under the new historical conditions we are required to comprehensively push forward the ideological , organizational , and stylistic building of the Party and truly maintain and display the advanced nature of the Party on the basis of correctly mastering and handling the relationship of dialectical unity between the advanced nature of ourselves and the extensiveness of our contacts with the masses .  
Hosts of facts proved that through fabricating a set of heresies , Li Hongzhi absorbed and controlled spiritually a great number of kindhearted people who want to keep themselves strong and healthy .  At the same time , he trained his key members to establish a compact organizational setup and he himself sat in a leading position and gave remote controls and commands .  
In the wake of the deepening of reforms and the development of socialist market economy , economic components and interests , social organizational forms and social ways of life , and jobs and employment methods are becoming more varied by the day , and this inevitably affects people 's ideological concepts and human relations in various ways , and some of these influences are negative ;  
At present , China 's civilian networks are widely distributed , and the web sites and net points are scattering everywhere .  To enable these scattered strengths to really form an integrated joint force for attack and defense during the war , we must establish a highly authoritative , centralized and united network people 's war organizational organ .  
Only when our party leads and brings along the masses to fulfill the historical mission of " three represents " in real terms amidst social changes and social progresses can it be able to keep to the correct orientation of the party building ; and can it improve its own quality , consolidate its organizational building , and enhance its fighting capacity during the process of playing a dynamic role in transforming the objective world and in pushing forward social progress .  
as social and economic elements , organizational forms , main interested parties , and employment forms are being further diversified , how we should educate officers and men to foster a correct outlook on life and values and to carry forward the spirit of selfless devotion ;  
The organization work is an important component part of our democratic and political building ; and to make the party 's organization work to effectively serve the country 's central task of economic construction and to provide both a firm and powerful organizational guarantee and a personnel support for the country 's reform , opening up , and modernization building , we must adapt the party 's organization work to the needs of the situation , improve work methods , and strive to enhance the quality of both leading bodies and the contingent of cadres .  
Operations under high-tech conditions are the combined operations of all the military branches ; and in adapting correspondingly , equipment support can only be planned overall after going through the three branches ' joint support , and only then will there be a rational distribution of resources , organizational chaos be overcome , waste of materials and equipment be overcome , work procedures be simplified , and non-support consumption be lessened , fully putting into play the capability of existing resources .  
Various democratic parties and personalities without party affiliation holding leading posts in government and judicial organs at various levels , taking part in the state power , and participating in the management of state affairs are an important feature of the democratic parties ' participation in public affairs , which is the concrete embodiment of multiparty cooperation and political consultation system and the organizational guarantee for the practice of this basic political system .  
In the march toward the new century , in order to conscientiously implement Comrade Jiang Zemin 's requirement on the " three represents " and " comprehensively advance party building around the two major historical topics , that is , constantly raising our leading and governing ability and improving our ability to guard against corruption and degeneration and withstand risks , " it is necessary to thoroughly implement the principle of strictly administering the party and satisfactorily resolve the ideological , organizational , and work style problems that exist in our party .  
To coordinate all quarters concerned means to properly coordinate the work relationship of the municipal people 's congress standing committee , and the municipal government , and the municipal committee of the CPPCC according to the requirements for advancing the work across the board , and properly coordinate and arrange the work for the organizational , propaganda , united front , and judicial departments so that all of them can properly perform their functions , fulfill their duties , cooperate , and form a joint force .  
The purpose of the " three stresses " education by positive examples conducted at the grass-roots level is to bring into play the role of grass-roots party organizations as fighting bastions and the role of party members as exemplary vanguards , pool together the strength of the vast numbers of officers and men , and provide a strong organizational and ideological safeguards for all-round construction of our grass-roots units and for meeting the requirements of " winning the war " and " preventing degeneration " .  
The thinking of persisting in the " three represents " under the new historical conditions has clearly defined the political direction , political standard , and political requirement for the building of our military ; and is of an extremely important and far-reaching significance to strengthening the party 's ideological leadership , political leadership , and organizational leadership over the military , and to ensuring that our military can forever march forward under the banner of the party and can always retain the nature and the aim of a people 's military .  
We must make bold explorations , and have the courage to carry out implementation in such aspects as the policy system , the organizational mechanism , incentive measures , and means for ensuring a sufficient logistical supply , and constantly enhance the vigor of the military work .  In our innovation of the methods of operation , methods of training , and methods of management , we should set our eyes on improving the quality of our military ;  
This means shifting our civil air defense focus from service to winning high-tech wars , our civil air defense priority to higher high-tech content and establishing quality and better organizational command and emergency rescue capabilities , our civil air defense guidance to construction and management in accordance with law , and our civil air defense efficiency to the real achievement of a good cycle of war readiness , social , and economic efficiency .  
And as to making our civil air defense organs " quasi-militarized " , we need to intensify civil air defense organ building .  Through constant building , we need to turn our civil air defense organs at all levels in the entire northeast China region into " quasi-militarized " administrative organs with political and ideological firmness , strong and effective unity , excellent professional skills , efficient organizational command , honest and clean administration , and a good administrative climate .  
They felt : In the new century , changes will continue to take place in the international environment and the international political struggle , the practice of socialist reform will develop in depth in our country , and an unprecedentedly complicated situation will appear in the social ideological field .  The diversification of socioeconomic elements , organizational forms , material benefits , and ways of employment will influence officers and men deeply , on all sides , and in a long-term way .  
In view of the " shortcomings " and weak points in the building of equipment department , this department vigorously carried out , organized , and directed the training while selecting personnel and grasping professional basic training .  It also cultivated equipment commanders at all levels who have military theoretical accomplishment and macro decision-making awareness , and raised the organizational and planning ability of equipment organs .  
The emergence of key and difficult problems makes some new demands on the organizational structure , the internal division of effort , the means and methods , and the scope of application of ideological and political work , and in the mutual relationships among these things .  How to draw new boundaries and achieve new standardization of these things , and make them form up an integrated whole which is full of vitality , is an important aspect of strengthening and improving ideological and political work in the new situation .  
In order to attain their unspeakable aims , cults always take advantage of loopholes in state laws and social management policies ; to the outside world they are cloaked in religious practice and working to improve people 's health , while internally they draw up strict regulations and prohibitions , and establish a strictly graded illegal organizational structure in a vain attempt to form a " secret kingdom " backed by " religious " beliefs outside the framework of a society with a legal system .  
In recent years , he has rounded up practitioners through this organizational system and has instigated his followers to carry out illegal activities , to willingly act as political tools for western anti-China forces , to try and execute impossible missions for these hostile foreign forces , and to severely interfere with proper social order .  In doing so , he has created a significant political backlash , and has fully exposed his vicious ulterior scheme to create social chaos .  
We must persist in the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences and being understanding and tolerant , we can not regard personal problems as organizational issues , we can not treat cognitive issues as political issues , and we should not create a tense atmosphere only because certain isolated cases of erroneous ideological and political views arise .  
Thereby , the key to consolidating and developing the current gratifying situation , realizing objectives in the Outline of the 10th Five-Year Plan , and fulfilling the three major historical tasks in the new century hinges on further implementing the important thinking of the " three represents " as put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin . Besides , the party should achieve its ideological and organizational construction , improve its work styles , and ceaselessly improve its leadership , its ruling level , and its capability of resisting corruption and preventing peaceful evolution .  
We must focus on maintaining the party 's advanced nature , cohesion , and combat strength , vigorously strengthen the ideological , work style , organizational , and disciplinary building of the party in the armed forces , promote healthy practices , oppose unhealthy practices , guard against lax organization and discipline and the growth and spread of corruption , resolutely overcome formalism and bureaucratism , and build the party organizations at all levels into combat collectives able to withstand severe tests .  
Fourth , optimize the organizational structure of the enterprises , appropriately merging enterprises in the same industries through the market mechanism which maintain the good and eliminate the bad and through macroeconomic regulation , ensure full competition among enterprises , form a pattern dominated by large enterprises and suited to the coordinated development of enterprises of all sizes .  
and further enhance the quality of rural grassroots cadres and strengthen the cohesion and combat strength of the rural grassroots party organizations , so as to provide strong and effective ideological and organizational guarantee for making a success of agriculture and rural work .  In carrying out this work it is essential to strictly act in accordance with the principles , methods , and measures laid down by the central authorities , and pay particular attention to getting a good grasp of the following issues .  
During this ongoing fight against the evil forces , leading party and government comrades must act firmly , take a clear-cut stand , earnestly strengthen their organizational guidance , and carefully plan and organize every move so as to wipe out the evil forces completely , pull up their roots , deal ruinous blows to all forms of evil forces , and create a peaceful and harmonious environment that can facilitate the realization of the grand objective of national revitalization .  
and difficulties in organizational coordination , modern joint operations can not compare to previous wars .  Relatively speaking , the joint logistics service levels of our military are fairly low .  Thus , joint logistics subunits should make a breakthrough in changing the current situation where logistics units and the units that they serve do not coordinate with each other in terms of planning and supplying and in the aspects of command and support .  
Second , new progress was made in the work of training and educating young cadres .  Through theoretical training , practical exercise , and routine education and management , the ideological and political quality of the young cadres was enhanced , and their ability to do organizational work and exercise leadership was also enhanced .  
Article 20 .  Military regions , provincial military districts ( including Beijing Garrison and other garrisons ) , military subdistricts ( including sub-garrisons ) , and the people 's armed forces departments of counties , autonomous counties , cities , and municipal districts shall conduct national defense education for militiamen and personnel on reserve duty in combination with political education , organizational rectification , military training , performance of services , conscription work , and activities on important festivals and commemoration days .  
Since these training exercises , be they staged on a map , on a computer in a simulated manner , or with real arms and real men , often involve a large amount of financial and human resources and organizational efforts , we should study ways of fully developing their exemplary or guiding roles for our teaching and training work ;  
In order to gain the initiative in maneuver operations at night , this regiment actively organized pilots to conduct night maneuvers at unfamiliar airports , aviation routes , airspace and environment ; laid ambushes ; and made long-distance raids and carried out other difficult training subjects in an effort to vigorously improve the quality of flights as well as the organizational planning and command coordination ability of commanders , and tempered their mentality , technology , and other comprehensive qualities .  
The Russian air force will optimize its setup and organizational structure through merging , reducing redundant commanding organs , and replacing backward weapons and equipment so that it will have the capability to serve as a fighting group in peacetime and to cope with local armed conflicts , thus becoming the principal attacking military service of the Russian armed forces in the new century .  
do a better job in the ideological and political work , the organizational work , the propaganda work , and the mass work under the present new situation ; resolutely eliminate such social malignant tumors as the " Falungong " ; and resolutely dump all the social garbage that runs counter to the development direction of advanced productive forces and advanced cultures , and that sets itself against the fundamental interests of the masses of the people .  
At present , every locality , on the basis of summing-up and applying successful experiences , is further implementing the demands of " three represents " for the construction of party grassroots organizations , making efforts to heighten the focus and fighting force of the rural grassroots organizations , comprehensively enhancing the overall quality of rural grassroots cadres , and providing solid and forceful ideological and organizational guarantees so that good work can be done on agricultural and rural tasks under the new conditions that confront us .  
We have also emphasized that since the party 's leadership means ideological , political and organizational leadership , party committees must bring into play their role in assuming overall responsibility and coordinating the work of different quarters and make the decisionmaking process more scientific and democratic .  
When looking at it from the point of view of the historical development of various " religious sects " , new and developing religious sects become discontented with the rigidity of the organizational system and break off from the mother religion .  Their leaders put forward the enlightenment of a special divinity and call on the minority of the followers .  This early developmental stage is inevitably looked upon by the mainstream as " heretical " .  
This network has played a positive role in preventing and correcting unhealthy trends arising from personnel appointment .  Per incomplete statistics , as of the end of 2000 , the center and the organizational departments of the party committees of various provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities received 40,200 tip-offs from the masses .  
In May last year , the center received a tip-off reflecting that principal leaders of the party committee of Qingyang Prefecture , Gansu Province , recklessly promoted cadres without regard to the regulations on bringing promotion of cadres under strict control before organizational realignment , set forth by the central authorities and the provincial party committee .  After that , the center entrusted the Organizational Department of the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee to investigate into and handle this case .  
From 1994 to 2000 , all localities throughout the country sent more than 3-million organizational cadres group by group to townships and villages to help them carry out rectification work .  Some 356,000 weak , listless , and paralytic village party branches , backward villages , and poverty-stricken village party branches were rectified , accounting for 48.8 percent of the total number of rural party branches ;  
In the organizational system of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the position of Chinese Ambassador to the United States Yang Jiechi is higher than Zhou Wenzhong . However , Zhou Wenzhong 's current visit to the United States is in the capacity of a special envoy of the Chinese Government and also at a time when the final solution of the plane collision incident has been reached between the two countries .  Therefore , diplomatic circles here have paid high attention to Zhou Wenzhong 's visit to the United States .  
Zheng Bijian said that in studying and understanding the important explication of " three represents , " it is imperative for us to further focus our understanding and actions on the issue of the advanced nature of the party and on the question of how the party , beginning from ideological building , organizational building , work-style building , and system building , can build itself into a genuine Marxist ruling party that always stays ahead of the trend of the times and that are completely consolidated ideologically , politically , and organizationally .  
In this connection , Zhang Xuezhong pointed out that the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee and the Ministry of Personnel jointly issued " Opinions on Implementing Competitive Appointment Mechanism in Party and Government Organs " in July 1998 and made specific provisions governing the guiding ideology for competitive appointment , the applicable scope , the program method , organizational leadership , and basic conditions for participating in the competitive appointment program .  
They said : In his speech , Jiang Zemin made a new theoretical summary of the party 's nature , fundamental aim , guiding principle , historical mission , and progressiveness ; and clearly set forth demands in carrying through the party 's ideological line , organizational line , and work line , and in carrying forward the party 's good traditions and work style .  
To study and resolve major party building issues in the spirit of reform , we would have to - - in accordance with practical criteria , particularly the criteria of the " three represents " - - test and examine the various aspects of the party 's ideological , political , organizational , and workstyle development to see whether they meet the requirements of the " three represents " and are proved through practice to be correct and effective .  
From the above two fundamental characteristics of the working class , we can see that the working class is a proletarian class that is the most selfless , that does not seek personal gain , and that regards liberating the whole of mankind as the prerequisite for liberating themselves , and we can see that it is a class that has revolutionary steadfastness and thoroughness , as well as a strict organizational and disciplinary nature .  
Organizational establishment departments at all levels should resolvedly carry out organizational reform plans approved by higher authorities ; they are strictly prohibited from increasing organizational sizes without prior approval and from hastily promoting cadres and assigning more cadres than actually required .  We should resolutely prevent instances in which cadres are first selected in violation of established regulations and then are re-assigned to other posts , " covert operation " in assigning and re-assigning cadres , and appointing cadres based on their personal connections .  
To break out of the ideological deadlock and be free of the mode of " management by vertical lines of division , " the crucial thing to do is to proceed from the actual need of an integrated battlefield , firmly establish the mentality of the whole and , in light of the uniqueness of the essence of joint operation of various arms and services , build an organizational system that adapts to the blending of various support forces , to the release of various support capabilities and to the optimized allocation of various support resources .  
At present the organizational forms of the illegal pyramid schemes have become still more close knit , and the means of their activities still more concealed , and they have marked characteristics of an " economic cult " : They lure the participants away from their home towns to engage in these illegal activities , practice so-called " patriarchal " concentrated management , exercise 24-hour supervision and control over the participants , and break all their ties with outsiders .  
An official of the Ministry of Public Security pointed out that in the future the public security organs will intensify their handling of illegal pyramid scheme activities and place serious and criminal cases on file for investigation and handling and will deal steady , hard , and accurate blows at their bosses and backbone elements ; they must destroy the pyramid scheme organizational networks , prevent them rising from the ashes , and totally curb the growth momentum of this criminal activity .  
In his speech , Zhang Bolin said : The changes in the principal leaders of the State Sports General Bureau were decided by the party central leadership for the purpose of promoting cadre exchanges to meet the actual needs in enhancing the leading body .  The decision was based on giving consideration to the general situation and was a normal change in the organizational work .

It should give full play to its political nucleus role and set a correct direction , goal and task for the development of Chinese culture .  It should formulate a correct line , guiding principle and policy , provide a staunch cultural and organizational guarantee and become the leader of the progressive course of China 's advanced culture .  
Endeavoring to represent demand of development of advanced productive forces is a solemn mission and sacred responsibility of our party .  Party committees at all levels , every grass-roots party organization , and every party member should work hand in hand to serve as a good " representative " of demand of development of advanced productive forces .  They should consistently maintain the party 's progressiveness and provide a strong political and organizational assurance for our socialist modernization drive .

Zhu Mingshan , vice president of the Supreme People 's Court , indicated that during the continued restructuring , the courts at all levels in localities will readjust the names and functions of their divisions according to the organizational setup of the Supreme People 's Court . Organizational setup of higher and intermediate people 's courts should basically correspond to that of the Supreme People 's Court . People 's courts at the basic level should set up their divisions from the reality of conducting the judicial work in a comprehensive way .

We must treat thorough strengthening of Party building and ideological and political work , upholding Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guide , upholding implementation of consciousness of the Party 's basic line and educational policy , upholding the socialist direction for running a school , strengthening the ideological front , and providing reliable political guarantees and organizational assurances in order to promote reform and development of schools and nurturing of successors for building socialism as the outstanding substance and requirements of " three stresses " education for higher educational institutions .

In order to realize their ulterior political motives and ambitions , cults often make use of loopholes in state laws and social administration policies .  Under the cloak of religious cultivation or physical exercise , they set up very strict internal interdictions and taboos and establish among their followers illegal and rigidly stratified organizational structures in an attempt to form " secret kingdoms " based on " religious belief " outside the framework of a legal society .  
In 1997 , at the 15th CPC National Congress , Chairman Jiang Zemin declared to the whole world : Following the 1-million personnel retrenchment in the 1980s , China will further cut down the personnel size of its army by 500,000 in the next three years .  In order to implement this strategic decision made by Chairman Jiang and the party Central Committee , the PLA has readjusted the organizational establishment of its troops ; reformed its logistic support , weaponry management , and the structure of its military academies and training institutions ;

They should make active efforts to do a good job in every stage of their work , continuously raise their ideological awareness , and make genuine efforts to prevent and overcome jaded and lackadaisical feelings .

With regard to the organizational structure of the provincial government , Professor Cheng states that during the years when military men filled the governorship , administrative powers were highly concentrated in the hands of the central government .

At its organizational session , the Commission also decided that the items entitled " Process of nuclear disarmament in the framework of international peace and security , with the objective of the elimination of nuclear weapons " and " Review of the Declaration of the 1990s as the Third Disarmament Decade " would be concluded at its 1995 substantive session .  
The Revolutionary Youth Movement to which the youth of Syria belong is an organizational framework and an educational forum for young people through which Syria 's youth exercise their its democratic rights , elect their political leaderships , practice their hobbies and defend their interests at all levels : the educational , social , economic , vocational , cultural , touristic , athletic , artistic , informational , ideological , political and technical .  
At its organizational session , the Commission also decided that the items entitled \ x { e4f8 } rocess of nuclear disarmament in the framework of international peace and security , with the objective of the elimination of nuclear weapons and \ x { e4fa } eview of the Declaration of the 1990s as the Third Disarmament Decade would be concluded at its 1995 substantive session . " 
At its second regular session of 1982 , the Council decided to identify , at its annual organizational session , a subject relating to interregional cooperation , of common interest to all regions , for detailed consideration under the agenda item on regional cooperation and to request the executive secretaries of the regional commissions to submit their joint recommendations in this regard to the Council at its annual organizational session ( decision 1982 / 174 ) .  
Our Government is more than determined to take the reins of its destiny and lead its people to the brightest , most peaceful and prosperous future that its current limited economic , infrastructural and organizational capacities can provide .  
An internal study dated March 1994 states that since 1990 , Professional staff levels at the Field Missions Procurement Section have remained constant while the total procurement dollar volume has increased 872 per cent , and that the Service can no longer accommodate or service the rapid growth in procurement and contracting activities without a very substantial infusion of staff resources and a change in the organizational structure . 
Bearing in mind , however , that under paragraph 2 of General Assembly resolution 49 / 53 , the arrangements for the convening of an international conference of plenipotentiaries are to be considered by the Ad Hoc Committee in the light of its review of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the Commission 's draft , the Secretary-General considers it premature to make proposals on the procedural and organizational aspects of the convening of the conference . 
The practical strategy which the General Assembly adopted in 1992 entitled " global targets on ageing for the year 2001 " ( comprising global and national sections ) provides a useful organizational tool at the global level for supporting regional , national and local actions .  
The Committee will also consider relevant organizational and supportive arrangements for technical cooperation among developing countries , such as administrative , legal , information and financial matters .  
Among the problems the subprogramme will address are those related to improving international purchasing and supply management methods and practices , inappropriate procurement procedures and organizational structures , insufficient external and internal information for import planning and supply management , lack of skilled personnel and limited availability of import support services .  
Services on organizational and institutional issues affecting national statistical services ; implementation of the 1993 System of National Accounts ; economic , social and demographic statistics ; electronic interchange and networking ; design and development of government information systems ; and technical and substantive support to the Statistical Institute for Asia and the Pacific ;  
Empowerment in this regard might be perceived as adopting a correct ( technical / organizational ) approach , based on alternative sets of prescriptive rules developed by experts .  
Given the increasing complexity of its role in facilitating development among countries with widely varying economic , social and political systems , innovative means of fostering communication , coordination , and organizational learning within and among its member countries are essential if the United Nations is to play a successful role in this dynamic environment .  
Carefully designed investment in information technology , coupled with appropriate organizational development , offers the possibility of not only restoring collapsed systems but of renewing faltering ones and generating viable systems in new areas of economic and social practice .  
Decides that further consideration of these staffing requirements will be subject to review during the autumn session of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , based on additional information provided by the Secretary-General through established procedures on , inter alia , the 61 posts cited in paragraph 12 above ( to include , inter alia , an organizational chart reflecting current number , grade and function of posts ) , and the report by the Board of Auditors requested in paragraph 3 above ;  
It should also consider conditions that are conducive to the rise and growth of criminal organizations , such as social , economic and political factors , structural characteristics of organized crime , as well as organizational shortcomings in the control agencies .  
In particular , it was recommended that States examine the experience of countries that have confronted organized crime and the intelligence derived from the analysis of its structures and criminal activities , as useful guiding principles concerning which substantive , procedural and regulatory legislation and organizational structures are necessary to combat the phenomenon .  
While there is a need for basic operational reliability , many established and routine forms of communication can be utilized effectively for early warning if there is an official recognition of their utility and organizational planning to do so .  
Although concrete results have been reached over the past few years in improving the technical infrastructure at the Palais des Nations , the physical distribution of buildings and the relative autonomy of many Secretariat organizational units located in Geneva , made it difficult for the Electronic Services Section of the United Nations Office at Geneva to provide the increasing amount of services required .  
The International Tribunal set up to identify agents of genocide living abroad has not been effective , as it has been crippled by organizational , financial and operational obstacles .  
These included the rethinking of existing organizational structures and the introduction of role delineation ; the revision of existing legislation and the introduction of new legislation to reflect subsidiarity ; the introduction of an information technology infrastructure ; sustained development initiatives in management of change and business re-engineering ; the setting up of local Government to enhance citizen empowerment ; the revamping of human resources practices and procedures ; the new salary structure , which reduced 96 pay scales to 20 ; and the introduction of a code of ethics for all public officers .  
This real accounting audit of personnel files , accompanied by a legal and organizational analysis , has revealed a certain number of failings that can be addressed through a proposed organizational arrangement linked to a permanent system of administrative management .  
Decides , subject to the outcome of deliberations concerning the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament at the 1997 substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , to convene a meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Fourth Special Session of the General Assembly Devoted to Disarmament before the end of the fifty-first session of the Assembly in order to set an exact date and to decide on organizational matters relating to the convening of the special session , and to submit its progress report to the Assembly at its fifty-second session . 
Operative paragraph 9 recommends that , pursuant to the adopted three-item phased approach , the Disarmament Commission , at its 1996 organizational session , adopt the following items for consideration at its 1997 substantive session : ( a ) the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned ; ( b ) the fourth special session of the General devoted to disarmament ; and ( c ) the new agenda item on conventional weapons , to be decided by the Disarmament Commission at this session .  
At its substantive session of 1994 , the Council decided that each operational activities segment would determine a principal theme or themes primarily for consideration at the high-level meeting , which would be guided by paragraph 16 of annex I to General Assembly resolution 48 / 162 , and that those themes should be agreed on by the Council at its substantive session for consideration at the subsequent substantive session , without excluding consideration of other themes to be decided on by the Council , at the latest , at its organizational session .  
At its second regular session of 1982 , the Council decided to identify , at its annual organizational session , a subject relating to interregional cooperation , of common interest to all regions , for detailed consideration under the agenda item on regional cooperation and to request the executive secretaries of the regional commissions to submit their joint recommendations in this regard to the Council at its annual organizational session ( decision 1982 / 174 ) .  
In the same resolution , the Council requested the Secretary-General to submit to Member States for their consideration at the fifth session of the Commission a proposal on the creation of a central repository for existing legislative and regulatory measures and information on organizational structures designed to combat organized transnational crime .  
Capacity-development , like sustainable development , encompasses a wide range of aspects , including the human , technological , organizational , financial , scientific , cultural and institutional .  
The specific topics under the theme " Capacity-building in public administration " were the enhancement of policy development capacity , organizational strengthening , improved civil service systems , the strengthening of financial management for development , human resource development for the public sector , and the development of administrative capacities for post-conflict and crisis conditions .  
In the area of public administration , programme activities focus on strengthening administrative and organizational systems at both the central and local levels , improving management methods and practices through modern management techniques and information technology , and legal frameworks and programmes that are sensitive to the global economy .  
Some of these specific issues being addressed include organizational structures ; systems and processes of government for decision-making , budgeting and financial management , personnel management and appropriate incentive systems ; adequate legal and regulatory frameworks ; managerial and technical skills ; and organizational capacity to learn from and adapt to the changing environment . 
The Advisory Committee inquired as to the administrative , organizational and resource requirements for UNFICYP 's humanitarian activities and was informed that a military unit comprising from 15 to 20 personnel , including civilian local level staff , was involved in this activity . 
In the same resolution , the Council requested the Secretary-General to submit to Member States for their consideration at the fifth session of the Commission a proposal on the creation of a central repository for existing legislative and regulatory measures and information on organizational structures designed to combat organized transnational crime , taking into account the capabilities of the United Nations Crime and Justice Information Network .  
Part of the problem for the international community in trying to deal with organized transnational crime is that there is no single organizational or behavioural paradigm that provides a constant and accessible target .  
Such a programme might include comparative studies of the situation of organized transnational crime around the world and the establishment and maintenance of a central repository for information on legislation , regulatory measures , organizational structures designed to prevent and control organized transnational crime , and bilateral and multilateral cooperation arrangements .  
To improve the quality of the analytical , organizational and administrative support to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs , its subsidiary bodies and intergovernmental conferences dealing with international drug control so as to facilitate their effective functioning ;  
To meet these challenges , which were exacerbated by budgetary constraints , the Department streamlined its organizational structure , consolidated its resources and established or strengthened existing links with media organizations and other organizations .  
At its organizational session for 1996 , the Council , taking note of the letter dated 6 February 1996 from the Acting Permanent Representative of Australia to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General ( E / 1996 / 14 ) , decided to include in the provisional agenda of its substantive session of 1996 an item entitled " New and innovative ideas for generating funds " ( decision 1996 / 210 ) .  
ECLAC has made major efforts over the past five years to develop a more efficient and effective secretariat through more streamlined organization , cost-saving measures , rigorous programming , training , improving horizontal and vertical communication between staff , and enhancing responsibility and accountability on the part of individual staff members and organizational units .  
As regards the $ 8.4-million reserve established to cover administrative costs related to organizational changes in the biennium 1996-1997 , the Advisory Committee was informed that the total disbursements , for the purposes outlined in paragraph 27 of document DP / 1996 / 29 , will be effected by the end of 1996 from budget savings that have already accrued to the 1994-1995 biennial budget .  
Cooperatively structured community enterprises are an effective organizational means whereby grass-roots initiative and both public and private funds can be combined in order to revitalize disadvantaged communities without creating dependency .  
Only by means of a people-centred , participatory approach will effective transformation of the rural sector occur ; cooperative enterprise is one of the most efficient organizational vehicles for such transformation in developing regions - as it has been in the past when similar conditions existed in the rural economies of currently developed countries .  
At its organizational meeting ( 22 March 1996 ) , the Task Force decided to establish a synthesis of best practices or lessons learned with an aim : ( a ) to clarify the elements of an enabling environment for economic and social development ; ( b ) to establish mechanisms for improving inter-agency coordination in support of such an environment ; and ( c ) to provide respective constituents with standardized inter-agency performance indicators of social and economic progress that represent the development agenda reflected in the outcome of the major conferences .  
Since the adoption by the General Assembly of its resolution 49 / 108 , UNIDO has advanced a major process of programmatic and managerial reform , responding to changed industrial realities and support requirements both by a substantive reformulation of its priorities and focus and by internal reforms in management and organizational structure with a view to increasing effectiveness , efficiency and impact .  
The Universal Postal Union ( UPU ) assisted the postal administrations of the countries concerned , mainly in modernizing their organizational structures and in improving the quality of their service to the urban and rural communities they serve .  
The Secretary-General 's programme to achieve staff reductions deserved support in that it sought to preserve organizational viability and performance with minimum negative impact on the international civil service and the legitimate career expectations of staff .  
The current period has been particularly important for this new international organization : the principal organs of the Authority - the Assembly , the 36-member Council and the Secretariat - have all been established , together with the subsidiary expert bodies , and the organizational work required to assume the substantive functions entrusted to the Authority by Part XI of the Convention and by the 1994 Agreement has been initiated .  
Establishing a central repository for three categories of information and documentation , namely , ( i ) national legislation , including regulatory measures ; ( ii ) organizational structures ; and ( iii ) international cooperation arrangements , including bilateral and multilateral treaties , and implementing legislation , with a view to making the collected data available to Member States upon request . 
The European Union believed that the medium-term plan should reflect the political parameters established at the recent global conferences , promote their integrated implementation and assess the organizational needs , including the administrative and budgetary resources required to facilitate the implementation of the commitments undertaken . 
Decides , subject to the outcome of deliberations concerning the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament at the 1997 substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , to convene a meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Fourth Special Session of the General Assembly Devoted to Disarmament before the end of the fifty-first session of the Assembly in order to set an exact date and to decide on organizational matters relating to the convening of the special session , and to submit its progress report to the Assembly at its fifty-second session ;  
The limited organizational capacity of many local transport providers - particularly undersized freight forwarders , who with proper assistance might develop into efficient multimodal transport operators - is leaving many countries too dependent on foreign transport providers . 
Decides , subject to the outcome of deliberations concerning the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament at the 1997 substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , to convene a meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Fourth Special Session of the General Assembly Devoted to Disarmament before the end of the fifty-first session of the Assembly in order to set an exact date and to decide on organizational matters relating to the convening of the special session , and to submit its progress report to the Assembly at its fifty-second session " ;  
Decides , subject to the outcome of deliberations concerning the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament at the 1997 substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , to convene a meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Fourth Special Session of the General Assembly devoted to Disarmament before the end of the fifty-first session of the Assembly in order to set an exact date and to decide on organizational matters relating to the convening of the special session , and to submit its progress report to the Assembly at its fifty-second session ;  
This enhanced capacity is already going beyond the provision of such data as natural attrition rates , by working to introduce analysis of projected staffing and organizational structures at the macro , organizational level , and skill and staff needs required at the micro , departmental level .  
Other delegations expressed the view that those organizational units should be merged with other relevant organizational units of the Secretariat or consolidated under the umbrella of a high-level official of the Secretariat to be responsible for the implementation of all action programmes on African development .  
We therefore appeal from this rostrum for merging our efforts at the Government and organizational level , both inter-State and voluntary , to galvanize our will and generate our energies , both official and at the mass level , in order to provide material and technical resources to implement practical and well-considered programmes to achieve this end .  
Similar expectations also exist for the quality and quantity of information and contributions made by the major groups themselves : in the next phase , their inputs will need to be more accurate , unique and reliable , while their organizational structures will need to be increasingly transparent and accountable .  
The role and priorities of UNEP , as reflected in its organizational structure and its successive biennial work programmes since the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , indicate a fundamental shift , largely in reaction to Agenda 21 and based on a clear assessment of needs , from a sectoral approach in respect of the environment to a fully integrated strategy , that is responsive to the agenda for sustainable development .  
In its decision 96 / 25 , the Executive Board decided , inter alia , to introduce an annual work plan and , in paragraph 5 of the same decision , requested that UNDP and UNFPA prepare , for the third regular session " an outline of issues that could be considered by the Board in 1997 , based on previous deliberations of the Board and the organizational priorities and objectives set for 1997 " .  
The Government of India had recognized the threat posed by organized transnational crime and measures had been taken at both the organizational and legislative levels by streamlining and reinforcing law enforcement agencies dealing with sophisticated forms of crime , as well as by drafting and passing legislation that dealt with , inter alia , terrorism , drug trafficking , smuggling of valuables and money-laundering .  
The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice , at its fifth session , proposed the establishment of a central repository for information on legislation , regulatory measures , organizational structures designed to prevent and control organized transnational crime and bilateral and multilateral cooperation agreements .  
The team 's examination of the UNEP organizational chart ( see appendix ) and related material defining functional responsibilities , suggests that the functions and authorities are broadly defined at the divisional level but less so at the subdivisional level , where clusters of staff form key groups responsible for specific functions within the overall responsibility of a division . 
Recommendations to address these constraints included : ( a ) identifying promotional messages for SHD to be used by all staff in contacts with the media at seminars and other venues ; ( b ) improving links between the staff working in policy , substantive and operational matters and those in media ; ( c ) encouraging all staff to invest time in developing and communicating clear messages on the role and activities of UNDP ; and ( d ) allocating increased funding from the organizational budget for communication and advocacy efforts .  
It is united by shared organizational values and managerial principles that foster effective teamwork , high standards and managerial and individual responsibility and clear norms of staff conduct ; is secure in the justness of its accountability framework and in the provisions for staff empowerment , recognition and sanctions which that framework actively guarantees .  45 .  It has improved leadership styles and has established among all staff a strong culture of efficiency and professionalism .  
The new UNDP structure will reflect an effort to recognize three distinct components or functions : headquarters , being those units whose functions concentrate on organizational policy , global advocacy , management oversight and quality control and global resource mobilization ; operating units , comprising the country offices and the regional bureaux ; and common administrative and financial services .  
The changes accompanying the diffusion of ICTs create the need for people who can act as intermediaries able to coordinate , integrate and disseminate new information about the production and use of ICTs drawn from relevant scientific and technical research and the practical experience of ICT implementation in a variety of organizational settings .  
The most desirable alternative would be to maintain the previously existing advantageous parking arrangements for diplomats performing their official duties , and to give them the appropriate legal and organizational status , for example by making the necessary additions to local legislative or other texts and issuing for diplomats ' vehicles special parking permits along the lines of those issued to State and City officials in New York .  
The High Contracting Parties , while independently deciding on matters of national security and military organizational development , shall engage in close cooperation in these areas and determine forms of interaction on the basis of this Treaty , the bilateral Treaty of 16 March 1995 on the Russian military base in the territory of the Republic of Armenia , and other relevant agreements .  
At its organizational session , the Commission decided to include three substantive items on its 1997 agenda : item 4 Establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned ; item 5 Fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament ; and item 6 Guidelines on conventional arms control / limitation and disarmament , with particular emphasis on consolidation of peace in the context of General Assembly resolution 51 / 45 N . Three Working Groups were established to deal with these agenda items . 
Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-third session an item entitled " Convening of the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament " and , in the light of the outcome of the deliberations at the 1998 substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , to set an exact date for and to decide on organizational matters relating to the convening of the special session .  * On behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries .  
Currently , UNSCP work areas are as follows : ( a ) support of peacekeeping , peacemaking and peace-building and management of complex emergencies and post-conflict recovery , representing a combination of joint training and shared reflection on key aspects of field operations in those areas and their cross-sectoral and inter-institutional dimensions ; ( b ) support of management development , organizational learning and change in the United Nations system ; and ( c ) support of economic and social development , development management and development studies .  
Specialized knowledge and various organizational mandates have created gaps or unclear delineations of responsibility in current institutional abilities to address adequately early warning for technological hazards and issues of severe environmental degradation .  
These require organizational structures , information flows and decision-making protocols capable of acting effectively at both national and local levels to monitor and forecast hazards at those levels , and to generate risk scenarios that can indicate the potential impacts of an impending hazard event on specifically identified vulnerable groups and sectors .  
While attention has previously largely been paid to technical applications , there is now a need to concentrate on gaining human understanding and strengthening organizational relationships essential for effective early warning .  
When we speak of reform in the United Nations , we have in mind first and foremost an effective distribution of United Nations resources , the streamlining of the Organization 's administrative and organizational structures , and budgetary and structural reform of the United Nations Secretariat , as well as personnel adjustments to meet the challenges of the modern world .  
All national development efforts need a vision a focal point to make coordinated and sustained improvements supported by political will , the participation of the people and solid organizational and financial backing .  
Another significant event in the international community 's quest to apply the rule of law in relations between States in marine affairs was the successful completion by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea of its judicial organizational phase , despite operating with a modest budget and a tiny staff under its President , Thomas Mensah .  
Among the measures taken by the Israeli authorities are the allocation of huge funds to change the basic features of Jerusalem and to erase its Arab character and the promulgation of special decrees and laws treating Jerusalem as a purely Israeli zone subject to the same organizational , legal and administrative rules applicable to other Israeli cities .  
In its decision 96 / 25 , the Executive Board decided , inter alia , to introduce an annual work plan and , in paragraph 5 of the same decision , requested that UNDP and UNFPA prepare , for the third regular session " an outline of issues that could be considered by the Board in 1997 , based on previous deliberations of the Board and the organizational priorities and objectives set for 1997 " .  
At its second regular session of 1982 , the Council decided to identify , at its annual organizational session , a subject related to interregional cooperation , of common interest to all regions , for detailed consideration under the agenda item on regional cooperation .  
This workshop on indigenous and black women ended on 14 July 1996 with a call for equitable participation in all organizational structures and the appointment of women to top _ level and decision _ making posts in the political , economic and cultural spheres .  
The Secretary-General has the honour to submit to the Council for confirmation , pursuant to rule 11 of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , an additional name of a representative of the member of the functional commission listed below that has been received since the close of the organizational session for 1996 .  
The Committee will consider relevant organizational and supportive arrangements for technical cooperation among developing countries , such as administrative , legal , informational and financial matters .  
Paragraph 12 of the report elaborated on the implications of preparing budgets on a full-cost basis , and pointed out that " each budget , whether regular , peacekeeping or support account , should show the complete staffing picture for each organizational unit under review " , and that positions approved by the General Assembly " must be filled in the traditional manner in full compliance with all existing personnel policies and procedures , including the need to maintain geographical balance " .  
While gratis personnel had played a valuable role in advancing the implementation of approved activities , particularly in the current climate of budgetary constraint , his delegation concurred with the Advisory Committee 's view that gratis personnel should not be sought solely for financial reasons but should be recruited to enhance the efficiency of the United Nations by bringing experts with needed skills and experience into the organizational fold .  
Notes with appreciation the strengthened training programmes , inter alia , people management training , upgrading of substantive skills , information technology , communications and training in all six official languages on an equal basis , and requests the Secretary-General to continue to invest in the Organization 's future capacity by sustaining and expanding these programmes in order to meet organizational needs and individual career development aspirations ;  
Notes with appreciation the strengthened training programmes , inter alia , people management training , upgrading of substantive skills , information technology , communications and training in all six official languages on an equal basis , and requests the Secretary-General to continue to invest in the Organization 's future capacity by sustaining and expanding these programmes in order to meet organizational needs and individual career development aspirations ;  
In fact , the team did not come across any system to assess organizational performance in Habitat 's two basic goals , namely , that of assisting Governments in policy and strategy formulation to improve the living conditions of people in their communities and that of strengthening the capacity of national Governments and local authorities to mobilize public and private resources to improve urban environmental conditions and productivity .  
There will be particular emphasis on strengthened planning and recruitment systems and methods , taking full account of the principle of equitable geographical distribution and gender balance ; staff learning , training and career development ; managed staff reassignment programmes ; established managerial competencies ; support to organizational and managerial reform ; improved work environment and managerial practices ; and better technical human resources management services and support to departments and offices .  
This exercise involved extensive external and internal consultations throughout 1994 and 1995 and culminated in the introduction in January 1996 of a modified organizational structure consisting essentially of redefined divisional responsibilities and the creation of a Corporate Strategy and Quality Assurance Section to facilitate a corporate approach to the delivery of services .  
We are encountering many complexities in these conditions , and these require radical organizational and institutional restructuring , vast resources and the relevant modern technologies and specialized technical know-how .  
Other delegations expressed the view that those organizational units should be merged with other relevant organizational units of the Secretariat or consolidated under the umbrella of a high-level official of the Secretariat to be responsible for the implementation of all action programmes on African development .  
The Committee had proposed that at its 1997 session the advisory committee should finalize the agenda and work out the organizational aspects of the special session and a schedule of events , as well as outlining the desirable form of participation of relevant international , regional and other governmental and non-governmental organizations in the preparatory work .  
In economic terms , the two main types of efficiency promoted by competition are static efficiency ( optimum utilization of existing resources at least cost ) and dynamic efficiency ( optimal introduction of new products , more efficient production processes and superior organizational structures over time ) .  
The challenge now is to combine this complex policy and organizational mix at the local , national and international levels into a critical mass that can lead to significant changes in human behaviour .  
Such information may relate to the size and type of previous projects carried out by the bidders ; the level of experience of the key personnel to be engaged in the project ; sufficient organizational capability , including minimum levels of construction , operation and maintenance equipment .  
The situation of deadlock in which the Conference finds itself now in connection with procedural or organizational issues , which , it is true , have a very important relationship to the substantive consideration of the topics falling within the competence of the Conference , regrettably have a negative impact on its credibility , in which the international community has vested its confidence so that it will consider issues of disarmament and nuclear disarmament in particular . 
The additional resources would enable the Secretary-General to make available an expanded range of programmes aimed at building and strengthening core organizational and managerial competencies ; to provide greater opportunities for staff at all levels to upgrade specific technical and substantive skills ; to support the decentralization of human and financial resource management responsibilities ; and to strengthen career support mechanisms .  
It will be recalled that the Committee , at its organizational session in May 1998 , requested the Secretary-General to submit to its second substantive session in April 2000 a comprehensive document assessing the overall level of implementation of the outcome of the Summit , including the identification of constraints , obstacles and successes and lessons learned , as well as recommendations on further actions and initiatives at the national and international levels .  
In this context , the additional resources would enable the Secretary-General to make available an expanded range of programmes aimed at building and strengthening core organizational and managerial competencies ; to provide greater opportunities for staff at all levels to upgrade specific technical and substantive skills ; to support decentralization of human and financial resource management responsibilities and to strengthen career support mechanisms .  
The Advisory Committee was informed that in view of the continuing operational requirements of the Mission with regard to engineering and logistical support of its activities , in particular the maintenance of the three mission-owned base camps and the logistics complex in Laayoune , it was considered necessary to retain the Engineering and Logistics Sections in the organizational structure of the Mission , headed by Professional staff at the P-4 and P-3 levels , respectively .  
The PAHO initiative focuses mainly on the health sector and UNDP assistance aims at ( a ) strengthening the institutional and organizational capacities of each of the civil protection agencies ; ( b ) supporting the preparation of a national disaster management plan ; and ( c ) providing planning and technical assistance to the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency ( CDERA ) located in Barbados .  
It was noted that the proposed programme of work for 20002001 was the first programme formulated on the basis of the cumulative reform efforts of the Commission , which included the conference structure as determined by the Commission in 1997 , the programme structure as revised and approved by the General Assembly in 1998 and the subsequent organizational structure as presented in the proposed programme budget for 20002001 .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session containing a comprehensive analysis of the organizational structure and technical , personnel and financial resources of the Non-Governmental Organizations Section , commensurate with the increased workload and the level of responsibility , necessary to implement the Secretariats mandate , as contained in Council resolution 1996 / 31 , parts 10 and 11 ;  
As a major topical event of the IDNDR closing process and the consolidation of global views , the conference identified those accomplishments and local experiences which can best improve organizational relationships and practical effectiveness for early warning into the twenty-first century .  
A primary output of the follow-up to the Potsdam conference will be a specific action plan and guidelines towards an integrated process approach , interdisciplinary and multisectoral , thereby comprising sociological , economical , political , organizational , scientific and technological components .  
We recommend to the international community and the United Nations that based on the proven success of the functional responsibilities and organizational arrangements during IDNDR , the international cooperative framework for disaster reduction be maintained and strengthened .  
Potential barriers , whether cultural and organizational , political and legal , technical and programmatic or economic , needed to be identified and then removed or minimized .  
Strengthening and supporting the activities of the regional centres , established at the initiative of the United Nations pursuant to General Assembly resolution 45 / 72 of 11 December 1990 , calls for concerted effort by various agencies with a view to sustaining , inter alia , their educational activities , infrastructure development and the institutional and organizational framework .  
At the same meeting , following a statement by the representative of the Secretariat , the Commission acting as preparatory body approved and recommended to the General Assembly the provisional agenda and organizational arrangements contained in document E / CN . 17 / 1999 / PC / CRP . 1 for adoption at the special session , as amended ( see chap .  V , sect .  
The need for an integrated and coherent policy response to the existing and emerging environmental challenges is mirrored in UNEPs integrated organizational structure and work programme , which is based on environmental monitoring , assessment , information and research , including early warning ; enhanced coordination of environmental conventions and development of environment policy instruments ; freshwater activities ; technology transfer and industry ; and support to Africa .  
Police restructuring involves reducing the number of excess police and ensuring that the rationalized police forces are representative of the ethnic composition of the community they serve and that they work within legitimate , transparent , accountable and professional organizational structures .  
The most effective organizational location for the responsible entity would be within a department already charged with broad strategic and coordinating functions , such as the office of a prime minister or president , or that responsible for economic management of development planning .  
The Governing Council session had given concrete support to the integrated work programme of UNEP , which was based on five areas of concentration environmental monitoring , assessment , information and research , including early warning , enhanced coordination of environmental conventions and development of environmental policy instruments ; freshwater ; technology transfer in industry ; and support to Africa and had endorsed its new functional organizational structure .  
The WTO-regime ( in the specific sense of a trade regime formulated and implemented under the organizational auspices of the WTO ) must be compared not to some idealized global economic democracy but to the most likely alternative a globalized economy shaped primarily by the bilateral efforts of the United States and other advanced industrial countries .  
Requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the staffing of the new organizational structure is completed as a matter of urgency in accordance with the principle of equitable geographical representation and gender balance , including in particular improving the status of women in the Secretariat and bearing in mind the need for recruitment of qualified staff in accordance with the relevant United Nations rules and regulations ;  
Notes , in particular , Governing Council decision 20 / 31 of 4 February 1999 , entitled Proposed programme budget of the United Nations Environment Programme : revised requirements for the biennium 1998-1999 and proposed requirements for the biennium 2000-2001 , which gives concrete support to the integrated work programme of the Programme and endorsement of its new functional organizational structure , and anticipates an increased level of funding to the Environment Fund for the biennium 2000-2001 ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the staffing of the new organizational structure is completed as a matter of urgency in accordance with the principle of equitable geographical representation and gender balance , including , in particular , improving the status of women in the Secretariat , and bearing in mind the need for recruitment of qualified staff in accordance with the relevant United Nations rules and regulations ;  
Central imperative planning based on physical targets , that allowed fast initial structural change , soon came to be viewed as engendering critical rigidities and obstacles to endogenous technological and organizational change .  
The creation of socialist systems appeared as a gigantic experiment in organizational and institutional innovation that met with significant initial success in achieving some important development targets set by communist regimes ( other objectives , like consumption increases or popular participation having early been deliberately sacrificed or postponed ) .  
A kind of systemic lock-in made itself increasingly felt , owing to the coherence of the classical system ( Kornai , 1992 ) and to the strong restraints set by the institutional base ( mono-party communist regime combined with domination of State ownership ) on genuine technological , organizational and institutional adaptive change .  
The change of rules in general institutional and organizational rules , constitutional and ordinary rules , and formal and informal rules represents the essential content of systemic change , hence the decisive role of law and the State in the process . 
Along with an explanation of the global framework and its regional organizational arrangement , the report will include concise methodological notes on how each regional comparison was aggregated and how the comparisons were brought together within a consistent and readily comparable framework .  
In this context , the additional resources would enable the Secretary-General to make available an expanded range of programmes aimed at building and strengthening core organizational and managerial competencies ; to provide greater opportunities for staff at all levels to upgrade specific technical and substantive skills ; to support decentralization of human and financial resource management responsibilities and to strengthen career support mechanisms .  
The incipient organizational and structural transformation of the IPU into a genuine union of parliaments of the entire world , and the adaptation of its agenda to the whole range of issues addressed by the United Nations , will help to enhance the role of the United Nations itself , endowing it with a new parliamentary dimension .  
The Committee will consider relevant organizational and supportive arrangements for technical cooperation among developing countries , such as administrative , legal , informational and financial arrangements .  
The resolution stressed that there would be no renegotiation of the existing agreements contained therein ; it defined the organizational aspects of the preparatory body and the special session and stressed the need for the effective participation of all stakeholders according to modalities similar to those applied in Cairo .  
Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-fourth session the item entitled Convening of the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament and , subject to the outcome of the deliberations at the 1999 substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , to set an exact date for and to decide on organizational matters relating to the convening of the special session .  
In its resolution 1998-49 , the Council decided to consider before the end of its organizational session in February 1999 , the reports of the Secretary-General on restructuring and revitalization of the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields and on the joint exploratory review of cooperation between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions , as well as the consolidated report on the outcomes of the functional commissions of the Council in 1998 .  
At the local , national and regional levels , the organizational arrangements that were successfully and effectively utilized for the preparations for Habitat II will be refined and adapted to the requirements of the special session , with special emphasis on the inputs and participation of local authorities and other partners from civil society . 13.44 During the biennium 20002001 , the following outputs will be delivered : 
Moreover , the successful implementation of privately financed infrastructure projects typically requires various measures beyond the establishment of an appropriate legislative framework , such as adequate administrative structures and practices , organizational capability , technical expertise , appropriate human and financial resources and economic stability .  
Also decides that the Preparatory Committee , at its resumed organizational session , based on the results of consultations to be held with all relevant stakeholders in a flexible manner , should consider innovative ways and mechanisms to facilitate the active involvement of all relevant stakeholders in both the preparatory process and the high-level intergovernmental event ;  
The appointed committee consists of about 50 representatives from various branches of society academic , service , organizational , ministerial and political that are dealing with the healthy and disabled elderly .  
The new functional organizational structure , which was considered and endorsed by the special session of the Governing Council held in May 1998 , indicates that UNEP is addressing all environmental issues in a holistic and integrated manner .  
The plan defined the legal , normative , organizational , economic , scientific , technical , environmental and social aspects of such cooperation as well as its main policies and tasks .  
The diverse elements presented reflect varying sets of constraints , ranging from human , geographical and climatic conditions , to financial , organizational or political limitations .  
The diverse elements presented reflect varying sets of constraints , ranging from human , geographical and climatic conditions , to financial , organizational or political limitations .  
The challenges faced by the organizations of the common system ( in broad terms , the need for competitiveness and improved organizational performance ) were not isolated from the outside world and were also being experienced by a number of national administrations .  
In the interests of enabling the League of Arab States to fulfil its mission , perform its tasks , implement its programmes and carry out its activities , the leaders charged the Secretary-General of the League with taking the necessary steps and proposing appropriate formulas for the reform of all financial , administrative and organizational aspects of the General Secretariat of the League with a view to restructuring it , enhancing its working methods and performance and enabling it to address national requirements and keep pace with new developments at the regional and international levels . 
In line with those objectives , the Department provides timely and qualitative organizational and technical support to the General Assembly , its General , First , Special Political and Decolonization ( Fourth ) , Second and Third Committees and its various subsidiary organs , to the Economic and Social Council and most of its subsidiary and ad hoc bodies and to United Nations conferences dealing with disarmament , international security and economic , social and related matters .  
The most effective organizational location for the responsible entity would be within a department already charged with broad strategic and coordinating functions , such as the office of a prime minister or president , or that responsible for economic management of development planning .  
Towards the end of the second half of 2001 , ITC is expected to complete the review of its medium-term planning and it is expected that several indicators will be established , including the prior definition of organizational goals , strategic principles , programme-specific objectives , dedicated strategies and related indicators of achievement , in addition to the objectives that are already specified in individual projects .  
Since industrial environments such as shipping and ports undergo continuous technological , organizational and commercial change in a world which is changing continuously in respect of social and political structures , the evaluation and validation of courses - as well as the updating of instructors - must also be continuous .  Otherwise , an admirable system may end up teaching the wrong things !  
But central to its success has been an organic sense of common purpose around which most operational and organizational questions revolve , and are resolved , with a minimum of fuss , by multilateral standards .  
She stressed the need to strengthen normative , legislative and organizational frameworks in the interests of a stable and predictable world economy , adding that one way to facilitate the developing countries integration into that economy was to provide sufficient development funding ; the International Conference on Financing for Development could play an important role in that .  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations , in close cooperation with , and with the full involvement of , the secretariat of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , as appropriate , to provide substantive and organizational support , within existing resources of the budget for the biennium 2002-2003 and by voluntary contributions , for the international ministerial meeting , and that , in this context , the necessary preparations should be undertaken at the subregional and regional levels , as appropriate , with the involvement of all major stakeholders , including the private sector ;

The objectives of the plan include improving police competency and integrity , organizational capacity , institutional integrity and cooperation between civilian police and the judiciary ; fully establishing the State border service ; enhancing cooperation among law enforcement institutions ; and increasing police and public awareness of their respective rights , duties , and role as members of the international community .

The decentralization that is occurring in many tropical countries can bring benefits to many poor rural people in heavily forested areas , including greater access to forest resources , but weak local technical capacity , limited national support and organizational problems among small-scale loggers undermine prospects for sustainable forest management .  
He stressed : Conducting the " Three Stresses " education at the county and city level is of great significance , because in our party 's organizational structure and the structure of state power , counties and cities are both leading organizations and basic units .  They play a pivotal role in forming a link between the provincial and central authorities on the one hand and the countryside , including townships and towns , on the other hand .  
Many deputies and committee members said that in the course of reform , opening up , and establishing a socialist market economy system , pluralistic trends have emerged in economic components and interests , ways of social life , and social organizational forms ; high technology has developed rapidly , new changes have occurred in people 's ideological concepts and value orientation , there are more social hot spots and difficult points , all kinds of ideas and cultures stir each other , and certain new situations and problems have arisen in social life .  
and the foundation of unity and stability has been further strengthened .  At the same time , with the continual deepening of reform and opening , there have emerged diverse economic elements and economic interests as well as diverse lifestyles and organizational forms in society , resulting in new changes in the economic structure and social relationships .  As a result , we are faced with many complicated issues entailing both benefits and harms and have encountered many tough and difficult contradictions .  
Meanwhile , under the new historical conditions we are required to comprehensively push forward the ideological , organizational , and stylistic building of the Party and truly maintain and display the advanced nature of the Party on the basis of correctly mastering and handling the relationship of dialectical unity between the advanced nature of ourselves and the extensiveness of our contacts with the masses .  
Hosts of facts proved that through fabricating a set of heresies , Li Hongzhi absorbed and controlled spiritually a great number of kindhearted people who want to keep themselves strong and healthy .  At the same time , he trained his key members to establish a compact organizational setup and he himself sat in a leading position and gave remote controls and commands .  
In the wake of the deepening of reforms and the development of socialist market economy , economic components and interests , social organizational forms and social ways of life , and jobs and employment methods are becoming more varied by the day , and this inevitably affects people 's ideological concepts and human relations in various ways , and some of these influences are negative ;  
At present , China 's civilian networks are widely distributed , and the web sites and net points are scattering everywhere .  To enable these scattered strengths to really form an integrated joint force for attack and defense during the war , we must establish a highly authoritative , centralized and united network people 's war organizational organ .  
Only when our party leads and brings along the masses to fulfill the historical mission of " three represents " in real terms amidst social changes and social progresses can it be able to keep to the correct orientation of the party building ; and can it improve its own quality , consolidate its organizational building , and enhance its fighting capacity during the process of playing a dynamic role in transforming the objective world and in pushing forward social progress .  
as social and economic elements , organizational forms , main interested parties , and employment forms are being further diversified , how we should educate officers and men to foster a correct outlook on life and values and to carry forward the spirit of selfless devotion ;  
The organization work is an important component part of our democratic and political building ; and to make the party 's organization work to effectively serve the country 's central task of economic construction and to provide both a firm and powerful organizational guarantee and a personnel support for the country 's reform , opening up , and modernization building , we must adapt the party 's organization work to the needs of the situation , improve work methods , and strive to enhance the quality of both leading bodies and the contingent of cadres .  
Operations under high-tech conditions are the combined operations of all the military branches ; and in adapting correspondingly , equipment support can only be planned overall after going through the three branches ' joint support , and only then will there be a rational distribution of resources , organizational chaos be overcome , waste of materials and equipment be overcome , work procedures be simplified , and non-support consumption be lessened , fully putting into play the capability of existing resources .  
Various democratic parties and personalities without party affiliation holding leading posts in government and judicial organs at various levels , taking part in the state power , and participating in the management of state affairs are an important feature of the democratic parties ' participation in public affairs , which is the concrete embodiment of multiparty cooperation and political consultation system and the organizational guarantee for the practice of this basic political system .  
In the march toward the new century , in order to conscientiously implement Comrade Jiang Zemin 's requirement on the " three represents " and " comprehensively advance party building around the two major historical topics , that is , constantly raising our leading and governing ability and improving our ability to guard against corruption and degeneration and withstand risks , " it is necessary to thoroughly implement the principle of strictly administering the party and satisfactorily resolve the ideological , organizational , and work style problems that exist in our party .  
To coordinate all quarters concerned means to properly coordinate the work relationship of the municipal people 's congress standing committee , and the municipal government , and the municipal committee of the CPPCC according to the requirements for advancing the work across the board , and properly coordinate and arrange the work for the organizational , propaganda , united front , and judicial departments so that all of them can properly perform their functions , fulfill their duties , cooperate , and form a joint force .  
The purpose of the " three stresses " education by positive examples conducted at the grass-roots level is to bring into play the role of grass-roots party organizations as fighting bastions and the role of party members as exemplary vanguards , pool together the strength of the vast numbers of officers and men , and provide a strong organizational and ideological safeguards for all-round construction of our grass-roots units and for meeting the requirements of " winning the war " and " preventing degeneration " .  
The thinking of persisting in the " three represents " under the new historical conditions has clearly defined the political direction , political standard , and political requirement for the building of our military ; and is of an extremely important and far-reaching significance to strengthening the party 's ideological leadership , political leadership , and organizational leadership over the military , and to ensuring that our military can forever march forward under the banner of the party and can always retain the nature and the aim of a people 's military .  
We must make bold explorations , and have the courage to carry out implementation in such aspects as the policy system , the organizational mechanism , incentive measures , and means for ensuring a sufficient logistical supply , and constantly enhance the vigor of the military work .  In our innovation of the methods of operation , methods of training , and methods of management , we should set our eyes on improving the quality of our military ;  
This means shifting our civil air defense focus from service to winning high-tech wars , our civil air defense priority to higher high-tech content and establishing quality and better organizational command and emergency rescue capabilities , our civil air defense guidance to construction and management in accordance with law , and our civil air defense efficiency to the real achievement of a good cycle of war readiness , social , and economic efficiency .  
And as to making our civil air defense organs " quasi-militarized " , we need to intensify civil air defense organ building .  Through constant building , we need to turn our civil air defense organs at all levels in the entire northeast China region into " quasi-militarized " administrative organs with political and ideological firmness , strong and effective unity , excellent professional skills , efficient organizational command , honest and clean administration , and a good administrative climate .  
They felt : In the new century , changes will continue to take place in the international environment and the international political struggle , the practice of socialist reform will develop in depth in our country , and an unprecedentedly complicated situation will appear in the social ideological field .  The diversification of socioeconomic elements , organizational forms , material benefits , and ways of employment will influence officers and men deeply , on all sides , and in a long-term way .  
In view of the " shortcomings " and weak points in the building of equipment department , this department vigorously carried out , organized , and directed the training while selecting personnel and grasping professional basic training .  It also cultivated equipment commanders at all levels who have military theoretical accomplishment and macro decision-making awareness , and raised the organizational and planning ability of equipment organs .  
The emergence of key and difficult problems makes some new demands on the organizational structure , the internal division of effort , the means and methods , and the scope of application of ideological and political work , and in the mutual relationships among these things .  How to draw new boundaries and achieve new standardization of these things , and make them form up an integrated whole which is full of vitality , is an important aspect of strengthening and improving ideological and political work in the new situation .  
In order to attain their unspeakable aims , cults always take advantage of loopholes in state laws and social management policies ; to the outside world they are cloaked in religious practice and working to improve people 's health , while internally they draw up strict regulations and prohibitions , and establish a strictly graded illegal organizational structure in a vain attempt to form a " secret kingdom " backed by " religious " beliefs outside the framework of a society with a legal system .  
In recent years , he has rounded up practitioners through this organizational system and has instigated his followers to carry out illegal activities , to willingly act as political tools for western anti-China forces , to try and execute impossible missions for these hostile foreign forces , and to severely interfere with proper social order .  In doing so , he has created a significant political backlash , and has fully exposed his vicious ulterior scheme to create social chaos .  
We must persist in the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences and being understanding and tolerant , we can not regard personal problems as organizational issues , we can not treat cognitive issues as political issues , and we should not create a tense atmosphere only because certain isolated cases of erroneous ideological and political views arise .  
Thereby , the key to consolidating and developing the current gratifying situation , realizing objectives in the Outline of the 10th Five-Year Plan , and fulfilling the three major historical tasks in the new century hinges on further implementing the important thinking of the " three represents " as put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin . Besides , the party should achieve its ideological and organizational construction , improve its work styles , and ceaselessly improve its leadership , its ruling level , and its capability of resisting corruption and preventing peaceful evolution .  
We must focus on maintaining the party 's advanced nature , cohesion , and combat strength , vigorously strengthen the ideological , work style , organizational , and disciplinary building of the party in the armed forces , promote healthy practices , oppose unhealthy practices , guard against lax organization and discipline and the growth and spread of corruption , resolutely overcome formalism and bureaucratism , and build the party organizations at all levels into combat collectives able to withstand severe tests .  
Fourth , optimize the organizational structure of the enterprises , appropriately merging enterprises in the same industries through the market mechanism which maintain the good and eliminate the bad and through macroeconomic regulation , ensure full competition among enterprises , form a pattern dominated by large enterprises and suited to the coordinated development of enterprises of all sizes .  
and further enhance the quality of rural grassroots cadres and strengthen the cohesion and combat strength of the rural grassroots party organizations , so as to provide strong and effective ideological and organizational guarantee for making a success of agriculture and rural work .  In carrying out this work it is essential to strictly act in accordance with the principles , methods , and measures laid down by the central authorities , and pay particular attention to getting a good grasp of the following issues .  
During this ongoing fight against the evil forces , leading party and government comrades must act firmly , take a clear-cut stand , earnestly strengthen their organizational guidance , and carefully plan and organize every move so as to wipe out the evil forces completely , pull up their roots , deal ruinous blows to all forms of evil forces , and create a peaceful and harmonious environment that can facilitate the realization of the grand objective of national revitalization .  
and difficulties in organizational coordination , modern joint operations can not compare to previous wars .  Relatively speaking , the joint logistics service levels of our military are fairly low .  Thus , joint logistics subunits should make a breakthrough in changing the current situation where logistics units and the units that they serve do not coordinate with each other in terms of planning and supplying and in the aspects of command and support .  
Second , new progress was made in the work of training and educating young cadres .  Through theoretical training , practical exercise , and routine education and management , the ideological and political quality of the young cadres was enhanced , and their ability to do organizational work and exercise leadership was also enhanced .  
Article 20 .  Military regions , provincial military districts ( including Beijing Garrison and other garrisons ) , military subdistricts ( including sub-garrisons ) , and the people 's armed forces departments of counties , autonomous counties , cities , and municipal districts shall conduct national defense education for militiamen and personnel on reserve duty in combination with political education , organizational rectification , military training , performance of services , conscription work , and activities on important festivals and commemoration days .  
Since these training exercises , be they staged on a map , on a computer in a simulated manner , or with real arms and real men , often involve a large amount of financial and human resources and organizational efforts , we should study ways of fully developing their exemplary or guiding roles for our teaching and training work ;  
In order to gain the initiative in maneuver operations at night , this regiment actively organized pilots to conduct night maneuvers at unfamiliar airports , aviation routes , airspace and environment ; laid ambushes ; and made long-distance raids and carried out other difficult training subjects in an effort to vigorously improve the quality of flights as well as the organizational planning and command coordination ability of commanders , and tempered their mentality , technology , and other comprehensive qualities .  
The Russian air force will optimize its setup and organizational structure through merging , reducing redundant commanding organs , and replacing backward weapons and equipment so that it will have the capability to serve as a fighting group in peacetime and to cope with local armed conflicts , thus becoming the principal attacking military service of the Russian armed forces in the new century .  
do a better job in the ideological and political work , the organizational work , the propaganda work , and the mass work under the present new situation ; resolutely eliminate such social malignant tumors as the " Falungong " ; and resolutely dump all the social garbage that runs counter to the development direction of advanced productive forces and advanced cultures , and that sets itself against the fundamental interests of the masses of the people .  
At present , every locality , on the basis of summing-up and applying successful experiences , is further implementing the demands of " three represents " for the construction of party grassroots organizations , making efforts to heighten the focus and fighting force of the rural grassroots organizations , comprehensively enhancing the overall quality of rural grassroots cadres , and providing solid and forceful ideological and organizational guarantees so that good work can be done on agricultural and rural tasks under the new conditions that confront us .  
We have also emphasized that since the party 's leadership means ideological , political and organizational leadership , party committees must bring into play their role in assuming overall responsibility and coordinating the work of different quarters and make the decisionmaking process more scientific and democratic .  
When looking at it from the point of view of the historical development of various " religious sects " , new and developing religious sects become discontented with the rigidity of the organizational system and break off from the mother religion .  Their leaders put forward the enlightenment of a special divinity and call on the minority of the followers .  This early developmental stage is inevitably looked upon by the mainstream as " heretical " .  
This network has played a positive role in preventing and correcting unhealthy trends arising from personnel appointment .  Per incomplete statistics , as of the end of 2000 , the center and the organizational departments of the party committees of various provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities received 40,200 tip-offs from the masses .  
In May last year , the center received a tip-off reflecting that principal leaders of the party committee of Qingyang Prefecture , Gansu Province , recklessly promoted cadres without regard to the regulations on bringing promotion of cadres under strict control before organizational realignment , set forth by the central authorities and the provincial party committee .  After that , the center entrusted the Organizational Department of the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee to investigate into and handle this case .  
From 1994 to 2000 , all localities throughout the country sent more than 3-million organizational cadres group by group to townships and villages to help them carry out rectification work .  Some 356,000 weak , listless , and paralytic village party branches , backward villages , and poverty-stricken village party branches were rectified , accounting for 48.8 percent of the total number of rural party branches ;  
In the organizational system of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the position of Chinese Ambassador to the United States Yang Jiechi is higher than Zhou Wenzhong . However , Zhou Wenzhong 's current visit to the United States is in the capacity of a special envoy of the Chinese Government and also at a time when the final solution of the plane collision incident has been reached between the two countries .  Therefore , diplomatic circles here have paid high attention to Zhou Wenzhong 's visit to the United States .  
Zheng Bijian said that in studying and understanding the important explication of " three represents , " it is imperative for us to further focus our understanding and actions on the issue of the advanced nature of the party and on the question of how the party , beginning from ideological building , organizational building , work-style building , and system building , can build itself into a genuine Marxist ruling party that always stays ahead of the trend of the times and that are completely consolidated ideologically , politically , and organizationally .  
In this connection , Zhang Xuezhong pointed out that the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee and the Ministry of Personnel jointly issued " Opinions on Implementing Competitive Appointment Mechanism in Party and Government Organs " in July 1998 and made specific provisions governing the guiding ideology for competitive appointment , the applicable scope , the program method , organizational leadership , and basic conditions for participating in the competitive appointment program .  
They said : In his speech , Jiang Zemin made a new theoretical summary of the party 's nature , fundamental aim , guiding principle , historical mission , and progressiveness ; and clearly set forth demands in carrying through the party 's ideological line , organizational line , and work line , and in carrying forward the party 's good traditions and work style .  
To study and resolve major party building issues in the spirit of reform , we would have to - - in accordance with practical criteria , particularly the criteria of the " three represents " - - test and examine the various aspects of the party 's ideological , political , organizational , and workstyle development to see whether they meet the requirements of the " three represents " and are proved through practice to be correct and effective .  
From the above two fundamental characteristics of the working class , we can see that the working class is a proletarian class that is the most selfless , that does not seek personal gain , and that regards liberating the whole of mankind as the prerequisite for liberating themselves , and we can see that it is a class that has revolutionary steadfastness and thoroughness , as well as a strict organizational and disciplinary nature .  
Organizational establishment departments at all levels should resolvedly carry out organizational reform plans approved by higher authorities ; they are strictly prohibited from increasing organizational sizes without prior approval and from hastily promoting cadres and assigning more cadres than actually required .  We should resolutely prevent instances in which cadres are first selected in violation of established regulations and then are re-assigned to other posts , " covert operation " in assigning and re-assigning cadres , and appointing cadres based on their personal connections .  
To break out of the ideological deadlock and be free of the mode of " management by vertical lines of division , " the crucial thing to do is to proceed from the actual need of an integrated battlefield , firmly establish the mentality of the whole and , in light of the uniqueness of the essence of joint operation of various arms and services , build an organizational system that adapts to the blending of various support forces , to the release of various support capabilities and to the optimized allocation of various support resources .  
At present the organizational forms of the illegal pyramid schemes have become still more close knit , and the means of their activities still more concealed , and they have marked characteristics of an " economic cult " : They lure the participants away from their home towns to engage in these illegal activities , practice so-called " patriarchal " concentrated management , exercise 24-hour supervision and control over the participants , and break all their ties with outsiders .  
An official of the Ministry of Public Security pointed out that in the future the public security organs will intensify their handling of illegal pyramid scheme activities and place serious and criminal cases on file for investigation and handling and will deal steady , hard , and accurate blows at their bosses and backbone elements ; they must destroy the pyramid scheme organizational networks , prevent them rising from the ashes , and totally curb the growth momentum of this criminal activity .  
In his speech , Zhang Bolin said : The changes in the principal leaders of the State Sports General Bureau were decided by the party central leadership for the purpose of promoting cadre exchanges to meet the actual needs in enhancing the leading body .  The decision was based on giving consideration to the general situation and was a normal change in the organizational work .  
Zhang Bolin also said : Yuan Weimin has been in the leading body of the State Sports Commission since 1984 .  He is politically firm , always willing to study , proficient in sports management , and has rich administrative experience and strong organizational and leading ability .  He works in a down-to-earth manner , firmly adheres to principles , has courage to manage things , and set strict demands on himself .  
At the plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission held in the beginning of this year , General Secretary Jiang Zemin pointed out : " The key to determining how well China can handle its current affairs lies in our party and depends on the party 's ideology , work style , discipline , organizational situation , fighting capacity and leadership level .

It should give full play to its political nucleus role and set a correct direction , goal and task for the development of Chinese culture .  It should formulate a correct line , guiding principle and policy , provide a staunch cultural and organizational guarantee and become the leader of the progressive course of China 's advanced culture .  
Endeavoring to represent demand of development of advanced productive forces is a solemn mission and sacred responsibility of our party .  Party committees at all levels , every grass-roots party organization , and every party member should work hand in hand to serve as a good " representative " of demand of development of advanced productive forces .  They should consistently maintain the party 's progressiveness and provide a strong political and organizational assurance for our socialist modernization drive .  
persist in taking Marxism as a guide , proceed from the reality of the initial stage of socialism , emancipate the mind , seek truth from facts , conduct bold innovation , and correctly handle the relations between communities and residents , other units stationed in the communities , and pertinent government administrative organs ; penetratingly explore the organizational forms and structure of communities which are suited to the requirements of the building of spiritual civilization , and positively bring forth new ideas on the community management system and activity modes that are well received by the people .  
For this reason , the State Metallurgy Industrial Bureau decided a few days ago to continue to regard " overall control , structural readjustment , and efficiency " as the focus of iron and steel industrial work for a period of time in the future .  Based on this , only by making the most of the favorable opportunity to speed up enterprise technical progress and carry out enterprise organizational structural readjustment can the iron and steel enterprises smoothly participate in international competition before long .  
Zhu Mingshan , vice president of the Supreme People 's Court , indicated that during the continued restructuring , the courts at all levels in localities will readjust the names and functions of their divisions according to the organizational setup of the Supreme People 's Court . Organizational setup of higher and intermediate people 's courts should basically correspond to that of the Supreme People 's Court . People 's courts at the basic level should set up their divisions from the reality of conducting the judicial work in a comprehensive way .  
Charged with the onerous and complex tasks of fixing posts for personnel and locating posts for some personnel , local organizational and personnel departments have formulated policies to advance reform in the spirit of being responsible for every civil servant , organizing the competitive assignment of posts and two-way choosing .

Part of the problem for the international community in trying to deal with organized transnational crime is that there is no single organizational or behavioural paradigm that provides a constant and accessible target .  
Such a programme might include comparative studies of the situation of organized transnational crime around the world and the establishment and maintenance of a central repository for information on legislation , regulatory measures , organizational structures designed to prevent and control organized transnational crime , and bilateral and multilateral cooperation arrangements .

The team 's examination of the UNEP organizational chart ( see appendix ) and related material defining functional responsibilities , suggests that the functions and authorities are broadly defined at the divisional level but less so at the subdivisional level , where clusters of staff form key groups responsible for specific functions within the overall responsibility of a division . 
Recommendations to address these constraints included : ( a ) identifying promotional messages for SHD to be used by all staff in contacts with the media at seminars and other venues ; ( b ) improving links between the staff working in policy , substantive and operational matters and those in media ; ( c ) encouraging all staff to invest time in developing and communicating clear messages on the role and activities of UNDP ; and ( d ) allocating increased funding from the organizational budget for communication and advocacy efforts .

Specialized knowledge and various organizational mandates have created gaps or unclear delineations of responsibility in current institutional abilities to address adequately early warning for technological hazards and issues of severe environmental degradation .  
These require organizational structures , information flows and decision-making protocols capable of acting effectively at both national and local levels to monitor and forecast hazards at those levels , and to generate risk scenarios that can indicate the potential impacts of an impending hazard event on specifically identified vulnerable groups and sectors .  
While attention has previously largely been paid to technical applications , there is now a need to concentrate on gaining human understanding and strengthening organizational relationships essential for effective early warning .

Paragraph 12 of the report elaborated on the implications of preparing budgets on a full-cost basis , and pointed out that " each budget , whether regular , peacekeeping or support account , should show the complete staffing picture for each organizational unit under review " , and that positions approved by the General Assembly " must be filled in the traditional manner in full compliance with all existing personnel policies and procedures , including the need to maintain geographical balance " .  
While gratis personnel had played a valuable role in advancing the implementation of approved activities , particularly in the current climate of budgetary constraint , his delegation concurred with the Advisory Committee 's view that gratis personnel should not be sought solely for financial reasons but should be recruited to enhance the efficiency of the United Nations by bringing experts with needed skills and experience into the organizational fold .

In fact , the team did not come across any system to assess organizational performance in Habitat 's two basic goals , namely , that of assisting Governments in policy and strategy formulation to improve the living conditions of people in their communities and that of strengthening the capacity of national Governments and local authorities to mobilize public and private resources to improve urban environmental conditions and productivity .  
There will be particular emphasis on strengthened planning and recruitment systems and methods , taking full account of the principle of equitable geographical distribution and gender balance ; staff learning , training and career development ; managed staff reassignment programmes ; established managerial competencies ; support to organizational and managerial reform ; improved work environment and managerial practices ; and better technical human resources management services and support to departments and offices .  
This exercise involved extensive external and internal consultations throughout 1994 and 1995 and culminated in the introduction in January 1996 of a modified organizational structure consisting essentially of redefined divisional responsibilities and the creation of a Corporate Strategy and Quality Assurance Section to facilitate a corporate approach to the delivery of services .  
We are encountering many complexities in these conditions , and these require radical organizational and institutional restructuring , vast resources and the relevant modern technologies and specialized technical know-how .  
Other delegations expressed the view that those organizational units should be merged with other relevant organizational units of the Secretariat or consolidated under the umbrella of a high-level official of the Secretariat to be responsible for the implementation of all action programmes on African development .  
The Committee had proposed that at its 1997 session the advisory committee should finalize the agenda and work out the organizational aspects of the special session and a schedule of events , as well as outlining the desirable form of participation of relevant international , regional and other governmental and non-governmental organizations in the preparatory work .  
In economic terms , the two main types of efficiency promoted by competition are static efficiency ( optimum utilization of existing resources at least cost ) and dynamic efficiency ( optimal introduction of new products , more efficient production processes and superior organizational structures over time ) .  
The challenge now is to combine this complex policy and organizational mix at the local , national and international levels into a critical mass that can lead to significant changes in human behaviour .  
Such information may relate to the size and type of previous projects carried out by the bidders ; the level of experience of the key personnel to be engaged in the project ; sufficient organizational capability , including minimum levels of construction , operation and maintenance equipment .  
The situation of deadlock in which the Conference finds itself now in connection with procedural or organizational issues , which , it is true , have a very important relationship to the substantive consideration of the topics falling within the competence of the Conference , regrettably have a negative impact on its credibility , in which the international community has vested its confidence so that it will consider issues of disarmament and nuclear disarmament in particular . 
The additional resources would enable the Secretary-General to make available an expanded range of programmes aimed at building and strengthening core organizational and managerial competencies ; to provide greater opportunities for staff at all levels to upgrade specific technical and substantive skills ; to support the decentralization of human and financial resource management responsibilities ; and to strengthen career support mechanisms .

Police restructuring involves reducing the number of excess police and ensuring that the rationalized police forces are representative of the ethnic composition of the community they serve and that they work within legitimate , transparent , accountable and professional organizational structures .  
The most effective organizational location for the responsible entity would be within a department already charged with broad strategic and coordinating functions , such as the office of a prime minister or president , or that responsible for economic management of development planning .

The creation of socialist systems appeared as a gigantic experiment in organizational and institutional innovation that met with significant initial success in achieving some important development targets set by communist regimes ( other objectives , like consumption increases or popular participation having early been deliberately sacrificed or postponed ) .  
A kind of systemic lock-in made itself increasingly felt , owing to the coherence of the classical system ( Kornai , 1992 ) and to the strong restraints set by the institutional base ( mono-party communist regime combined with domination of State ownership ) on genuine technological , organizational and institutional adaptive change .  
The change of rules in general institutional and organizational rules , constitutional and ordinary rules , and formal and informal rules represents the essential content of systemic change , hence the decisive role of law and the State in the process . 
Along with an explanation of the global framework and its regional organizational arrangement , the report will include concise methodological notes on how each regional comparison was aggregated and how the comparisons were brought together within a consistent and readily comparable framework .
