Wang Dongjin spoke at the 92nd International Labor Organization Conference , saying that facing the challenges and difficulties of globalization , developing countries should enact feasible economic and sustainable social developmental strategies according to their countries ' situations .  Advanced countries and international organizations should provide the developing countries with a more practical and effective technical assistance to raise their ability to participate in the globalization process , thus allowing them to enjoy fairly the fruits of economic globalization from which common prosperity and development of the world can be realized .  
The basic framework of the study includes : The current population situation and developmental conditions of the Yangtze Delta Region , the regional property development , the developmental trends in property structure and employment population , the developmental trends in urbanization and the development of cities , the total population and the ecological carrying capacity of population resources , the aging of the population , and the social security system of urban and rural areas .  
The proliferation of information technology and the trend toward global economic and technological unification have further heightened the speed of technological propagation .  This has moved forward our starting point , skipping certain developmental stages , and providing innumerable opportunities for realizing generation crossing developments in military construction .  
In the beginning of the transitional leap , since our experience was limited , and our funding was insufficient , we were in this kind of " point by point developmental mode " and special project construction had was logically based , but by now we should have already arrived at " unification " - - systems integration - - time .  We must conclude the separate explorations of the initial period and enter an integration phase as soon as possible .  
The surpassing road selected by the strategy of " three steps forward " means that , observing objective laws , one can pursue development in strides , skipping over stages .  It does not , however , set false objectives and diverge from reality , or mean that development in strides means arbitrarily skipping over certain necessary developmental stages , or inappropriately raising the objectives of the next stage of development .  
While inspecting Guangdong Province in February of this year , General Secretary Jiang Zemin pointed out that , " Only if our Party is from start to finish the developmental requirement of China 's advanced social productive forces , the direction of advance of China 's advanced culture , and the faithful representative of the basic interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people , only then can our Party forever occupy an invincible position , always obtain the wholehearted support of all the people of this nation , and continually lead the people forward . "  
For more than 20 years now , the basic lines , basic guiding principles , and policies for reform and opening up formulated and continually improved by the Party 's second and third generations of central leadership work hard to embody the forward direction of developmental requirements for China 's advanced productive force and culture , truly representing the basic interests of the majority .  
B : The new challenges and new opportunities require us to have the correct , proper new ideas that go with the flow but also are realistic and practical for us .  Our economic construction should never again embark on a developmental path of extensive expansion .  We should no longer pursue rapid growth only in terms of the total economic volume .  
Just as the three old military groups " China Returnees Union " , " Sino-Japanese Friendship Association of Veterans " and " Association of Citizen Non-Fighting Soldiers " said in their declaration , this problematic textbook " seeks to nurture people just like those who created an enormous harm on the people of Asia some 55 years ago . "  This type of reactionary education directly influences the future developmental direction of Japan .  
To implement the great western development strategy , the state has explicitly arranged to let scientific and technological education take the lead .  It has mobilized the " Great Western Development Special Operation In Science and Technology , " and the localities are in the process of formulating , or have already formulated , their own developmental strategies to invigorate science and technology .  In the areas of opening up scientific research , circulation , competition , cooperation , and attraction and retention of talent , they have set up some effective working mechanisms .  
Such achievements have made an important contribution to the successful implementation of " the 9th five-year " plan in our region and the basic realization of developmental goals established at the third Tibet Work Forum set forth by the central authorities .  They have also created favorable conditions for carrying out the strategic goal of a leap forward in economic and social development in our region during the new period .  
When looking at it from the point of view of the historical development of various " religious sects " , new and developing religious sects become discontented with the rigidity of the organizational system and break off from the mother religion .  Their leaders put forward the enlightenment of a special divinity and call on the minority of the followers .  This early developmental stage is inevitably looked upon by the mainstream as " heretical " .  
We must securely grasp the developmental characteristics of the farming and animal husbandry industries and of the industries in countrysides and towns , adjust economic structures in agricultural and pastoral industries , which , after all , are the main threads of our work ; revolve around increasing the incomes of peasants and animal herders , which is the core concern ; and promote overall economic and social developmental progress in impoverished areas .  
According to what is understood , for more than 20 years China 's national defense science and technology industry has gradually realized a transformation from an industry that produces industrial products for military use only , to one that produces products that integrate military and civilian use .  Every industry within the military industrial complex has fundamentally formed a developmental pattern with professional characteristics for products for the civilian industry .  
These lifetime revolutionary companions who were born in the same month of the same year were well-experienced and loyal communist soldiers and outstanding proletariat revolutionaries ; they made major indelible contributions to China 's revolution and developmental undertakings .  
In the new historical period , Chairman Jiang , based on the developmental changes in the domestic and foreign situation , summarized the new experience in our army 's modernization development , creatively putting forward the scientific concept of " ideological and political development " , stressing that we must put ideological and political development in the premier position among all the army 's development projects , and he gave a series of important instructions in regard to strengthening military ideological and political development under the new situation .  
This year is the last year of the " National Eight-seven Plan for Tackling Tough Problems in Poverty Relief " ; all localities and departments concerned must seriously implement the central arrangements for development for poverty relief ; with poor villages as the main battleground , and with the focus on developing crop cultivation and livestock raising and the construction of basic farmland , they should adhere to the guideline of developmental poverty relief and concentrate forces and increase input in an effort to fulfill this historic task .  
In the wake of rural economic development , especially with the development of the non-agricultural sectors , those sectors that have attained the highest standard of development have begun to integrate into the urban economy at a faster pace .  This marks the beginning of the transition of the dual , urban-versus-rural , economy from a two-tier to a one-tier developmental pattern , indicating that the dual economy is beginning to merge into a unified economy .  
While their own countries carry out massive activities aimed at prohibiting smoking , developed countries on the contrary encourage sales of tobacco products to developing countries .  The majority of developed countries not only have not kept to their own promises regarding increasing official developmental support in international society , but have attempted through technological monopoly and trade barriers to conduct a " new economic colonialism " .  
All party comrades , and all levels of leading cadres before all , must remain committed to the historical , practical , and developmental viewpoint of Marxism , insist that practice is the sole criterion for testing truth , display history-making initiative and revolutionary creativity , and make persistent efforts to study and tackle new problems .

Even for Mr . and Mrs . Chang Erh-lien , who had run a nursery for nearly 30 years and considered themselves very knowledgeable about preschool children , the reality of foster parenting was far different from what they had been anticipating .

" The first child they accepted , aged two years and nine months , displayed severe developmental regression , and was completely unable to control his bowel or bladder movements .

They typically possess limited institutional and human resource capacity to assess the implications for sustainable agricultural and rural development of ongoing developmental plans .  
Within the changing context of sustainable development , developmental efforts should be able to pay its full costs , that is , the environmental and social costs ; for this reason resources have to be priced at or equal to the marginal value or scarcity rent and incorporated into development-related decision-making .  
In view of the challenging international context marked by countries in transition , ethnic conflicts , increase in refugees , acute complex developmental need and humanitarian assistance , the role of the resident coordinator - to lead a strong , integrated , effective team at the country level - has become even more crucial .
