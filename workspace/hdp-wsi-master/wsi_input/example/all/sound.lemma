The open letter emphasized : " The Chinese Government 's ban of the cultish organization of ' Falungong ' is a correct measure and the actual deed to safeguard the country 's political power and social stability , the sound mind and body of the people and the personal interests of the Chinese people .  It is to uphold the basic human rights of the Chinese people , which is purely an internal affair of China . "  
Because China 's relevant legal code is still not quite sound and comprehensive , its market mechanism not quite mature , and its capital market not fully open , some 70 percent of direct foreign investment in China are through joint venture and cooperation , with only a portion invested in wholly-owned companies .

Under the conditions of a socialist market economy , carrying forward and developing the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation , giving rise to a sound common practice of respecting , providing for , assisting the elderly in society , and building up a harmonious relationship between different generations is a major content for our current socialist spiritual civilization building .  
It is important to vigorously carry forward and develop the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation ; launch a society-wide moral education on the need to respect , provide for , and assist the old ; and to give form to a sound common practice of respecting , caring for , and helping the elderly in the entire society in combination with the activity of creating civilized communities , civilized villages and towns , and civilized families .  
In urban areas , a sound old-age security system needs to be established , with basic old-age insurance , basic medical insurance , business insurance , social relief , social welfare , and mutual social aid as its major contents .

They should see to a sound implementation of the relevant principles and policies adopted by the party Central Committee and the State Council ; and ensure that both the minimum subsistence guarantee allowances for urban residents and the basic old-age pension for retirees can be issued at the scheduled time and in full amount without any delay , and ensure that the two kinds of pensions can increase in a rational way along with the country 's economic growth .

China is subject to the influence of 2,000-year-old feudalism , plus the influence due to the intrusion of the decadent capitalist thought and lifestyle .  In particular , it is now in a period of economic transformation from a longtime planned economy to a market economy .

He emphasized that the long-standing objective of the Government was to maintain an overall environment favourable to economic growth , through providing a sound legal and institutional framework , a simple tax system with low tax rate , a stable financial sector , well - developed infrastructure and an efficient Government machinery .  
The Chief Executive said Hong Kong was fortunate , and had incomparable advantages , such as a high degree of autonomy under the ' One Country , Two Systems ' concept , abundant financial reserves , social and economic systems that worked well and a sound , comprehensive legal system .  
Nevertheless , he said that due to the joint efforts of the Hong Kong Arts Development Council and the two municipal councils , Hong Kong does have , through the organisation of recreational and cultural exchanges and other activities , a sound base for gradually nurturing the public 's understanding of national history and culture and for building a greater sense of national identity .  
Hong Kong has a sound and effective financial monitoring system ; ample fiscal reserves as well as prudent financial management policies .  The Government is free of any foreign debts .  Private firms also exercise financial prudence when seeking foreign loans .

And in the year just closed , March 31 , 1998 , our budget surplus was a full 5.8% of GDP .

In conclusion , Mr Tong explained that in spite of the projected negative growth rate of 4 per cent for 1998 , the territory with its vast fiscal reserves , and sound financial and monetary system , will be able to ride out the storm and continue with the implementation of its major infrastructure projects .  
We also are determined to uphold the rule of law , the free market principles , clean and efficient government , sound and transparent regulations and prudent fiscal management , the hallmarks of our past success .  
" We are a model of sound economic management , with a free market operating under the rule of law , a well-regulated financial sector and a clean government that exercises prudence in its fiscal policies .  
These include a well developed financial infrastructure , a conducive regulatory environment and sound supervisory process , free and open markets , a modern and effective legal system and a high degree of transparency .  
Miss Chan said a few underlying principles must be observed in considering the four options .  They are : ( 1 ) the aim to save jobs and improve unemployment ; ( 2 ) the need to ensure employees ' statutory entitlements are not impaired ; ( 3 ) that the PWIF must stay financially sound at all times and ( 4 ) that no public funds should be used to finance the PWIF should it run into financial difficulties as a result of payment made to employees in cases of corporate rescue .

" In addition , the establishment of a sound and credible regulatory framework will lay a solid foundation for the future development of Chinese medicine within our healthcare system and strengthen Hong Kong 's potential to develop over time into an international centre for research , manufacture and trading of Chinese medicine , " she stressed .

He together with 19 Hong Kong based officers are tasked to build a very crucial bridge to link up the CPG and the provincial / municipal authorities in the Mainland with the HKSARG . I sincerely look forward to the generous support of the central leadership , State and Provincial officials to this new Office , to help it establish its work on a sound foundation . 
Hong Kong 's economic fundamentals remain strong .  These include , inter alia , the Mainland as our economic hinterland , robust financial and banking systems , a huge foreign exchange reserve , a sound legal system , a simple tax system with low tax rates , a clean government and efficient transport and communications facilities .  All these factors contribute towards the maintenance of our competitiveness .  
There is a school of thought that maintains that mobile international capital can play a useful global role as a sort of ' policeman ' of sound policies .

For instance , to the sound of Chinese flute music they would walk from one end of the practice hall to the other , on the way changing themselves into a seed which pushes its way out of the ground , then sprouts and flowers ; or into a prisoner in a deep dark dungeon who slowly crawls out to see the sunlight ; or a condemned man walking to the execution ground , who is struck by a bullet and falls down , but continues to struggle forward clutching his wound .  
On Mid-Autumn Festival in August of this year , with a light breeze and misty rain passing through the darkened evening sky , the sound of Chang Cheng-chieh 's violin resonates through the air outside the Confucius Temple in Taipei . Every morning , before the sky has lightened Father takes his lunchbox and rides off on his bicycle Leaving his abode , he heads to the river . . . . The unadorned but moving voice of poet Hsiang Yang weaves itself in and out of the violin strains , embroidering a romantic atmosphere . . . .  
Thirty years ago , an American director and cinematographer named Morton Heilig , inspired by 3-D films , had the " wild idea " of developing a " total illusion of reality " which would encompass sight , smell , motion , and sound . He declared that audiences would enjoy complete and realistic sensory stimulation .  
As for dialogue content , in addition to those traditional scripts that still sound fresh after a hundred listenings , some people have begun to offer up new creations in step with current times . And the language employed is no longer Beijing Mandarin with its heavily retroflexed consonants . In recent years , comic dialogues have imperceptibly gone through an unprecedented metamorphosis - - they are now often recited in local dialects .  
A well-designed domed facility should be highly flexible , with adjustable activity size , space , lighting , and sound . Also , to attract spectators , it must provide " full service , " including private boxes , food and beverage services , concessions to sell memorabilia , and so on . And to meet the needs of the press at major events , there must be TV broadcast facilities , a press box , darkroom , and phone and fax equipment .  
He faces a number of urgent problems . One is how to balance economic growth and environmental protection in a Taiwan that is densely crowded and has already suffered serious ecological damage and pollution . Another is how to create a sound investment environment that will keep local capital at home and attract foreign investment .  
Lin Yu-ping went the island to observe the troupe . Liu says that upon striking the drum , the whole wooden classroom resonated as if the room itself had been struck . The resultant sound , he recounts , can not be described as music , nor as rhythm , but rather as a direct assault upon one 's body , which " awakens your entire being . " The visitor is quite shaken by the experience .  
Ancient texts give us a glimpse of the many different occasions when such music was played . For instance , Shan Hai Jing ( The Classic of Mountains and Seas ) describes how the Yellow Emperor used the skin of a kui ( a legendary beast ) for a drum : " He struck it with the bones of the thunder-beast . The sound was heard 500 leagues , and terrified the whole world . " This is probably the earliest recorded example in Chinese history of the use of a war drum .  
When the white moon shines bright over silent mountains , and the wind in the pines is silent , poets still find inspiration : Wang Wei , hearing a rushing stream gurgle through jumbled rocks and flow away into the still depths of a pine forest , savored a pure sound which can not be found in the clamorous world of men .  
" Turning a corner , the bus had climbed to the height of the temperate forest . There was no longer the rustling of bamboo leaves ; through the windows came the sound of soughing pines , and both sides of the road were dark with Japanese red cedar , Taiwan red pine and Pinus morrisonicola . The treetops towered over the road , and serried ranks of trunks rushed by one after another . . . . "  
The sense of humor of Hong Kong people reached full expression here . One product offered was toilet paper printed like a calendar , with the days counting down to Chinese rule being torn off square by square to wipe somebody 's butt-Hong Kong people are sick and tired of hearing about the return ! A soft pillow covered with the character for " Communism " was guaranteed " to insure a sound sleep . "  
Later , a corrupt official threatens to expose Shao 's mistaken identity . The intense exchange between the two captivates the audience . When there is a pause that lasts a minute or so , there is not the slightest sound on stage or off , with only the faint whirr of the air conditioning disturbing the silence .  
" It seemed that wrapped up inside her blanket was a little printing press , printing sheet after sheet of warm , damp , pale yellow diapers . . . One began to hear the sound of hammers from our bedroom . We put up steel wires , one , two , three , four , five , six .  
Music critic Wang Hen only partly agrees with this assessment . He thinks Wong is a quite outstanding conductor , and that this year in particular he raised his game a notch . Moreover , his ability to coordinate each section of musicians is rare indeed ; otherwise it would be impossible to bring together musicians from different places , of different ages , and with different habits , and produce a quality sound in only a short rehearsal period .  
Having been left without parents when a child , Fang-liang was always the caring mother . Her husband was a strict father in the traditional mold . He would beat the children when they did something wrong , to the sound of Fang-liang imploring him to stop in her Ningbo dialect .  
When she had a big gash knocked in the back of her head , with her blood gushing out , the world moving in slow motion and the suddenly amplified sound of her heartbeat and breathing ringing in her ears , she did n't want go to a hospital because to save money she had n't bought health insurance . Meanwhile her friends were trying to staunch her bleeding while at the same time shaking her and shouting at her for all they were worth so as not to let her pass out . . . .  
Hau Pei-tsun , a former premier as well as chief of the General Staff , was a member of the armed forces for most of his career . Speaking about his experience as chief of the General Staff , Hau has stated that the military already has a perfectly sound procurement system , and that the important thing is the ethical standards of the officers in charge . If top generals get involved in politics and start engaging in tricky power plays , the military will naturally fall into disarray .  
Leaving behind the " real virtuality " of Taitien Temple 's heaven , the lush and verdant mortal world around us is vibrant with the sound of cicadas , and a light breeze caresses our skins . The ticket seller dozes peacefully after eating his packed lunch . Is he roaming through heaven in his dreams ?  
For example , popular legend has it that the wood in coffin shops emits sounds , which are the souls of the deceased coming to choose their own coffins . Lin explains , with scientific basis , that the sound comes from the wood drying and splitting under the northeast seasonal winds , and is completely unrelated to spirits .  
To avoid having their shares sold off , these tycoons , who were such able stock market operators when the economy was sound , had to devote their firm 's entire resources to defending their share price . This made it difficult to employ their capital effectively-they lived and died with the market .  
Such occurrences might sound like complete fantasy to someone who has never practiced martial arts before . Chan wants to try and use modern scientific methods to explain these phenomena . " I 've been fortunate enough to win medals . This good fortune has come about thanks to good karma from a previous existence . "  
All of a sudden you are drawn to a halt by the sound , which wafts down from an upper story , of a pipa being plucked , along with resonant , melancholy singing . For a moment it is as if you have stepped back several centuries in time . . . .  
There was a time when the gong was shunned by most professional musicians , who did n't want its loud , brash sound in their modern , air-conditioned concert halls . Even when it did make an appearance , the star of the show in boisterous outdoor temple parades was only allowed to make muffled hints at its real capabilities .  
He is especially appreciative of the way older folks take care of their gongs . In a temple parade , direct exposure to the hot sun can get a gong too hot and foul up its sound . When this happens , the old folks will wipe a gong with a wet cloth and wait for it to cool before striking it .  
Music also interferes with the contemplative process of liberating oneself from worldly concerns , and even Mahakasyapa , who always accompanied the Buddha , was unable to calm down when preaching to the lovely sound of a zither-while the other 500 divine beings present simply lost their heads and started dancing . When former music students take monastic vows they renounce forever their beloved pianos and violins , because everything makes way for the overriding priority of breaking the cycle of rebirth .  
Tribute candy , a blend of peanuts and maltose , was originally called " ground candy " in Fujian because the peanuts used in making it are ground continuously to give it the proper crumbly texture . The name changed on Kinmen because few of the ROC soldiers who secured the island understood the Fujianese word for " grind . " These soldiers instead took to calling the candy " tribute candy , " and the new name , which has a similar sound as well as conveying an air of imperial quality , stuck .  
And despite the surrounding hubbub , when the chiming guitar of the first track " At the Begin " welled up , accompanied by the sound of sea waves , my thoughts were quickly carried off to a beach at dawn , leagues away on the northeast coast of Taiwan , or a broad stretch of deep blue flooded with the sparkling silver light of the moon , possessed of nothing but the warmth and calm of the ocean , completely submerged in an instant .  
" Many scenes which reflected sensitive issues of the time may sound totally innocuous today , but back then they would bring knowing chuckles from audiences . " Hsin Chi says with a laugh that the way stories picked up on things people were angry about but dared not speak out over , created a mutually consoling sense of shared experience between actors and audience .  
After analyzing large quantities of recorded maroon oriole song , Chang divided the calls of the male bird during the mating season into five categories , according to their sound spectrum . They include a rough and rasping " a - , " a graceful whistle , a rapidly repeated " ga-ga-ga . . . " and so on .  
When applied to oceanography , the natural sound waves produced by the wind and currents create ambient noise , which is comparable to ambient light . An underwater target will perturb this ambient noise to produce " noisy " signals , just as ambient light reflects off objects in a room . Even though the ambient noise does not come from a specific source as in conventional sonar imaging , it can still " illuminate " objects .  
I want to emphasize that in the future Taiwan industry must , on the foundation of a sound manufacturing sector , continue to extend outward to the two ends of the " smiling curve , " moving toward a strategy of increasing added value , and producing smaller volumes of more diversified and differentiated products . There must also be movement toward upstream R &amp; D and innovation , as well as downstream marketing and distribution .  
For this reason , he has spent decades assiduously researching the " genes " of Chinese characters , to analyze the basic structure of Chinese writing on the basis of six essential factors : the characters ' constituent elements ; the sequence of those elements ; the shapes of the strokes and stroke combinations that make up the characters ; recognition features ; sound ( in those characters with a phonetic element ) ; and meaning . Using these factors , Chu hopes to make computers " understand " the concepts underlying the Chinese writing system .  
He enlarged the puppets , put more modern faces on them and dressed them in brighter costumes . He used dry ice and flash powder to create a variety of stage effects . He also made changes to the music , importing a sound system and making bold use of local pop stars and Western music to accompany his plays . His golden-light theater came to dominate puppetry and he himself rose to the top of his generation of puppeteers .  
When you enter the hamlet , on all sides you can see magnificent old trees piercing the sky , feel a fresh breeze , and hear the sound of birds chirping-and of nothing but birds chirping . In the moist heat of summer , it is like entering the proverbial Chinese " peach blossom paradise " and visitors from outside suddenly feel cool and relaxed .  
" Wellness centers " tout their ability to stave off aging , and woo customers with scented hot spring baths , quartz sound wave therapy , and whole-body pummeling with contoured mallets . They stress that these therapies can adjust slight lopsidedness or other deformations of the spine caused by modern people 's poor posture , thus restoring mental and physical balance .  
Mr . Lin , a writer who generally speaking is not averse to tuina massage , once went to a TCM traumatology clinic near his home for some skeletal manipulation . The hundred-square-meter clinic was packed full of patients , and in the middle were three reclining chairs attended a young tuina masseur . The masseur worked on Lin 's neck and back and rotated his shoulders and arms for 20 minutes . Lin heard the sound of his own joints cracking , and felt that his muscles had relaxed quite a lot .  
At present , 76 US medical schools offer courses in alternative medicine . In the international academic community , bioenergetic medicine organizations are holding frequent symposia , to take the first steps toward putting the field on a sound scientific footing . They have also begun active dialogue with practitioners of Chinese and Western medicine . It looks as if the health authorities in Taiwan ought not to completely ignore alternative medicine .  
Maybe drawing large crowds with deliberately staged events is a necessary measure to develop the tourism industry . But what if they are " full of sound and fury , but lacking in soul " ( in the words of Wang Chen-hua , director of a private school ) . Thus , for example , Pinghsi 's Sky Lanterns originally expressed respect for deities and spirits , but who can tell that these days , when any otherworldly atmosphere is smothered by the raging sounds of the pop bands doing outdoor shows during the event ?  
At 5 a.m . on June 13 , to the accompaniment of sonorous beiguan music , priests at the temple began to make a report to Heaven about the jiao , explaining the reasons for it and its scheduled itinerary . For three days running , from early in the morning to late at night , the sound of festive beiguan music with suona horns and gongs , as well as the loud and clear chanting of the Daoist priests , drifted from the main hall .  
A sound recycling regime is extremely important . " Chen gives an example : Taiwan 's paper recycling is quite successful , because traditional paper recycling businesses have existed for 30 or 40 years . They have not been displaced by societal changes , and have been fortunate to have their efforts be in lockstep with the new era of resource recycling . A virtuous circle has been created , not only making for an outstanding record with recycling , but also seeing vendors evolve from the use of street stalls to the construction of numerous recycling plants .  
Tang Yaw-chung , professor in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering , National Taiwan University , says that modern technology makes it very easy to copy sound and image data . The more personal data criminals are able to lay their hands on , the harder it is for ordinary people to differentiate between the genuine and the bogus , and the easier it is for them to be taken in .  
Before the morning dew on the pink petals of the mountain rambling roses has evaporated , and as the flowers ' soft , subtle fragrance arrests the steps of the passer-by , suddenly the sound of helicopter blades gets closer . Those on the ground directing the work shout to the others immediately to vacate the drop zone and get down as low to the ground as possible .

In 1968 the interdependence of human rights and development was reiterated more explicitly in the Proclamation of Tehran , 5 / which provides that the achievement of lasting progress in the implementation of human rights is dependent upon sound and effective national and international policies of economic and social development .  
The United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , which was the core of the system of operational activities , had provided assistance in such crucial areas as national capacity-building in management , governance and democratization , private sector development and economic reforms , human resources , the social sector and the development of environmentally sound energy sources .  
the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Governments bore the primary responsibility for formulating appropriate strategies , policies , programmes and actions to combat poverty ; the effort required sound macroeconomic policies , structural changes and the mobilization of domestic resources , inter alia , through more equitable tax regimes and a reduction in military expenditures .  
Stresses the need for finding effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of the poorest and most indebted developing countries and the importance of a full , constructive and expeditious implementation of the Naples terms , agreed upon in the Paris Club in December 1994 , for such countries , with a view to helping them exit from the rescheduling process on the basis of sound economic policies in those countries , thus contributing to the promotion of their prospects for resuming growth and development ;  
Calls upon the international community , particularly developed countries and international organizations , to fulfil all their commitments as affirmed in chapter 34 of Agenda 21 , 5 / in particular on the effective access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including new and emerging technologies and publicly owned technologies , to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries , so as to enable those developing countries to meet their development-related challenges ;  
Calls upon the international community to meet all the objectives as reaffirmed in chapter 34 of Agenda 21 , 15 / in particular those dealing with effective access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including new and emerging technologies and publicly owned technologies , to developing countries on favourable terms , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries , so as to contribute to enabling those developing countries to meet their development-related challenges ;

The Commission had concluded from a reappraisal of the principle and its application that the Noblemaire principle continued to be applicable and that the " best-paid national civil service " formula , combined with a reference check with international organizations , appeared to be sound , provided that the process was handled in a timely manner and the margin range realistically reflected comparator expatriation benefits and resulted in a competitive remuneration package .  
Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;  
Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;  
Even if it were assumed that globalization was an integral aspect of the normative structure of the established international economic system , the concerns expressed by the Group of 77 and others would seem to require additional antidotes , such as the establishment , for preventative purposes , of sound fiscal and monetary policies and early-warning systems , or normative counter-weights .  
Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;  
The 1990s have been a decade of political and economic upheaval throughout the world , and there has been an increasing tendency towards democratization and the participation of non-governmental actors in development , with a particularly strong emphasis on the need for good governance and for sound financial and economic policies at the national level and a greater reliance on market forces and on the private sector as basic requirements of development .  
Significant political and economic changes are taking place all over the world , characterized by , among other things , a growing concern for democratization and good governance , by the increasing resort to privatization and greater reliance on market forces , by an enhanced awareness of the need to mobilize domestic resources and reduce fiscal deficits , by growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes and by greater recognition of the need to ensure that development is not only sustainable but also environmentally sound .  
The main objective of the review was to obtain assurance that the assumptions used in the programme budget were based on sound financial and economic principles and to suggest refinements in budgetary techniques and modifications in format with a view to achieving realistic and transparent budgetary proposals .  
Our Organization , which was designed to respond to both global challenges and to the needs of its Member States , will not be able to play its double role in the coming century unless it can count on a sound , solid and stable financial basis .  
Aware that they are primarily responsible for promoting their own development through sound and consistent economic and social policies , the developing countries involved in structural adjustment programmes have made enormous sacrifices , which , unfortunately , have not yet achieved the desired results .  
A sound early warning system , combining political , military , humanitarian , human rights and economic areas , would broaden the base of options and enhance the chances for success in the early detection of conflict situations .  An early international monitoring presence in itself has a major deterrent effect .  
We are convinced that through prudent management of our very limited resources , a willingness on the part of our people to work hard and , on our part , clear political leadership and virtuously inspired guidance all enhanced by the support of friendly Governments and donor agencies we shall , in due course , place our country on a sound path towards genuine growth .  
Furthermore , my Government places particular emphasis on the needs of vulnerable groups , such as the disabled , in the process of social development , in the firm conviction that a genuinely sound and prosperous society can be realized only when all people , irrespective of their physical or mental disadvantages , are able to pursue a life of happiness and dignity based on stability and equality .  
Finally , sound monetary and fiscal policies implemented by a government which is transparent and accountable will also help to provide the confidence needed to attract private sector investment that is critical to growth and job creation . 
The definitive solution to the problem of the external debt , of ownership and of a considerable improvement in national , foreign and private investment , in the framework of a sound and responsible macroeconomic policy favouring internal savings and contributing to improving the standard of living of the Nicaraguan people , must be our goal .  
I should also like to reiterate the proposal made by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , President of the Republic of Tunisia , advocating the concept of a global economic and social plan aimed at guaranteeing African growth on sound and lasting bases and at assisting our continent to remedy its deficiencies , achieve integration into the world economy and ensure dignified living conditions for all peoples in Africa .  
This is being achieved through the pursuit of a sound and stable macroeconomic policy , supported by a prudent and disciplined fiscal and monetary stance , and the delivery of an investor-friendly institutional legal framework .  
Emphasizes the need to implement sound and stable macroeconomic , micro-economic and sectoral policies that encourage broad-based economic growth and development that is sustainable and equitable , that generate jobs and that are geared towards eradicating poverty and reducing social and economic inequalities and exclusion ;  
The favourable risk assessment was based on the generally sound macroeconomic policies and continued economic liberalization pursued by most Governments as well as the high rates of domestic investment and savings .  
This is based on existing data sets and uses two independent variables - general fertility rates and proportion of births that are assisted by a trained person - to predict values for countries with no sound national estimate of maternal mortality .  
They engaged in such hostile and provocative actions as breaking the sound barrier over civilian sites , dropping heat flares over agricultural land and intercepting and provoking Iraqi civilian vessels .  
Stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Stresses the need for finding effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of the poorest and most indebted developing countries and the importance of a full , constructive and expeditious implementation of the Naples terms , agreed upon in the Paris Club in December 1994 , for such countries , with a view to helping them exit from the rescheduling process on the basis of sound economic policies in those countries , thus contributing to the promotion of their prospects for resuming growth and development ;  
Apart from traditional telecommunications services , satellite technology had found increasing applications in rural telecommunications , direct and digital broadcasting ( sound and television ) and mobile telecommunications ( land , maritime and aeronautical ) , as well as in global computer networking .  
A vital element in the development and improvement of the Division is the appointment of a Director at the D-2 level with extensive experience and sound knowledge in procurement , logistics and contracting , including substantial managerial experience in these areas at the international level , as well as a proven ability and record of strategic planning .  
Calls upon the international community to meet all the objectives as reaffirmed in chapter 34 of Agenda 21 , 5 / in particular those dealing with effective access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including new and emerging technologies and publicly owned technologies , to developing countries on favourable terms , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries , so as to contribute to enabling those developing countries to meet their development-related challenges ;  
Our present objective is to achieve adequate shelter for all and especially for the deprived urban and rural poor through an enabling approach to the development and improvement of shelter that is environmentally sound .  
Apply transparent , comprehensive , easily accessible and progressive taxation and incentive mechanisms to stimulate the efficient , environmentally sound and equitable use of land , and exploit the full potential of land-based and other forms of taxation in mobilizing financial resources for service provision by local authorities ;  
The sustainability of the global environment and human life will not be achieved unless , among other things , human settlements in both urban and rural areas are made economically buoyant , socially vibrant and environmentally sound , with full respect for cultural , religious and natural heritage and diversity .  
The eradication of poverty requires , inter alia , sound macroeconomic policies aimed at creating employment opportunities , equal and universal access to economic opportunities ( and special efforts to facilitate such access for the disadvantaged ) ; education and training that will promote sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen productive employment and work , and basic social services , including health facilities . 
An integrated approach to the provision of environmentally sound infrastructure in human settlements , particularly for the rural and urban poor , is an investment in sustainable human settlements development that can enhance the quality of life , reduce negative impacts on the environment , improve the overall health of a population , and reduce the burden of investment in curative health and poverty alleviation . 95 bis .  
Promoting construction methods , materials and technologies that are affordable , safe , efficient and accessible and that emphasize greater use of local materials and human resources , that encourage and support design efficiency and energy-saving methods , and that are environmentally sound and protective of human health ;  
In general terms , sustainable forest management deals with the administrative , economic , social , legal , technical and scientific aspects of the conservation and sustainable use of forests within the framework of technically sound and politically accepted national land-use plans . 
Lack of implementation is partially attributed to lack of resources , expertise and political commitment and to insufficient availability of factual and scientific information on , for example , successional change and variables such as growth and yield of tree species under varying intensities of forest management , relationship between harvesting practices and forest ecosystem functions etc .  The lack of scientifically sound information is even more acute in relation to ecological processes on which increasing emphasis has been made in recent years .  
At its first session , the Panel re-emphasized the need to explore and consider ways to address the areas relating to the transfer and development of environmentally sound technology on favourable terms , as mutually agreed , and the mobilization of financial resources to assist developing countries in pursuing policies and comprehensive strategies for achieving sustainable forest management , taking into account ongoing work of the Commission and other relevant processes .  
Additionally , at the international level , commercial private-sector efforts to follow up UNCED are promoted by such groups as the International Network for Environmental Management in Germany and the Business Council for Sustainable Development ( BCSD ) in Switzerland . BCSD has established task forces on , inter alia , internalizing social and environmental costs in prices , and conducting a global study on the environmentally sound production and use of paper .  
The Commission made substantial progress at its third session in identifying and analysing various mechanisms and instruments for the financing of environmentally sound technologies ( ESTs ) , and it indicated that in its future work it would focus on improving the conditions for financing from external financial resources , facilitating access to traditional national financing mechanisms , and promoting innovative mechanisms for the financing of ESTs ( see E / CN . 17 / 1995 / 8 ) .  
A strong expansion of agricultural production , internal stability , strong government commitments , a sound political and regulatory framework for development , complemented by significant external support , among other factors , have contributed to raising economic growth rates .  
The Government of Cuba has sound and undeniable proof , from the legal and political points of view , that the acts of violation and aggression against Cuban airspace perpetrated for more than 35 years , and most recently by aircraft of " Brothers to the Rescue " , have had a subversive , hostile , aggressive and terrorist character .  
To integrate environment and development in the policies and practices of each country effectively , it is necessary to develop and implement integrated , enforceable and effective laws and regulations that are based on sound social , ecological , economic and scientific principles .  
Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;  
During the 1990s , dramatic political and economic shifts had been occurring throughout the world , marked by increasing tendencies towards democratization , greater reliance on market forces , greater emphasis on mobilizing domestic resources and reducing fiscal deficits , increasing privatization , growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes , and heightened recognition of the need to assure environmentally sound and sustainable development .  
The Andean Presidents take note of the sustained and financially sound growth of the Andean Development Corporation in the international sphere , to the point where it has become the primary source of financing for the Andean countries , supporting physical integration projects , private-sector development , increased trade and the procurement of resources in capital markets .  
The Committee may wish to consider these new approaches and perhaps recommend additional paths to pursue as regards the environmentally sound development of mineral resources for the purposes of implementing activities in the area of mineral resources , given the current budgetary constraints under which United Nations organizations are operating and pursuant to their specific mandates . 
Directly tied into this process has been the continued dissemination of individual country information through the very successful investment seminars and round-table discussions which have enabled private companies , financial institutions and technical advisers to gain a better understanding of various countries and their risk factors , and to develop good working relationships with private and government officials and the multilateral and bilateral aid institutions , all with a view towards creating a sustainable economic and environmentally sound base of operations on which to build within the various countries .  
In order to maintain public finances on a sound footing while simultaneously meeting social commitments , the Government implemented tax reforms by widening the tax base ; increasing tax rates ; restructuring tax brackets to increase progressivity of personal income tax ; and by raising excise taxes to finance an increase in pensions and educational spending .  
Bearing in mind the rapid pace of global economic developments and their implications for all countries , particularly developing countries , and the critical importance of efficient and effective government institutions , administrative systems and procedures , and sound financial management to harness these changes in support of economic and social progress and sustainable development ,  
Document good practices , innovative models and success stories with respect to assisting women in improving their living and working environment , to the adoption of sound environmental technologies and to women 's role in maintaining sustainable urban environments under conditions of globalization and rapid urbanization , and propose ways of assisting them in that role ( UNIFEM , UNEP / UNCHS , World Bank , UNDP , UNESCO , DPCSD ) .  
It was agreed that the best means of conducting a systematic and methodologically sound comparative analysis of the question of firearms regulation in selected Member States would be by preparing and disseminating a well-constructed questionnaire , one that would be neutral in essence , accompanied by guidelines for the respondents .  
The objective of the initiative undertaken by the Netherlands and Switzerland is to facilitate dialogue and exchange experiences regarding national needs assessment as a supporting tool for the improved utilization of environmentally sound technologies in the transition towards sustainable development , in particular in developing countries and in countries in economic transition .  17 / 1996 / 1 .  
Bearing in mind the rapid pace and interdependence of global , political , social and economic developments , and their implications for all countries , particularly the developing countries , and that there is a critical need for improved efficiency and effective public institutions , administrative procedures and sound financial management to harness these challenges in support of sustainable development in all countries ,  
An appropriate economic framework based on sound macroeconomic policies , a well-developed infrastructure , strengthened institutions and capacity , as well as meeting basic human needs such as shelter , and providing social welfare , were recognized as key factors for addressing the poverty problem .  
To strengthen the institutional , human resources and policy-making capabilities of Governments and communities in order to foster the effective planning and management of natural resources ; to promote an iterative and multisectoral approach to water resources management that integrates technological , socio-economic , environmental and human health considerations and involves local initiatives and participation in such development efforts ; and to formulate policies on mineral resources that encourage environmentally sound production practices ;  
I should like to inform you that United States warplanes operating from bases in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are continuing to violate the airspace of the Republic of Iraq and are engaging in acts of reconnaissance , breaking the sound barrier and dropping heat flares over public and private property in the north and south of Iraq , causing damage and spreading alarm among the civilian population .  
We fully believe that through mutual good will , realism and observance of international commitments , the tendencies aiming at the maintenance of tension in the region will be defeated and a sound political decision in favour of peace and stability and our good multi-purpose relations with the fraternal Republic of Tajikistan will prevail , and no place will be left for the exchange of such notes where wisdom and common sense stand firm .  
Measures to enhance socio-political stability and good governance and to secure sound macroeconomic policies that will be conducive to private foreign and domestic investment should be strongly encouraged .  
With regard to the external debt , it is also relevant to point out the Declaration of the Support Group for Nicaragua of 16 April 1996 , which considers that , within the framework of a sound and responsible macroeconomic policy that encourages domestic savings , resources released as a result of a comprehensive approach to the debt problem should be used to support productive and social development .  Alleviation of the external debt burden would thus help to eliminate widespread poverty among the Nicaraguan population .  
Their central objectives are to improve the economic position of members , whether individuals or enterprises , denied access to other banking institutions owing to their inability to offer sufficiently sound collateral ; to facilitate the continual recycling of cooperative capital into cooperative enterprise ; and to attract and manage capital obtained from outside the cooperative sector for use by individual cooperatives .  
National capacities , especially in developing countries , must be urgently strengthened not only to implement sustainable forest management but also to collect and compile reliable data for monitoring the sustainability of forest management at the national level and to ensure that the information generated is relevant , scientifically sound and technically valid . 
The third session of the Commission and the first session of the Panel emphasized the need to explore and consider ways to address the areas relating to the transfer and development of environmentally sound technology on favourable terms as mutually agreed and the mobilization of financial resources to assist developing countries in pursuing policies and comprehensive strategies for achieving sustainable forest management , taking into account the ongoing work of the Commission and other relevant processes .  
Reaffirming that investment in people is as vital as investment in capital , they called for paying special attention to sound basic education , skill formation and training , which is a lifelong undertaking , and improving the transition from school to work ;  
It stressed the need to implement sound and stable macroeconomic , microeconomic and sectoral policies that encouraged broad-based , sustained economic growth and development , and called upon the international community to seek to mobilize additional financial resources that were both adequate and predictable to contribute to poverty eradication .  
The objective of eradicating absolute poverty required a broad range of policies and actions at all levels : an appropriate economic framework based on sound macroeconomic policies ; a well-developed infrastructure ; strengthened institutions and capacity ; as well as programmes designed to meet basic human needs ;  
The major tasks to be addressed in the post-election phase of Bosnia and Herzegovina 's economic development include , inter alia , rapid installation of State institutions , implementation of sound macroeconomic policies , adoption of a legislative framework conducive to the transition to a market economy and continuing the reconstruction efforts .  
Cancelled : ( ii ) compendium on human settlement-related interventions in the control of vector-borne diseases in urban areas ; ( iv ) strategies for environmentally sound energy management in urban areas of sub-Saharan Africa ; and ( viii ) compendium of sustainable disposal techniques for septate and pit-latrine waste .  
They emphasized with grave concern that , while the Conference , Agenda 21 and other international instruments on environmental subjects invoked a new spirit of partnership and cooperation , four years after the Conference the required new and additional financial resources had not been allocated and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on concessional and preferential terms , scientific and technical cooperation and the appropriate dissemination of information had not materialized .  
Expert seminars have been held on the effects of racism and racial discrimination on the social and economic relations between indigenous peoples and States ( Geneva , 1989 ) , on schemes of internal self-government for indigenous peoples ( Nuuk , 1991 ) , on practical experience in the realization of sustainable and environmentally sound self-development of indigenous peoples ( Santiago , 1992 ) , and on practical experiences regarding indigenous land rights and claims ( Whitehorse , 1996 ) .  
Despite considerable efforts , the Commission had been unable to balance viewpoints and to catalyse decisive action by the international community , not only on financial resources but also on other cross-sectoral issues such as the transfer of environmentally sound technologies , economic instruments for sustainable development and the relation between international trade and the environment . 
Firstly , it had been recognized that the relatively favourable economic situation was not a fortuitous outcome , but the product of many years of hard work and sacrifice in pursuit of sound economic policies at both the national and international levels .  
UNIDO played an active role in the implementation of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer , was an authority on environmentally sound industrial development and promoted direct contacts between government officials and representatives of the private sector on a global level .  
Calls upon the international community , and financial institutions , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
To initiate action , including consultations with Parties and relevant international organizations , inter alia , taking into account the ongoing work of the Climate Technology Initiative , to identify existing technology information activities and needs , with a view to developing options for building on existing specialized information centres and networks to provide fast and one-stop databases relating to state-of-the-art , environmentally sound and economically feasible technology and know-how in a manner that would be readily accessible to developing countries .  
The recommendation was based on the following needs : " ( a ) to better identify priorities for action at the global level to promote conservation and sustainable use of the marine environment ; ( b ) for better coordination among the relevant United Nations organizations and intergovernmental financial institutions ; ( c ) to ensure sound scientific , environmental , economic and social advice on these issues . "  
We hope that the effective cooperation between the two organizations in the field of the gradual development and codification of international law and in other areas of common concern can be further enhanced so that a positive contribution can be made to the promotion of friendly cooperation among countries , the maintenance of world peace and security , common prosperity for all societies , and the achievement of a just and sound new international order based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference .  
Accordingly , the Governments role should be confined to its core functions , namely creating a sound legal and macroeconomic framework , protecting the environment , ensuring order and security and providing infrastructure , education , social protection and essential public services .  
Notes that while sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country to promote macroeconomic stability are essential elements for determining the volume and structure of private capital flows , international macroeconomic policies play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness , and should contribute to creating a favourable international economic environment ;  
He also welcomed the work accomplished by the Special Committee at its most recent session with regard to the formulation of guiding principles for the establishment and conduct of peacekeeping operations and the consideration of practical steps to ensure that future peacekeeping operations would have a sound logistical and financial basis .  
Calls upon the international community , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on those environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
In order to address these concerns and to reach the goal of economically efficient , socially balanced and ecologically sound sustainable forest management , the experts call upon the Governments , private sector and investment community , multilateral international organizations , non-governmental organizations and the voluntary sector to recognize their shared responsibility and to take urgent action as follows :  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Also stresses that implementation of sound domestic monetary , fiscal and structural policies over the medium term , including ensuring of sound banking systems , is required to promote financial and exchange rate stability ;  
Noting also that the future course of net transfer of resources to developing countries depends on a growth-oriented and supportive international economic environment and on sound domestic economic policies ,  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions , and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
These included macroeconomic stability , high rates of domestic saving , maintenance of sound financial intermediaries , high priority given to human resource development ( especially to high _ quality primary and secondary education ) , competitive exchange rates , export orientation , a supportive environment which rewarded entrepreneurship and allowed open and constructive dialogue between government and the private sector regarding objectives and policies , and governance which balanced the promotion of social cohesion and consensus with that of competition between individuals and companies .  
The representative of the Republic of Korea identified the following crucial components of the East Asian development experience : political and economic stability , which could only be fully ensured by sound domestic governance ; an export orientation with export promotion ; capital accumulation financed both domestically and from abroad ; the upgrading and importation of new technology and the development of overseas marketing skills ; balanced enterprise development ; and human resource development , at the level of both skilled workers and advanced education .  
PRANDLER ( Hungary ) said that the word " ecosystems " should be defined in article 2 and that article 20 could be further strengthened by including three additional elements , namely : the prevention , reduction and control of pollution ; the need for ecologically sound and rational water management , conservation of water resources ( including freshwater systems ) and environmental protection ; and the conservation and , where necessary , the regeneration of the ecosystems of international watercourses , as already proposed by the Venezuelan representative with the support of others .  
Calls upon the international community , and financial institutions , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;

Notes that while sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country to promote macroeconomic stability are essential elements for determining the volume and structure of private capital flows , international macroeconomic policies play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness , and should contribute to creating a favourable international economic environment ;  
A number of major causes of the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina have yet to be removed and it is only the continuing sound international presence , both military and civilian , that can prevent the resumption of hostilities even on a minor scale .  
The commitment of the developed countries to ensure an adequate flow of financial resources and the transfer of environmentally sound technology , which were crucial in order for the developing countries to implement Agenda 21 , had been left unfulfilled .  
These are to enable disadvantaged groups , young people and refugees to establish themselves in the housing market ; improve the existing housing conditions , especially for persons living under poor , cramped conditions ; adapt housing to the needs of the elderly and the handicapped ; and the building of ecologically sound houses and residential environments .  
While it is recognized that States have the primary responsibility in securing a sound and stable national political , economic and social environment for development , international support , at the request of interested Governments , and the creation of a favourable international economic environment are crucial ingredients in this effort .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
This requires adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including on concessional and preferential terms as mutually agreed , and promoting fair and non-discriminatory trading arrangements .  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
As Mali sees it , any work towards sustainable development is above all a national responsibility , through the effective definition and application of sound macroeconomic policies , based on transparency , the pre-eminent rule of law , the practice of democracy , respect for human rights , social justice , and the participation of all in the effort of national development .  
At the national level , sound fiscal and monetary policies that foster broadly based long-term growth should be strengthened and promoted .  
For many of today 's major environment and development concerns , the sciences ( including the social and human sciences ) are essential in detecting and analysing the problem , in identifying solutions and in ensuring scientifically sound action .  This has been particularly evident for the ozone depletion issue , and increasingly also for other issues such as climate change , erosion of biological diversity and water and coastal pollution .  
The establishment and functioning of the Commission on the Strengthening of the Justice System should provide the country with a historic opportunity to undertake , based on a broad debate , a judicial reform that meets society 's tremendous need for an independent , professionally sound justice system which can restore public confidence .  
In its reply the Government of Angola confirmed its interest in the Commission resolution , underlined the difficulties faced in controlling its maritime and riverine coasts which risk being transformed into dumping sites for toxic wastes , and finally requested technical assistance in order to implement an environmentally sound policy . 
The Special Rapporteur ventures to remind them that there can be no lasting peace in Burundi until an equitable solution is found to the crucial problem of power _ sharing between the minority and majority on a concrete and realistic basis , providing the minority with sound and genuine guarantees and ensuring that the rights of the majority are firmly respected , in order to overcome the deep _ rooted socio _ economic inequalities from which Burundi society continues to suffer .  
Calls upon the international community , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on those environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
Noting also that the future course of net transfer of resources to developing countries depends on a growth-oriented and supportive international economic environment and on sound domestic economic policies ,  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
The main objectives of the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources Development will be to promote regional and subregional cooperation for sustainable development and to strengthen national capacities in the field of the environment , including integration of environmental concerns into development strategies , in line with the provisions of Agenda 21 and other subsequent decisions ; development and management of natural resources , including water , mineral and energy resources ( excluding infrastructural aspects of electric power ) ; diffusion and management of environmentally sound technologies ; space technology applications ; and natural disaster reduction .  
Recognizing that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential in achieving sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , and that North-South and South-South transfer of environmentally sound technologies is essential for sustainable development , and recognizing also that the fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their sustainable development requirements has not materialized ,  
Also considering that in spite of the commitments made at Rio by the industrialized countries to facilitate transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries and to provide new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , the progress has been very disappointing ,  
Decide to work towards evolving principles based on sound management of hazardous wastes so as to develop national policies to phase out toxic agricultural and industrial chemicals and trade in hazardous waste ;  
Governments are needed to create the conditions that will allow consistent and realistic goals to be developed and met goals that are based on good science and the sound assessment of risk , and which balance ecological , economic and social objectives .  
The transfer of environmentally sound , economically viable and socially acceptable technologies to developing countries relevant to combating desertification and / or mitigating the effects of drought , with a view to contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in affected areas , should be undertaken without delay on mutually agreed terms . "  
An essential component of an enabling environment for development is sound national macroeconomic policies and the creation of favourable conditions for investment and increased domestic savings , including through the creation of a sound banking system .  
The international community could contribute to the implementation of the sustainable development programmes required for economic and social progress in the developing countries by providing financial and technical support to those countries and facilitating access to environmentally sound alternative technologies .  
All three of these operational programmes are supporting the development of environmentally sound , renewable sources of commercial energy with demonstrated viability and the improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources .  
Whilst a sound and stable macroeconomic and microeconomic policy was essential , basic transport , power and telecommunications infrastructure were identified as the most important physical elements , coupled with mechanisms for encouraging investment in the processing industries , for promoting the provision of export credit and trade finance , for ensuring the control of product quality and for building managerial capacity .  
A public sector that is either too weak or too large can lead to serious ethnic , religious , political and economic conflicts , undermining sound governance and efforts to promote human development .  
Accordingly , when we constantly stress the overriding need for compliance with the principle of parallelism between the sale of petroleum and the provision of the food , medicine and other humanitarian needs included in the procurement and distribution plan , we do so for sound legal and logical reasons , since the proceeds from the sale of petroleum is to be used to purchase supplies with a view to distributing them quickly to the entire population of Iraq , thereby ensuring that all the elements of resolution 986 ( 1995 ) are implemented simultaneously .  
The decision concerning the sound management of chemicals adopted by the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme at its nineteenth session [ 29 ] should be implemented in accordance with the agreed timetables for negotiations on the conventions relating to prior informed consent and persistent organic pollutants .  
The transfer to developing countries of environmentally sound , economically viable and socially acceptable technologies relevant to combating desertification and / or mitigating the effects of drought , with a view to contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in affected areas , should be undertaken without delay on mutually agreed terms .  
External assistance for building the requisite infrastructure and for national capacity-building , including human and institutional capacity , and for facilitating access to information on sustainable development practices and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies , in accordance with paragraph 34.14 ( b ) of Agenda 21 , is crucial for small island developing States to effectively attain the goals of the Programme of Action .  
The international community should promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
The creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
Similarly , the international community 's assertions of true partnership with Africa in the face of failing official development assistance and impossible debt repayments to mention just two major constraints may soon sound hollow unless that partnership manifests itself in concrete programmes of action .  
A considerable contribution to strengthening security in the Mediterranean could be made by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , which has accumulated sound experience in drawing up and implementing joint steps by participating countries to strengthen security and cooperation in the military-political , economic , humanitarian and other spheres that could also be drawn on for resolving Mediterranean problems .  
While it is recognized that States have the primary responsibility for securing a sound and stable national political , economic and social environment for development , international support , at the request of interested Governments , and the creation of a favourable international economic environment are crucial ingredients in this effort .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
This requires adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including on concessional and preferential terms as mutually agreed , and promoting fair and non-discriminatory trading arrangements .  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
For the developed countries , those responsibilities included a sound global financial system , open trade and investment regimes and consistent and sustained growth in the advanced economies .  
Development called for the private sector to act as the engine of sustained economic growth , in partnership with the public sector , which played a crucial role in basic infrastructure and services and in establishing and maintaining sound macroeconomic policies , protecting human rights and the environment and creating a conducive legal environment for private investment and entrepreneurship .  
In order for developing countries to be able to attract private capital flows , they must maintain good governance , sound macroeconomic policies and close , cooperative working relations with international financial organizations .  
The objectives of this project are to help to formulate sound human development policies through : ( a ) the preparation of national human development reports , combined with an annual regional human development report ; and ( b ) the development of improved statistics on human development indicators , including reports on social trends by countries , the latter in close cooperation with ECE . 13 .  Subregional workshops will bring together specialists responsible for national human development reports and from the national statistical offices .  
The main needs of developing countries with respect to EMS and ISO 14001 include assistance in awareness building , access to information , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , technical and financial support for participation in the development of international standards , infrastructure requirements including through assistance in the development and implementation of related legislation , the training of local auditors and consultants , sharing experiences on implementing EMS , and support for SMEs .  
Those efforts would be in vain unless effective and sound development policies at the national level were supported by non-discriminatory economic relations and a favourable international economic environment .  
Expressing its concern that a number of developing countries , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , have become more vulnerable to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate of private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Noting that the globalization of financial markets can generate new risks of instability , including interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations , which have the potential to aggravate the volatility of short-term capital flows and to adversely affect the international financial system , requiring all countries to pursue sound economic policies and to recognize the external economic impact of their domestic policies ,  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Also recognizes the importance of ensuring transparency and accountability at the national level to achieve policy credibility and confidence-building as well as sound regulatory and supervisory arrangements so as to strengthen the domestic financial system , and further recognizes the importance of a stable international economic environment and stability in the international monetary system ;  
Participation requires a guarantee of the rule of law and fair judicial procedures in order to reduce the likelihood of decisions that are arbitrary , corrupt and biased , which in turn requires a sound legal environment , including an independent judiciary with adequate resources .  
Stressing , given the fact that much of the most advanced environmentally sound technology is developed and held by the private sector , that the creation of an enabling environment on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private-sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries , as affirmed by the General Assembly in paragraph 90 of the annex to its resolution S / 19-2 of 28 June 1997 ,  
Continued support from a robust and credible NATO-led military force will not least be crucial to a successful completion of IPTF 's efforts to restructure , retrain and reform the local police and judicial system in Bosnia in order to help them handle public security in a manner which is professionally sound , democratic and observant of human and minority rights .  
These are : to enable disadvantaged groups , young people and refugees to establish themselves in the housing market ; to improve the existing housing conditions , especially for persons living under poor , cramped conditions ; to adapt housing to the needs of the elderly and the handicapped ; and to build ecologically sound houses and residential environments .  
The key elements for attaining sustainable economic development are a sound policy framework that encourages stable growth , a vigorous private sector , the strengthening of institutional and legal foundations and , last but not least , good-governance and anti-corruption measures .  
The objectives are the following : the continuation and consolidation of the process of democratizing political and social life ; the increased participation of the citizens in political , economic and social life and in making decisions that concern them ; the establishment of sound rules of government ; the promotion of the private sector ; the development of human resources ; and the restoration and safeguarding of environmental equilibrium and of the ecosystem , with special attention being paid to environmental problems related to human activities .  
A growing number of countries on our continent , including my own country , Ethiopia , have taken decisive measures to liberalize their economies , to cut Government spending , to institute sound macroeconomic policies and to enhance the role of the private sector and civil society .  
In the United States , we have raised the minimum wage , expanded tax credits for working families and reduced the federal deficit , all of which provide the basis for investment , growth and job creation .  The lesson we have learned is that a flexible job market that facilitates mobility , an economy open to competition and sound monetary and fiscal policies implemented by a Government that is representative , transparent and accountable , all contribute to the creation of jobs .  
Article VII of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) and paragraphs 5 , 6 and 7 of the Principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament proclaimed at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the NPT established a sound legal foundation for creating new international nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of agreements freely entered into between the appropriate States for the purposes of strengthening peace and security on the global and regional levels .  
In addition to national systems of financial regulation , international standards are also needed to promote sound financial principles and practices and avoid destructive competition and inconsistency between countries .  Such international standards should be developed through the existing international bodies that coordinate financial regulation and supervision .  
The political process of establishing and maintaining sound long-term development policies tends to be most successful when the Government has a strong legislative position , visionary leadership , and a united economic policy team .  
While national systems of regulation and control are essential prerequisites for financial stability and sustained capital flows , international standards are needed to promote sound principles and practices and to avoid competition and inconsistency between countries .  
Those objectives are set out relative to the following five programme areas : ( a ) increasing the availability of food , feed and renewable raw materials ; ( b ) improving human health ; ( c ) enhancing protection of the environment ; ( d ) enhancing safety and developing international mechanisms for cooperation ; and ( e ) establishing enabling mechanisms for the development and environmentally sound application of biotechnology .  
Policy makers in developing countries are faced with the dilemma of choosing between long-term solutions through technology transfer and capacity-building , including through cooperative arrangements with developed countries , and short-term solutions utilizing conventional methods and improvements of their information and management practices .  9 .  Essential for success in developing capabilities in the safe and sound use and management of biotechnologies appear to be the establishment of relevant research and development programmes , fostering research potential through a steady supply of qualified personnel , making investment capital available and providing private-sector incentives to invest in biotechnology .  
Constraints include : ( a ) scarcity of human and financial resources ; ( b ) low institutional capacity ; ( c ) lack of coherent realistic policies in some countries , and on occasions lack of political will ; and ( d ) inadequate awareness and understanding of the potential benefits and risks of the technology , as well as of the requirements for its environmentally sound management .  
There is a growing need to integrate urban needs with those of the surrounding rural , or once rural areas ; to assess changes in the peri-urban areas in response to rapid urbanization ; to prepare strategies to meet the concentrated demands for food , energy and various material goods ; to ensure that urban development proceeds in an environmentally sound manner ; and to involve all stakeholders in urban development projects .  
The following important common policy approaches are emerging in the promotion of SARD : ( a ) the use of economic incentives to guide sustainable agricultural practices ; ( b ) education and information exchange for human development ; ( c ) the development and transfer of new and appropriate technologies ; ( d ) farm and off-farm employment for alleviating poverty ; ( e ) sound natural resource management leading to environmental protection ; and ( f ) focusing on men and women farmers themselves .  
Developing countries are concerned that private capital flows are concentrated in a few developing countries ( 12 countries accounted for about 80 per cent of total private flows and three quarters of FDI in developing countries during the first half of the 1990s ) , mostly middle-income countries in Asia ( which accounted for about two thirds of the expansion of total private flows ) and Latin America that have adopted outward-looking strategies and sound macroeconomic policies .  
Programme area A ( Promoting sustainable development through trade ) includes among its policy objectives : ( a ) promote an open , non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system ; ( b ) promote access to markets for exports of developing countries ; and ( c ) improve the functioning of commodity markets , and achieve sound , compatible and consistent commodity policies at the national and international levels with a view to optimizing the contribution of the commodity sector to sustainable development , taking into account environmental considerations .  
Even in some low-income countries that are pursuing sound policies , their low level of development - characterized by structural rigidities , weak institutions and administration , poorly functioning markets and deficiencies in skills and infrastructure - have prevented a rapid and strong response to reform efforts , which may delay the provision of relief under the initiative . 
Fourthly , unilateral internalization at the producer 's level could be beneficial especially in the long run , but short-term costs and the uncertainty about foreign exchange earnings , global commodity demand , and socio-economic implications are formidable constraints58 as they have been in the removal of trade barriers . 59 Intergovernmental cooperation is therefore likely to be important to encourage internalization at the producers level and facilitate the reflection of these producer prices in international commodity prices and / or provide finance for environmentally sound processing methods . 
This role was manifested at two levels : at the macro level in terms of creating an enabling environment , good macroeconomic policies , a sound legal , regulatory and tax framework and political stability ; and at the micro level inter alia through providing appropriate support measures and structures and investing in capacity _ building , including in the areas of education , training and health .  It could create an environment in which the private sector knew what was happening .  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Also stresses that implementation of sound domestic monetary , fiscal and structural policies over the medium term , including ensuring sound banking systems , is required to promote financial and exchange rate stability ;  
External assistance for the building of requisite infrastructure and national capacity-building , including human and institutional capacity , and for facilitating access to information on sustainable development practices and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies is crucial for small island developing States to effectively attain the goals of the Programme of Action .  
Hence , renewed commitment is needed from developed countries to promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , the access to and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies ( ESTs ) and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private-sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
Expresses its conviction of the importance of sound , inclusive development strategies to avoid conflict and dislocation , recognizes the value of international cooperation , peacemaking and peacekeeping efforts , and stresses the need for the international community to continue to assist those countries receiving refugees in coping with the resulting economic , social , humanitarian and environmental challenges ;  
In the interests of equity , binding commitments for non-Annex I Parties could not even be envisaged until agreement had been reached on a fair system of apportionment of emission limits , a globally agreed reduction pathway and a projected sustainable future emission level on an equitable basis , and until there was reliable and predictable financial provision for the acquisition and adaptation of sound technologies , know-how and production systems in developing countries .  
A sound peace agreement which is generally accepted by the parties as a fair and just compromise respecting basic human , political and economic rights is the best basis for subsequent efforts to disarm , demobilize and reintegrate combatants .  
The most effective means of reducing poverty is the adoption of national development strategies , including sound macroeconomic and structural policies , which encourage sustainable growth that increases income-earning opportunities for the poor and develop the human resources of the poor , particularly through broad access to education , health and family planning services .  
In response to an initiative at the Lyon Summit of the Group of Seven , a Working Party of the Group of Ten and emerging market economies is developing , with the support of all relevant institutions , a concerted international strategy to promote the establishment , adoption and implementation of sound principles and policies needed for financial stability . 
While it is recognized that States have the primary responsibility in securing a sound and stable national political , economic and social environment for development , international support , at the request of interested Governments , and the creation of a favourable international economic environment are crucial ingredients in this effort .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .

Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
In this regard , the Netherlands stated that institutional and human capacity , a reliable regulatory and a supportive legal system , as well as stable and sound macroeconomic policies , were among the central building blocks to attract domestic and international capital to finance development .  
The decision concerning the sound management of chemicals adopted by the Governing Council of UNEP at its nineteenth session24 should be implemented in accordance with the agreed timetables for negotiations on the conventions relating to prior informed consent ( PIC ) and persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) .  
The transfer to developing countries of environmentally sound , economically viable and socially acceptable technologies relevant to combating desertification and / or mitigating the effects of drought , with a view to contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in affected areas , should be undertaken without delay on mutually agreed terms .  
External assistance for building the requisite infrastructure and for national capacity-building , including human and institutional capacity , and for facilitating access to information on sustainable development practices and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies , in accordance with paragraph 34.14 ( b ) of Agenda 21 , is crucial for small island developing States to effectively attain the goals of the Programme of Action .

The creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
Therefore , Member States , the developed nations in particular , international development organizations and the private sector must fulfil the commitments they undertook in Rio , especially in terms of the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the provision of financial and technical resources , with a view to creating an equitable , fair and just international economic and social environment that would ensure the incorporation of the efforts of the developing countries into the implementation of the overall strategies of sustainable development and environmental protection .  
A sound peace agreement that is generally accepted by the parties as a fair and just compromise respecting basic human ( political and economic ) rights is the best basis for subsequent efforts to disarm , demobilize and reintegrate combatants .  
Recognizing also that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms , and fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their huge sustainable development requirements ,  
His delegation looked forward to the special session of the General Assembly for the review of Agenda 21 , which it hoped would provide policy guidelines in the critical areas of sustainable development and adopt measures to achieve sustainable development goals , in particular through the provision of adequate financial resources , the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the creation of institutional mechanisms . 
A common vision had developed that sound financial and economic policies , including development of human resources and respect for human rights , good governance , individual initiative and the private sector , were critical to creating an environment conducive to economic growth , environmental sustainability and social equity .  
The explanation for that situation lay in the accumulation of such factors as poor physical infrastructure , a generally unskilled labour force , high levels of indebtedness , high inflation and small domestic markets , problems which the African countries must face up to by seeking to establish sound macroeconomic equilibrium and suitable infrastructure , and by investing in social programmes to promote the integration of their people in the global system .  
While his delegation supported the reform of the Economic and Social Council , the reform process would not solve all the problems facing the international community , since institutional reforms must be complemented by a sound resource base for implementing approved strategic and financial plans .  
Since debt problems varied considerably from country to country , debt relief measures needed to be adapted to the needs of each case ; to that end , through an evolving debt strategy , the international financial community had contributed significantly to the introduction of improvements in developing countries based on sound economic policies and programmes of adjustment and reform .  
That measure was important for what could be called a sound macroeconomic policy ; however , coordination proper , in the sense that countries jointly established monetary or fiscal policies , was a thing of the past , since it had proved to be ineffective , as had been indicated in the World Economic and Social Study , 1995 .  
The international conferences of the 1990s recognized the crucial role of the private sector , together with other actors of civil society , in achieving goals of economic , social and environmentally sound development .  
Therefore , we support the search for effective multilateral mechanisms to control international capital flows and monetary fluctuations in order to ensure fair competition and to organize financial transactions on sound and solid bases .  
They should pursue sound macroeconomic policies , strive to increase domestic savings and investment , strengthen institutional , legal , regulatory and supervisory capacities and improve economic management in the public and private sectors .  
The Special Committee had considered practical steps to ensure that future peacekeeping operations would have a sound logistical and predictable financial basis .  
Liberalization needed to be combined with sound and coherent domestic economic policies , the creation of effective judicial systems , the promotion of the rule of law and respect for the regulatory responsibility of Governments .  
There is now a growing understanding of the close and inevitable links between political liberalization , good and effective governance and a stable and sound environment for economic growth .  
Basic space science is a key to the prosperity of a nation and it is almost impossible to expect a country to have significant economic and social development without a sound educational and research base in the field of basic space science .  
His delegation believed that two factors were essential for that revitalization , namely , the adoption by developing countries of sound , sustained internal policies and the existence of a favourable global economic environment .  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
A sound financial sector , good governance , broad-based social investments , respect for human rights , and transparency in both the public and private sector were factors at the national level conducive to economic and social growth and development .  
The Committee noted that the improved economic performance of LDCs in recent years was mainly attributable to their own sound macroeconomic policy reforms , undertaken under most difficult domestic and external conditions .  
The Board noted that the improved economic performance of LDCs in recent years was mainly attributable to their own sound macroeconomic policy reforms , undertaken under most difficult domestic and external conditions .  
The Board noted that the improved economic performance of LDCs in recent years was mainly attributable to their own sound macroeconomic policy reforms , undertaken under most difficult domestic and external conditions .  
In this connection , we believe that the issues of trade and environment , access to the markets of the developed countries , direct foreign investment , access to environmentally sound technologies on concessional and preferential terms and official development assistance require concerted action by the international community .  
New and additional resources and environmentally sound technology were identified as the critical inputs for arresting worldwide environmental degradation and achieving sustained economic growth and the sustainable development of humankind .  
Governments must provide the political and legal framework for sound environmental management and for agricultural and industrial development policies that take into account current and foreseeable health needs .  
Because people are inspired by ideas , empowered by knowledge , and moved to change by greater understanding , WRI provides and helps other institutions provide objective information and practical proposals for policy and institutional change that will foster environmentally sound , socially equitable development .  
Mr . Beti ( Observer for Switzerland ) said that the area of activity of UNITAR was training and institutional capacity-building , which consisted of assisting developing countries and countries in transition to better understand international issues such as negotiation , the peaceful settlement of disputes , modern information and communications technologies , environmental development or sound financial management .  
From north to south and east to west , passing through Central Africa , the clash of arms and the sound of bombs effectively beat out the rhythm of daily life in that ailing continent .  
But implementation of these policies will have little impact on long _ term sustainable development , sound management of natural resources , or on the reduction of poverty and inequality unless accompanied by fundamental transformation of unjust economic and political structures both at national and global levels .  
Recognizes also the importance of appropriate policy responses to the challenges of globalization at the national level , in particular by pursuing sound and stable domestic policies , including , inter alia , sound macroeconomic and social policies , so as to realize the objective of the eradication of poverty ;  
The continuing Asian crisis , which was taking place in countries considered to have dynamic economies based on sound fundamental macroeconomic variables , had clearly shown that macroeconomic stability could not by itself ensure the level of stability that a sustained development-oriented industrial strategy required .  
Obviously , however , development of the private sector was impossible without support at the public level , which should include , inter alia , demonopolization , the introduction of tax incentives , a sound legal environment and the promotion of domestic and foreign investment .  
Even when political leaders have thoroughly good intentions , human rights norms as expressed in the Constitution and the international conventions need to be underpinned by sound legislation , an effective and independent judiciary and a non-partisan , professional police .  
In that connection , Tunisia supported the establishment of effective multilateral mechanisms to control international capital flows and currency fluctuations with the aim of ensuring fair competition and organizing financial operations on sound and solid bases .  
Until the causes of the current vulnerability of the international economy were determined , it should not be forgotten that the adoption of sound macroeconomic policies and the implementation of far-reaching institutional reforms were essential for the achievement of comprehensive and equitable social and economic progress .  
Some delegations expressed continued support for improving the operation of GESAMP , while noting at the same time that regional approaches were most practical for improving access to sound scientific understanding .  
On the contrary , it has always been considered a very sound way of providing guarantees to Salvadoran workers taking up offers of work abroad that are fraudulent or do not meet the conditions laid down in national legislation .  
Daily and weekly dissemination on tape , via satellite and / or shortwave broadcasting , telephone feeds and as sound files on the Internet to participating radio organizations in all regions of the world for local , national , regional and international broadcasting ( News and Media Division ) ; ii .  
The recent financial turmoil had shown that countries must maintain constant vigilance over all economic , financial and institutional parameters in order to guard against the volatility of other markets and contagion effects , and that each country needed not only sound macroeconomic fundamentals , but also a strong financial and banking system with adequate supervisory and regulatory mechanisms , transparency and good governance .  
The Programme is playing a catalytic role in the development of a comprehensive and reliable international monitoring mechanism , including the development of a scientifically sound yield assessment methodology and the determination of yield figures for selected countries to guide and assess the progress of measures implemented by the international community to eliminate or significantly reduce the illicit cultivation of cannabis , coca and opium poppy by the year 2008 .  
There was considerable emphasis on the need for improved scientific understanding of the marine environment as a fundamental basis for sound decision-making , improved human well-being and prevention of environmental degradation including in coastal areas .  
Aware of the increasing rate if illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in African and other developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
ACC stressed the critical importance of sound macroeconomic policies as well as economic reforms that balance growth with social investment for achieving accelerated and sustained economic growth , without which a sustained reduction in poverty is not possible .  
A UNIDO policy firmly aligned with the broad United Nations global agenda of sustainable human development and poverty reduction through UNIDOs programmatic focus on the three Es of sustainable industrial development : competitive Economy , productive Employment , and sound Environment , at the policy , institutional and enterprise level ;  
The main orientations of such a policy would include improving market transparency ; enhancing information flows to local operators , and in particular the capacity of these operators to analyse this information ; providing a sound , stable policy environment and legal and regulatory framework ; stimulating the emergence of support services ; and enabling access to modern marketing , risk management and financing instruments .  
Internal enabling environment : policy framework incentives for domestic private savings , equitable tax systems ( development and enforcement of ) , macroeconomic policies , disincentives to corruption ; good governance ; transparency ; effective regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector ; banking infrastructure , pension funds ; corporate governance ; internationally accepted accounting standards , and a sound legal system ( land and property rights ) ;  
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) : need to spread FDI more widely and to diversify private capital flows in order to reduce country / sector concentration , strengthened contribution of FDI for domestic capacity-building and national development goals , role of South-South flows , reasons for marginalization of countries with a sound investment environment ;  
Emphasizes the role of the international community and external assistance to developing countries and countries with economies in transition in improving the quality of information on the impact of urbanization on all aspects of sustainable development , in sharing of information on the use of economic instruments and in the transfer and dissemination of environmentally sound technology ;  
Having reviewed and shared experiences with tax reforms in their various countries , the Ministers agreed to reinforce macroeconomic stability and deepen financial market and institutional reforms , as well as to ensure sound interest and exchange-rate policy management so as to enhance private and public savings .  
We welcome the progress made through the chairmanship of the European Commission and the World Bank towards establishing a donor coordination process to develop a coherent international assistance strategy for the region , opening the door for all donor opportunities , as well as to mobilize additional financial support for reconstruction , regional integration , economic recovery and reform and to promote sound macroeconomic and structural policies by the countries concerned .  
In this era of heightened financial volatility , the importance of sound macroeconomic fundamentals has become paramount : a sustainable fiscal position and current-account balance , a low or moderate rate of inflation , and consistency between the rate of inflation and the exchange rate are indispensable for any economy , as all economies are open ( albeit to different degrees ) .  
The inspection covered two aspects : first on the basis of the reasoning that sound central services provide a logical staging ground for common services , the inspection examined how the central support services in areas included in the Secretary-Generals plan to strengthen common services had improved or otherwise effected changes in the work approaches that would enhance cost-effectiveness , quality of services delivered and timeliness .  
Rapid advances in technology , growing awareness of the need to preserve Earth and its environment , the increasing potential offered by space activities for economic and social benefits vis - - vis the urgent needs of the developing countries and the changes in the global political scene during the post-cold-war era are sound reasons to deliberate on the role of space in the development of humanity in the twenty-first century .  
It has been established that sound of a quality very close to the standard requirements for simultaneous interpretation can be reliably transmitted using the required number of ISDN links .  
The general principles are that : ( a ) in order to be both financially viable and of sufficient quality for simultaneous interpretation , communications for remote interpretation require the use of ISDN lines for the transmission of both audio and video ; and ( b ) under the International Standards Organization standards applicable to simultaneous interpretation equipment , the minimum sound bandwidth acceptable for interpretation purposes is 12.5 kHz .  
This encouragement demonstrated a conscious political will that recognizes the importance of women in this field in particular , based on sound principles whereby equality between men and women is the means and approach adopted and whereby the advancement of women is an eminent objective to be accomplished with the aim of achieving a free and equal society , as is the motivation of women to assume higher political office .

Aware of the increasing rate of illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
Another pillar of an enabling domestic environment is a sound macroeconomic framework , including , for example , sound budget priorities for health , education and agriculture / food security , and transparent and accountable public expenditure management and an efficient tax system .  
All countries must realize that the mobilization of domestic resources for development calls for a supportive environment in which sound macroeconomic policies are applied ( stabilization of public finance , control of inflation , use of effective and efficient mechanisms for the distribution of public expenditure ) and favourable conditions in which the private sector can grow .  
Other essential factors in promoting the mobilization of domestic resources for development are political stability , good governance and the rule of law , a sound and transparent legal system , guarantees for private investors , transparency in public administration , markets and companies , respect for contract law and private property , efforts to combat corruption at the national and international levels , the participation of citizens and civil society in public life , and equal access to resources for women and men .

National efforts to mobilize domestic financial resources should consolidate enabling domestic environments geared to promote growth with equity , through good governance , effective domestic institutions , the rule of law and sound macroeconomic , structural and social development policies that are gender - and environment-sensitive .  
These include the statements in the executive summary , conclusions and recommendations of the report that private firms are engaged because the United Nations agencies are short of resources ; or that firms from countries that have sound managerial principles are not used as often as others ; or that organizations appear to choose firms from certain countries because of the perception that such firms are more knowledgeable .  
Equally , it requires the definition of a clear and consistent set of public objectives , sound macroeconomic policies , efficient management of public revenue and expenditure , better allocation of resources and incentives to prevent capital flight and to encourage private savings and tax reforms , and a solid framework to implement stabilization or economic reform programmes .  
On the other hand , a high degree of consistency at the personal level is evident : individuals who have a more positive view of the quality of the visual and sound information available to them also feel less burdened by remote working conditions , and vice versa .  
We also recognize that , despite the positive effects that an enabling environment with good governance , sound macroeconomic policies and efficient management of public revenue and expenditure , can achieve in terms of mobilization of local resources , external finance , in particular ODA , will remain , for African countries , a critical resource for achieving the international development goals .

We also are determined to uphold the rule of law , the free market principles , clean and efficient government , sound and transparent regulations and prudent fiscal management , the hallmarks of our past success .  
" We are a model of sound economic management , with a free market operating under the rule of law , a well-regulated financial sector and a clean government that exercises prudence in its fiscal policies .

This saved the government money , gave the soldiers land to farm , established a sound foundation for agriculture , and even led to major accomplishments in terms of economic activities important to the daily life of the people ( such as salt and sugar production , water conservancy , and paddy cultivation ) .  
A radio in every handIn the future shortwave broadcasting may be no competition for satellite TV , with its combined impact of both sound and image . But every time a major international incident occurs , the number of shortwave listeners increases .  
At that moment the sound of weeping again drifted across from the dune , and she recognized her lover 's voice . Giving a loud cry of " Dune Boy , " Crescent Moon fell into a faint inside the palanquin . The bearers heard her cry , turned round to look , and shouted in surprise , " The bride 's fainted ! "  
The sound of gongs and drums gets nearer and nearer . We pass through a narrow lane , and a vision suddenly appears before our eyes , reflected in the light of fire - - a huge procession of people and horses . Some folks carry incense ; others are striking large gongs . Some are bearing little palanquins in which are seated statues of the village gods ; they excitedly crowd around Matsu 's seat of honor as it moves its way forward .  
With regard to this , some scholars early on suggested that medical histories , being a precious medical resource and crucial to human life , should be transferred along with the person , and should not be locked within the hospital . Ideal as this suggestion may sound , medical centers maintain the hesitant mentality of " if personal medical history is really opened up , wo n't there be endless medical controversies ? "  
As the situation threatened to get out of control , Hsu Hsiao-ming broke out in a cold sweat . Under a blazing sun in Chiayi 's Tungshih , a fishing boat going out to sea was to be filmed for Tropical Fish . Chen Yu-hsun anticipated that the film crew might get seasick , so he gave everyone a motion sickness pill before departure . Maybe someone bought the wrong pills - - true , no one got seasick , but everyone became so drowsy that they spent the entire day sound asleep .  
For instance , to the sound of Chinese flute music they would walk from one end of the practice hall to the other , on the way changing themselves into a seed which pushes its way out of the ground , then sprouts and flowers ; or into a prisoner in a deep dark dungeon who slowly crawls out to see the sunlight ; or a condemned man walking to the execution ground , who is struck by a bullet and falls down , but continues to struggle forward clutching his wound .  
On Mid-Autumn Festival in August of this year , with a light breeze and misty rain passing through the darkened evening sky , the sound of Chang Cheng-chieh 's violin resonates through the air outside the Confucius Temple in Taipei . Every morning , before the sky has lightened Father takes his lunchbox and rides off on his bicycle Leaving his abode , he heads to the river . . . . The unadorned but moving voice of poet Hsiang Yang weaves itself in and out of the violin strains , embroidering a romantic atmosphere . . . .  
Thirty years ago , an American director and cinematographer named Morton Heilig , inspired by 3-D films , had the " wild idea " of developing a " total illusion of reality " which would encompass sight , smell , motion , and sound . He declared that audiences would enjoy complete and realistic sensory stimulation .  
As for dialogue content , in addition to those traditional scripts that still sound fresh after a hundred listenings , some people have begun to offer up new creations in step with current times . And the language employed is no longer Beijing Mandarin with its heavily retroflexed consonants . In recent years , comic dialogues have imperceptibly gone through an unprecedented metamorphosis - - they are now often recited in local dialects .  
A well-designed domed facility should be highly flexible , with adjustable activity size , space , lighting , and sound . Also , to attract spectators , it must provide " full service , " including private boxes , food and beverage services , concessions to sell memorabilia , and so on . And to meet the needs of the press at major events , there must be TV broadcast facilities , a press box , darkroom , and phone and fax equipment .  
He faces a number of urgent problems . One is how to balance economic growth and environmental protection in a Taiwan that is densely crowded and has already suffered serious ecological damage and pollution . Another is how to create a sound investment environment that will keep local capital at home and attract foreign investment .  
Lin Yu-ping went the island to observe the troupe . Liu says that upon striking the drum , the whole wooden classroom resonated as if the room itself had been struck . The resultant sound , he recounts , can not be described as music , nor as rhythm , but rather as a direct assault upon one 's body , which " awakens your entire being . " The visitor is quite shaken by the experience .  
Ancient texts give us a glimpse of the many different occasions when such music was played . For instance , Shan Hai Jing ( The Classic of Mountains and Seas ) describes how the Yellow Emperor used the skin of a kui ( a legendary beast ) for a drum : " He struck it with the bones of the thunder-beast . The sound was heard 500 leagues , and terrified the whole world . " This is probably the earliest recorded example in Chinese history of the use of a war drum .  
When the white moon shines bright over silent mountains , and the wind in the pines is silent , poets still find inspiration : Wang Wei , hearing a rushing stream gurgle through jumbled rocks and flow away into the still depths of a pine forest , savored a pure sound which can not be found in the clamorous world of men .  
" Turning a corner , the bus had climbed to the height of the temperate forest . There was no longer the rustling of bamboo leaves ; through the windows came the sound of soughing pines , and both sides of the road were dark with Japanese red cedar , Taiwan red pine and Pinus morrisonicola . The treetops towered over the road , and serried ranks of trunks rushed by one after another . . . . "  
The sense of humor of Hong Kong people reached full expression here . One product offered was toilet paper printed like a calendar , with the days counting down to Chinese rule being torn off square by square to wipe somebody 's butt-Hong Kong people are sick and tired of hearing about the return ! A soft pillow covered with the character for " Communism " was guaranteed " to insure a sound sleep . "  
Later , a corrupt official threatens to expose Shao 's mistaken identity . The intense exchange between the two captivates the audience . When there is a pause that lasts a minute or so , there is not the slightest sound on stage or off , with only the faint whirr of the air conditioning disturbing the silence .  
" It seemed that wrapped up inside her blanket was a little printing press , printing sheet after sheet of warm , damp , pale yellow diapers . . . One began to hear the sound of hammers from our bedroom . We put up steel wires , one , two , three , four , five , six .  
Music critic Wang Hen only partly agrees with this assessment . He thinks Wong is a quite outstanding conductor , and that this year in particular he raised his game a notch . Moreover , his ability to coordinate each section of musicians is rare indeed ; otherwise it would be impossible to bring together musicians from different places , of different ages , and with different habits , and produce a quality sound in only a short rehearsal period .  
Having been left without parents when a child , Fang-liang was always the caring mother . Her husband was a strict father in the traditional mold . He would beat the children when they did something wrong , to the sound of Fang-liang imploring him to stop in her Ningbo dialect .  
When she had a big gash knocked in the back of her head , with her blood gushing out , the world moving in slow motion and the suddenly amplified sound of her heartbeat and breathing ringing in her ears , she did n't want go to a hospital because to save money she had n't bought health insurance . Meanwhile her friends were trying to staunch her bleeding while at the same time shaking her and shouting at her for all they were worth so as not to let her pass out . . . .  
Hau Pei-tsun , a former premier as well as chief of the General Staff , was a member of the armed forces for most of his career . Speaking about his experience as chief of the General Staff , Hau has stated that the military already has a perfectly sound procurement system , and that the important thing is the ethical standards of the officers in charge . If top generals get involved in politics and start engaging in tricky power plays , the military will naturally fall into disarray .  
Leaving behind the " real virtuality " of Taitien Temple 's heaven , the lush and verdant mortal world around us is vibrant with the sound of cicadas , and a light breeze caresses our skins . The ticket seller dozes peacefully after eating his packed lunch . Is he roaming through heaven in his dreams ?  
For example , popular legend has it that the wood in coffin shops emits sounds , which are the souls of the deceased coming to choose their own coffins . Lin explains , with scientific basis , that the sound comes from the wood drying and splitting under the northeast seasonal winds , and is completely unrelated to spirits .  
To avoid having their shares sold off , these tycoons , who were such able stock market operators when the economy was sound , had to devote their firm 's entire resources to defending their share price . This made it difficult to employ their capital effectively-they lived and died with the market .  
Such occurrences might sound like complete fantasy to someone who has never practiced martial arts before . Chan wants to try and use modern scientific methods to explain these phenomena . " I 've been fortunate enough to win medals . This good fortune has come about thanks to good karma from a previous existence . "  
All of a sudden you are drawn to a halt by the sound , which wafts down from an upper story , of a pipa being plucked , along with resonant , melancholy singing . For a moment it is as if you have stepped back several centuries in time . . . .  
There was a time when the gong was shunned by most professional musicians , who did n't want its loud , brash sound in their modern , air-conditioned concert halls . Even when it did make an appearance , the star of the show in boisterous outdoor temple parades was only allowed to make muffled hints at its real capabilities .  
He is especially appreciative of the way older folks take care of their gongs . In a temple parade , direct exposure to the hot sun can get a gong too hot and foul up its sound . When this happens , the old folks will wipe a gong with a wet cloth and wait for it to cool before striking it .  
Music also interferes with the contemplative process of liberating oneself from worldly concerns , and even Mahakasyapa , who always accompanied the Buddha , was unable to calm down when preaching to the lovely sound of a zither-while the other 500 divine beings present simply lost their heads and started dancing . When former music students take monastic vows they renounce forever their beloved pianos and violins , because everything makes way for the overriding priority of breaking the cycle of rebirth .  
Tribute candy , a blend of peanuts and maltose , was originally called " ground candy " in Fujian because the peanuts used in making it are ground continuously to give it the proper crumbly texture . The name changed on Kinmen because few of the ROC soldiers who secured the island understood the Fujianese word for " grind . " These soldiers instead took to calling the candy " tribute candy , " and the new name , which has a similar sound as well as conveying an air of imperial quality , stuck .  
And despite the surrounding hubbub , when the chiming guitar of the first track " At the Begin " welled up , accompanied by the sound of sea waves , my thoughts were quickly carried off to a beach at dawn , leagues away on the northeast coast of Taiwan , or a broad stretch of deep blue flooded with the sparkling silver light of the moon , possessed of nothing but the warmth and calm of the ocean , completely submerged in an instant .  
" Many scenes which reflected sensitive issues of the time may sound totally innocuous today , but back then they would bring knowing chuckles from audiences . " Hsin Chi says with a laugh that the way stories picked up on things people were angry about but dared not speak out over , created a mutually consoling sense of shared experience between actors and audience .  
After analyzing large quantities of recorded maroon oriole song , Chang divided the calls of the male bird during the mating season into five categories , according to their sound spectrum . They include a rough and rasping " a - , " a graceful whistle , a rapidly repeated " ga-ga-ga . . . " and so on .  
When applied to oceanography , the natural sound waves produced by the wind and currents create ambient noise , which is comparable to ambient light . An underwater target will perturb this ambient noise to produce " noisy " signals , just as ambient light reflects off objects in a room . Even though the ambient noise does not come from a specific source as in conventional sonar imaging , it can still " illuminate " objects .  
I want to emphasize that in the future Taiwan industry must , on the foundation of a sound manufacturing sector , continue to extend outward to the two ends of the " smiling curve , " moving toward a strategy of increasing added value , and producing smaller volumes of more diversified and differentiated products . There must also be movement toward upstream R &amp; D and innovation , as well as downstream marketing and distribution .  
For this reason , he has spent decades assiduously researching the " genes " of Chinese characters , to analyze the basic structure of Chinese writing on the basis of six essential factors : the characters ' constituent elements ; the sequence of those elements ; the shapes of the strokes and stroke combinations that make up the characters ; recognition features ; sound ( in those characters with a phonetic element ) ; and meaning . Using these factors , Chu hopes to make computers " understand " the concepts underlying the Chinese writing system .  
He enlarged the puppets , put more modern faces on them and dressed them in brighter costumes . He used dry ice and flash powder to create a variety of stage effects . He also made changes to the music , importing a sound system and making bold use of local pop stars and Western music to accompany his plays . His golden-light theater came to dominate puppetry and he himself rose to the top of his generation of puppeteers .  
When you enter the hamlet , on all sides you can see magnificent old trees piercing the sky , feel a fresh breeze , and hear the sound of birds chirping-and of nothing but birds chirping . In the moist heat of summer , it is like entering the proverbial Chinese " peach blossom paradise " and visitors from outside suddenly feel cool and relaxed .  
" Wellness centers " tout their ability to stave off aging , and woo customers with scented hot spring baths , quartz sound wave therapy , and whole-body pummeling with contoured mallets . They stress that these therapies can adjust slight lopsidedness or other deformations of the spine caused by modern people 's poor posture , thus restoring mental and physical balance .  
Mr . Lin , a writer who generally speaking is not averse to tuina massage , once went to a TCM traumatology clinic near his home for some skeletal manipulation . The hundred-square-meter clinic was packed full of patients , and in the middle were three reclining chairs attended a young tuina masseur . The masseur worked on Lin 's neck and back and rotated his shoulders and arms for 20 minutes . Lin heard the sound of his own joints cracking , and felt that his muscles had relaxed quite a lot .  
At present , 76 US medical schools offer courses in alternative medicine . In the international academic community , bioenergetic medicine organizations are holding frequent symposia , to take the first steps toward putting the field on a sound scientific footing . They have also begun active dialogue with practitioners of Chinese and Western medicine . It looks as if the health authorities in Taiwan ought not to completely ignore alternative medicine .  
Maybe drawing large crowds with deliberately staged events is a necessary measure to develop the tourism industry . But what if they are " full of sound and fury , but lacking in soul " ( in the words of Wang Chen-hua , director of a private school ) . Thus , for example , Pinghsi 's Sky Lanterns originally expressed respect for deities and spirits , but who can tell that these days , when any otherworldly atmosphere is smothered by the raging sounds of the pop bands doing outdoor shows during the event ?  
At 5 a.m . on June 13 , to the accompaniment of sonorous beiguan music , priests at the temple began to make a report to Heaven about the jiao , explaining the reasons for it and its scheduled itinerary . For three days running , from early in the morning to late at night , the sound of festive beiguan music with suona horns and gongs , as well as the loud and clear chanting of the Daoist priests , drifted from the main hall .  
A sound recycling regime is extremely important . " Chen gives an example : Taiwan 's paper recycling is quite successful , because traditional paper recycling businesses have existed for 30 or 40 years . They have not been displaced by societal changes , and have been fortunate to have their efforts be in lockstep with the new era of resource recycling . A virtuous circle has been created , not only making for an outstanding record with recycling , but also seeing vendors evolve from the use of street stalls to the construction of numerous recycling plants .  
Tang Yaw-chung , professor in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering , National Taiwan University , says that modern technology makes it very easy to copy sound and image data . The more personal data criminals are able to lay their hands on , the harder it is for ordinary people to differentiate between the genuine and the bogus , and the easier it is for them to be taken in .  
Before the morning dew on the pink petals of the mountain rambling roses has evaporated , and as the flowers ' soft , subtle fragrance arrests the steps of the passer-by , suddenly the sound of helicopter blades gets closer . Those on the ground directing the work shout to the others immediately to vacate the drop zone and get down as low to the ground as possible .

Starting as a small programme implemented jointly with UNEP to assist countries to implement the prior informed consent ( PIC ) procedure for chemicals in international trade , these programmes now increasingly address a wider spectrum of chemicals management topics , relevant to sound industrial development at both national and regional levels .  
" In addition to international developments related to the elaboration of the 1982 Convention , FAO continued to stress , in fisheries policy and technical advice provided to its developing members , that the implementation of conservation and management measures in exclusive economic zones would be unlikely to bring sustained long-term benefits in the absence of sound , reliable and cost-effective MCS systems . 
The implementation of a sound macroeconomic policy framework is seen as a key determinant of future financial stability and rapid economic recovery .  
The Division is responsible for establishing policies for environmentally sound and sustainable multi-sectoral development plans , the integration of environmental imperatives into the development process , the development of energy and natural resources and the reduction of natural disasters , taking into account technological and economic and demographic development .  
A strong expansion of agricultural production , internal stability , strong government commitments , a sound political and regulatory framework for development , complemented by significant external support , among other factors , have contributed to raising economic growth rates .  
Factors such as a strong expansion of agricultural production , internal stability , strong government commitments , a sound political and regulatory framework for development , complemented by significant external support , among other factors , have contributed to raising economic growth rates and have helped these countries to address some of the constraints facing their economies .  
Forum countries had increased their active participation in recent international and regional forums , in which they had emphasized the importance of maintaining sound environmental management practices and sustainable development .  
An increase in official development assistance , improved market access for export products , more equitable terms of trade , encouragement of foreign investments and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on a concessional and preferential basis would greatly facilitate the efforts of the developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , to implement Agenda 21 .  
Subject to the approval of that post by the General Assembly , the Secretary-General intends to appoint a Director with extensive experience and sound knowledge in procurement , logistics and contracting , including substantial managerial experience in these areas at the international level , as well as a proven ability and record of strategic planning .  
In 1968 the interdependence of human rights and development was reiterated more explicitly in the Proclamation of Tehran , 5 / which provides that the achievement of lasting progress in the implementation of human rights is dependent upon sound and effective national and international policies of economic and social development .  
The United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , which was the core of the system of operational activities , had provided assistance in such crucial areas as national capacity-building in management , governance and democratization , private sector development and economic reforms , human resources , the social sector and the development of environmentally sound energy sources .  
the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Governments bore the primary responsibility for formulating appropriate strategies , policies , programmes and actions to combat poverty ; the effort required sound macroeconomic policies , structural changes and the mobilization of domestic resources , inter alia , through more equitable tax regimes and a reduction in military expenditures .  
Stresses the need for finding effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of the poorest and most indebted developing countries and the importance of a full , constructive and expeditious implementation of the Naples terms , agreed upon in the Paris Club in December 1994 , for such countries , with a view to helping them exit from the rescheduling process on the basis of sound economic policies in those countries , thus contributing to the promotion of their prospects for resuming growth and development ;  
Calls upon the international community , particularly developed countries and international organizations , to fulfil all their commitments as affirmed in chapter 34 of Agenda 21 , 5 / in particular on the effective access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including new and emerging technologies and publicly owned technologies , to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries , so as to enable those developing countries to meet their development-related challenges ;  
Calls upon the international community to meet all the objectives as reaffirmed in chapter 34 of Agenda 21 , 15 / in particular those dealing with effective access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including new and emerging technologies and publicly owned technologies , to developing countries on favourable terms , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries , so as to contribute to enabling those developing countries to meet their development-related challenges ;

The Commission had concluded from a reappraisal of the principle and its application that the Noblemaire principle continued to be applicable and that the " best-paid national civil service " formula , combined with a reference check with international organizations , appeared to be sound , provided that the process was handled in a timely manner and the margin range realistically reflected comparator expatriation benefits and resulted in a competitive remuneration package .  
Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;

Even if it were assumed that globalization was an integral aspect of the normative structure of the established international economic system , the concerns expressed by the Group of 77 and others would seem to require additional antidotes , such as the establishment , for preventative purposes , of sound fiscal and monetary policies and early-warning systems , or normative counter-weights .  
Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;  
The 1990s have been a decade of political and economic upheaval throughout the world , and there has been an increasing tendency towards democratization and the participation of non-governmental actors in development , with a particularly strong emphasis on the need for good governance and for sound financial and economic policies at the national level and a greater reliance on market forces and on the private sector as basic requirements of development .  
Significant political and economic changes are taking place all over the world , characterized by , among other things , a growing concern for democratization and good governance , by the increasing resort to privatization and greater reliance on market forces , by an enhanced awareness of the need to mobilize domestic resources and reduce fiscal deficits , by growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes and by greater recognition of the need to ensure that development is not only sustainable but also environmentally sound .  
The main objective of the review was to obtain assurance that the assumptions used in the programme budget were based on sound financial and economic principles and to suggest refinements in budgetary techniques and modifications in format with a view to achieving realistic and transparent budgetary proposals .  
Our Organization , which was designed to respond to both global challenges and to the needs of its Member States , will not be able to play its double role in the coming century unless it can count on a sound , solid and stable financial basis .  
Aware that they are primarily responsible for promoting their own development through sound and consistent economic and social policies , the developing countries involved in structural adjustment programmes have made enormous sacrifices , which , unfortunately , have not yet achieved the desired results .  
A sound early warning system , combining political , military , humanitarian , human rights and economic areas , would broaden the base of options and enhance the chances for success in the early detection of conflict situations .  An early international monitoring presence in itself has a major deterrent effect .  
We are convinced that through prudent management of our very limited resources , a willingness on the part of our people to work hard and , on our part , clear political leadership and virtuously inspired guidance all enhanced by the support of friendly Governments and donor agencies we shall , in due course , place our country on a sound path towards genuine growth .  
Furthermore , my Government places particular emphasis on the needs of vulnerable groups , such as the disabled , in the process of social development , in the firm conviction that a genuinely sound and prosperous society can be realized only when all people , irrespective of their physical or mental disadvantages , are able to pursue a life of happiness and dignity based on stability and equality .  
Finally , sound monetary and fiscal policies implemented by a government which is transparent and accountable will also help to provide the confidence needed to attract private sector investment that is critical to growth and job creation . 
The definitive solution to the problem of the external debt , of ownership and of a considerable improvement in national , foreign and private investment , in the framework of a sound and responsible macroeconomic policy favouring internal savings and contributing to improving the standard of living of the Nicaraguan people , must be our goal .  
I should also like to reiterate the proposal made by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , President of the Republic of Tunisia , advocating the concept of a global economic and social plan aimed at guaranteeing African growth on sound and lasting bases and at assisting our continent to remedy its deficiencies , achieve integration into the world economy and ensure dignified living conditions for all peoples in Africa .  
This is being achieved through the pursuit of a sound and stable macroeconomic policy , supported by a prudent and disciplined fiscal and monetary stance , and the delivery of an investor-friendly institutional legal framework .  
Emphasizes the need to implement sound and stable macroeconomic , micro-economic and sectoral policies that encourage broad-based economic growth and development that is sustainable and equitable , that generate jobs and that are geared towards eradicating poverty and reducing social and economic inequalities and exclusion ;  
The favourable risk assessment was based on the generally sound macroeconomic policies and continued economic liberalization pursued by most Governments as well as the high rates of domestic investment and savings .  
This is based on existing data sets and uses two independent variables - general fertility rates and proportion of births that are assisted by a trained person - to predict values for countries with no sound national estimate of maternal mortality .  
They engaged in such hostile and provocative actions as breaking the sound barrier over civilian sites , dropping heat flares over agricultural land and intercepting and provoking Iraqi civilian vessels .

Stresses the need for finding effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of the poorest and most indebted developing countries and the importance of a full , constructive and expeditious implementation of the Naples terms , agreed upon in the Paris Club in December 1994 , for such countries , with a view to helping them exit from the rescheduling process on the basis of sound economic policies in those countries , thus contributing to the promotion of their prospects for resuming growth and development ;  
Apart from traditional telecommunications services , satellite technology had found increasing applications in rural telecommunications , direct and digital broadcasting ( sound and television ) and mobile telecommunications ( land , maritime and aeronautical ) , as well as in global computer networking .  
A vital element in the development and improvement of the Division is the appointment of a Director at the D-2 level with extensive experience and sound knowledge in procurement , logistics and contracting , including substantial managerial experience in these areas at the international level , as well as a proven ability and record of strategic planning .  
Calls upon the international community to meet all the objectives as reaffirmed in chapter 34 of Agenda 21 , 5 / in particular those dealing with effective access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including new and emerging technologies and publicly owned technologies , to developing countries on favourable terms , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries , so as to contribute to enabling those developing countries to meet their development-related challenges ;  
Our present objective is to achieve adequate shelter for all and especially for the deprived urban and rural poor through an enabling approach to the development and improvement of shelter that is environmentally sound .  
Apply transparent , comprehensive , easily accessible and progressive taxation and incentive mechanisms to stimulate the efficient , environmentally sound and equitable use of land , and exploit the full potential of land-based and other forms of taxation in mobilizing financial resources for service provision by local authorities ;  
The sustainability of the global environment and human life will not be achieved unless , among other things , human settlements in both urban and rural areas are made economically buoyant , socially vibrant and environmentally sound , with full respect for cultural , religious and natural heritage and diversity .  
The eradication of poverty requires , inter alia , sound macroeconomic policies aimed at creating employment opportunities , equal and universal access to economic opportunities ( and special efforts to facilitate such access for the disadvantaged ) ; education and training that will promote sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen productive employment and work , and basic social services , including health facilities . 
An integrated approach to the provision of environmentally sound infrastructure in human settlements , particularly for the rural and urban poor , is an investment in sustainable human settlements development that can enhance the quality of life , reduce negative impacts on the environment , improve the overall health of a population , and reduce the burden of investment in curative health and poverty alleviation . 95 bis .  
Promoting construction methods , materials and technologies that are affordable , safe , efficient and accessible and that emphasize greater use of local materials and human resources , that encourage and support design efficiency and energy-saving methods , and that are environmentally sound and protective of human health ;  
In general terms , sustainable forest management deals with the administrative , economic , social , legal , technical and scientific aspects of the conservation and sustainable use of forests within the framework of technically sound and politically accepted national land-use plans . 
Lack of implementation is partially attributed to lack of resources , expertise and political commitment and to insufficient availability of factual and scientific information on , for example , successional change and variables such as growth and yield of tree species under varying intensities of forest management , relationship between harvesting practices and forest ecosystem functions etc .  The lack of scientifically sound information is even more acute in relation to ecological processes on which increasing emphasis has been made in recent years .  
At its first session , the Panel re-emphasized the need to explore and consider ways to address the areas relating to the transfer and development of environmentally sound technology on favourable terms , as mutually agreed , and the mobilization of financial resources to assist developing countries in pursuing policies and comprehensive strategies for achieving sustainable forest management , taking into account ongoing work of the Commission and other relevant processes .  
Additionally , at the international level , commercial private-sector efforts to follow up UNCED are promoted by such groups as the International Network for Environmental Management in Germany and the Business Council for Sustainable Development ( BCSD ) in Switzerland . BCSD has established task forces on , inter alia , internalizing social and environmental costs in prices , and conducting a global study on the environmentally sound production and use of paper .  
The Commission made substantial progress at its third session in identifying and analysing various mechanisms and instruments for the financing of environmentally sound technologies ( ESTs ) , and it indicated that in its future work it would focus on improving the conditions for financing from external financial resources , facilitating access to traditional national financing mechanisms , and promoting innovative mechanisms for the financing of ESTs ( see E / CN . 17 / 1995 / 8 ) .  
A strong expansion of agricultural production , internal stability , strong government commitments , a sound political and regulatory framework for development , complemented by significant external support , among other factors , have contributed to raising economic growth rates .  
The Government of Cuba has sound and undeniable proof , from the legal and political points of view , that the acts of violation and aggression against Cuban airspace perpetrated for more than 35 years , and most recently by aircraft of " Brothers to the Rescue " , have had a subversive , hostile , aggressive and terrorist character .  
To integrate environment and development in the policies and practices of each country effectively , it is necessary to develop and implement integrated , enforceable and effective laws and regulations that are based on sound social , ecological , economic and scientific principles .  
Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;  
During the 1990s , dramatic political and economic shifts had been occurring throughout the world , marked by increasing tendencies towards democratization , greater reliance on market forces , greater emphasis on mobilizing domestic resources and reducing fiscal deficits , increasing privatization , growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes , and heightened recognition of the need to assure environmentally sound and sustainable development .  
The Andean Presidents take note of the sustained and financially sound growth of the Andean Development Corporation in the international sphere , to the point where it has become the primary source of financing for the Andean countries , supporting physical integration projects , private-sector development , increased trade and the procurement of resources in capital markets .  
The Committee may wish to consider these new approaches and perhaps recommend additional paths to pursue as regards the environmentally sound development of mineral resources for the purposes of implementing activities in the area of mineral resources , given the current budgetary constraints under which United Nations organizations are operating and pursuant to their specific mandates . 
Directly tied into this process has been the continued dissemination of individual country information through the very successful investment seminars and round-table discussions which have enabled private companies , financial institutions and technical advisers to gain a better understanding of various countries and their risk factors , and to develop good working relationships with private and government officials and the multilateral and bilateral aid institutions , all with a view towards creating a sustainable economic and environmentally sound base of operations on which to build within the various countries .  
In order to maintain public finances on a sound footing while simultaneously meeting social commitments , the Government implemented tax reforms by widening the tax base ; increasing tax rates ; restructuring tax brackets to increase progressivity of personal income tax ; and by raising excise taxes to finance an increase in pensions and educational spending .  
Bearing in mind the rapid pace of global economic developments and their implications for all countries , particularly developing countries , and the critical importance of efficient and effective government institutions , administrative systems and procedures , and sound financial management to harness these changes in support of economic and social progress and sustainable development ,  
Document good practices , innovative models and success stories with respect to assisting women in improving their living and working environment , to the adoption of sound environmental technologies and to women 's role in maintaining sustainable urban environments under conditions of globalization and rapid urbanization , and propose ways of assisting them in that role ( UNIFEM , UNEP / UNCHS , World Bank , UNDP , UNESCO , DPCSD ) .  
It was agreed that the best means of conducting a systematic and methodologically sound comparative analysis of the question of firearms regulation in selected Member States would be by preparing and disseminating a well-constructed questionnaire , one that would be neutral in essence , accompanied by guidelines for the respondents .  
The objective of the initiative undertaken by the Netherlands and Switzerland is to facilitate dialogue and exchange experiences regarding national needs assessment as a supporting tool for the improved utilization of environmentally sound technologies in the transition towards sustainable development , in particular in developing countries and in countries in economic transition .  17 / 1996 / 1 .  
Bearing in mind the rapid pace and interdependence of global , political , social and economic developments , and their implications for all countries , particularly the developing countries , and that there is a critical need for improved efficiency and effective public institutions , administrative procedures and sound financial management to harness these challenges in support of sustainable development in all countries ,  
An appropriate economic framework based on sound macroeconomic policies , a well-developed infrastructure , strengthened institutions and capacity , as well as meeting basic human needs such as shelter , and providing social welfare , were recognized as key factors for addressing the poverty problem .  
To strengthen the institutional , human resources and policy-making capabilities of Governments and communities in order to foster the effective planning and management of natural resources ; to promote an iterative and multisectoral approach to water resources management that integrates technological , socio-economic , environmental and human health considerations and involves local initiatives and participation in such development efforts ; and to formulate policies on mineral resources that encourage environmentally sound production practices ;  
I should like to inform you that United States warplanes operating from bases in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are continuing to violate the airspace of the Republic of Iraq and are engaging in acts of reconnaissance , breaking the sound barrier and dropping heat flares over public and private property in the north and south of Iraq , causing damage and spreading alarm among the civilian population .  
We fully believe that through mutual good will , realism and observance of international commitments , the tendencies aiming at the maintenance of tension in the region will be defeated and a sound political decision in favour of peace and stability and our good multi-purpose relations with the fraternal Republic of Tajikistan will prevail , and no place will be left for the exchange of such notes where wisdom and common sense stand firm .  
Measures to enhance socio-political stability and good governance and to secure sound macroeconomic policies that will be conducive to private foreign and domestic investment should be strongly encouraged .  
With regard to the external debt , it is also relevant to point out the Declaration of the Support Group for Nicaragua of 16 April 1996 , which considers that , within the framework of a sound and responsible macroeconomic policy that encourages domestic savings , resources released as a result of a comprehensive approach to the debt problem should be used to support productive and social development .  Alleviation of the external debt burden would thus help to eliminate widespread poverty among the Nicaraguan population .  
Their central objectives are to improve the economic position of members , whether individuals or enterprises , denied access to other banking institutions owing to their inability to offer sufficiently sound collateral ; to facilitate the continual recycling of cooperative capital into cooperative enterprise ; and to attract and manage capital obtained from outside the cooperative sector for use by individual cooperatives .  
National capacities , especially in developing countries , must be urgently strengthened not only to implement sustainable forest management but also to collect and compile reliable data for monitoring the sustainability of forest management at the national level and to ensure that the information generated is relevant , scientifically sound and technically valid . 
The third session of the Commission and the first session of the Panel emphasized the need to explore and consider ways to address the areas relating to the transfer and development of environmentally sound technology on favourable terms as mutually agreed and the mobilization of financial resources to assist developing countries in pursuing policies and comprehensive strategies for achieving sustainable forest management , taking into account the ongoing work of the Commission and other relevant processes .  
Reaffirming that investment in people is as vital as investment in capital , they called for paying special attention to sound basic education , skill formation and training , which is a lifelong undertaking , and improving the transition from school to work ;  
It stressed the need to implement sound and stable macroeconomic , microeconomic and sectoral policies that encouraged broad-based , sustained economic growth and development , and called upon the international community to seek to mobilize additional financial resources that were both adequate and predictable to contribute to poverty eradication .  
The objective of eradicating absolute poverty required a broad range of policies and actions at all levels : an appropriate economic framework based on sound macroeconomic policies ; a well-developed infrastructure ; strengthened institutions and capacity ; as well as programmes designed to meet basic human needs ;  
The major tasks to be addressed in the post-election phase of Bosnia and Herzegovina 's economic development include , inter alia , rapid installation of State institutions , implementation of sound macroeconomic policies , adoption of a legislative framework conducive to the transition to a market economy and continuing the reconstruction efforts .  
Cancelled : ( ii ) compendium on human settlement-related interventions in the control of vector-borne diseases in urban areas ; ( iv ) strategies for environmentally sound energy management in urban areas of sub-Saharan Africa ; and ( viii ) compendium of sustainable disposal techniques for septate and pit-latrine waste .  
They emphasized with grave concern that , while the Conference , Agenda 21 and other international instruments on environmental subjects invoked a new spirit of partnership and cooperation , four years after the Conference the required new and additional financial resources had not been allocated and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on concessional and preferential terms , scientific and technical cooperation and the appropriate dissemination of information had not materialized .  
Expert seminars have been held on the effects of racism and racial discrimination on the social and economic relations between indigenous peoples and States ( Geneva , 1989 ) , on schemes of internal self-government for indigenous peoples ( Nuuk , 1991 ) , on practical experience in the realization of sustainable and environmentally sound self-development of indigenous peoples ( Santiago , 1992 ) , and on practical experiences regarding indigenous land rights and claims ( Whitehorse , 1996 ) .  
Despite considerable efforts , the Commission had been unable to balance viewpoints and to catalyse decisive action by the international community , not only on financial resources but also on other cross-sectoral issues such as the transfer of environmentally sound technologies , economic instruments for sustainable development and the relation between international trade and the environment . 
Firstly , it had been recognized that the relatively favourable economic situation was not a fortuitous outcome , but the product of many years of hard work and sacrifice in pursuit of sound economic policies at both the national and international levels .  
UNIDO played an active role in the implementation of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer , was an authority on environmentally sound industrial development and promoted direct contacts between government officials and representatives of the private sector on a global level .  
Calls upon the international community , and financial institutions , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
To initiate action , including consultations with Parties and relevant international organizations , inter alia , taking into account the ongoing work of the Climate Technology Initiative , to identify existing technology information activities and needs , with a view to developing options for building on existing specialized information centres and networks to provide fast and one-stop databases relating to state-of-the-art , environmentally sound and economically feasible technology and know-how in a manner that would be readily accessible to developing countries .  
The recommendation was based on the following needs : " ( a ) to better identify priorities for action at the global level to promote conservation and sustainable use of the marine environment ; ( b ) for better coordination among the relevant United Nations organizations and intergovernmental financial institutions ; ( c ) to ensure sound scientific , environmental , economic and social advice on these issues . "  
We hope that the effective cooperation between the two organizations in the field of the gradual development and codification of international law and in other areas of common concern can be further enhanced so that a positive contribution can be made to the promotion of friendly cooperation among countries , the maintenance of world peace and security , common prosperity for all societies , and the achievement of a just and sound new international order based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference .  
Accordingly , the Governments role should be confined to its core functions , namely creating a sound legal and macroeconomic framework , protecting the environment , ensuring order and security and providing infrastructure , education , social protection and essential public services .  
Notes that while sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country to promote macroeconomic stability are essential elements for determining the volume and structure of private capital flows , international macroeconomic policies play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness , and should contribute to creating a favourable international economic environment ;  
He also welcomed the work accomplished by the Special Committee at its most recent session with regard to the formulation of guiding principles for the establishment and conduct of peacekeeping operations and the consideration of practical steps to ensure that future peacekeeping operations would have a sound logistical and financial basis .  
Calls upon the international community , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on those environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
In order to address these concerns and to reach the goal of economically efficient , socially balanced and ecologically sound sustainable forest management , the experts call upon the Governments , private sector and investment community , multilateral international organizations , non-governmental organizations and the voluntary sector to recognize their shared responsibility and to take urgent action as follows :  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Also stresses that implementation of sound domestic monetary , fiscal and structural policies over the medium term , including ensuring of sound banking systems , is required to promote financial and exchange rate stability ;  
Noting also that the future course of net transfer of resources to developing countries depends on a growth-oriented and supportive international economic environment and on sound domestic economic policies ,  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions , and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
These included macroeconomic stability , high rates of domestic saving , maintenance of sound financial intermediaries , high priority given to human resource development ( especially to high _ quality primary and secondary education ) , competitive exchange rates , export orientation , a supportive environment which rewarded entrepreneurship and allowed open and constructive dialogue between government and the private sector regarding objectives and policies , and governance which balanced the promotion of social cohesion and consensus with that of competition between individuals and companies .  
The representative of the Republic of Korea identified the following crucial components of the East Asian development experience : political and economic stability , which could only be fully ensured by sound domestic governance ; an export orientation with export promotion ; capital accumulation financed both domestically and from abroad ; the upgrading and importation of new technology and the development of overseas marketing skills ; balanced enterprise development ; and human resource development , at the level of both skilled workers and advanced education .  
PRANDLER ( Hungary ) said that the word " ecosystems " should be defined in article 2 and that article 20 could be further strengthened by including three additional elements , namely : the prevention , reduction and control of pollution ; the need for ecologically sound and rational water management , conservation of water resources ( including freshwater systems ) and environmental protection ; and the conservation and , where necessary , the regeneration of the ecosystems of international watercourses , as already proposed by the Venezuelan representative with the support of others .  
Calls upon the international community , and financial institutions , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;

Notes that while sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country to promote macroeconomic stability are essential elements for determining the volume and structure of private capital flows , international macroeconomic policies play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness , and should contribute to creating a favourable international economic environment ;  
A number of major causes of the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina have yet to be removed and it is only the continuing sound international presence , both military and civilian , that can prevent the resumption of hostilities even on a minor scale .  
The commitment of the developed countries to ensure an adequate flow of financial resources and the transfer of environmentally sound technology , which were crucial in order for the developing countries to implement Agenda 21 , had been left unfulfilled .  
These are to enable disadvantaged groups , young people and refugees to establish themselves in the housing market ; improve the existing housing conditions , especially for persons living under poor , cramped conditions ; adapt housing to the needs of the elderly and the handicapped ; and the building of ecologically sound houses and residential environments .  
While it is recognized that States have the primary responsibility in securing a sound and stable national political , economic and social environment for development , international support , at the request of interested Governments , and the creation of a favourable international economic environment are crucial ingredients in this effort .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
This requires adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including on concessional and preferential terms as mutually agreed , and promoting fair and non-discriminatory trading arrangements .  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
As Mali sees it , any work towards sustainable development is above all a national responsibility , through the effective definition and application of sound macroeconomic policies , based on transparency , the pre-eminent rule of law , the practice of democracy , respect for human rights , social justice , and the participation of all in the effort of national development .  
At the national level , sound fiscal and monetary policies that foster broadly based long-term growth should be strengthened and promoted .  
For many of today 's major environment and development concerns , the sciences ( including the social and human sciences ) are essential in detecting and analysing the problem , in identifying solutions and in ensuring scientifically sound action .  This has been particularly evident for the ozone depletion issue , and increasingly also for other issues such as climate change , erosion of biological diversity and water and coastal pollution .  
The establishment and functioning of the Commission on the Strengthening of the Justice System should provide the country with a historic opportunity to undertake , based on a broad debate , a judicial reform that meets society 's tremendous need for an independent , professionally sound justice system which can restore public confidence .  
In its reply the Government of Angola confirmed its interest in the Commission resolution , underlined the difficulties faced in controlling its maritime and riverine coasts which risk being transformed into dumping sites for toxic wastes , and finally requested technical assistance in order to implement an environmentally sound policy . 
The Special Rapporteur ventures to remind them that there can be no lasting peace in Burundi until an equitable solution is found to the crucial problem of power _ sharing between the minority and majority on a concrete and realistic basis , providing the minority with sound and genuine guarantees and ensuring that the rights of the majority are firmly respected , in order to overcome the deep _ rooted socio _ economic inequalities from which Burundi society continues to suffer .  
Calls upon the international community , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on those environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
Noting also that the future course of net transfer of resources to developing countries depends on a growth-oriented and supportive international economic environment and on sound domestic economic policies ,  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
The main objectives of the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources Development will be to promote regional and subregional cooperation for sustainable development and to strengthen national capacities in the field of the environment , including integration of environmental concerns into development strategies , in line with the provisions of Agenda 21 and other subsequent decisions ; development and management of natural resources , including water , mineral and energy resources ( excluding infrastructural aspects of electric power ) ; diffusion and management of environmentally sound technologies ; space technology applications ; and natural disaster reduction .  
Recognizing that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential in achieving sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , and that North-South and South-South transfer of environmentally sound technologies is essential for sustainable development , and recognizing also that the fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their sustainable development requirements has not materialized ,  
Also considering that in spite of the commitments made at Rio by the industrialized countries to facilitate transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries and to provide new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , the progress has been very disappointing ,  
Decide to work towards evolving principles based on sound management of hazardous wastes so as to develop national policies to phase out toxic agricultural and industrial chemicals and trade in hazardous waste ;  
Governments are needed to create the conditions that will allow consistent and realistic goals to be developed and met goals that are based on good science and the sound assessment of risk , and which balance ecological , economic and social objectives .  
The transfer of environmentally sound , economically viable and socially acceptable technologies to developing countries relevant to combating desertification and / or mitigating the effects of drought , with a view to contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in affected areas , should be undertaken without delay on mutually agreed terms . "  
An essential component of an enabling environment for development is sound national macroeconomic policies and the creation of favourable conditions for investment and increased domestic savings , including through the creation of a sound banking system .  
The international community could contribute to the implementation of the sustainable development programmes required for economic and social progress in the developing countries by providing financial and technical support to those countries and facilitating access to environmentally sound alternative technologies .  
All three of these operational programmes are supporting the development of environmentally sound , renewable sources of commercial energy with demonstrated viability and the improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources .  
Whilst a sound and stable macroeconomic and microeconomic policy was essential , basic transport , power and telecommunications infrastructure were identified as the most important physical elements , coupled with mechanisms for encouraging investment in the processing industries , for promoting the provision of export credit and trade finance , for ensuring the control of product quality and for building managerial capacity .  
A public sector that is either too weak or too large can lead to serious ethnic , religious , political and economic conflicts , undermining sound governance and efforts to promote human development .  
Accordingly , when we constantly stress the overriding need for compliance with the principle of parallelism between the sale of petroleum and the provision of the food , medicine and other humanitarian needs included in the procurement and distribution plan , we do so for sound legal and logical reasons , since the proceeds from the sale of petroleum is to be used to purchase supplies with a view to distributing them quickly to the entire population of Iraq , thereby ensuring that all the elements of resolution 986 ( 1995 ) are implemented simultaneously .  
The decision concerning the sound management of chemicals adopted by the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme at its nineteenth session [ 29 ] should be implemented in accordance with the agreed timetables for negotiations on the conventions relating to prior informed consent and persistent organic pollutants .  
The transfer to developing countries of environmentally sound , economically viable and socially acceptable technologies relevant to combating desertification and / or mitigating the effects of drought , with a view to contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in affected areas , should be undertaken without delay on mutually agreed terms .  
External assistance for building the requisite infrastructure and for national capacity-building , including human and institutional capacity , and for facilitating access to information on sustainable development practices and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies , in accordance with paragraph 34.14 ( b ) of Agenda 21 , is crucial for small island developing States to effectively attain the goals of the Programme of Action .  
The international community should promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
The creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
Similarly , the international community 's assertions of true partnership with Africa in the face of failing official development assistance and impossible debt repayments to mention just two major constraints may soon sound hollow unless that partnership manifests itself in concrete programmes of action .  
A considerable contribution to strengthening security in the Mediterranean could be made by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , which has accumulated sound experience in drawing up and implementing joint steps by participating countries to strengthen security and cooperation in the military-political , economic , humanitarian and other spheres that could also be drawn on for resolving Mediterranean problems .  
While it is recognized that States have the primary responsibility for securing a sound and stable national political , economic and social environment for development , international support , at the request of interested Governments , and the creation of a favourable international economic environment are crucial ingredients in this effort .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
This requires adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including on concessional and preferential terms as mutually agreed , and promoting fair and non-discriminatory trading arrangements .  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
For the developed countries , those responsibilities included a sound global financial system , open trade and investment regimes and consistent and sustained growth in the advanced economies .  
Development called for the private sector to act as the engine of sustained economic growth , in partnership with the public sector , which played a crucial role in basic infrastructure and services and in establishing and maintaining sound macroeconomic policies , protecting human rights and the environment and creating a conducive legal environment for private investment and entrepreneurship .  
In order for developing countries to be able to attract private capital flows , they must maintain good governance , sound macroeconomic policies and close , cooperative working relations with international financial organizations .  
The objectives of this project are to help to formulate sound human development policies through : ( a ) the preparation of national human development reports , combined with an annual regional human development report ; and ( b ) the development of improved statistics on human development indicators , including reports on social trends by countries , the latter in close cooperation with ECE . 13 .  Subregional workshops will bring together specialists responsible for national human development reports and from the national statistical offices .  
The main needs of developing countries with respect to EMS and ISO 14001 include assistance in awareness building , access to information , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , technical and financial support for participation in the development of international standards , infrastructure requirements including through assistance in the development and implementation of related legislation , the training of local auditors and consultants , sharing experiences on implementing EMS , and support for SMEs .  
Those efforts would be in vain unless effective and sound development policies at the national level were supported by non-discriminatory economic relations and a favourable international economic environment .  
Expressing its concern that a number of developing countries , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , have become more vulnerable to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate of private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Noting that the globalization of financial markets can generate new risks of instability , including interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations , which have the potential to aggravate the volatility of short-term capital flows and to adversely affect the international financial system , requiring all countries to pursue sound economic policies and to recognize the external economic impact of their domestic policies ,  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Also recognizes the importance of ensuring transparency and accountability at the national level to achieve policy credibility and confidence-building as well as sound regulatory and supervisory arrangements so as to strengthen the domestic financial system , and further recognizes the importance of a stable international economic environment and stability in the international monetary system ;  
Participation requires a guarantee of the rule of law and fair judicial procedures in order to reduce the likelihood of decisions that are arbitrary , corrupt and biased , which in turn requires a sound legal environment , including an independent judiciary with adequate resources .  
Stressing , given the fact that much of the most advanced environmentally sound technology is developed and held by the private sector , that the creation of an enabling environment on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private-sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries , as affirmed by the General Assembly in paragraph 90 of the annex to its resolution S / 19-2 of 28 June 1997 ,  
Continued support from a robust and credible NATO-led military force will not least be crucial to a successful completion of IPTF 's efforts to restructure , retrain and reform the local police and judicial system in Bosnia in order to help them handle public security in a manner which is professionally sound , democratic and observant of human and minority rights .  
These are : to enable disadvantaged groups , young people and refugees to establish themselves in the housing market ; to improve the existing housing conditions , especially for persons living under poor , cramped conditions ; to adapt housing to the needs of the elderly and the handicapped ; and to build ecologically sound houses and residential environments .  
The key elements for attaining sustainable economic development are a sound policy framework that encourages stable growth , a vigorous private sector , the strengthening of institutional and legal foundations and , last but not least , good-governance and anti-corruption measures .  
The objectives are the following : the continuation and consolidation of the process of democratizing political and social life ; the increased participation of the citizens in political , economic and social life and in making decisions that concern them ; the establishment of sound rules of government ; the promotion of the private sector ; the development of human resources ; and the restoration and safeguarding of environmental equilibrium and of the ecosystem , with special attention being paid to environmental problems related to human activities .  
A growing number of countries on our continent , including my own country , Ethiopia , have taken decisive measures to liberalize their economies , to cut Government spending , to institute sound macroeconomic policies and to enhance the role of the private sector and civil society .  
In the United States , we have raised the minimum wage , expanded tax credits for working families and reduced the federal deficit , all of which provide the basis for investment , growth and job creation .  The lesson we have learned is that a flexible job market that facilitates mobility , an economy open to competition and sound monetary and fiscal policies implemented by a Government that is representative , transparent and accountable , all contribute to the creation of jobs .  
Article VII of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) and paragraphs 5 , 6 and 7 of the Principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament proclaimed at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the NPT established a sound legal foundation for creating new international nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of agreements freely entered into between the appropriate States for the purposes of strengthening peace and security on the global and regional levels .  
In addition to national systems of financial regulation , international standards are also needed to promote sound financial principles and practices and avoid destructive competition and inconsistency between countries .  Such international standards should be developed through the existing international bodies that coordinate financial regulation and supervision .  
The political process of establishing and maintaining sound long-term development policies tends to be most successful when the Government has a strong legislative position , visionary leadership , and a united economic policy team .  
While national systems of regulation and control are essential prerequisites for financial stability and sustained capital flows , international standards are needed to promote sound principles and practices and to avoid competition and inconsistency between countries .  
Those objectives are set out relative to the following five programme areas : ( a ) increasing the availability of food , feed and renewable raw materials ; ( b ) improving human health ; ( c ) enhancing protection of the environment ; ( d ) enhancing safety and developing international mechanisms for cooperation ; and ( e ) establishing enabling mechanisms for the development and environmentally sound application of biotechnology .  
Policy makers in developing countries are faced with the dilemma of choosing between long-term solutions through technology transfer and capacity-building , including through cooperative arrangements with developed countries , and short-term solutions utilizing conventional methods and improvements of their information and management practices .  9 .  Essential for success in developing capabilities in the safe and sound use and management of biotechnologies appear to be the establishment of relevant research and development programmes , fostering research potential through a steady supply of qualified personnel , making investment capital available and providing private-sector incentives to invest in biotechnology .  
Constraints include : ( a ) scarcity of human and financial resources ; ( b ) low institutional capacity ; ( c ) lack of coherent realistic policies in some countries , and on occasions lack of political will ; and ( d ) inadequate awareness and understanding of the potential benefits and risks of the technology , as well as of the requirements for its environmentally sound management .  
There is a growing need to integrate urban needs with those of the surrounding rural , or once rural areas ; to assess changes in the peri-urban areas in response to rapid urbanization ; to prepare strategies to meet the concentrated demands for food , energy and various material goods ; to ensure that urban development proceeds in an environmentally sound manner ; and to involve all stakeholders in urban development projects .  
The following important common policy approaches are emerging in the promotion of SARD : ( a ) the use of economic incentives to guide sustainable agricultural practices ; ( b ) education and information exchange for human development ; ( c ) the development and transfer of new and appropriate technologies ; ( d ) farm and off-farm employment for alleviating poverty ; ( e ) sound natural resource management leading to environmental protection ; and ( f ) focusing on men and women farmers themselves .  
Developing countries are concerned that private capital flows are concentrated in a few developing countries ( 12 countries accounted for about 80 per cent of total private flows and three quarters of FDI in developing countries during the first half of the 1990s ) , mostly middle-income countries in Asia ( which accounted for about two thirds of the expansion of total private flows ) and Latin America that have adopted outward-looking strategies and sound macroeconomic policies .  
Programme area A ( Promoting sustainable development through trade ) includes among its policy objectives : ( a ) promote an open , non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system ; ( b ) promote access to markets for exports of developing countries ; and ( c ) improve the functioning of commodity markets , and achieve sound , compatible and consistent commodity policies at the national and international levels with a view to optimizing the contribution of the commodity sector to sustainable development , taking into account environmental considerations .  
Even in some low-income countries that are pursuing sound policies , their low level of development - characterized by structural rigidities , weak institutions and administration , poorly functioning markets and deficiencies in skills and infrastructure - have prevented a rapid and strong response to reform efforts , which may delay the provision of relief under the initiative . 
Fourthly , unilateral internalization at the producer 's level could be beneficial especially in the long run , but short-term costs and the uncertainty about foreign exchange earnings , global commodity demand , and socio-economic implications are formidable constraints58 as they have been in the removal of trade barriers . 59 Intergovernmental cooperation is therefore likely to be important to encourage internalization at the producers level and facilitate the reflection of these producer prices in international commodity prices and / or provide finance for environmentally sound processing methods . 
This role was manifested at two levels : at the macro level in terms of creating an enabling environment , good macroeconomic policies , a sound legal , regulatory and tax framework and political stability ; and at the micro level inter alia through providing appropriate support measures and structures and investing in capacity _ building , including in the areas of education , training and health .  It could create an environment in which the private sector knew what was happening .  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Also stresses that implementation of sound domestic monetary , fiscal and structural policies over the medium term , including ensuring sound banking systems , is required to promote financial and exchange rate stability ;  
External assistance for the building of requisite infrastructure and national capacity-building , including human and institutional capacity , and for facilitating access to information on sustainable development practices and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies is crucial for small island developing States to effectively attain the goals of the Programme of Action .  
Hence , renewed commitment is needed from developed countries to promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , the access to and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies ( ESTs ) and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private-sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
Expresses its conviction of the importance of sound , inclusive development strategies to avoid conflict and dislocation , recognizes the value of international cooperation , peacemaking and peacekeeping efforts , and stresses the need for the international community to continue to assist those countries receiving refugees in coping with the resulting economic , social , humanitarian and environmental challenges ;  
In the interests of equity , binding commitments for non-Annex I Parties could not even be envisaged until agreement had been reached on a fair system of apportionment of emission limits , a globally agreed reduction pathway and a projected sustainable future emission level on an equitable basis , and until there was reliable and predictable financial provision for the acquisition and adaptation of sound technologies , know-how and production systems in developing countries .  
A sound peace agreement which is generally accepted by the parties as a fair and just compromise respecting basic human , political and economic rights is the best basis for subsequent efforts to disarm , demobilize and reintegrate combatants .  
The most effective means of reducing poverty is the adoption of national development strategies , including sound macroeconomic and structural policies , which encourage sustainable growth that increases income-earning opportunities for the poor and develop the human resources of the poor , particularly through broad access to education , health and family planning services .  
In response to an initiative at the Lyon Summit of the Group of Seven , a Working Party of the Group of Ten and emerging market economies is developing , with the support of all relevant institutions , a concerted international strategy to promote the establishment , adoption and implementation of sound principles and policies needed for financial stability . 
While it is recognized that States have the primary responsibility in securing a sound and stable national political , economic and social environment for development , international support , at the request of interested Governments , and the creation of a favourable international economic environment are crucial ingredients in this effort .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .

Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
In this regard , the Netherlands stated that institutional and human capacity , a reliable regulatory and a supportive legal system , as well as stable and sound macroeconomic policies , were among the central building blocks to attract domestic and international capital to finance development .  
The decision concerning the sound management of chemicals adopted by the Governing Council of UNEP at its nineteenth session24 should be implemented in accordance with the agreed timetables for negotiations on the conventions relating to prior informed consent ( PIC ) and persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) .  
The transfer to developing countries of environmentally sound , economically viable and socially acceptable technologies relevant to combating desertification and / or mitigating the effects of drought , with a view to contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in affected areas , should be undertaken without delay on mutually agreed terms .  
External assistance for building the requisite infrastructure and for national capacity-building , including human and institutional capacity , and for facilitating access to information on sustainable development practices and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies , in accordance with paragraph 34.14 ( b ) of Agenda 21 , is crucial for small island developing States to effectively attain the goals of the Programme of Action .

The creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
Therefore , Member States , the developed nations in particular , international development organizations and the private sector must fulfil the commitments they undertook in Rio , especially in terms of the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the provision of financial and technical resources , with a view to creating an equitable , fair and just international economic and social environment that would ensure the incorporation of the efforts of the developing countries into the implementation of the overall strategies of sustainable development and environmental protection .  
A sound peace agreement that is generally accepted by the parties as a fair and just compromise respecting basic human ( political and economic ) rights is the best basis for subsequent efforts to disarm , demobilize and reintegrate combatants .  
Recognizing also that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms , and fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their huge sustainable development requirements ,  
His delegation looked forward to the special session of the General Assembly for the review of Agenda 21 , which it hoped would provide policy guidelines in the critical areas of sustainable development and adopt measures to achieve sustainable development goals , in particular through the provision of adequate financial resources , the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the creation of institutional mechanisms . 
A common vision had developed that sound financial and economic policies , including development of human resources and respect for human rights , good governance , individual initiative and the private sector , were critical to creating an environment conducive to economic growth , environmental sustainability and social equity .  
The explanation for that situation lay in the accumulation of such factors as poor physical infrastructure , a generally unskilled labour force , high levels of indebtedness , high inflation and small domestic markets , problems which the African countries must face up to by seeking to establish sound macroeconomic equilibrium and suitable infrastructure , and by investing in social programmes to promote the integration of their people in the global system .  
While his delegation supported the reform of the Economic and Social Council , the reform process would not solve all the problems facing the international community , since institutional reforms must be complemented by a sound resource base for implementing approved strategic and financial plans .  
Since debt problems varied considerably from country to country , debt relief measures needed to be adapted to the needs of each case ; to that end , through an evolving debt strategy , the international financial community had contributed significantly to the introduction of improvements in developing countries based on sound economic policies and programmes of adjustment and reform .  
That measure was important for what could be called a sound macroeconomic policy ; however , coordination proper , in the sense that countries jointly established monetary or fiscal policies , was a thing of the past , since it had proved to be ineffective , as had been indicated in the World Economic and Social Study , 1995 .  
The international conferences of the 1990s recognized the crucial role of the private sector , together with other actors of civil society , in achieving goals of economic , social and environmentally sound development .  
Therefore , we support the search for effective multilateral mechanisms to control international capital flows and monetary fluctuations in order to ensure fair competition and to organize financial transactions on sound and solid bases .  
They should pursue sound macroeconomic policies , strive to increase domestic savings and investment , strengthen institutional , legal , regulatory and supervisory capacities and improve economic management in the public and private sectors .  
The Special Committee had considered practical steps to ensure that future peacekeeping operations would have a sound logistical and predictable financial basis .  
Liberalization needed to be combined with sound and coherent domestic economic policies , the creation of effective judicial systems , the promotion of the rule of law and respect for the regulatory responsibility of Governments .  
There is now a growing understanding of the close and inevitable links between political liberalization , good and effective governance and a stable and sound environment for economic growth .  
Basic space science is a key to the prosperity of a nation and it is almost impossible to expect a country to have significant economic and social development without a sound educational and research base in the field of basic space science .  
His delegation believed that two factors were essential for that revitalization , namely , the adoption by developing countries of sound , sustained internal policies and the existence of a favourable global economic environment .  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
A sound financial sector , good governance , broad-based social investments , respect for human rights , and transparency in both the public and private sector were factors at the national level conducive to economic and social growth and development .  
The Committee noted that the improved economic performance of LDCs in recent years was mainly attributable to their own sound macroeconomic policy reforms , undertaken under most difficult domestic and external conditions .  
The Board noted that the improved economic performance of LDCs in recent years was mainly attributable to their own sound macroeconomic policy reforms , undertaken under most difficult domestic and external conditions .  
The Board noted that the improved economic performance of LDCs in recent years was mainly attributable to their own sound macroeconomic policy reforms , undertaken under most difficult domestic and external conditions .  
In this connection , we believe that the issues of trade and environment , access to the markets of the developed countries , direct foreign investment , access to environmentally sound technologies on concessional and preferential terms and official development assistance require concerted action by the international community .  
New and additional resources and environmentally sound technology were identified as the critical inputs for arresting worldwide environmental degradation and achieving sustained economic growth and the sustainable development of humankind .  
Governments must provide the political and legal framework for sound environmental management and for agricultural and industrial development policies that take into account current and foreseeable health needs .  
Because people are inspired by ideas , empowered by knowledge , and moved to change by greater understanding , WRI provides and helps other institutions provide objective information and practical proposals for policy and institutional change that will foster environmentally sound , socially equitable development .  
Mr . Beti ( Observer for Switzerland ) said that the area of activity of UNITAR was training and institutional capacity-building , which consisted of assisting developing countries and countries in transition to better understand international issues such as negotiation , the peaceful settlement of disputes , modern information and communications technologies , environmental development or sound financial management .  
From north to south and east to west , passing through Central Africa , the clash of arms and the sound of bombs effectively beat out the rhythm of daily life in that ailing continent .  
But implementation of these policies will have little impact on long _ term sustainable development , sound management of natural resources , or on the reduction of poverty and inequality unless accompanied by fundamental transformation of unjust economic and political structures both at national and global levels .  
Recognizes also the importance of appropriate policy responses to the challenges of globalization at the national level , in particular by pursuing sound and stable domestic policies , including , inter alia , sound macroeconomic and social policies , so as to realize the objective of the eradication of poverty ;  
The continuing Asian crisis , which was taking place in countries considered to have dynamic economies based on sound fundamental macroeconomic variables , had clearly shown that macroeconomic stability could not by itself ensure the level of stability that a sustained development-oriented industrial strategy required .  
Obviously , however , development of the private sector was impossible without support at the public level , which should include , inter alia , demonopolization , the introduction of tax incentives , a sound legal environment and the promotion of domestic and foreign investment .  
Even when political leaders have thoroughly good intentions , human rights norms as expressed in the Constitution and the international conventions need to be underpinned by sound legislation , an effective and independent judiciary and a non-partisan , professional police .  
In that connection , Tunisia supported the establishment of effective multilateral mechanisms to control international capital flows and currency fluctuations with the aim of ensuring fair competition and organizing financial operations on sound and solid bases .  
Until the causes of the current vulnerability of the international economy were determined , it should not be forgotten that the adoption of sound macroeconomic policies and the implementation of far-reaching institutional reforms were essential for the achievement of comprehensive and equitable social and economic progress .  
Some delegations expressed continued support for improving the operation of GESAMP , while noting at the same time that regional approaches were most practical for improving access to sound scientific understanding .  
On the contrary , it has always been considered a very sound way of providing guarantees to Salvadoran workers taking up offers of work abroad that are fraudulent or do not meet the conditions laid down in national legislation .  
Daily and weekly dissemination on tape , via satellite and / or shortwave broadcasting , telephone feeds and as sound files on the Internet to participating radio organizations in all regions of the world for local , national , regional and international broadcasting ( News and Media Division ) ; ii .  
The recent financial turmoil had shown that countries must maintain constant vigilance over all economic , financial and institutional parameters in order to guard against the volatility of other markets and contagion effects , and that each country needed not only sound macroeconomic fundamentals , but also a strong financial and banking system with adequate supervisory and regulatory mechanisms , transparency and good governance .  
The Programme is playing a catalytic role in the development of a comprehensive and reliable international monitoring mechanism , including the development of a scientifically sound yield assessment methodology and the determination of yield figures for selected countries to guide and assess the progress of measures implemented by the international community to eliminate or significantly reduce the illicit cultivation of cannabis , coca and opium poppy by the year 2008 .  
There was considerable emphasis on the need for improved scientific understanding of the marine environment as a fundamental basis for sound decision-making , improved human well-being and prevention of environmental degradation including in coastal areas .  
Aware of the increasing rate if illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in African and other developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
ACC stressed the critical importance of sound macroeconomic policies as well as economic reforms that balance growth with social investment for achieving accelerated and sustained economic growth , without which a sustained reduction in poverty is not possible .  
A UNIDO policy firmly aligned with the broad United Nations global agenda of sustainable human development and poverty reduction through UNIDOs programmatic focus on the three Es of sustainable industrial development : competitive Economy , productive Employment , and sound Environment , at the policy , institutional and enterprise level ;  
The main orientations of such a policy would include improving market transparency ; enhancing information flows to local operators , and in particular the capacity of these operators to analyse this information ; providing a sound , stable policy environment and legal and regulatory framework ; stimulating the emergence of support services ; and enabling access to modern marketing , risk management and financing instruments .  
Internal enabling environment : policy framework incentives for domestic private savings , equitable tax systems ( development and enforcement of ) , macroeconomic policies , disincentives to corruption ; good governance ; transparency ; effective regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector ; banking infrastructure , pension funds ; corporate governance ; internationally accepted accounting standards , and a sound legal system ( land and property rights ) ;  
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) : need to spread FDI more widely and to diversify private capital flows in order to reduce country / sector concentration , strengthened contribution of FDI for domestic capacity-building and national development goals , role of South-South flows , reasons for marginalization of countries with a sound investment environment ;  
Emphasizes the role of the international community and external assistance to developing countries and countries with economies in transition in improving the quality of information on the impact of urbanization on all aspects of sustainable development , in sharing of information on the use of economic instruments and in the transfer and dissemination of environmentally sound technology ;  
Having reviewed and shared experiences with tax reforms in their various countries , the Ministers agreed to reinforce macroeconomic stability and deepen financial market and institutional reforms , as well as to ensure sound interest and exchange-rate policy management so as to enhance private and public savings .  
We welcome the progress made through the chairmanship of the European Commission and the World Bank towards establishing a donor coordination process to develop a coherent international assistance strategy for the region , opening the door for all donor opportunities , as well as to mobilize additional financial support for reconstruction , regional integration , economic recovery and reform and to promote sound macroeconomic and structural policies by the countries concerned .

Aware of the increasing rate of illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
Another pillar of an enabling domestic environment is a sound macroeconomic framework , including , for example , sound budget priorities for health , education and agriculture / food security , and transparent and accountable public expenditure management and an efficient tax system .  
All countries must realize that the mobilization of domestic resources for development calls for a supportive environment in which sound macroeconomic policies are applied ( stabilization of public finance , control of inflation , use of effective and efficient mechanisms for the distribution of public expenditure ) and favourable conditions in which the private sector can grow .  
Other essential factors in promoting the mobilization of domestic resources for development are political stability , good governance and the rule of law , a sound and transparent legal system , guarantees for private investors , transparency in public administration , markets and companies , respect for contract law and private property , efforts to combat corruption at the national and international levels , the participation of citizens and civil society in public life , and equal access to resources for women and men .

These include the statements in the executive summary , conclusions and recommendations of the report that private firms are engaged because the United Nations agencies are short of resources ; or that firms from countries that have sound managerial principles are not used as often as others ; or that organizations appear to choose firms from certain countries because of the perception that such firms are more knowledgeable .  
Equally , it requires the definition of a clear and consistent set of public objectives , sound macroeconomic policies , efficient management of public revenue and expenditure , better allocation of resources and incentives to prevent capital flight and to encourage private savings and tax reforms , and a solid framework to implement stabilization or economic reform programmes .  
On the other hand , a high degree of consistency at the personal level is evident : individuals who have a more positive view of the quality of the visual and sound information available to them also feel less burdened by remote working conditions , and vice versa .  
We also recognize that , despite the positive effects that an enabling environment with good governance , sound macroeconomic policies and efficient management of public revenue and expenditure , can achieve in terms of mobilization of local resources , external finance , in particular ODA , will remain , for African countries , a critical resource for achieving the international development goals .
