A responsible person of an authoritative state organ pointed out the other day : If the work of changing debt into equity is successfully conducted , it can provide a healthy financial foundation for state banks and state enterprises in China and can help prepare them for meeting competitions from both domestic and overseas markets .  However , if the work of changing debt into equity turns out to be a failure , we will be unable to attain the desired goal of this policy ;  
Some people , violating party and state policy , insert their relatives and friends into the party and government organs , where they can all eat the " fiscal meal " ; thus the great majority of local fiscal funds are wasted on personnel , with the result that they are unable to make ends meet and their finances are all used up in idleness and eating , and this leads to unhealthy trends which persist despite repeated prohibition , thus increasing the masses ' burden and causing dissatisfaction among them .  
Nevertheless , Taiwan , being a typical hilly island and surrounded by the sea , is narrow in space and lacks strategic depth .  Crowded with 23-million people , the 36,000 square kilometer island is absolutely unable to resist forced entry by a power .  At the moment , the Taiwan authorities are going against the historical trend .  
Once , in an organized on-the-spot driving training , little banners , one after another , slowly transmitted commanding information , while more than 100 vehicles , in a noisy disorder , were unable to set out on time , which resulted in a delay of training time and frequent signs of accidents .  
At that time our country 's capacity for screening chemical compounds was less than one-tenth of that of a single US research institute .  Despite the circumstances , members of the project group were determined to carry out innovative research .  Eventually they triumphed over their powerful adversaries , smashed the preoccupation that " developing countries are unable to develop new drugs " and captured the world 's commanding height of developing the anti-malaria drug .  
Price cartel has drawbacks of monopoly - - it will mislead enterprises to escape competition and not to improve their efficiency , which has an adverse effect on improving enterprises ' management , upgrading their technology , saving efficient enterprises and eliminating poor ones , improving the overall quality of the entire industry , and on the overall development of the industry .  For this reason , it has been unable to correct using a market means the practice of redundant construction in the past .  
Just as some economists have analyzed , through the practice of proactive financial policies , China has withstood the impacts of the Asian financial crisis , achieved the sustained and relatively rapid national economic growth , created favorable conditions for promoting reform , exploiting the existing production capability , mitigating the contradiction with regard to employment , and maintaining social stability , and concentrated its energies on constructing a number of infrastructure facilities and accomplishing some major projects which were intended , but were unable , to be carried out for years .  
In the course of the operations , he discovered that some commanding officers were unable to take advantage of the terrain and surface features , but instead fought recklessly , causing huge casualties to their units .  Therefore , he resolutely assisted the direction of the units , breaking through the enemy positions with accurate tactical maneuvers .  
Now , the initial form of socialist market economy has been established , but the historical mission of social system transition remains to be completed .  For example , some enterprises are still unable to meet the development demands of market economy , the operating mechanism is not active , the capability for technical innovation is not strong ;  
People have come to see that as a regional vehicle for promoting an open trade and an economic and technological cooperation , APEC has been moving at an extremely slow pace in exercising its latter function , and is now unable to meet the economic development needs of its member states in this aspect ; as for its former function , due to an unduly fast speed in the past , APEC has now found it difficult to take another step forward .  
Some of them are overanxious for quick results and doing things on too large a scale , and they set a very high standard , making their training program look dynamic ; but in fact it is inappropriate , unable to achieve desired results .  
Under his fascination and his spell , how many wonderful families have been torn asunder , how many brilliant futures destroyed in a moment , the destinies of how many strong young men and beautiful young women destroyed ?  Even young girls and schoolboys are unable to escape .  
The self-immolation incident in Tiananmen Square is not merely Li Hongzhi 's stinging slap in the face to his disciples , but it should be said that the political intelligence of the anti-China forces in the West has sunk to so low a point that they are unable to tell black from white , and they willfully confuse right with wrong . 
Yang pointed out : With the deepening of the reform , the expansion of the opening up , and the establishment and development of a socialist market economic structure , China 's administrative and management structures have been reformed accordingly and marked results have been scored .  However , the problem of the current administrative and management structures being unable to completely meet the demands of the socialist market economy still exists .  
Although a number of developing countries or countries making an economic switch are practicing a market economy legal system , the market is unable to operate efficiently because the law and rule of law is not on a sound basis ; on the one hand lack of clarity in individual and enterprise property rights means that economic efficiency falls , contracts can not be effectively enforced , and disputes can not be settled in fair fashion ;  
The Pentagon is still sticking to its hardline stance , and has even again sent reconnaisance planes to carry out provocative activities ; apart from showing that the United States is unable to advance any further arguments to justify itself , it shows all the more the current US administration 's blind spots and total ignorance in foreign policy - - at least we have already seen that the diplomats involved in this affair are all military men who lack normal knowledge of foreign affairs , and even lack essential knowledge of Chinese humanity and history .  
A Communist China official confirmed that since 18 March last year , Chang Yung-fa , who is an adviser to President Chen Shui-bian , had been unable to visit the mainland due to political reason .

Wherever blockades are organized and superior goods from outside are unable to enter , the consumers there can only buy inferior local products , and so their interests are damaged , while the protected inferior enterprises have no intention of improving themselves , and are ultimately bound to be mercilessly knocked out in market competition ;  
Jeb , who had attempted to ignore rumors about him in the public , was finally unable to hold himself back and declared that he was absolutely loyal to his wife and they had helped each other even when they were in humble circumstances for 27 years and that the sex scandal about him and Henderson was " a terrible lie , " which might have been used to serve political purposes .  
In the event that the provincial ( regional , and municipal ) and city party committees are unable to call such a plenary meeting , their standing committees may call a similar meeting to decide on the matter .  However , before deciding on the matter , the standing committees concerned should solicit views from the members of the party committees concerned .  
If this situation is not resolved , people will be unable to clearly distinguish between the problems of national position , the independence and reunification issue and values of political parties and ideology , and will be unable to understand that free and democratic human rights can not supersede the framework of national sovereignty and the integrity of territory .  The DPP government of Chen Shui-bian can not let go of their evil intentions in the form of a coalition government .  
However , since the DSP satellites are unable to effectively sound an early warning against an incoming tactical ballistic missile , are excessively dependent on a ground station , and are likely to sound a false alarm , and even an alarm in case of fire , the US Defense Department eventually decided in 1995 to phase out the DSP system and substitute it with an " air-based infrared early warning system " called SBIRS .  
Seeing that the US MD plan was getting the cold shoulder throughout international society , with even NATO unable to reach unanimous agreement on supporting US implementation of the plan , Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi hastened to make some major changes in his previous attitude , that the US missile plan was " very meaningful research . "  
Mu Xiudong , political commissar of a missile brigade of the Second Artillery Corps , said during a discussion that without emancipating its mind and seeking truth from facts - - a spirit of exploring a scientific theory in an in-depth manner - - the party would have been unable to acquire major theoretical innovations , the Chinese nation would have been unable to achieve independence and liberation , building socialism with Chinese characteristics would have been impossible , and there would not have been such powerful national defense as we have today .  
Japan would have difficulty achieving a genuine sentimental reconciliation with its Asian neighbors , and Japan 's international image also would constantly be damaged if it should be unable to lay down this heavy burden on its own by correctly approaching history and properly handling historical issues .  
Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " heretical cult have the decisive nature of brutally injuring and killing people and causing grave harm to the state and the people .  However , with the pressure from the general populace and public opinion , this cult has been unable to completely expose itself and unwilling to let society and its practitioners understand the truth ; still less it dares to confront miserable facts .  
In fact , they are " deadlocks to be resolved . "  While intensifying efforts to publicize the issues of reducing and eliminating poor countries ' debts , the current G-8 summit was unable to implement any new and concrete measures to further reduce and eliminate poor countries ' heavy foreign debts even though $ 53-billion of foreign debts have been accumulatively reduced or exempted from 23 poorest countries in the world .  
If we treat only the symptoms , not the root cause , we would not only be unable to consolidate the achievements that have been made in the rectification and improvement , but also lose such achievements altogether .  When that happened , the offense of making and selling counterfeit products would rear its ugly head again and may even become worse .  Therefore , firstly , the legislative work concerning market regulation should be strengthened and perfected .  
Fourthly , while shoddy commodities are exposed , it is also necessary to publish and inform the public of the results of tests performed on quality commodities , to support the good and eliminate the bad , let the proper prevail over the improper , protect and support the development of advanced productive forces , and make counterfeit and shoddy commodities unable to find a foothold in the market . 
Even after winning their political independence , developing countries were still unable to achieve economic independence and an equal position in the international market ; as a result , the irrational North-South relationship has formed in which countries in the North have economically ( also politically to a considerable extent ) controlled and exploited developing countries in the South , the North has become increasingly rich , and the South increasingly poor .  
Had we been conservative , restrained by the routine , and not brave enough to do anything , we would still be suffering from the restraints of " two any-and-alls " and caught in endless discussions on whether this or that is " socialist " or " capitalist . "  We would be unable to blaze this new trail of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Nevertheless , due to the development of economic construction , some articles of " The Regulations " have grown outdated for the purpose of protecting pipelines and facilities , becoming unable to ensure a forceful crackdown on the relevant unlawful or criminal behaviors , such as seizing , sabotaging , stealing , and looting pipelines and facilities .  
For example , the health of Tang Yao-ming has become a political issue because of his position .  When the media learned that he underwent surgery to remove his gallbladder , they sought confirmation from the military before reporting on it .  However , the military broke the news first by publishing Tang Yao-ming 's surgery on Ching-Nien Jih-Pao . Thus , the media were unable to break the news .  This struck a great fear into journalism and the media can no longer trust the directive to " confirm all matters through the spokesman . "

As may be seen from Chen Shuibian 's [ Ch'en Shui-pian ] inaugural speech on 20 May , this " minority leader " who took power with 39 percent of the popular vote is still hard-pressed to promote " Taiwan Independence " at present .  Under domestic and international pressure , he has forged compromises with all sides , and his government is presented with pretty wording and an academic wrapping .  However , all these are unable to conceal the consistently true nature of things .  
Patriotic scientists dedicated to the service of their country were unable to realize their goals .  Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party , all the people of China went through an arduous struggle and won national independence and people 's liberation by the middle of the 20th century .  The new China was established , creating the basic political conditions for the flourishing development of China 's science and technology and other such undertakings .

The trends of international development in recent yeas show that as the funds needed for investment in research and development have been doubled and redoubled , enterprises have been unable to innovate in products alone and that with the rapid renewal of knowledge and technology , it is difficult for enterprises , although with patents and intellectual property rights , to recover their investments in research and development in a short period of time before the appearance of other newer technologies .  
Following the growth of the DPP in Taiwan 's political arena , " Taiwan independence " thinkers seem to have felt that the simple slogan of " democracy and human rights " is rather of the grass roots , not comprehensive and profound enough , and difficult to attain the purpose of " winning maximum popular support . "  Besides , an extremely urgent matter for Chen Shui-bian after his inauguration is the debate over reunification and independence , which " democracy and human rights " seem unable to eliminate .  
The film exposes the disgraceful end of certain leading cadres who are unable to withstand the lure of desire for material things , fall into the abyss of evil , and embark on the path of crime , and reveals the ugly ways of corrupt elements in going all-out to rig up a network of connections , open a breach through people at the side of the leaders , and end up by dragging the leading cadres into the water .  
However , relevant departments are unable to find a single piece of evidence to support the case all this time , but are faced with constant public queries .  To get the government out of the predicament , the Justice Department and the FBI had to seek a compromise with Lee Wen-ho , asking Lee to plead guilty to a felony count of " improperly downloading classified information " in exchange for his personal freedom .  
Modern war is a huge war of attrition , and Taiwan 's limited arms will be used up very rapidly , whereas the mainland has tremendous potential for fighting a war of attrition , and this determines that Taiwan will be unable to wage protracted war with the mainland ; and given the consumption of large numbers of arms and men , Taiwan will not be able to sustain the fight for long and its armed forces will collapse .  
After the economically developed west , with its strong military forces , has been attacked and destroyed , Taiwan 's entire economic , political , and military systems will be in a state of chaos and paralysis , and no matter how strong the eastern defense base is , it will be unable to retrieve the war situation in the west .

Unless the Vatican treats China in an equal and proper way , reflects on the Catholic Church 's bullying of the Chinese people in history by relying on unequal treaties , and uncovers the crimes of Catholic scum in committing rape , loot , and massacre in China , and if it still intends to commemorate a time a century and a half ago when it rode roughshod over China , it can only make a mess of its relations with China and will be unable to obtain any advantage whatever .  
Designer Wang Huaiyi said that the research and development of a infrared remote sensor for space use is limited by the levels of a nation 's industrial , electronics , machining and other basic technologies .  If any one of these is unable to meet the demands of the project , the entire system will be impacted .  
Podrov , general manager of Russia Aeronautical and Astronautical Equipment Corporation , which is the manufacturer of Su-27 ' s electronic equipment , was attending an aviation exhibition in Zhuhai . Podrov said : The day before yesterday , I held talks with the relevant aviation and aerospace departments of China and learned that half of China 's Su-27 fighter planes purchased or imported several years ago are unable to conduct normal flight due to damaged electronic equipment on board .  
Dr . Zhao Jianglin pointed out : Judging from the present situation , the principal factors affecting the economic development in the ASEAN countries is the failure to set up a regional market so that they are unable to compete with the EU and other rivals .  In the future , the economies in the ASEAN countries will be regulated by stimulating domestic demand and enhancing efficiency .  
In order to suit the development of the market economy , they carried on diversified and multitrade operations in the past .  With their businesses expanded , they have exposed the weaknesses in the shortage of managerial personnel and decentralization of funds .  Therefore , they were unable to achieve the scale merit , the costs of raw materials were comparatively high , the operating costs were comparatively expensive , the prices of goods and services were less competitive , and the return rate on capital failed to reach the best level .  
He has indeed devoted great efforts to this end , and it was unexpected that large-scale bloody conflict would erupt at the last crucial moment , causing his efforts to fall short of success at the last ditch , so he would be unable to write a perfect ending to his diplomatic achievements .

Facts have proved : The Chinese Government is right in adopting the active fiscal policy ; that the results obtained from this active fiscal policy of floating more national bonds and invest the money in building more infrastructure projects are remarkable ; and that building more key projects and pooling the resources on building some large projects that China wanted to build but was unable to build can help economic restructuring , improve the quality of economic growth , and improve enterprises ' economic performance .  
Shu Huiguo , secretary of the Jiangxi province CPC committee , said : Currently , China 's conventional agriculture is being transformed into modern agriculture and the market of agricultural and sideline products is being transformed from one catering to basic living needs into one catering for things required for living a relatively comfortable life .  Therefore , we will be unable to achieve major development without adjusting the agricultural structure .  
People of all sectors of Taiwan have pointed out that the Chen Shui-bian government has bent on pursuing Taiwan independence and has been unable to adhere to a correct policy , resulting in conflicts between Taiwan 's ruling and opposition parties , social confrontations , economic recession , deteriorating social order , financial and economic crises , and political instability , and even the government has been unable to practice its policies .  
It is reported that the Social Welfare Department has cut the number of new recruits due to a slow down in the growth of social welfare spending this year , and this has resulted in a number of social service programmes failing to meet the set targets .

From operational experience , imported workers filled gaps in the labour market in respect of the jobs which local workers were unwilling or unable to undertake due to obnoxious job nature , distant workplace or the lack of relevant skills .  
The government has faced criticism about its economic forecasts .  Some have said - that we have been complacent , myopic , unable to keep track on development and inaccurate in our forecasts .  We estimate that GDP will contract about 4% in 1998 .  This is a substantial downward adjustment on the figures released in the Budget when the full scope of the Asian financial crisis was not yet known .  
Although the overall success rate remained roughly at the same level as last year 's , Professor Young explained that the number of proposals considered by the Council to be of sufficient academic quality to merit funding support , but were unable to be supported by the Council because of a lack of funds , increased by about 34 per cent to 432 proposals .

The financial system , in particular the banking system , is the foundation for economic growth , since a crippled financial sector will be unable to intermediate between savings and investments , thereby leading to prolonged liquidity crunch and inefficient allocation of resources . 
The Special Finance Scheme for Small and Medium Enterprises set up by the Government in 1998 has stopped accepting new loan applications since April 2000 .  Nevertheless , the credit guarantees approved prior to that date will not be fully discharged until May 2003 .

The much dwindled current account surplus was unable to offset the net outflow of funds in the financial and capital account , which was mainly led by a sharp reversal from net inflow to net outflow in the banking sector as net other investment outflow , outrunning the strong surge in net direct investment inflow and the significantly moderated net portfolio investment outflow .  
Giving up on the prospect , he went home , put it in his dresser , and went out for the evening . Later that night , Ch'en heard on the radio that the grand prizewinning number was the same as that on the section of tickets which he was unable to sell .

The seventh lunar month is hot and infectious diseases are rampant . To reduce contagion , ancient sages may have used " ghosts " to keep the people from going outside . Actually the sages ' actions would have been quite reasonable - - literate scholars might listen to arguments about contagion but the ignorant masses would be unable to understand .  
The little incident described below is a classic anecdote of the Yu family . When their eldest son was born in Washington , D . C . , Mrs . Yu 's mother was unable to come all the way to the United States and help her daughter with the month of recuperation and special diet required by Chinese tradition . Mother-in-law then wrote to son-in-law exhorting him to be sure to stew a chicken for the postpartum mother , to help her regain her strength .

From transient visitors who left their hometowns for a temporary stay there , they have made themselves into the sector of the populace with the most economic clout on the island , but owing to special historical and geographical factors , they have been unable to shake off the psychology of transience .  
In future things will be clearer , with free competition in agricultural production whereby prices will be fixed by supply and demand . Those unable to compete will be eliminated , while those who can will find a welcome market for their produce . In this way farmers ' labor , resources and investment will be directed towards higher added value products . Meanwhile ordinary farmers working smaller , weaker family farms will receive government aid , but this will be completely divorced from their production .  
We spoke frankly , I watched the meeting and the election , and I attended the dinner . The piece de resistance was the seminar I chaired . The discussion revolved around living in a foreign land , coming to terms with the new land and the old , where the future of China was headed and so forth . Everyone talked in full confidence , unable to stop , and the seminar did n't break up until one o'clock at night .  
Radio drama and other popular programs went into decline once TV began to air similar shows . From its peak in 1961 , radio listenership fell to an all-time low after the Chinese Television System hit the screens in 1971 . Not only did that familiar image of the family grouped around the radio set vanish , but one researcher at the time even found that many interviewees were unable to help with his survey for the simple reason that they never listened to radio at all .  
Ten years ago , to help children that have been unable to receive proper parental care because their families have suffered special problems or misfortunes , the R . O . C .

As an example , Den Chi-fu , a professor at National Chiao Tung University , cites India , which has strong basic science , produces many Ph . D.s and far exceeds us in the number of papers published in international academic journals , but which has been unable to raise the quality of life of its citizens , where the electronics industry has been developed for decades without ever getting off the ground and where many airports are still not computerized . . . . "  
I 'm sure the reason many overseas students go bad or give up on themselves is that they 're afraid of being unable to live up to their parents ' expectations , combined with the stress of living overseas and the pressure of getting ahead academically .  
The great Western tradition of management represented by the United States has encountered grave difficulties over the past 20 or 30 years . Under multicultural attack , the Protestant , capitalist camp has met with difficulties that it has been unable to adjust to and has had to search outside for inspiration , and the organic integration of the world economy has forced them to take a look at the rest of the world .  
Too much water for the pot : Such frequent switching was not really surprising considering there were 403 candidates fighting over 161 seats . With such a narrow chance of getting elected , even the well-oiled machine of the ruling Kuomintang ( KMT ) party was unable to smooth over the competing demands of its candidates .  
Confined to modern living spaces , most domestically-raised hawks look more like homeless puppies , " sitting listlessly in a tiny room , with sparse and thin feathers , always nervous and alert and ready to strike , but finding themselves tied down and unable to fly . "  
In line with this policy the Ministry of Justice has prepared an Anti-Corruption Plan , the four main aims of which are to make public officials " afraid to be corrupt , unable to be corrupt , unwilling to be corrupt and free of the need to be corrupt . "  
Explaining these four aims , Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou says that making people afraid to be corrupt takes strict laws ; making them unable to be corrupt takes comprehensive preventive measures ; the way to make them unwilling to be corrupt is to instil in public servants a sense of honor in uprightness and shame in corruption ; and for civil servants to have no need to be corrupt depends on giving then adequate salaries , so that they can afford to stay clean , and do not need to rely on ill-gotten gains .  
" No men , no money , no power . Even if there is just as much courage and character at the local level , and as much love for the land and people , everything just gets rubbed out , " says one individual who formerly served as a county executive . Today , comfortably ensconced in his central government official 's office , he describes his former days as " hectic from start to finish , yet I was often so frustrated or felt so powerless that I was unable to sleep at night . "  
In other words , if I was spiritually unable to pass the test , and could not conquer the terror of dying , no matter what the final outcome I would have felt very ashamed . This would be like a businessman losing even his initial investment . This sense of shame more or less inspired me to believe that I had no choice but to overcome fear .  
The inhabitants of northern Thailand adopted the scorched earth method of planting . The poppy cultivation drained off a great deal of the earth 's fertility , and they were unable to grow successive crops on the same patch of soil . Fields had to be rotated . In addition , minority people used to cut down a good many trees in order to build houses , so that what was originally a stretch of virgin forest in northern Thailand had become a bald mountain with burnt out patches in between .  
Right now the mainland economy is heated up , and the financial market has the jitters . Of course private companies ca n't compete with state-owned enterprises which have access to deep and extensive human relations networks , " Yang Donghong observes . If a state-owned establishment defaults on a loan , the loan officer holds little responsibility . But if a private business goes insolvent , the officer who sponsored the loan will almost certainly be unable to escape blame .  
Under the mandate of discouraging nude dance as a form of worship , electronically animated mannequins appeared at one point as substitutes . But though the mannequins ' figures were no less shapely than real performers , and from time to time , they would un veil their gauzy outer garments , fakes , after all , were unable to invoke the same heated response .  
Of course , everyone has their own version of the story , and it is hard to say who is right or wrong . But Li , looking at things from the point of view of enterprise development , feels that democratization in Taiwan is divorced from the rule of law , that the media is biased , that local elected officials stir up the population to win favor , and that the government - - though willing to help - - is unable to do anything . All these keep investors from moving forward . "  
In an extreme example of the principle of natural selection , only the strongest could survive the journey home , thus maintaining the durability and health of the whole species .

Many elderly people who were unable to collect their subsidies ended up accusing the staff of being obstructionist . Moreover , beginning next year the central government will no longer compensate local governments for hiring social workers .

As Chinese know from their own books , " The Chinese armed forces held Shanghai amidst bitter fighting from August to November , and even then the Japanese were unable to completely rout the Chinese . " But in the relevant Japanese film , the viewer only gets two images - - " Fighting has spread to Shanghai , where our forces are heavily engaged , " and " Valiant naval airmen who gave their lives " - - that gloss right over actual events .  
Many young people , unable to find work immediately after completing their military service , see driving a taxi as a job which offers independence and an apparently reasonable income , so they enter this " reception center for the unemployed and waystation for those changing jobs . "  
Even though I was unable to celebrate the coming of the new spring with my kith and kin , our branch of the family did our very best , by dining on hot pot , wearing new clothes , letting my child don a little traditional suit of skullcap and cotton jacket .

Given the current intense anti-drug efforts and heavy sentences , it is difficult to move drugs within Taiwan , and the price of heroin has increased as supply has been unable to keep up with demand .

Even if there are numerous homes and senior citizen centers that have been set up by government agencies and private organizations which can solve the problems of part of the elderly population , many of these places do not accept people who are indigent , too sick or aged , entirely unable to care for themselves , or who have been abandoned by their families . Most of the elderly at home alone are n't served by the homes and senior citizen centers .  
Look back at all the various ghosts-the male ghost who fears that no one will look after him , the female phantom trapped in the pain of emotional hurt and revenge , the old man unable to rest in peace in a tomb full of water , and the aggrieved " substitute seeking " ghost looking everywhere for someone to stand in for it-and you will notice something interesting : The appearance of ghosts reflects the fact that life is too short ; the tragedies of ghosts represent the persistent attachment to the mundane world .  
Again , Xue Baocha should have made an ideal wife for the son of a family of high standing , but because she is unable to communicate with Jia Baoyu on a spiritual level , although she gains social rank , she finds no sympathetic resonance , but instead only a cold , empty shell .  
However , this part is no joke : in recent years , many young mathematical and science talents , identified as gifted in high school but unable to pass the intelligence tests required to enter college , have been weeded out of the special program as a result , and are forced to take the Joint College Entrance Exams with everyone else .  
Far from his native place , Su looked back on his frustrated career and felt he had spent 30 years in a dream of illusory glory . On awakening he now found himself mired in the mud of human politics , his future uncertain . He felt like a fish caught on a hook , unable to swim up or down .  
It was n't that I had no interest in reading it , but rather was unable to get away from the constant stream of daily activities that keep me busy . Then , however , when I finally struggled through to the second chapter , I read about the idea of " active laziness . " Rinpoche says : " Our lives seem to live us , to possess their own bizarre momentum , to carry us away ; in the end we feel we have no choice or control over them . "  
Upon his arrival in Taiwan , both supporters of Taiwan independence and of reunification with mainland China staked out their own battle positions . There were some who welcomed him , while those who opposed him protested . Yet , unable to avoid being mired down in their own preconceived , subjective ideology , they could only blur the focus of the Dalai Lama 's visit . The Tibetan leader 's reaction to the scene-to voice support for " freedom of expression " - was truly worthy of admiration , and proved him to be a learned man .  
" At that time , the resource most lacking in Tainan 's social services was nursing homes for the elderly . The situation was especially bad for those who were poor or ill or whose families were unable to take care of them , " says Rev . John B . Kung , now Chancellorof the Diocese , but at that time the assistant to Bishop Cheng .  
Tzung-han is a gifted child with an IQ of 180 . The school he attended was unable to meet his educational needs and attending class was just boring for him . His teacher beat him everyday for forgetting to bring a handkerchief or toilet paper , or for losing things . He is a sensitive boy and the jealousy of his classmates hurt him .  
In his thinking , the peasants have no month of rest and the life of the fields is one of exhausting hard labor . Yet he also saw the pleasure of rural life , when the peasants have finished work and " the children who were picking melons laugh and wash their feet at the water 's edge as the sun goes down , telling outrageous stories before the evening wind picks up . " This was a simple kind of leisure that the sophisticated literati were unable to appreciate .  
" The majority of Taiwanese senior citizens in the US come here to live with their grown children , who mostly have master 's or PhD degrees , and are ' suburban Chinese . ' Because the homes of their children are spread out in middle - and high-class residential areas , unlike members of self-contained urban Chinatowns , elderly Taiwanese suffer great inconvenience if they are unable to communicate in English , " says Peter C . Lee , associate vice-president of the Office of Faculty Affairs at San Jose State University in California .  
Other possible symptoms include feelings of alienation , emotional withdrawal and a loss of interest in life . Some victims become hypersensitive , anxious , insomniac , unable to focus their attention and subject to memory lapses . Those who have lost a loved one or who themselves survived a disaster are particularly prone to feeling guilty about their own survival when others died .  
" Most people respond to a major trauma by trying to push the experience out of their conscious mind . The trauma is never spoken of and is only recognized through the symptoms the victim displays , " says Dr . Chang Ta-jen , assistant director of the Provincial Taoyuan Psychiatric Center . Chang says that as most people are unable to recognize the warning signs and symptoms , they deal with a trauma by repressing it or through displacement .  
Soldiers who had been exposed to the horrors of trench warfare , the constant threat of death , who had seen their brothers-in-arms wounded and killed while they themselves were unable to do anything about it , would shout and cry hysterically , or become suddenly rigid . Their personalities changed ; they became silent and unresponsive . Some even lost their memories or their senses .  
Although there is an impressive number of lions on display , the museum is unable to ascribe an accurate date and place of origin to each pair . For the time being , it is only able to group them into rough categories . For instance , Southern Fujianese lions from Hui'an and from Tong'an near Quanzhou are placed together , and the shigandang , which have their origins in belief in stone spirits , are placed alongside the wind lion lords which protect their owners from ravaging " evil " winds on small southern islands .  
In fact , some experts feel that since most enterovirus cases in Taiwan are in rural areas , it is still the result of poor hygiene . Nonetheless , it is also true that children today live too cleanly : they lack natural sources of infection in their environment , so that when they do meet with a virus they are quite unable to fend it off .  
According to regulations , when the volume of effluent exceeds the approved maximum by 10% , a report of this fact and an application to increase the approved maximum must be submitted . But the approval process takes six months and the volume of waste water was continuing to grow at an explosive rate . As such , the park was unable to avoid exceeding the stipulated volume .  
The Ministry of Education also has plans to establish " community colleges , " but their main goal is to give those students from the technical and vocational educational stream who are unable to squeeze in through the narrow doors of the conventional universities an extra opportunity to gain a university-level qualification ; the aims do not seem very different from those behind the establishment of the old night schools or today 's Open University .  
Even for Mr . and Mrs . Chang Erh-lien , who had run a nursery for nearly 30 years and considered themselves very knowledgeable about preschool children , the reality of foster parenting was far different from what they had been anticipating . Says Mr . Chang , " These children are really very different from most kids . " The first child they accepted , aged two years and nine months , displayed severe developmental regression , and was completely unable to control his bowel or bladder movements .  
If we compare him to other Nativist writers who address the tragedy of the rural elderly unable to adapt to the modern industrial world , we note that Huang is reluctant to expose his elderly characters to unmitigated suffering .  
Facing an uncertain fate , and caught between the northern and southern governments , parliamentarians were unable to hold meaningful sessions , nor could they collect any regular salaries , so it is no surprise that these early parliamentarians , many idealistic to start with , ended up giving in to temptation . There is nothing new under the sun about intellectuals being sullied by the realities of hard-nosed politics .  
To avoid people being denied the right to medical self-determination because they are unable to express their will , anyone over 20 years of age and of full capacity may make an " advance declaration " of their wishes ( also known as a " living will " ) , and may appoint a medical representative who is empowered to sign a consent form on their behalf if they are unable to express themselves .  
Music also interferes with the contemplative process of liberating oneself from worldly concerns , and even Mahakasyapa , who always accompanied the Buddha , was unable to calm down when preaching to the lovely sound of a zither-while the other 500 divine beings present simply lost their heads and started dancing . When former music students take monastic vows they renounce forever their beloved pianos and violins , because everything makes way for the overriding priority of breaking the cycle of rebirth .  
The special new trash bags , which come in six sizes , are not cheap-NT $ 7 per bag for the standard small size . It is estimated that this will result in a threefold increase in residential garbage fees compared with the old system . Just as the scheme was about to get off the ground , the supply of new trash bags was " held back " from the market by distributors . Residents were unable to obtain the bags from local stores , triggering further complaints about the new system .  
It is necessary because within a single nation , different local governments take in different amounts of revenue due to their unique geographic , environmental , and economic conditions . The central government can not sit idly by while people in certain areas are unable to enjoy basic government services , so it uses various means to alleviate revenue shortfalls where they exist . The Tax Redistribution Fund is one such method .  
For example Master Hui Neng , despite being illiterate , was known for his skill at literary discussion and the composition of religious verse . It was Hui Neng who left his cassock on a rock atop Dayu Ridge , from where the monk who was following him was unable to move it . The external actions of those who had attained enlightenment often strayed into the realm of what for normal people would be " miracles . "  
The PRC is reported to be the main cause of the diplomatic rupture . Macedonia has been beset in recent years by both internal and external threats . Fighting connected with the separatist movement in neighboring Kosovo has generated a mass exodus of refugees into Macedonia , while the Macedonian government has been unable to quell a domestic rebellion by ethnic Albanians .  
( Chang Chin-ju / tr . by Robert Taylor ) The APEC economic leaders ' meeting was concluded on 21 October . Regrettably , because Taiwan and this year 's host , mainland China , were unable to agree on Taiwan 's choice of representative , and because at a ministerial press conference prior to the leaders ' meeting PRC foreign minister Tang Jiaxuan prevented ROC economic affairs minister Lin Hsin-yi from speaking , the ROC government decided to withdraw from the summit .  
One day , acting upon the advice of his ox , the Oxherd retrieved and hid an article of celestial garb he had come upon by the riverside . The Weaving Maid , unable to return to heaven because she no longer possessed her celestial garb , agreed to marry the earnest and straightforward Oxherd . With the husband tilling the fields and the wife weaving her cloth , the couple set about raising two sons .  
It was n't until consumption reached 150% of replacement levels in May that it finally issued a completely unexpected warning . Part of the problem is that three of Taiwan Power 's liquefied natural gas storage tanks have never been put into use because of technological defects unresolved by their Japanese contractor . The power shortage has also led to widespread suspicions that Taiwan Power is technologically inept and unable to handle crises . As a result , its chairman Lin Wen-yuan tendered his resignation .  
From the moment they say " I do , " they should be ready in their hearts and willing to take the bad along with the good . Why is it , then , that today 's couples , free to choose their partners , find it so difficult to honor their vows ? Some find it impossible to deal with hardship , and others , even after struggling to make it through a difficult stretch , are somehow unable to enjoy the sweet yields of their struggle .  
For example , " amniotic fluid embolism " is a dangerous obstetric emergency that can occur without any prior warning or symptoms , and may cause the sudden death of a mother during or after labor . Kao Tien-fu , a director of the Association of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the ROC and convener of its medical disputes committee , has encountered two cases , and sadly was unable to save either of the women .  
Not far off the east coast of Taiwan the continental shelf falls away into an ocean trench thousands of meters deep , so bluefin arriving from across the Pacific have to come close inshore to find shallow waters to spawn . Their newly hatched fry are unable to hunt or swim for themselves , so they need waters that are rich in plankton and have strong currents . The North Equatorial Current and the Kuroshio Current pass by eastern Taiwan , creating an area of high primary productivity .  
However , hopes are one thing , but reality is another . According to the analysis in the survey report , the number of children hoped for or considered ideal by married women with a college-level or better education , and by employed married women , is on average greater than two . But most are unable to fully realize their childbearing hopes or ideals , because of the high cost of raising children in terms of mental and physical energy , material resources and opportunity cost .  
Trend expert John Naisbitt , in his High Tech , High Touch : Technology and Our Search for Meaning , discusses the threat posed to American youth by violent virtual reality games ( especially lifelike combat games ) , stating that they render children unable to distinguish between real and virtual . This in turn has generated a slew of on-campus firearms attacks that have left American society reeling .  
In the sexual spectrum , there is a wide range of colors . To divide male and female into two extreme categories of masculine and feminine would make us unable to understand and appreciate disadvantaged groups . "  
The war not only left Vietnam with countless deformed children , but also greatly hindered its economic development . Today its national income per capita is only US $ 600 , less than one-tenth of that in Taiwan , and the state is unable to provide sufficient medical resources and personnel to treat so many patients .  
Why is it that the WHO , which emphasizes pursuing human health across all racial , religious , economic , and social boundaries , is unable to bring Taiwan within its international network ?  
The impression that people are still unable to grasp the meaning of installation art is naturally one of the first addressed by the author . At the very beginning Yao seeks to make clear the purpose and meaning of such art with the following definition : " In general terms installation art refers to an expressive method not a style . In the main it focuses on artistic behavior or approaches undertaken in a physical or conceptual space .  
In order to better understand the English-language education conundrum facing elementary schools throughout Taiwan , Control Yuan members Lu Hsi-mu , Lin Shih-chi , and Yin Shih-hao compiled an investigative report entitled " Problems in Elementary School English Education " at the close of last year . In it they discovered that rural schools were quite often unable to hire accredited English instructors .  
Sun Yung-ching observes that " in industrial education , time is money . " The central reason why technical and vocational students are unable to meet the demands of industry is that the equipment they need to train on is too expensive . Schools are unable to meet the financial burden of constantly upgrading facilities and industry is unwilling to receive students for training in their plants , on the one hand because of the possible impact on output , but also out of genuine concern that students could damage precision machinery .  
Wen Shih-jen , deputy CEO of computer manufacturer Inventec , has likened the importance of cooperation between technical and vocational education and industry to laying the " last mile " in establishing the Internet : " The final section needed to ensure the Internet is linked with actual users is known as the ' last mile . ' Without this section users would be unable to get online and the Internet would be a wasted opportunity . "  
Recently a parent unable to find his spare mobile phone was told by his junior-high-school-aged son : " Sorry Pop , but I already sold it over the Internet ! " So dazzling is the array of products online , in fact , that it can make ordinarily normal people do strange things .  
The established publication and distribution mechanism could n't keep up with the needs of the market or with the changing face of the industry . Now the mainland publishing industry is overburdened upstream and overwhelmed downstream : the production of published works is like a torrential river rushing to the ocean-but on reaching the estuary ( distribution channels ) , it can do no more than trickle in . Some merges into the " second channel , " while the rest overflows everywhere , unable to smoothly enter the ocean that is the literary market .  
In terms of agreement , both sides realize that although democratic government is essentially " representative government , " duly elected representatives and officials are sometimes unable to carry out fully and impartially the duties entrusted to them by the electorate . To correct the insufficiencies of " indirect democracy " one must thus rely on the " direct democracy " of the popular referendum . This is an important element in the deepening and reform of the democratic process .  
In the first place , they maintain , people are driven by their own individual interests and are frequently unable to take the broad view in considering public affairs . This " me first " attitude exacerbates conflicts of interest . Secondly , to avoid referendum issues being controlled by special-interest groups , laws must be passed to regulate public announcements , provide for the balanced presentation of information and guarantee the free flow of information .  
Suo points out that in recent years , the proportion of reported TB cases that have been changed from " suspected " to " confirmed negative " has increased from 10% to 20% . Some patients are blindly given medication even though it is unclear whether they in fact have contracted tuberculosis . Other patients , unable to obtain specialized medical care , spread M . tuberculosis while wandering from one regular health care institution to another .  
Cheng points out that although such ideas have a contagious element about them , people who are mentally healthy or who have a strong " psychological immunity " will not easily be " infected " by suicide reports . But people who are themselves suffering from severe depression or who have suffered a serious setback in life , are more likely to be contaminated by an unhealthy suicidal frame of mind and to be unable to free themselves from it .  
Today , because staying alive is not hard , people are unable to find meaning in life itself . Yet we must look for meaning in life itself , " comments social critic Nanfang Shuo . He notes that feelings of fatigue , emptiness , waste , and futility with respect to life have become an unavoidable existential question for young men and women .  
Writer Li Ang was n't bothered that she was unable to make it to the top this time . She figured this was a perfect foreshadowing of a future trip up the mountain when the azaleas would be in bloom . " I 've traveled all over the world . I never imagined that the most beautiful spot was right here under my feet . "  
" Sadly , the average person does n't know very much about this , " laments Nelson Yang . Because in the past mountain climbers or naturalists neglected the history of the opening and development of Taiwan 's mountain areas , people have focused only on the flatlands and shoreline that make up just one fourth of the total land area of the island . They have little knowledge of the length and breadth of the mountains and are unable properly to understand the development of Taiwan 's ethnic and cultural diversity .  
Professor Tsai Hung-chin , recently retired from Taiwan National University 's Agricultural Extension Department , goes further . He points out that Taiwan agricultural products have for some time tended to earn low profits and that farm income has had no guarantees . Even if high-quality products are raised , in light of the multiple layers of exploitation existing throughout the sales system and the dumping of low-priced products on the market , farmers are frequently unable to earn a profit .  
As for the current situation , there is perhaps no immediate solution to the two major problems of " small-scale " farming that is unable to recover investment capital and the aging of the manpower in the agricultural sector . But as for improving production and marketing , this is something the government can apply its efforts toward .  
Furthermore , modern people may lack ecological and environmental knowledge . Or they may know that natural resources are limited and that biodiversity is important , but be unable to refuse materialistic temptations , lack the time to recycle , and be powerless to refuse their children 's requests for the fashionable pet of the moment . More knowledge does not necessarily help in easing environmental deterioration .  
Later , due to my persistence , after they had considered things for some time , finally a letter arrived from the editorial department . It said that in consideration of my good reputation in the scientific community , they would publish the paper , despite being unable to find any evidence supportive of my conclusion . However , the text would include a special disclaimer , indicating that I was solely responsible for the content , and that the editors did not back up my claims in any way .  
Changhua City has a long history , but now it seems to have hit a wall , unable to get beyond its current population level or its geographical limitations , stuck running second to Taichung . But the past was different . Old Changhua once held the spotlight , especially its train station . A popular rest stop in the long north-south train journey , the station made a huge impression on all who visited it , and was the pride of Changhua .  
Lin still remembers that when he was in the seventh grade , tuition fees were NT $ 200 . Because his mother was unable to come up with the very substantial amount needed to pay tuition for him and his four elder brothers , she sent the children to school with NT $ 50 each , instructing them to discuss with their teachers the possibility of making an initial , partial tuition payment . The young Lin Pen-po felt so ashamed at not having the full amount that he lingered outside the school , not daring to enter .  
If the present generation is unable to defeat growing poverty and secure employment opportunities for the already vast global army of the indigent , it will be impossible to ensure the peace and wellbeing in the developed regions of the world .  
Official development assistance , so important for developing countries that were unable to attract private financial flows , continued to decline both in real terms and in proportion to the gross national product ( GNP ) of developing countries . 
Because controls on growing trade and communication had been unable to keep pace with organized criminal activities , there was an urgent need to elaborate an improved response by criminal justice authorities world wide .  
History is replete with instances of youth frustration militating against development and social progress in rich as well as poor countries when the existing political and social institutions were either unwilling or unable to respond meaningfully and in a timely manner to youth problems and aspirations . 
However , we have been helpless witnesses to unacceptable suffering , to shameful operations of so-called ethnic cleansing and to crimes against humanity , which the international community was unable to prevent and before which it remained passive .  
In the case of foreign military installations , we did hear some comments to the effect that the military installations were an important factor in local employment and the local economic situation , and that because of the decision to close or downsize some of them there were adverse consequences that some of the Territories were unable to face without adequate cooperation from the administering Powers . 
The agenda item entitled Process of nuclear disarmament in the framework of international peace and security , with the objective of the elimination of nuclear weapons has been under consideration for several years in our Commission . For various reasons , the Commission has been unable to formulate a set of satisfactory guidelines for nuclear disarmament , thus falling short of people 's expectations . 
In this so-called new era in which bipolar confrontation no longer exists , it is especially regrettable that the international community should be unable to arrive at a firm commitment on nuclear disarmament and on the complete elimination of these weapons of mass destruction , which continue to endanger the very survival of the human race .  
Owing to the acute economic crisis , the State was unable to guarantee to a sufficient extent the protection of such inalienable rights as the right to work , the right to an adequate living standard and the right to housing or to protect the rights of many refugees and illegal immigrants in the country .  
Their consent to the terms of a peace-keeping mandate may be given and withdrawn ; factional leaders may be unable to control followers ; peace-keepers may be forced to choose between passivity in the face of destructive breaches of a mandate and forceful responses they are ill equipped to carry out .  As the Secretary-General has pointed out , these conditions entail considerable risk to peace-keepers .  
While he respected the Committee on Contributions as an independent , technical body in its sphere of competence , he noted that , because of the vague nature of the mandate given to it by the General Assembly , it had been unable to adopt a balanced political decision on the scale of assessments , as a result of which the matter had been left to the Fifth Committee .  
Despite debt rescheduling and other relief from the application of the enhanced Toronto terms , debt buy-back schemes , bilateral debt forgiveness and new concessional money , a large number of the poorest and most indebted countries are still unable to meet scheduled debt-service payments .  Arrears have accumulated and they have been locked into a process of repeated rescheduling .  
The 1994 ECA " Economic report " confirms the continued deterioration in social and human conditions and the escalating absolute and relative poverty by pointing out that about 220-million Africans - almost half of the population in sub-Saharan Africa - now live in absolute poverty , unable to meet their most basic needs .  
Such crises may save various sources , continue for varying periods of time , and disrupt governmental performance to varying degrees , but their primary characteristic is that the existing national Government is unable to meet the immediate daily requirements of its population or to build a viable basis for sustainable development without external assistance .  
When the United Nations is unable to provide accommodation to an equivalent standard and the unit rents a suitable structure , the unit will be reimbursed the actual rental cost on a bilateral special case arrangement between the troop-contributing country and the United Nations .  
No country could be expected to stand idle when its own territorial integrity is incessantly threatened by blatant cross-border attacks of a terrorist organization based and operating from a neighbouring country , if that country is unable to put an end to such attacks .  
UNHCR responded that it was unable to associate itself with that action , explaining that the registration of spontaneous returnees was directly linked with , and complementary to , the simultaneous official voluntary repatriation process under the terms of the quadripartite agreement . 
The international community should give further thought to the background and habitual course of the conflicts in Africa and support African efforts to secure rapid , effective agreements guaranteeing the right to self-determination , fundamental freedoms , democracy and development for all these peoples who , despite the attainment of independence some years ago , are unable to find peace with justice and development , mainly because of violence , foreign interests and armed conflicts .  
If , however , the country is unable or unwilling to meet the minimum standards required by humanitarian or human rights law , then these guarantees may have to be met through international assistance .

The Group of 77 and China were unable to share the view that the current cash-flow problem was somehow linked to the existing systems of assessment , which were the incremental result of shared experience and common understanding .  
My Government therefore finds it disappointing that sponsors of draft resolution A / C . 1 / 50 / L . 39 were apparently unable to accept even a cross-reference to the contribution made to enhanced international security by the continuing strict adherence of non-nuclear-weapon States to multilateral and legally binding non-proliferation undertakings that are verified by full-scope nuclear safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency .  
In that connection , he reiterated that the increase in Iraq 's rate was unjustified since it ignored the country 's economic situation and the adverse consequences of the complete embargo imposed on it by the Security Council , since that embargo had deprived it of any source of income and rendered it unable to respond to the humanitarian and vital needs of the population .  
was unacceptable that many were unable to enjoy their human rights and fundamental freedoms , and it was essential that the international community should be aware of that , in order to make every effort to secure the enjoyment of those rights for indigenous people .  
We support the efforts of the Angolan Government and the international community to undertake all tasks aimed at bringing about a lasting peace , social stability and the normal functioning of institutions at the national level , without which the Angolan people will be unable to enjoy the tranquillity they rightfully deserve and the wealth they could and should benefit from , given the huge potential of their country .  
Among other things , African countries had experienced considerable difficulties in attracting the requisite foreign direct investment , and had also been unable to ensure adequate access of their populations to education , health and related social services .  
If we agree that long-term , sustained growth and sustainable development depend on the private sector and on attracting foreign direct investment , then we must identify a true incentive for investment , since Africa , despite its conducive climate , is still unable to attract foreign direct investment .  
The most obvious case of grave violations of human rights in an industrialized country , however , was that of the United States , where the " American dream " was a tragic nightmare for vast sectors of its population in a society that was unable to conceal the situation of extreme inequality and open discrimination that affected tens of millions of African Americans , Latin Americans , Asians and indigenous people .  
The collapse of the central authority also posed extreme difficulties for the protection of human rights , while the administration of justice continued to be arbitrary and local authorities were unable to prevent some sections of the population from engaging in arms dealing and trafficking in narcotics and cultural artifacts .  
It was recognized that , while private capital flows to developing countries could make an important contribution to growth and development , many of those inflows were in the form of portfolio investment rather than direct investment in productive capacity , and their distribution among developing countries was uneven , with countries needing capital most being unable to attract them .  
Conflicts have not been resolved by markets , and the water administration is to a large extent unable to address them ; ( g ) Water legislation should include water marketing principles , established within a balanced structure in which property protected water rights are accommodated to public interest , including the principle of effective and beneficial use and environmental protection .  
International and local observers take the view that principal responsibility for the continuing insecurity lies with the local police , who are either unable or unwilling to take effective action against the ongoing wave of criminal activity against the Croatian Serbs .  
More than 360 medical specialists and highly qualified instructors from universities and medical centres from around the world have been unable to come to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to treat patients with serious conditions , perform delicate surgical procedures in public hospitals , conduct examinations in the country 's medical schools at different times of the year , and participate in conferences , symposia and courses organized in the country .  NULLThe growing shortage of spare parts has resulted in a deterioration in the maintenance of modern medical equipment used in hospitals and medical centres .  
Despite considerable efforts , the Commission had been unable to balance viewpoints and to catalyse decisive action by the international community , not only on financial resources but also on other cross-sectoral issues such as the transfer of environmentally sound technologies , economic instruments for sustainable development and the relation between international trade and the environment . 
However , CPC had been unable to reach agreement on the content of that document at its session in June 1996 and had recommended that the Secretary-General be asked to present to the current session of the General Assembly , through CPC at its September session , a short and concise document to be considered for inclusion in the proposed medium-term plan based on relevant resolutions and decisions of intergovernmental bodies and taking into account the views expressed by the members of CPC .  
While the authorities have made efforts to ensure that cases of illegally occupied houses are solved , and many of the cases have been dealt with fairly and justly , there still remains a significant amount of unresolved cases where the local authorities have been unable to prevent de facto ethnic discrimination , owing to intimidation , limited capacity of the judiciary , pressure exercised on judges , and in some cases because decisions of eviction have not been enforced by the local police .  
A dramatic deterioration of the social and industrial infrastructure and a sharp decline in the provision of social , health and education services , lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes , and a sharp drop in the real income of most families have combined to render large sectors of the population in Tajikistan unable to meet even their basic food needs .  
Specifically , this has included activities such as moving people to safe havens and providing assistance upon their arrival , arranging for medical treatment abroad for those wounded and unable to obtain it in situ , and facilitating third-country resettlement on either a temporary or permanent basis .  
After 15 days of torture and ill treatment , he was found lying near the border fence , unable to walk because he had been tortured with corrosive chemicals which had burned his lower limbs , inflamed internal tissue and damaged the bones .  
It also has a negative impact on dedicated staff members who , in a genuine effort to fulfil all mandates , have to spread themselves too thinly , are unable to stay in touch with their fields of expertise and find themselves in a spiral of constant deadlines and diminishing results .  
Conscious that , in various situations , indigenous people are unable to enjoy their inalienable human rights and fundamental freedoms , determined to do everything possible to promote the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people , and bearing in mind that international standards must be developed on the basis of the diverse situations and aspirations of the world 's indigenous people ,  
The Government with its various structures has found itself unable to ensure systemwide and effective management of the economic and social processes and proper implementation of the reforms ; its has displayed poor initiative and spent its time largely " putting out fires " .  
In contrast , least developed countries which have been unable to resolve serious internal conflicts , maintain political stability or consistently implement the necessary economic reforms have experienced , at best , continued economic stagnation and , at worst , economic collapse .  
In the Midrand Declaration , 7 member States of the Conference stated that it should be recognized that countries entered the new rules-based system of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) from very different starting points ; that , accordingly , the impact of globalization and liberalization was uneven ; and that the least developed countries , particularly those in Africa , remained constrained by weak supply capabilities and were unable to benefit from trade . 
Accordingly , Israel is unable , at this juncture , to commit itself to a total ban on the use of anti _ personnel landmines until effective alternative measures are available to ensure the protection of civilians threatened on a daily basis by terrorists , and to ensure the protection of Israeli defence forces operating in areas of armed conflict .  
While the quality of United Nations programmes in the field of science and technology for development had improved , the question of how to bridge the gap between those countries that generated and utilized new scientific ideas and modern technologies , and those countries which were unable to do so remained one of the major challenges facing the international community .  
An increasing number of countries are addressing the key issues of land supply , security of tenure and housing finance but , at the global level , action is still limited .  167 .  Many developing countries are unable to devote the necessary resources for the provision of infrastructure to improve existing settlements and also to open up new lands for housing development .  
In specific terms our countries , despite various structural reforms , have been unable to attract in sufficient quantities the necessary capital inflows for investment , and are confronted at the same time with domestic supply-side constraints which limit our export potential , an unsustainable debt which swallows a great part of our national income , and declining levels of official development assistance , among others .  
An essential element in propagating a culture of peace is to refrain from implementing policies that would widen the gulf between the rich developed countries and poor third world countries , unable to ensure growth , to make the best use of their natural and human resources , with the resultant unemployment , financial deficit and indebtedness worsening year after year .  
Accordingly , Israel is unable at this juncture to commit itself to a total ban on the use of anti-personnel landmines until effective alternative measures are available to ensure the protection of civilians threatened on a daily basis by terrorists and of Israeli Defence Forces operating in areas of armed conflict .

Some people , violating party and state policy , insert their relatives and friends into the party and government organs , where they can all eat the " fiscal meal " ; thus the great majority of local fiscal funds are wasted on personnel , with the result that they are unable to make ends meet and their finances are all used up in idleness and eating , and this leads to unhealthy trends which persist despite repeated prohibition , thus increasing the masses ' burden and causing dissatisfaction among them .

Although a number of developing countries or countries making an economic switch are practicing a market economy legal system , the market is unable to operate efficiently because the law and rule of law is not on a sound basis ; on the one hand lack of clarity in individual and enterprise property rights means that economic efficiency falls , contracts can not be effectively enforced , and disputes can not be settled in fair fashion ;  
The Pentagon is still sticking to its hardline stance , and has even again sent reconnaisance planes to carry out provocative activities ; apart from showing that the United States is unable to advance any further arguments to justify itself , it shows all the more the current US administration 's blind spots and total ignorance in foreign policy - - at least we have already seen that the diplomats involved in this affair are all military men who lack normal knowledge of foreign affairs , and even lack essential knowledge of Chinese humanity and history .

Mu Xiudong , political commissar of a missile brigade of the Second Artillery Corps , said during a discussion that without emancipating its mind and seeking truth from facts - - a spirit of exploring a scientific theory in an in-depth manner - - the party would have been unable to acquire major theoretical innovations , the Chinese nation would have been unable to achieve independence and liberation , building socialism with Chinese characteristics would have been impossible , and there would not have been such powerful national defense as we have today .

If we treat only the symptoms , not the root cause , we would not only be unable to consolidate the achievements that have been made in the rectification and improvement , but also lose such achievements altogether .

Had we been conservative , restrained by the routine , and not brave enough to do anything , we would still be suffering from the restraints of " two any-and-alls " and caught in endless discussions on whether this or that is " socialist " or " capitalist .

As may be seen from Chen Shuibian 's [ Ch'en Shui-pian ] inaugural speech on 20 May , this " minority leader " who took power with 39 percent of the popular vote is still hard-pressed to promote " Taiwan Independence " at present .

Following the growth of the DPP in Taiwan 's political arena , " Taiwan independence " thinkers seem to have felt that the simple slogan of " democracy and human rights " is rather of the grass roots , not comprehensive and profound enough , and difficult to attain the purpose of " winning maximum popular support .

Shu Huiguo , secretary of the Jiangxi province CPC committee , said : Currently , China 's conventional agriculture is being transformed into modern agriculture and the market of agricultural and sideline products is being transformed from one catering to basic living needs into one catering for things required for living a relatively comfortable life .

There are four major reasons underlying the late payment of rates - - new owners have not received rates demands in the immediate period following the change of ownership of premises ; owners fail to make prompt arrangements with tenants for rates payment after the properties have been let ; payers claiming that they have not received rates demands or payers have forgotten to pay rates before the due date ; or payers have been unable to settle the payment due to financial difficulties .  
The financial system , in particular the banking system , is the foundation for economic growth , since a crippled financial sector will be unable to intermediate between savings and investments , thereby leading to prolonged liquidity crunch and inefficient allocation of resources . 
The Special Finance Scheme for Small and Medium Enterprises set up by the Government in 1998 has stopped accepting new loan applications since April 2000 .  Nevertheless , the credit guarantees approved prior to that date will not be fully discharged until May 2003 .  As such , we are unable to tell at this stage whether the ultimate bad debt ratio will indeed reach 15 per cent as cited by Dr Hon Lui Ming-wah .  
The local labour market , having held generally stable in the first two quarters of 2001 , eased distinctly in the third quarter , as amidst the economic downturn and corporate downsizing , employment was unable to catch up with growth in the total labour force . 
We also encourage SMEs to participate in Government tenders by enhancing the provision of information about our IT projects to the market and by reducing the financial burden on potential tenderers ( for example , lowering or removing the tender and contract deposit requirement , and only requiring a performance bond or bank guarantee from a successful tenderer for high-value or complex project contracts if , during financial vetting , the tenderer is unable to supply adequate supporting information about its financial capability to perform its contractual obligations ) .  
If the proposal is implemented , the SFC would be empowered to initiate , without court approval , a derivative action against wrongdoers in relation to a listed company on grounds including fraud , negligence , default in relation to any legislation and breach of any fiduciary or statutory duty , where the company is unwilling or unable to do so . 
The much dwindled current account surplus was unable to offset the net outflow of funds in the financial and capital account , which was mainly led by a sharp reversal from net inflow to net outflow in the banking sector as net other investment outflow , outrunning the strong surge in net direct investment inflow and the significantly moderated net portfolio investment outflow .  
Giving up on the prospect , he went home , put it in his dresser , and went out for the evening . Later that night , Ch'en heard on the radio that the grand prizewinning number was the same as that on the section of tickets which he was unable to sell . He rushed home , but only to realize that his wife had already sold the remaining ticket earlier in the evening . Every term , one winning number is chosen .  
The seventh lunar month is hot and infectious diseases are rampant . To reduce contagion , ancient sages may have used " ghosts " to keep the people from going outside . Actually the sages ' actions would have been quite reasonable - - literate scholars might listen to arguments about contagion but the ignorant masses would be unable to understand .  
The little incident described below is a classic anecdote of the Yu family . When their eldest son was born in Washington , D . C . , Mrs . Yu 's mother was unable to come all the way to the United States and help her daughter with the month of recuperation and special diet required by Chinese tradition . Mother-in-law then wrote to son-in-law exhorting him to be sure to stew a chicken for the postpartum mother , to help her regain her strength .  
In recent years , because of the rapid increase in the airline industry and the aging of planes built in the 60 ' s and 70 ' s , major aircraft manufacturers in the U . S . and Europe have , unable to meet rising demand , made the newly industrialized countries partners in cooperation .  
From transient visitors who left their hometowns for a temporary stay there , they have made themselves into the sector of the populace with the most economic clout on the island , but owing to special historical and geographical factors , they have been unable to shake off the psychology of transience .  
In future things will be clearer , with free competition in agricultural production whereby prices will be fixed by supply and demand . Those unable to compete will be eliminated , while those who can will find a welcome market for their produce . In this way farmers ' labor , resources and investment will be directed towards higher added value products . Meanwhile ordinary farmers working smaller , weaker family farms will receive government aid , but this will be completely divorced from their production .  
We spoke frankly , I watched the meeting and the election , and I attended the dinner . The piece de resistance was the seminar I chaired . The discussion revolved around living in a foreign land , coming to terms with the new land and the old , where the future of China was headed and so forth . Everyone talked in full confidence , unable to stop , and the seminar did n't break up until one o'clock at night .  
Radio drama and other popular programs went into decline once TV began to air similar shows . From its peak in 1961 , radio listenership fell to an all-time low after the Chinese Television System hit the screens in 1971 . Not only did that familiar image of the family grouped around the radio set vanish , but one researcher at the time even found that many interviewees were unable to help with his survey for the simple reason that they never listened to radio at all .  
Ten years ago , to help children that have been unable to receive proper parental care because their families have suffered special problems or misfortunes , the R . O . C . Children 's Welfare Foundation studied examples overseas and introduced to Taiwan the foster care system , in which families volunteer to take in foster children on a temporary basis .  
As an example , Den Chi-fu , a professor at National Chiao Tung University , cites India , which has strong basic science , produces many Ph . D.s and far exceeds us in the number of papers published in international academic journals , but which has been unable to raise the quality of life of its citizens , where the electronics industry has been developed for decades without ever getting off the ground and where many airports are still not computerized . . . . "  
I 'm sure the reason many overseas students go bad or give up on themselves is that they 're afraid of being unable to live up to their parents ' expectations , combined with the stress of living overseas and the pressure of getting ahead academically .  
The great Western tradition of management represented by the United States has encountered grave difficulties over the past 20 or 30 years . Under multicultural attack , the Protestant , capitalist camp has met with difficulties that it has been unable to adjust to and has had to search outside for inspiration , and the organic integration of the world economy has forced them to take a look at the rest of the world .  
Too much water for the pot : Such frequent switching was not really surprising considering there were 403 candidates fighting over 161 seats . With such a narrow chance of getting elected , even the well-oiled machine of the ruling Kuomintang ( KMT ) party was unable to smooth over the competing demands of its candidates .  
Confined to modern living spaces , most domestically-raised hawks look more like homeless puppies , " sitting listlessly in a tiny room , with sparse and thin feathers , always nervous and alert and ready to strike , but finding themselves tied down and unable to fly . "  
In line with this policy the Ministry of Justice has prepared an Anti-Corruption Plan , the four main aims of which are to make public officials " afraid to be corrupt , unable to be corrupt , unwilling to be corrupt and free of the need to be corrupt . "  
Explaining these four aims , Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou says that making people afraid to be corrupt takes strict laws ; making them unable to be corrupt takes comprehensive preventive measures ; the way to make them unwilling to be corrupt is to instil in public servants a sense of honor in uprightness and shame in corruption ; and for civil servants to have no need to be corrupt depends on giving then adequate salaries , so that they can afford to stay clean , and do not need to rely on ill-gotten gains .  
" No men , no money , no power . Even if there is just as much courage and character at the local level , and as much love for the land and people , everything just gets rubbed out , " says one individual who formerly served as a county executive . Today , comfortably ensconced in his central government official 's office , he describes his former days as " hectic from start to finish , yet I was often so frustrated or felt so powerless that I was unable to sleep at night . "  
In other words , if I was spiritually unable to pass the test , and could not conquer the terror of dying , no matter what the final outcome I would have felt very ashamed . This would be like a businessman losing even his initial investment . This sense of shame more or less inspired me to believe that I had no choice but to overcome fear .  
The inhabitants of northern Thailand adopted the scorched earth method of planting . The poppy cultivation drained off a great deal of the earth 's fertility , and they were unable to grow successive crops on the same patch of soil . Fields had to be rotated . In addition , minority people used to cut down a good many trees in order to build houses , so that what was originally a stretch of virgin forest in northern Thailand had become a bald mountain with burnt out patches in between .  
Right now the mainland economy is heated up , and the financial market has the jitters . Of course private companies ca n't compete with state-owned enterprises which have access to deep and extensive human relations networks , " Yang Donghong observes . If a state-owned establishment defaults on a loan , the loan officer holds little responsibility . But if a private business goes insolvent , the officer who sponsored the loan will almost certainly be unable to escape blame .  
Under the mandate of discouraging nude dance as a form of worship , electronically animated mannequins appeared at one point as substitutes . But though the mannequins ' figures were no less shapely than real performers , and from time to time , they would un veil their gauzy outer garments , fakes , after all , were unable to invoke the same heated response .  
Of course , everyone has their own version of the story , and it is hard to say who is right or wrong . But Li , looking at things from the point of view of enterprise development , feels that democratization in Taiwan is divorced from the rule of law , that the media is biased , that local elected officials stir up the population to win favor , and that the government - - though willing to help - - is unable to do anything . All these keep investors from moving forward . "  
In an extreme example of the principle of natural selection , only the strongest could survive the journey home , thus maintaining the durability and health of the whole species . However , when the ice receded , many brook masu salmon were left stranded , unable to return to the sea . They had no choice but to become " landlocked " salmon .  
Many elderly people who were unable to collect their subsidies ended up accusing the staff of being obstructionist . Moreover , beginning next year the central government will no longer compensate local governments for hiring social workers . It is likely that after many social workers leave their positions , the work of visiting and protecting the handicapped , women , children , and other disadvantaged groups will grind to an even slower pace .  
As Chinese know from their own books , " The Chinese armed forces held Shanghai amidst bitter fighting from August to November , and even then the Japanese were unable to completely rout the Chinese . " But in the relevant Japanese film , the viewer only gets two images - - " Fighting has spread to Shanghai , where our forces are heavily engaged , " and " Valiant naval airmen who gave their lives " - - that gloss right over actual events .  
Many young people , unable to find work immediately after completing their military service , see driving a taxi as a job which offers independence and an apparently reasonable income , so they enter this " reception center for the unemployed and waystation for those changing jobs . "  
Even though I was unable to celebrate the coming of the new spring with my kith and kin , our branch of the family did our very best , by dining on hot pot , wearing new clothes , letting my child don a little traditional suit of skullcap and cotton jacket . He was curious , and we felt joyful inside watching him . Here , the Lunar New Year is a special celebration for Chinese people , not a public holiday with time off from work .  
Given the current intense anti-drug efforts and heavy sentences , it is difficult to move drugs within Taiwan , and the price of heroin has increased as supply has been unable to keep up with demand . Depending upon how much major suppliers have in stock , one kilo can be sold for NT $ 15 million .  
Even if there are numerous homes and senior citizen centers that have been set up by government agencies and private organizations which can solve the problems of part of the elderly population , many of these places do not accept people who are indigent , too sick or aged , entirely unable to care for themselves , or who have been abandoned by their families . Most of the elderly at home alone are n't served by the homes and senior citizen centers .  
Look back at all the various ghosts-the male ghost who fears that no one will look after him , the female phantom trapped in the pain of emotional hurt and revenge , the old man unable to rest in peace in a tomb full of water , and the aggrieved " substitute seeking " ghost looking everywhere for someone to stand in for it-and you will notice something interesting : The appearance of ghosts reflects the fact that life is too short ; the tragedies of ghosts represent the persistent attachment to the mundane world .  
Again , Xue Baocha should have made an ideal wife for the son of a family of high standing , but because she is unable to communicate with Jia Baoyu on a spiritual level , although she gains social rank , she finds no sympathetic resonance , but instead only a cold , empty shell .  
However , this part is no joke : in recent years , many young mathematical and science talents , identified as gifted in high school but unable to pass the intelligence tests required to enter college , have been weeded out of the special program as a result , and are forced to take the Joint College Entrance Exams with everyone else .  
Far from his native place , Su looked back on his frustrated career and felt he had spent 30 years in a dream of illusory glory . On awakening he now found himself mired in the mud of human politics , his future uncertain . He felt like a fish caught on a hook , unable to swim up or down .  
It was n't that I had no interest in reading it , but rather was unable to get away from the constant stream of daily activities that keep me busy . Then , however , when I finally struggled through to the second chapter , I read about the idea of " active laziness . " Rinpoche says : " Our lives seem to live us , to possess their own bizarre momentum , to carry us away ; in the end we feel we have no choice or control over them . "  
Upon his arrival in Taiwan , both supporters of Taiwan independence and of reunification with mainland China staked out their own battle positions . There were some who welcomed him , while those who opposed him protested . Yet , unable to avoid being mired down in their own preconceived , subjective ideology , they could only blur the focus of the Dalai Lama 's visit . The Tibetan leader 's reaction to the scene-to voice support for " freedom of expression " - was truly worthy of admiration , and proved him to be a learned man .  
" At that time , the resource most lacking in Tainan 's social services was nursing homes for the elderly . The situation was especially bad for those who were poor or ill or whose families were unable to take care of them , " says Rev . John B . Kung , now Chancellorof the Diocese , but at that time the assistant to Bishop Cheng .  
Tzung-han is a gifted child with an IQ of 180 . The school he attended was unable to meet his educational needs and attending class was just boring for him . His teacher beat him everyday for forgetting to bring a handkerchief or toilet paper , or for losing things . He is a sensitive boy and the jealousy of his classmates hurt him .  
In his thinking , the peasants have no month of rest and the life of the fields is one of exhausting hard labor . Yet he also saw the pleasure of rural life , when the peasants have finished work and " the children who were picking melons laugh and wash their feet at the water 's edge as the sun goes down , telling outrageous stories before the evening wind picks up . " This was a simple kind of leisure that the sophisticated literati were unable to appreciate .  
" The majority of Taiwanese senior citizens in the US come here to live with their grown children , who mostly have master 's or PhD degrees , and are ' suburban Chinese . ' Because the homes of their children are spread out in middle - and high-class residential areas , unlike members of self-contained urban Chinatowns , elderly Taiwanese suffer great inconvenience if they are unable to communicate in English , " says Peter C . Lee , associate vice-president of the Office of Faculty Affairs at San Jose State University in California .  
Other possible symptoms include feelings of alienation , emotional withdrawal and a loss of interest in life . Some victims become hypersensitive , anxious , insomniac , unable to focus their attention and subject to memory lapses . Those who have lost a loved one or who themselves survived a disaster are particularly prone to feeling guilty about their own survival when others died .  
" Most people respond to a major trauma by trying to push the experience out of their conscious mind . The trauma is never spoken of and is only recognized through the symptoms the victim displays , " says Dr . Chang Ta-jen , assistant director of the Provincial Taoyuan Psychiatric Center . Chang says that as most people are unable to recognize the warning signs and symptoms , they deal with a trauma by repressing it or through displacement .  
Soldiers who had been exposed to the horrors of trench warfare , the constant threat of death , who had seen their brothers-in-arms wounded and killed while they themselves were unable to do anything about it , would shout and cry hysterically , or become suddenly rigid . Their personalities changed ; they became silent and unresponsive . Some even lost their memories or their senses .  
Although there is an impressive number of lions on display , the museum is unable to ascribe an accurate date and place of origin to each pair . For the time being , it is only able to group them into rough categories . For instance , Southern Fujianese lions from Hui'an and from Tong'an near Quanzhou are placed together , and the shigandang , which have their origins in belief in stone spirits , are placed alongside the wind lion lords which protect their owners from ravaging " evil " winds on small southern islands .  
In fact , some experts feel that since most enterovirus cases in Taiwan are in rural areas , it is still the result of poor hygiene . Nonetheless , it is also true that children today live too cleanly : they lack natural sources of infection in their environment , so that when they do meet with a virus they are quite unable to fend it off .  
According to regulations , when the volume of effluent exceeds the approved maximum by 10% , a report of this fact and an application to increase the approved maximum must be submitted . But the approval process takes six months and the volume of waste water was continuing to grow at an explosive rate . As such , the park was unable to avoid exceeding the stipulated volume .  
The Ministry of Education also has plans to establish " community colleges , " but their main goal is to give those students from the technical and vocational educational stream who are unable to squeeze in through the narrow doors of the conventional universities an extra opportunity to gain a university-level qualification ; the aims do not seem very different from those behind the establishment of the old night schools or today 's Open University .  
Even for Mr . and Mrs . Chang Erh-lien , who had run a nursery for nearly 30 years and considered themselves very knowledgeable about preschool children , the reality of foster parenting was far different from what they had been anticipating . Says Mr . Chang , " These children are really very different from most kids . " The first child they accepted , aged two years and nine months , displayed severe developmental regression , and was completely unable to control his bowel or bladder movements .  
If we compare him to other Nativist writers who address the tragedy of the rural elderly unable to adapt to the modern industrial world , we note that Huang is reluctant to expose his elderly characters to unmitigated suffering .  
Facing an uncertain fate , and caught between the northern and southern governments , parliamentarians were unable to hold meaningful sessions , nor could they collect any regular salaries , so it is no surprise that these early parliamentarians , many idealistic to start with , ended up giving in to temptation . There is nothing new under the sun about intellectuals being sullied by the realities of hard-nosed politics .  
To avoid people being denied the right to medical self-determination because they are unable to express their will , anyone over 20 years of age and of full capacity may make an " advance declaration " of their wishes ( also known as a " living will " ) , and may appoint a medical representative who is empowered to sign a consent form on their behalf if they are unable to express themselves .  
Music also interferes with the contemplative process of liberating oneself from worldly concerns , and even Mahakasyapa , who always accompanied the Buddha , was unable to calm down when preaching to the lovely sound of a zither-while the other 500 divine beings present simply lost their heads and started dancing . When former music students take monastic vows they renounce forever their beloved pianos and violins , because everything makes way for the overriding priority of breaking the cycle of rebirth .  
The special new trash bags , which come in six sizes , are not cheap-NT $ 7 per bag for the standard small size . It is estimated that this will result in a threefold increase in residential garbage fees compared with the old system . Just as the scheme was about to get off the ground , the supply of new trash bags was " held back " from the market by distributors . Residents were unable to obtain the bags from local stores , triggering further complaints about the new system .  
It is necessary because within a single nation , different local governments take in different amounts of revenue due to their unique geographic , environmental , and economic conditions . The central government can not sit idly by while people in certain areas are unable to enjoy basic government services , so it uses various means to alleviate revenue shortfalls where they exist . The Tax Redistribution Fund is one such method .  
For example Master Hui Neng , despite being illiterate , was known for his skill at literary discussion and the composition of religious verse . It was Hui Neng who left his cassock on a rock atop Dayu Ridge , from where the monk who was following him was unable to move it . The external actions of those who had attained enlightenment often strayed into the realm of what for normal people would be " miracles . "  
The PRC is reported to be the main cause of the diplomatic rupture . Macedonia has been beset in recent years by both internal and external threats . Fighting connected with the separatist movement in neighboring Kosovo has generated a mass exodus of refugees into Macedonia , while the Macedonian government has been unable to quell a domestic rebellion by ethnic Albanians .  
( Chang Chin-ju / tr . by Robert Taylor ) The APEC economic leaders ' meeting was concluded on 21 October . Regrettably , because Taiwan and this year 's host , mainland China , were unable to agree on Taiwan 's choice of representative , and because at a ministerial press conference prior to the leaders ' meeting PRC foreign minister Tang Jiaxuan prevented ROC economic affairs minister Lin Hsin-yi from speaking , the ROC government decided to withdraw from the summit .  
One day , acting upon the advice of his ox , the Oxherd retrieved and hid an article of celestial garb he had come upon by the riverside . The Weaving Maid , unable to return to heaven because she no longer possessed her celestial garb , agreed to marry the earnest and straightforward Oxherd . With the husband tilling the fields and the wife weaving her cloth , the couple set about raising two sons .  
It was n't until consumption reached 150% of replacement levels in May that it finally issued a completely unexpected warning . Part of the problem is that three of Taiwan Power 's liquefied natural gas storage tanks have never been put into use because of technological defects unresolved by their Japanese contractor . The power shortage has also led to widespread suspicions that Taiwan Power is technologically inept and unable to handle crises . As a result , its chairman Lin Wen-yuan tendered his resignation .  
From the moment they say " I do , " they should be ready in their hearts and willing to take the bad along with the good . Why is it , then , that today 's couples , free to choose their partners , find it so difficult to honor their vows ? Some find it impossible to deal with hardship , and others , even after struggling to make it through a difficult stretch , are somehow unable to enjoy the sweet yields of their struggle .  
For example , " amniotic fluid embolism " is a dangerous obstetric emergency that can occur without any prior warning or symptoms , and may cause the sudden death of a mother during or after labor . Kao Tien-fu , a director of the Association of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the ROC and convener of its medical disputes committee , has encountered two cases , and sadly was unable to save either of the women .  
Not far off the east coast of Taiwan the continental shelf falls away into an ocean trench thousands of meters deep , so bluefin arriving from across the Pacific have to come close inshore to find shallow waters to spawn . Their newly hatched fry are unable to hunt or swim for themselves , so they need waters that are rich in plankton and have strong currents . The North Equatorial Current and the Kuroshio Current pass by eastern Taiwan , creating an area of high primary productivity .  
However , hopes are one thing , but reality is another . According to the analysis in the survey report , the number of children hoped for or considered ideal by married women with a college-level or better education , and by employed married women , is on average greater than two . But most are unable to fully realize their childbearing hopes or ideals , because of the high cost of raising children in terms of mental and physical energy , material resources and opportunity cost .  
Trend expert John Naisbitt , in his High Tech , High Touch : Technology and Our Search for Meaning , discusses the threat posed to American youth by violent virtual reality games ( especially lifelike combat games ) , stating that they render children unable to distinguish between real and virtual . This in turn has generated a slew of on-campus firearms attacks that have left American society reeling .  
In the sexual spectrum , there is a wide range of colors . To divide male and female into two extreme categories of masculine and feminine would make us unable to understand and appreciate disadvantaged groups . "  
The war not only left Vietnam with countless deformed children , but also greatly hindered its economic development . Today its national income per capita is only US $ 600 , less than one-tenth of that in Taiwan , and the state is unable to provide sufficient medical resources and personnel to treat so many patients .  
Why is it that the WHO , which emphasizes pursuing human health across all racial , religious , economic , and social boundaries , is unable to bring Taiwan within its international network ?  
The impression that people are still unable to grasp the meaning of installation art is naturally one of the first addressed by the author . At the very beginning Yao seeks to make clear the purpose and meaning of such art with the following definition : " In general terms installation art refers to an expressive method not a style . In the main it focuses on artistic behavior or approaches undertaken in a physical or conceptual space .  
In order to better understand the English-language education conundrum facing elementary schools throughout Taiwan , Control Yuan members Lu Hsi-mu , Lin Shih-chi , and Yin Shih-hao compiled an investigative report entitled " Problems in Elementary School English Education " at the close of last year . In it they discovered that rural schools were quite often unable to hire accredited English instructors .  
Sun Yung-ching observes that " in industrial education , time is money . " The central reason why technical and vocational students are unable to meet the demands of industry is that the equipment they need to train on is too expensive . Schools are unable to meet the financial burden of constantly upgrading facilities and industry is unwilling to receive students for training in their plants , on the one hand because of the possible impact on output , but also out of genuine concern that students could damage precision machinery .  
Wen Shih-jen , deputy CEO of computer manufacturer Inventec , has likened the importance of cooperation between technical and vocational education and industry to laying the " last mile " in establishing the Internet : " The final section needed to ensure the Internet is linked with actual users is known as the ' last mile . ' Without this section users would be unable to get online and the Internet would be a wasted opportunity . "  
Recently a parent unable to find his spare mobile phone was told by his junior-high-school-aged son : " Sorry Pop , but I already sold it over the Internet ! " So dazzling is the array of products online , in fact , that it can make ordinarily normal people do strange things .  
The established publication and distribution mechanism could n't keep up with the needs of the market or with the changing face of the industry . Now the mainland publishing industry is overburdened upstream and overwhelmed downstream : the production of published works is like a torrential river rushing to the ocean-but on reaching the estuary ( distribution channels ) , it can do no more than trickle in . Some merges into the " second channel , " while the rest overflows everywhere , unable to smoothly enter the ocean that is the literary market .  
In terms of agreement , both sides realize that although democratic government is essentially " representative government , " duly elected representatives and officials are sometimes unable to carry out fully and impartially the duties entrusted to them by the electorate . To correct the insufficiencies of " indirect democracy " one must thus rely on the " direct democracy " of the popular referendum . This is an important element in the deepening and reform of the democratic process .  
In the first place , they maintain , people are driven by their own individual interests and are frequently unable to take the broad view in considering public affairs . This " me first " attitude exacerbates conflicts of interest . Secondly , to avoid referendum issues being controlled by special-interest groups , laws must be passed to regulate public announcements , provide for the balanced presentation of information and guarantee the free flow of information .  
Suo points out that in recent years , the proportion of reported TB cases that have been changed from " suspected " to " confirmed negative " has increased from 10% to 20% . Some patients are blindly given medication even though it is unclear whether they in fact have contracted tuberculosis . Other patients , unable to obtain specialized medical care , spread M . tuberculosis while wandering from one regular health care institution to another .  
Cheng points out that although such ideas have a contagious element about them , people who are mentally healthy or who have a strong " psychological immunity " will not easily be " infected " by suicide reports . But people who are themselves suffering from severe depression or who have suffered a serious setback in life , are more likely to be contaminated by an unhealthy suicidal frame of mind and to be unable to free themselves from it .  
Today , because staying alive is not hard , people are unable to find meaning in life itself . Yet we must look for meaning in life itself , " comments social critic Nanfang Shuo . He notes that feelings of fatigue , emptiness , waste , and futility with respect to life have become an unavoidable existential question for young men and women .  
Writer Li Ang was n't bothered that she was unable to make it to the top this time . She figured this was a perfect foreshadowing of a future trip up the mountain when the azaleas would be in bloom . " I 've traveled all over the world . I never imagined that the most beautiful spot was right here under my feet . "  
" Sadly , the average person does n't know very much about this , " laments Nelson Yang . Because in the past mountain climbers or naturalists neglected the history of the opening and development of Taiwan 's mountain areas , people have focused only on the flatlands and shoreline that make up just one fourth of the total land area of the island . They have little knowledge of the length and breadth of the mountains and are unable properly to understand the development of Taiwan 's ethnic and cultural diversity .  
Professor Tsai Hung-chin , recently retired from Taiwan National University 's Agricultural Extension Department , goes further . He points out that Taiwan agricultural products have for some time tended to earn low profits and that farm income has had no guarantees . Even if high-quality products are raised , in light of the multiple layers of exploitation existing throughout the sales system and the dumping of low-priced products on the market , farmers are frequently unable to earn a profit .  
As for the current situation , there is perhaps no immediate solution to the two major problems of " small-scale " farming that is unable to recover investment capital and the aging of the manpower in the agricultural sector . But as for improving production and marketing , this is something the government can apply its efforts toward .  
Furthermore , modern people may lack ecological and environmental knowledge . Or they may know that natural resources are limited and that biodiversity is important , but be unable to refuse materialistic temptations , lack the time to recycle , and be powerless to refuse their children 's requests for the fashionable pet of the moment . More knowledge does not necessarily help in easing environmental deterioration .  
Later , due to my persistence , after they had considered things for some time , finally a letter arrived from the editorial department . It said that in consideration of my good reputation in the scientific community , they would publish the paper , despite being unable to find any evidence supportive of my conclusion . However , the text would include a special disclaimer , indicating that I was solely responsible for the content , and that the editors did not back up my claims in any way .  
Changhua City has a long history , but now it seems to have hit a wall , unable to get beyond its current population level or its geographical limitations , stuck running second to Taichung . But the past was different . Old Changhua once held the spotlight , especially its train station . A popular rest stop in the long north-south train journey , the station made a huge impression on all who visited it , and was the pride of Changhua .  
Lin still remembers that when he was in the seventh grade , tuition fees were NT $ 200 . Because his mother was unable to come up with the very substantial amount needed to pay tuition for him and his four elder brothers , she sent the children to school with NT $ 50 each , instructing them to discuss with their teachers the possibility of making an initial , partial tuition payment . The young Lin Pen-po felt so ashamed at not having the full amount that he lingered outside the school , not daring to enter .  
If the present generation is unable to defeat growing poverty and secure employment opportunities for the already vast global army of the indigent , it will be impossible to ensure the peace and wellbeing in the developed regions of the world .  
Official development assistance , so important for developing countries that were unable to attract private financial flows , continued to decline both in real terms and in proportion to the gross national product ( GNP ) of developing countries . 
Because controls on growing trade and communication had been unable to keep pace with organized criminal activities , there was an urgent need to elaborate an improved response by criminal justice authorities world wide .
