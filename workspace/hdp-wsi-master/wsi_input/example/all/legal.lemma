Although this is an extreme case in a tiny minority , it is sufficient to show : Reducing the heavy academic burden on students and fostering their fine psychological quality and legal concepts are a pressing task .  
Because of their narrow education values , lopsided views on quality , and outmoded notions on talent , the education department and parents tend to one-sidedly pursue enrollment quotas and overlook students ' psychological quality and moral character and their disciplinary and legal education , thus placing the value of course grades above human values and replacing the objective of education with the goal of human and social development .  
The work on various fronts and of various departments , which is led by our party , especially that of the political and legal affairs departments , should persistently serve the people heart and soul and should focus on tackling problems which have aroused strong resentment among the people and masses , such as unfair trials , lack of forceful enforcement , bad images , and so on .

In furthering socialist democratic political construction , the current NPC and its standing committee revised the Village Committee Organization Law , and formulated and adopted the Law on Administrative Appeals . With these and the Administrative Litigation Law , Administrative Punishment Law , Administrative Supervision Law , and State Compensation Law formulated in earlier years , our country has basically established a complete legal system on administrative punishment and relief .  
In his report Li Peng also discussed the main tasks for this year and next in better relying on the people 's deputies to do a good job in Standing Committee work , unfolding thorough and protracted education in socialist democracy and legal system , further developing a new situation in exchanges and cooperation with foreign and international parliaments and assemblies , and continuing to step up the building of the Standing Committee itself .  
The aforementioned matters are major matters that concern the state 's basic political system , economic system , and civil , criminal , and other legal systems .  
the building of socialist spiritual civilization and of democracy and legal system was further intensified ; and social stability was maintained .  These achievements are the results of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core taking charge of the overall situation and providing correct leadership , and the results of all levels throughout the country implementing the central policy decision on expanding domestic demand and the series of guidelines and policies , and working hard with concerted efforts .  
Deputy Tian Chengzhong , secretary of Pingdingshan City CPC Committee in Henan , said that ideological and political work includes many aspects such as education content , ways and means , leadership system , operational mechanism , component force , and position carriers [ zhen di zai ti , 7109-0966-6528-7555 ] , and is closely lined with structural reform , the building of the legal system , and cultural construction .  
In addition , the judicial contingent also tried a number of criminal cases of major impact , sternly punished criminal activities that harmed the order of the market economy , thereby protecting legal rights and interests of various economic sectors in the midst of reform and opening up , and ensuring healthy development of our country 's economy .

Efforts must be made to strengthen the education and rectification of the judicial force .  
Training program should be enhanced .  We should help grassroots cadres in rural areas raise their awareness and abilities to lead the masses to readjust the economic structure , and to develop the rural economy , help them raise policy level , enhance legal system concept , change work style , particularly help them raise their levels and capabilities on the correct understanding and handling of the people 's internal contradiction in rural areas in the new period .  
Qiao Xiaoyang said : Tremendous achievements have been scored in our country 's legislation work , but some problems have also cropped up in practical legislative work as legislation progresses at an accelerated pace and the number of laws enacted multiplies , such as legislation in excess of legal power , conflict and contradiction between different laws , regulations , and rules , low legislative quality , and lack of democratic procedures in legislation .  
The purpose of formulating a relatively complete civil code on the basis of the existing single-item laws being relatively perfect is to better meet the needs for the development of a socialist market economy and further protect the legitimate rights and interests of citizens and legal persons .  
Being the largest multilateral economic organization for the standardized international economic and trade rules in the contemporary world , the WTO has formulated and implemented a complete set of multilateral trade rules with a very extensive coverage , which almost involve all facets of the contemporary world 's economy and trade and have legal effect and standards .  
And it is being unfolded at a time when various contradictions in reforms and construction are interwoven ; a structure , mechanism , legal system , and management system that meet the demands of the development of socialist market economy await gradual establishment and perfection ; and numerous negative corruption phenomena are prone to occur .  
the vanguard zones of the socialist market economic structure ; and the demonstration zones of sustainable development , which will take the lead in achieving modernization characterized by basically prosperous economy , optimum structure , perfect facilities , beautiful environment , integrated urban and rural areas , sound legal system , and civilized society .

The forum maintained that the forms applied to conduct the education on the legal system for youngsters should be suitable to the youngsters ' cognitive features , and efforts should be made to make the education rich in content and to conduct it in a lively and varied manner .  
These countries stressed that the United States does not have the authority to criticize the human rights situation of other countries , and this kind of application of the domestic law of one nation to the legal system of other nations is not only no in accordance with international law , but is not helpful to realizing mutual respect and peaceful coexistence among nations .  
The publication and implementation of " the Provisions " indicate that China has advanced a big step in developing legal system governing public security and border patrol .  They have very important significance in demonstrating China 's efforts to strengthen the administration over vessels along the coasts , to prevent and crack down on marine crimes , and to safeguard social order along coastal regions and at sea .  
It has put forward the three anti-corruption work patterns of cadres ' honest self-governing , investigation and handling of cases of discipline violation and broken law , and redressing unhealthy tendencies in government and industry .

In accordance with the DPRK Constitution , which was amended in 1998 , DPRK has allowed official organs , enterprises , or organizations to cooperate with the foreign legal persons or individuals in operation and has encouraged all types of enterprise operational activities in its designated " special economic zones . "  The DPRK has also begun working hard to improve its investment environment .  
conducted education and training with strenuous efforts , established and improved various forms of educational and training systems , and continuously raised the political and professional qualities and legal awareness of policemen , thereby effectively improving the fighting capacity of the public security force .  
Fourth , it is necessary to further improve the body of public security laws and regulations and comprehensively push forward the codification of public security work into the legal system and the building of the police force .  The 15th national party congress put forward the objectives and requirements for establishing and improving the socialist legal system .  It is necessary to go by these objectives and requirements and cater to the practical needs of public security work , making timely adjustments to the plans for , and pace of , public security legislative work ;  
In the subjective aspect , a small number of communists and party cadres became corrupt and degenerated because they did not study , did not stress politics , and then began to vacillate in their ideal and belief .  Therefore , to effectively stop corruption , in addition to improving the legal system and the supervision mechanisms , it is also necessary to enhance political , ideological , and moral education .  
Starting from the reform and institutional building , we have put into practice the systems of operating land auction , " two lines of revenue and expenditure , " government procurement , and so on , opened tangible construction markets and property rights trading markets , vigorously carried out the measure of making the administrative affairs , the village affairs , the enterprise affairs , and the social public affairs known to the public and , through the amplification of the legal system , took great pains to check the breeding of corrupt phenomena from their sources .  
Annette Lu is a so-called master of law , but unexpectedly she knows nothing about the history and geography of her own nation .  She has ignored logic , reasoning and legal principles , and wantonly spread splittist ideas .  This has really disgraced her scholarly dignity , made a laughing stock of herself and let herself be cursed from generation to generation .  
This kind of " international interference " can only be applicable within the commonwealth of sovereign states basically sharing similar political systems , legal standards , and value concepts and reaching a common view on human rights .  
Li Peng said : Since the standing committee was established in each of the local people 's congresses at and above the county level , local people 's congresses , holding legislative powers , and their standing committees have formulated a batch of local laws and regulations .  They have made a positive , catalytic contribution to the consummation of the socialist legal system and to promoting the development of various local causes .  
The separatist remarks spread by Annette Lu [ Lu Xiulian ] were in complete disregard of facts , ran counter to legal principle , and were total idiotic nonsense . "  
As a result of over 20 years of reform and development , there has been great improvement of our comprehensive national strength , social productive forces , and people 's living standards ; we have progressed by leaps and bounds in building socialist spiritual civilization , democracy , and legal system ; and the whole world has seen the great vitality and vigor demonstrated by socialism in China .  
The Chinese government practices a policy of respecting and protecting freedom of religious belief , pursuing the principle of keeping religion , political power and education separate .  The country protects normal religious activities , as well as the legal rights and interests of religious organizations .  The different religions have equal standing and live together harmoniously , and there is mutual respect and unified harmony between the citizens who practice religion and those who do not believe in any religion .  
He said : Now we already have copyright laws and pertinent criminal laws throughout the country .  In 1998 we further published laws and regulations against the smuggling of pirated goods .  We will also use for reference relevant foreign laws as well as laws in Hong Kong and Macao Regions , in strengthening administrative norms and making judicial interpretations of the antipiracy crackdown to make full use of legal weapons to crack down on piracy and protect intellectual property rights .  
The judicial and administrative sector has a huge force formed by 110,000 lawyers , 30,000 notaries public , 120,000 grassroots legal service workers , one-million mediatory groups , and 10-million people 's mediators .  This force plays a very important role in safeguarding social stability .  
After two years ' efforts , the " 148 " legal service hotline , which originated from Shandong , has spread all over the country .  It has become an important channel for party and government leaders and the public to know and understand judicial and administrative work , and an important means to bring the complex functional advantages of grassroots judicial and administrative departments into play and to strengthen grassroots judicial and administrative work .  
The " 148 " hotline is a socialized , mass , complex legal service project , which needs to be run after an operational pattern characterized by persistent , unified leadership of the party committee , close support by related departments , and comprehensive coordination among judicial and administrative organs .  
ensure social stability at the grassroots level , ensure the security of grassroots political power , and ensure normal local economic and social development .  By achieving these we will make new and greater contributions to the acceleration of the development of democracy and the legal system at the grassroots level , to the implementation of the basic strategy of ruling the country by law , and to the accelerated construction of a socialist state ruled by law .  
In light of the rampant momentum of illegal publishing activities , in December 1998 , with emphasis from the central leading comrades , the Director of the Working Group on " Eliminating Pornography and Fighting Illegal Publications " , Wang Maolin , convened a conference attended by a dozen or so central organizations .  The conference studies ways to make full use of legal weapons and increase the use of criminal penalties .  
Guided by the central departments concerned , the Hong Kong Garrison persistently regarded studying or understanding the law as a basic project ; intensified both legal education and behavioral guidance ; and enabled both the articles and spirit of the Hong Kong Garrison Law to take root in the hearts of all the officers and men and become a conscious sense among them as well .  
On 4 December 1999 , the court of final appeal of the special administrative region unanimously gave the ruling that the interpretation by the NPC Standing Committee is legal and in keeping with the constitution .  All those who really are concerned about the future prosperity and stability of Hong Kong held that Hong Kong 's judicial independence has not changed in the least by the interpretation .  
Meanwhile , military lawyers , as political workers , should consider the ultimate goal of their legal services as one of serving the armed forces ' political and ideological construction and increasing the relevancy and effectiveness of ideological and political work in the new period while performing their professional duties .  
Like their civilian counterparts , the legal affairs that military lawyers have to handle involve those relevant to criminal , civil , economic , administrative , maritime , and financial laws , and so they must be totally familiar with the laws and regulations of the country so that they can properly handle the legal affairs in the armed forces and legal affairs that involve both military and civilian departments ;  
Only when military lawyers are fully familiar with the country 's laws and regulations as well as military regulations and rules and understand the spirit of their legislation can they provide military leaders and organizations at different levels with proper legal advice , differentiate competent and incompetent servicemen , differentiate lawful and unlawful behaviors , and help servicemen perform their duties more competently .  
In dealing with both inflation and deflation , the party central leadership and the State Council consistently gave play to the role of the market as the foundation for distributing resources , comprehensively employed various economic levers , employed necessary legal and administrative means as supplements , and accumulated rich experience in conducting macroeconomic readjustment and control .  
our socialist system is not perfect , the socialist market economic system and socialist legal system are still immature and unsound , while decadent feudal and capitalist ideologies and small-scale production as a force of habit still have widespread influence on society .  To be sure , there are many tasks for us to undertake during the initial stage of socialism .  
In the wake of the development of the economic structural reform and socialist modernization in China , and in view of objective needs , General Secretary Jiang Zemin expressly pointed out during the 15th CPC National Congress : on the premise that the four cardinal principles are upheld , we must continue to forward the reform of the political structure , further expand socialist democracy , develop a sound socialist legal system , rule the country by law , and build a socialist legal state .  
It is worth mentioning that the Fifth " Five-Year Plan " period was timed with the Third " Five-Year " campaign launched in China to spread legal knowledge among the citizens , which was held in the course of China 's building a socialist market economic system and under the great backdrop of the party putting forward , at the 15th CPC national congress , the proposal of administering the country according to laws and of building China into a socialist country that is ruled by laws .  
The number of leading cadres at prefectural and city ( departmental and bureau ) level that received regular legal training topped 176,000 .  
Through studying the Constitution and acquiring basic legal knowledge , the broad mass of citizens gradually acquired the consciousness of exercising rights according to laws , taking part in democratic management , fulfilling legal obligations , and maintaining their own legitimate rights and interests .  And there initially emerged in society the excellent trend of studying laws , abiding by laws , exercising laws , and maintaining laws .  
the legal system of market economy is still unsound , the phenomenon of corruption is spread wide , and there are plenty of ecological environmental problems and so on .  All these are pressing practical issues with an impact on our country 's national economic and social development , which must be tackled through market-oriented reforms .  
During Comrade Wei Jianxing 's visit to Germany , Moldova , Finland , and the State of Mongolia , in addition to meeting with their presidents , prime ministers and parliamentary speakers , he also held talks and had meetings with major opposition party leaders , exchanged views with them on bilateral relations and major international issues of common concern , and examined the questions of technical innovations and building the legal system , which exerted a very good influence .  
Issuing and implementing the " armament regulation " will play a positive and important role in profoundly carrying out the strategic military principles in the new period , reinforcing the centralized leadership in the armament work , standardizing the operating mechanism in armament work and establishing and completing the legal system of armament work .  
On the contrary , we must be clearly aware that once the economically and culturally backward nations establish a capitalist system , they must spend appropriately long time to complete the tasks that must be completed during the capitalist stage : socialization , commercialization , industrialization , and modernization of production , as well as the establishing of appropriate democratic legal system , science and culture .  
" Special privilege " mentality , patriarchal style , obsession of hierarchy and other feudal things , in conjunction with the corrosion by decadent capitalist ideas and culture , have inflicted damage on the party building with regard to ideology , organization , and style of work , such that some leading cadres have obscured the nature and purpose of the party , even to the deterioration of the socialist democratic legal system .  
However , China 's current legal system is yet to be refined .  According to the guideline set by the 15th CPC National Congress , by 2010 , China should establish a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics .  As such , legislation is still an arduous task lying ahead for people 's congresses at all levels and their standing committees .  
Holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping theory , continuing to step up the building of democracy and the legal system , and building China into a country ruled by law having a high degree of socialist democracy and a sound socialist legal system , are an important assurance for the Chinese nation to realize the grand goal of rejuvenation , as well as an important contribution of the Chinese nation to mankind 's historical progress .  
In order to attain their unspeakable aims , cults always take advantage of loopholes in state laws and social management policies ; to the outside world they are cloaked in religious practice and working to improve people 's health , while internally they draw up strict regulations and prohibitions , and establish a strictly graded illegal organizational structure in a vain attempt to form a " secret kingdom " backed by " religious " beliefs outside the framework of a society with a legal system .  
- - We will perfect the mechanism for withdrawing enterprises from the market ; comprehensively resort to economic , legal , and other necessary administrative means to undertake bankruptcy proceedings against those chronically loss-making enterprises with debts in excess of assets and with no hopes of climbing out of the red ; actively and prudently close down those mines that are exhausting resources ; continue to close down the " five small industrial enterprises " in accordance with the law ; and eliminate backward production capability .  
Since the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy , we have been paying full attention to regulating people 's conduct with legal means in order to meet the requirements of developing the socialist market economy .  Meanwhile , rule by law has been defined as a basic strategy for ruling the country .  
They practiced a double standard on the issue of handling heretical cults .  In its own country , the US has adopted resolute measures to deal with heretic cult organizations such as the " Planet " and " Branch Davidians " heretic cults .  However , in the name of " safeguarding human rights , " it has made a fuss about China 's legal activities to outlaw the heretic cult of " Falungong , " and this will gradually become an integral part of its China strategy .  
These Interim Procedures have replaced the non-selection resettlement model based on assignment with a model that combines assignment with self-assignment .  This model will help make full use of the expertise of retired cadres and help these cadres obtain their desired goal .  This model also provides a legal guarantee the reasonable distribution of high-quality professional human resources .  
Judging from the present condition , for a considerably long time to come , Sino-foreign joint ventures will still be our principal method to attract foreign direct investments .  There is no doubt that improving the relevant legal systems , freeing such enterprises from unwarranted control and making things easy for them , and eliminating the negative impact of legal factors on the investment environment will greatly enhance the confidence and enthusiasm of overseas investors and quasi-investors and touch off another round of investment high tide .  
The economic , legal , and necessary administrative means should be used comprehensively to shut down enterprises which produce goods of inferior quality , waste resources , cause serious pollution , and do not have production safety conditions ; eliminate backward equipment , technology , and techniques ; cut down on surplus production capacity , and prevent these enterprises from reviving .  
To put it in concrete terms , first , we will institute a standard modern enterprise system , encouraging large and medium-sized SOEs to practice the joint-stock system , amplify the legal person management structure , and change their operational mechanism through such forms as standardized listing in the stock markets , joint ventures between Chinese and foreign investors , mutual share-holding , and so on . 
First , macroeconomic regulation and control will be intensified and improved in a bid to maintain macroeconomic stability , push forward the strategic economic structural adjustment , and guarantee the country 's economic security through working out economic and social development plans and macroeconomic policies that primarily depend on the application of economic and legal means . 
Professor Yu frankly admitted that as a developing country with a population of 1.2-billion , China 's per capita natural resources are comparatively scant , its current economic and cultural development is imbalanced , its legal system is not complete , and , in the process of law enforcement , some laws are not strictly abided by and some laws are not strictly enforced - - all these contribute to the non-perfect human rights situation in China .  
To carry out the struggle to " strike hard " and put things , it is necessary to build a contingent of political and legal workers into a strong contingent of political and legal workers who are up to standard in politics , highly disciplined , perfect in work styles , proficient in professional work , and firm in administering justice .  
Party committees and governments at all levels must provide the political and legal front with carefully selected cadres , who are ideologically and politically sound , proficient in professional work , bold and resolute , and able to meet the needs of the political and legal front , and strengthen the leading bodies at all levels of the political and legal front .  
The editorial says : The United States claims to be a country being most respectful to democracy and legal system in the world and always talks about human rights and law .  However , its military plane wantonly violated international law and paid no attention to the territories and sovereignty of another country .  
The meeting noted that economic order is an important symbol reflecting the operating quality of the national economy , the level of social and economic management , and the extent of legal system building , it is an important factor with an impact on economic development and social stability .  
Everybody who has little , elementary knowledge of the international law knows that the exclusive economic zone is the major outcome of the long-term struggle waged by numerous developing countries for their legal rights and interests after World War II .  
According to the relevant stipulations of the 1982 " UN Convention on the Law of the Sea , " exclusive economic zones are neither territorial waters nor international waters , and they themselves have formed a category of regions with a special legal regime .  
To exercise sovereign right and exclusive jurisdiction over its exclusive economic zone , the coastal state is entitled to draw up relevant laws and rules to restrict the overflight freedom enjoyed by another state 's aircraft in the airspace over the exclusive economic zone .  Doing so , the coastal state can safeguard the aerial traffic order and flight safety in the zone and protect its legal rights and interest .  
China 's military plane tailed after and conducted surveillance over the US military reconnaissance plane , which intruded into the airspace of our coastal exclusive economic zone to conduct military reconnaissance activities , according to the international law and China 's law .  Exercising sovereign right in the exclusive economic zone , and safeguarding the national defense security is just and legal behavior .  
Jin Chanrong said : Currently , the political and diplomatic channels remain the main channels for solving the plane collision incident .  The denunciations made by the Chinese Communist side against the US side 's violation of international law and the mainland 's domestic laws were mainly aimed at supporting its own position , not aimed at taking any legal action .  
Although a number of developing countries or countries making an economic switch are practicing a market economy legal system , the market is unable to operate efficiently because the law and rule of law is not on a sound basis ; on the one hand lack of clarity in individual and enterprise property rights means that economic efficiency falls , contracts can not be effectively enforced , and disputes can not be settled in fair fashion ;  
In 2000 , the Ninth Five-Year for National Economic and Social Development was successfully completed , the development of the western region got off to a good start , and the economy developed in a healthy way .  During that year , China 's democratic and legal systems were continuously strengthened , and its human rights situation maintained a good momentum of development .  
In light of China 's national conditions and according to the people 's wishes , the Chinese government aims to build a democratic and modernized country with a high level of civilization under the rule of law , and actively learn from the beneficial experiences and cultural achievements of other countries .  While maintaining social stability , it also aims to expedite development , strengthen the democratic legal system , promote spiritual civilization , and continuously push forward the development of the human rights cause .  
Overseas Chinese leaders expressed indignation at the hegemonic act of the U.S . spy plane 's collision with a Chinese military aircraft and the illegal invasion by the American plane of Chinese territorial air space and territory .  They reproached the United States one after another , saying that overseas Chinese and the Chinese people commonly consider this incident to wholly be the legal and moral responsibility of the United States , that the attitude of the United States is unreasonable , and its way of handling the situation inferior .  
We must build , in accordance with the requirement of " enforcing laws strictly and rendering warmhearted service " that was set by General Secretary Jiang , our contingent of political and legal workers into a strong contingent of political and legal workers who are up to standard in politics , highly disciplined , perfect in work styles , proficient in professional work , and firm in administering justice .  
The Standing Committee has also made a assessment of how administrative organs , judicial organs , and procuratorial organs carried out administration according to law and how the corporate law is implemented and an assessment of the work reports submitted by the cadres , who are selected and appointed by local people 's congresses , on how they discharged their legal functions and powers , enforced laws , and did official duties honestly and diligently .  
The Chinese Government has also revised the " Law on Regional Autonomy of Ethnic Groups , " adopted more policies for providing necessary preferential and favored treatments in the financial , monetary , taxation , and foreign trade aspects for areas exercising regional autonomy of ethnic groups , and provided a legal guarantee for the great development of the western areas .  
The circular stressed : The trial of cases should guarantee that basic facts are clear , basic evidence is sufficient and reliable .  It is necessary to strictly guarantee that facts and evidence are fully verified , the legal procedures and the application of the laws are proper and sound , thus guaranteeing the quality of case handling .  
Apart from similar stipulations on a country 's territorial airspace and legal status , the " International Civil Aviation Treaty , " concluded in Chicago in 1944 , in order to strictly classify the different legal status between civil and military aircraft , clearly stipulates in Article 3 : " The national aircraft of a signatory must not fly over the airspace of another signatory or land on its territory without special permission or other form of permission and abide by its rules . "  
The entire process of the incident was connected to historical , legal , cultural , language , and religious issues , and the only thing that was conspicuously absent was its military aspect .  US Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld did not even appear in public during the development of the incident .  It was not until 13 April that he held a news conference at which he complained that it was only the Chinese Communist plane 's provocative act that was the underlying cause of the collision .  
Moreover , it is necessary to use the positive and negative examples to conduct vivid and lively education on legal system in light of the realities of the economic and social life so that the vast number of people will know how to safeguard their legitimate interests and rights with the law and dare to wage the struggle against all sorts of conducts in violation of law .  
While instituting and developing a socialist legal system suited to the socialist market economy , we need to institute a moral system commensurate with it , and be good at merging the basic , important moral requirements into relevant laws and regulations and into various kinds of management in society , so as to ceaselessly promote the formation and perfection of the socialist ideological and ethical system .  
Contents in the preface of the revised law include the guiding position of Deng Xiaoping Theory and call for adhering to reform , opening up , taking the socialist road with Chinese characteristics , developing a socialist market economy and strengthening the building of socialist democracy and legal system .  The revised law has clearly defined the system of regional national autonomy as a basic political system of our country .  
We must improve the administrative structures of legal entities in state-owned commercial banks , appoint supervisory councils , establish supervisory mechanisms in accord with the market economy , set up business associations in various financial sectors , and implement prudent accounting systems in conformity with international practices .  
Zhu Rongji emphasized that in the entire process of the modernization of Shanghai , it is necessary to adhere to the principle of laying equal emphasis on both material and spiritual civilizations , and be strong in both , further strengthen the building of the socialist spiritual civilization , democracy and legal system , and promote comprehensive social progress .  
It has been learned that the major tasks of these coordination centers are : to coordinate work in handling legal issues involving units under the General Staff Headquarters , their servicemen and servicemen 's family members and to assist local governments and judicial departments as well as provincial military districts and sub-districts and the people 's armed forces departments of respective provinces to properly handle in good time legal issues involving the military and local people and to provide legal service for military units , servicemen , and servicemen 's family members .  
Zeng Qinghong pointed out : In commanding various rural work with the important thinking of " three represents , " we must devote major efforts to advancing the building of socialist spiritual civilization , democracy , and the legal system and safeguarding social stability in the countryside to provide an ideological guarantee and good sociopolitical environment for rural economic and social development .  
It is necessary to unremittingly enhance rural grassroots cadres ' ability to lead the masses in readjusting the economic structure and developing the rural economy , try hard to improve their understanding of policy , enhance their legal sense , and try hard to raise their level and ability in correctly understanding and handling the people 's internal contradictions in the new period .  
It is necessary to actively promote legal administration , to intensify law enforcement inspections , to strengthen law enforcement oversight , to firmly implement the principles of following existing laws , strict law enforcement , and tracking down offenses against the law , to curb waste and destruction of resources , and to effectively improve the ecological environment in order to provide effective guarantees for sustainable economic and social development .  
2 .  Both sides point out that the two countries have , through joint efforts , established a legal basis of treaties and organizations for mutually beneficial cooperation in the political , economic and trade , science and technological , and cultural fields .  
Over the last 20 years , the intellectual property system has become a basic legal system and major policy means of various countries to give impetus to technological innovation , and has played a significant role in invigorating economy and enhancing international competitiveness .  
At the beginning of reform and opening up , China began to institute an intellectual property system .  After more than 20 years of endeavor , a relatively complete legal system of intellectual property rights has taken shape , and an intellectual property protection system that integrates judiciary with administrative law enforcement has been instituted .  In the protection of intellectual property rights , a lot of work has been done , which has made contributions to the promotion of scientific and technological advancement and economic and social development .

In order to build or safeguard our market economic order or ensure normal operation or healthy growth of our market economy , we must enforce a rigorous legal system and standardize our social ethics , for ethics or opinion may also exert with their force a subtle influence on or help standardize or straighten out people 's unruly behaviors in competition , and may even help cultivate a fine general mood in the society as well . 
With the legal system and rules as the basis , reform as the motive force , and development as the goal , in accordance with China 's undertakings given in foreign negotiations , we will take full advantage of the transitional period in China 's WTO accession to speed up the establishment of a new foreign economic and trade setup compatible with international norms and China 's national condition .

This makes it rather difficult to perform supervision .

New Environment Foundation founder Prof . Ch'ai Sung-lin , who has written on Taiwan folk beliefs , maintains the popularity of divination reflects modern man 's inner uncertainty and helplessness in the face of rapid social changes and confused values . Apparent social injustices , such as businessmen profiting by exploiting legal loopholes , or lackluster politicians getting to the top , have led people to conclude that success depends more on good luck than personal effort . This explains why so many people resort to casting fortunes and interpreting horoscopes .  
At the time , Cantonese could be heard everywhere in Mexicali and checks written out in Chinese Characters were accepted as legal tender .

In the absence of a legal foundation , inevitably the division of powers and responsibilities between various levels of government has been unclear , causing frequent disputes .

Lu Kuang-yang says that although musk deer , certain tortoises and horned toads are protected animals , if there is clear documentation about the sources of domestically sold medicinal ingredients and a ban on the use of threatened species , then associations of doctors and pharmacists can control themselves . With the Board of Foreign Trade handling all imports , medicinal ingredients can be stamped to show that they are legal and thus prevent smuggling . With " complete rules of the game , " he would then not object to unthreatened animals being used in limited quantities .  
But with the present lack of an overall system of control , conservationists agree with the Department of Health 's extreme step of a temporary complete ban on medicinal ingredients taken from protected animals ; otherwise the situation will arise where legal behavior will obscure illegal behavior .  
The initiator of illegal radio programs - - " People 's Radio " - - received a legal frequency one and a half years after they transmitted their first program without permission .

Yet when ordinary folks hear that the total budget for many of the things they care about most - - such as the judicial system , the legislative process , legal affairs , civil administration , foreign policy , or relations with mainland China - - adds up to less than 10% of total outlays ( the same level as interest payments ) , they are at a loss for words .  
But today , when there is a greater emphasis on morality and humane treatment of other living beings , many countries are hard at work creating animal protection laws in the hope that in addition to wild animals , the pets with whom people have ever closer relationships , livestock and other animals that serve economic functions can also have legal protection . Humans will never stop eating and using animals , but some of the pain and hardship can be eliminated from how they use them . Such laws could also prevent unnecessary abuse .  
Traditional Chinese placed great emphasis on proper rituals or patterns of behavior , and failure to observe these was deemed to be criminal . For example , these days a lack of filial piety is considered to be a personal moral problem , in which outsiders should not get too involved . But in the past it was a serious offense .

( The latter two figures were calculated on the basis of the percentage of non-adult persons and the death rate in Taiwan . )  
Benjamin Lu , Taiwan 's representative in the US , was even more optimistic in an estimate he made last December while on a trip back to Taiwan . He guessed that 300,000 people living in the US would vote in the presidential election . ( His guess exceeded the theoretical limit of 260,000 because he also considered the number of ROC citizens in the US who still have legal residence in Taiwan , and thus are not included in the estimate of 260,000 eligible " overseas Chinese . "  
As the harmful effects of drugs came to be understood , drug trafficking changed from being legal to being a criminal offense around the world .

Producer , transshipment , and consumer nations have joined hands to clamp down at every link in the chain . Only in this way can narcotics activities be completely rooted out .  
As in the cultural , agricultural , and economic fields , cross-strait narcotics exchanges and mutual reliance among dealers have also grown significantly these past several years . Cross-strait anti-drug cooperation should be implemented with urgency , but it is stagnating amidst disputes over sovereignty and legal jurisdiction , and it has proven difficult to make any breakthroughs .  
" Assuming that the initial French recording process was in violation of the law , then all future uses of this unauthorized material , including those by Enigma and the IOC , would all be unlawful as well , " explains Huang Hsiu-lan , Difag 's attorney , in a firm tone of voice . She has received approval from Difag to use " the most intensive legal methods " to handle the case .  
Of Mr . Shih 's six years of employment , he spent the first three doing clerical work in the inspection department of a pharmaceuticals manufacturer . After seeing an ad in the paper in which an advertising company was looking for a legal assistant , he rushed to apply . In the company , he wrote letters demanding loan repayment and drafted complaints to be used in lawsuits . The job was extremely interesting to him , but , unfortunately , " the boss was too demanding and the workload was too heavy . "  
In other words , even though the production base moves overseas , the " headquarters " and " logistical support center " remain in Taiwan . Operations items stay in Taiwan , along with capital sourcing , legal , tax , and financial planning , and training of internationalized personnel .

There are also detailed descriptions of the SEF 's legal , trade and cultural services . The Mainland Affairs section presents the current state of cross-strait exchanges , and regulations governing cross-strait news reporting , publishing and electronic media work . All this information should provide a valuable reference resource for Taiwanese firms investing in the mainland , and for people both inside and outside the ROC who are engaged in cross-strait business or other affairs .  
The judicial training center has lately increased the training it provides to prepare the judges in these areas , for example , taking the students abroad and having them tour legal gambling establishments ( all gambling is illegal in Taiwan ) and sex operations . In order to competently handle the traffic accidents which are more and more prevalent , the students must all learn to drive ; in order to combat the new styles of economic crimes , the aspiring judges must also make visits to securities exchanges .  
The female prosecutors tend to be a bit more cautious in these matters , paying careful attention to legal and procedural demands . Although this is only proper in respecting human rights , still the police often feel frustrated as a result .  
Kan adds an even more ridiculous case of how hard it has been to change men 's attitudes . In ROC criminal law , rape is defined as a " crime damaging to social morality . " In other words , according to the legal interpretation , the real evil in rape is that it offends the requirement for women to remain chaste and virtuous . As for the woman , it seems that the violation of her person is secondary !  
Moreover , " acquaintance rape " is generally less violent than rape by a stranger . Therefore , under a maledominated legal system , and given the cultural script which calls for men to take the sexual initiative , the rate of conviction is very low . Indeed , victims often have no recourse at all . Worst of all , violation by a known person often leaves much deeper psychological and emotional scars on the victim than violence by a stranger .  
The civil code guarantees that the husband will manage , use , and receive the earnings from property . A divorced woman may win custody of her children , but with laws on the division of property incomplete , if her husband is something less than generous and tries to make things difficult for her , she may be left caring for her children without a penny to her name . In principle , the legal code is for " people " ; there should not be any distinctions made on the basis of sex .  
The company was to be headed by Rojas , the stock to be floated on the Mexican market . The Mexican City market was to be its base , chiefly responsible for financial and legal services . Miami was to be the operational and transport hub , responsible for sales , technical assistance , product planning , dispersal , warehousing , and so on .  
It 's just that state firms often are less efficient than private ones because they have three burdens to bear : implementing state policies based on non-economic concerns , accepting legal restraints and interference from government agencies , and the human failing of usually performing public tasks more poorly than those involving private profit . Thus people often are dismayed with state firms .  
At the National Development Conference , Huang was a major proponent of freezing provincial elections . Since becoming minister of the interior he has worried the provincial government by stating , " The provincial government was established by the central government , and has no status as an independent legal entity . "  
After consulting legal community opinion , Kao proposed revisions that included adopting the principle of " malicious intent " as determined by the US Supreme Court in its landmark 1964 decision " New York Times v . Sullivan . " In that case the court ruled that to be found not guilty journalists need only to do a reasonable job of gathering evidence and obtaining assurances of truth and show no malicious intent to destroy someone 's character .  
On the heels of legal rulings that granted mothers greater rights to the custody of children and wives equal rights to a couple 's shared assets , Taiwan 's women 's groups in April of this year celebrated another victory when a decision by the Grand Council of Justices granted wives " the freedom to choose their place of residence . " The ruling represented another major step on the road toward equal rights in the ROC .  
Chung Shi-kai , a professor in the psychology department at National Chengchi University , says that under the current medical system , professionals of every stripe , including doctors of every specialty and nurses , all have legal requirements to meet and tests to pass . All have a certification system . What is infuriating to him is that there is no such certification system for psychological counselors , psychological testers or clinical psychologists . Because no legal standards or sanctions are stipulated , you ca n't go after Yu for practicing without a license .  
She adds , with particular reference to the problem of overtime pay , " It is especially unfair given that employer and employee interact as economic entities , a status in which every individual should be equal . " The final irony of all is that the overtime regulations are frequently not observed by employers , so the people who are punished most are those single women who obediently agree to work past the legal limits on their overtime hours .  
" In traditional Chinese thinking there were human rights , there just was n't the term for them , " says Chai Sung-lin , chairman of the Chinese Human Rights Association . Apart from the support for human rights expressed in pre-Qin thought , when Liu Bang ruled at the end of the Qin , he and the elders mandated in law that those who killed would die themselves , and those who injured and robbed would be punished . " This provided a legal basis for protecting people 's rights to life and property . "  
In A Comparison of Chinese and Western Conceptions of Human Rights , the legal scholar Chang Yi-ting holds that Chinese society uses the power of ethics and morality to create a harmonious society . This is an exalted ideal of Confucianism and is also a major reason why there is no record of Chinese in ancient times fighting for human rights .  
On the question of KPS setting up its own channel , Father Raymond Parent notes that when he was a member of the Government Information Office 's nine-member research team on cable television , he felt that the remit set by the GIO was too narrow , and the pace of legal reform too slow . With the chaotic situation of the time , when all cable channels were illegal , it would have been very difficult for KPS , with its limited financial resources , to enter this market .  
When animal protection has to be implemented in specific legal regulations the assistance of scientific research is usually required , so that concepts such as cruelty and pain are no longer vague or left to the kind of subjective judgements to which Zhuangzi retorted " I am not a fish-how can I know a fish 's suffering ? " Science also allows appropriate protective rules to be drafted according to the specific needs of different animals .  
There has also been criticism voiced over the decision-making process . Wei Yung , director of a public policy think tank , contends that the president has neither constitutional nor legal authority to make foreign policy decisions or conduct diplomatic operations . Also , the meeting at which the decision was reached was not a meeting of the National Security Council nor of the Cabinet , so it is uncertain how binding this decision is .  
The Han dynasty and the Roman Empire were unified imperial states facing complex problems , and as a result shared much in common . In particular , their legal systems were extremely pragmatic and concrete , with the focus on day-to-day governance .  
From the " Nine Chapters " of the esteemed Han minister of state Xiao He-which covered , among other things , lawsuits , standards for arrest , and criminal punishments for robbery and theft-to the later marriage laws , there were 906 volumes under more than 60 separate legal headings . If you add to this supplementary sources of law , like precedents and debates by legal scholars , then the Han code could handle everything that is covered by both statute and customary law in the modern world .  
In 1996 , the US Congress passed the Communications Decency Act in an attempt to regulate Internet content . The act made the creation , transmission or solicitation of materials lewd , obscene or harmful to minors via the Internet a crime punishable by up to two years imprisonment and / or a fine of up to US $ 25,000 . The bill faced continuous opposition from within legal circles throughout its approval process and prompted the American Civil Liberties Union to sue on constitutional grounds .  
But as Hsueh Cheng-tai points out , when you consider the daily routine of most foreign workers and how little free time it leaves them for breaking the law , and bear in mind that the crime rate among illegal foreign workers is far higher than for the legal ones , the problem does indeed merit attention . Especially given that in 1997 rape accounted for the largest share of serious crime committed by overseas workers , causing widespread anxiety among the public .  
" Building on this foundation , we will continue striving to protect this resource . Human rights are dependent on more than merely political and legal struggle . Rather , they involve independent thinking and respect for people as individuals . We 've got to take our conception of human rights and make it an integral part of people 's basic moral fiber , so that it is fully manifested in everyday life . "  
This law should have a positive effect for current BOT projects which are facing obstacles , including the high-speed railway and the proposed rapid transit line to CKS International Airport .

The legal demobilization of the National Assembly was conducted without a hitch , yet the future of constitutional government looks bleak . This dire outlook is surely not something Taiwan 's political parties expected when , attempting to align with public opinion , they moved to phase out the National Assembly .

" At the same time , said the president , these organs must be diligent in all matters related to national security , economic security , major criminal activity , maintenance of social order , and any other matters that fall within their legal jurisdiction .

Yu Shyi-kun , Secretary-General of the Presidential Office , stated that the president would respect the ruling of the Grand Justices , but said the language of the ruling does not appear to require a Cabinet reshuffle . The various opposition caucuses in the legislature issued a joint statement arguing that in describing the decision to suspend construction of the plant as " procedurally flawed , " the Grand Justices had in effect declared the Cabinet 's unilateral action illegal , and the Cabinet 's action has naturally lost legal validity for that reason .  
There is currently more columbarium space than there is demand , and current capacity is not projected to be exhausted for the next 20 years . But Taipei City has halted burials in its public cemeteries , and plans to transfer burials elsewhere . For those who prefer burial to cremation , future supplies of legal gravesites are in extremely short supply . This has prompted Pacific Group investors to set up Rose Garden , a landscaped cemetery set on land acquired in the Chinshan and Yangmingshan area .

"  
A plethora of media reports about medical malpractice disputes seem to announce a crisis of confidence between doctors and patients . When patients are dissatisfied with or doubtful about the treatment they receive at hospitals and clinics , the majority choose to remain silent and put their experience down to bad luck , while some voice their concerns directly to the doctor , hospital or local health bureau . But others seek out their elected representatives , complain to the media , throw eggs , carry coffins through the streets in protest , or institute legal proceedings .  
And an LNG procurement worth several hundred billion New Taiwan dollars is an affair which can be carried out only through a public bidding process in conformance with the WTO spirit of free competition , not one which can be decided by anyone 's personal say-so .

Although these two parties , the only legal minority parties at the time , played only a marginal role as " tokens " of democracy under Kuomintang authoritarianism , nonetheless thanks to the idealism of key members like Chiang Yun-tien and Kao Yu-shu , and to popular disaffection with the KMT , the CDSP remained active in local elections and constituted a force outside the KMT .  
The eighth clause of the Basic Education Law , which was passed in June of the same year , puts it even more clearly : " During the period of compulsory education , parents are responsible for guiding and assisting their children .

The spending figures officially reported by Mayor Hsieh 's campaign headquarters did not exceed the legal limit , but the spending report noted that Hsieh 's reelection committee spent NT $ 70-80 million .

Hualien 's chief prosecutor Yang Ta-chih inflamed passions by accusing the Ministry of the Interior of " violating the constitution .

" There are some battered foreign brides who loathe Taiwanese and think all Taiwanese are evil , and even distrust the social workers themselves , " says Vietnamese-born Sister Mei of the Good Shepherd Sisters .

This last point is very difficult to bear and they frequently feel the social workers are unwilling to help them .  
However , " although Chiang Wei-shui and others were found guilty in the Social Order and Police Incident , " writes Huang Huang-hsiung in his Chiang biography , " they indirectly benefited from this , because it became a focal point for the political and social movement .

Constraints are removed and incentives provided to ensure that desirable land uses are encouraged and are profitable ; land users have legal title to their land ; legal and tax systems do not result in disincentives to increased and sustainable land use ; adequate market and physical infrastructure are available ; the disadvantages and inequalities which particularly apply to women are remedied ;  
It is recommended that the reports should not be confined to mere lists of legal instruments adopted in the country concerned in recent years but should also include information indicating how these legal instruments are reflected in the actual economic , political and social realities and general conditions existing in the country .  
Activities under chapter 15 and related chapters of Agenda 21 , together with measures contained in the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant legal instruments and agreements , thus need to be integrated into political , social and economic policy-making at every level .  
In the statement , the Conference noted that the Convention on Biological Diversity was the primary international legal instrument for advancing the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of genetic resources .  
sustainable use at various levels : the ecosystems / biogeographic realms level ( forests , arid zones , oceans , freshwater etc . ) ; the species level ( wildlife ) ; genetic resources level ( plant , animal and microbial resources , and natural resources economics ) ; the processes level ( biotechnology ) ; the monitoring and assessment level ; and the legal level .  
The Joint FAO / ECE Working Party on Relations between Agriculture and the Environment currently examines various aspects and national practices related to biological diversity and landscape protection as part of its work-plan element entitled Economic , legal , technological and regulatory measures for the promotion of environmentally sustainable agriculture and production of healthy food " .  
Desiring , in the interests of their citizens , to ensure equal conditions for their residence in the territories of the two Parties and , in this connection , wishing to offer the citizens of one Party who reside permanently in the territory of the other Party a legal status that is as close as possible to the legal status of the citizens of the other Party , in particular as regards civil , political , social , economic , labour , cultural and other rights ,  
Broad parliamentary support would be required to change the legal situation , especially in view of strong opposition from the Catholic Church , whose moral authority had been enhanced by its defence of human rights under the military dictatorship .  
All the main multilateral banks emphasize the need for forest-sector investment lending to be preceded by strong sectoral analysis , policy dialogue and institutional reform , including taking steps to improve regulatory and legal frameworks in forestry and to integrate sector aims and objectives with wider economic and environmental concerns .  
It reaffirms that all the legislative , administrative and settlement measures aimed at changing the legal status of the Holy City are null and contrary to international agreements , charters and conventions , in accordance with the resolutions of international legality , including United Nations Security Council resolutions 465 ( 1980 ) , 476 ( 1980 ) and 478 ( 1980 ) , as well as the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly which consider these measures null and void ;  
Being of the opinion that the establishment of model legislative provisions on procurement of services that are acceptable to States with different legal , social and economic systems contributes to the development of harmonious international economic relations ,  
The Convention on Biological Diversity is the primary international legal instrument for advancing the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of genetic resources , while recognizing the important role of other conventions to the objectives of the Convention .  
One representative drew attention to the fact that , increasingly , national courts were enforcing international legal instruments for punishing perpetrators of international crimes and that it should , therefore , not be felt that the granting of universal jurisdiction to national courts and judicial cooperation among States for the purpose of the administration of justice would no longer be valid after the establishment of the Court .  
It was stated that , if established under the Charter , the Court would be supported by the Organization 's moral authority and its universality , and furthermore the unity of the international legal order in respect of criminal matters would be assured .  
In this context it was noted that , since international criminal law was not a fully developed area and since the statute of the Court was certain to have an impact upon national legal systems , the jurisdiction should be established on a consensual basis in full regard to the fundamental principle of sovereignty , which should be reflected in all its provisions .  
It was further stated that the political question of whether a country had perpetrated an act of aggression was in principle separate from the legal question of whether an individual from a particular country could be held responsible for the act and that the Court would be perfectly capable of taking note of an act of aggression without the Security Council having first determined it .  
Another representative , after pointing out that the draft statute contained no provisions on statutory limitations or on their non-applicability , observed that , if a permanent international criminal court was to become a reality , the Court 's jurisdiction ratione temporis would have to be determined in order to preserve the principle of legal safety . 
In that regard , the mission proposes that a legal expert , a military expert and an administrative expert , all highly qualified and having considerable experience in their respective fields , should be appointed to assist the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in his mission .  
Unresponsive legal systems , overly complex administrative procedures , insensitive judicial personnel and inadequate monitoring of the violation of the human rights of women undermine women 's access to full and equal rights .  
Complete national law reviews by 2000 in order to incorporate the principles and provisions of accepted international norms and standards into national legislation and to revoke any remaining discriminatory laws ; ( d ) Provide gender sensitivity and women 's human rights training for all public officials , including law enforcement officers , legal and medical personnel , members of parliament and social workers , so that they may better exercise their public responsibilities ;  
These unconstitutional and illegal acts , which in essence , constituted political and legal aggression against a sovereign State , namely the Azerbaijani Republic , have never been repudiated by the Republic of Armenia , thus proving that Armenia should bear sole responsibility as the organizer and principal agent of the aggression against Azerbaijan . During this seven-year war , the armed forces of the Republic of Armenia have committed thousands of crimes in Azerbaijani territory .  
Our efforts have helped develop a text that , in its final version , makes no mention of Chapter VII of the Charter , addresses requests to States that are not binding in nature and specifies that any detentions will be effected in accordance with their national law which , in our view , means that only those States that have domestic legislation enabling them to act along the requested lines will be able to do so , as the resolution can not serve by itself alone as a legal basis for arresting anyone . 
All these complaints , which account for 16 per cent of the overall total , refer to violations of procedural guarantees ( presumption of innocence ( 4 ) , the right to a hearing by a competent , independent and impartial tribunal within a reasonable period of time ( 3 ) , the right of habeas corpus ( 8 ) and the legal duty of the State to investigate and administer punishment ( 31 ) ) .  
Let me assure you that the Government is prepared to propose the necessary transitional or definitive amendments to the electoral law and is already working on the various legal formulae which , once the armed conflict is over , would enable URNG members to be reintegrated into society on a basis of full legality and without any restriction on their civil and political rights .  
With regard to governance issues , national institutions and professionals from the public and private sectors , grass-roots organizations and political parties have been actively involved in discussions , round-table meetings and national conferences on governance issues , constitutional and legal reforms , etc . alongside high calibre international experts and consultants .  
Improved and innovative institutional , legal and financial arrangements relating to private sector collaboration , university-industry linkage , strategic business alliances and venture capital have been extensively developed to address the emerging issues relating to new biotechnology .  
Biotechnology applications have the potential for making major contributions to the health and welfare of humanity , although biotechnology is still perceived by many to have undesirable and partly unforeseeable ecological , socio-economic , legal and ethical implications .  
Noting that , following the cease-fire of 18 July 1994 , a new Government of Rwanda has been established and has made efforts to restore the rule of law and reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , physical , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda after the extensive damage inflicted by the civil conflict ,  
Invites Member States , the organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to intensify their efforts to contribute financial and technical support to the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , physical , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda ;  
Also convinced that through their own national legal and judicial systems States must provide appropriate civil , criminal and administrative remedies for violations of human rights ,  
This allegation is in radical conflict with the texts of the reports of the tripartite committee and its technical subcommittee , which make it absolutely clear that Iraq is completely serious about observing its legal , humanitarian and moral responsibilities in this field , and that the competent Iraqi authorities have dealt with many of the missing persons ' dossiers within the context of the circumstances and data relating to the matter .  
In response , in a letter of 24 July 1991 , 9 / my predecessor shared the Committee 's understanding of the problem and also expressed the view that , in order to find workable solutions to those problems , certain legal and practical difficulties must be overcome with the active assistance of all concerned , including the competent authorities of the host country .  
Much of its work has focused on establishing the necessary international legal and policy framework for ensuring women 's full and equal enjoyment of their rights in the political , economic , civil , social and educational fields .  
The reasons for this vary and include a lack of political commitment ; an unresponsive legal system ; attitudinal obstacles to the incorporation of international standards when these are believed to be in conflict with religious , cultural or customary practices ; the absence of effective domestic groups that can lobby for change effectively and without fear of intimidation ; and an absence of effective enforcement mechanisms even where legislation exists .  
Nevertheless , several countries state that in order to have a more sustainable impact , legal literacy should include developing an awareness of rights in general and of existing national statutory rights in particular , since penal and civil codes protect everyone .  
The notion of " economic integration " in fact implies specific and obvious political and legal consequences , particularly when it is linked to the continuation of the military occupation and the total political dependence of the Cypriot territories in question on Ankara .  
It was stated that existing legislation governing communication and storage of information was inadequate or outdated precisely because it did not contemplate the use of EDI and related means of communication , thus creating uncertainty with respect to the legal regime of transactions operated by electronic means and restricting the use of such means .  
This continuing practice by the United States of America , which is unwarranted and contrary to its legal and moral obligations under the Headquarters Agreement , the Charter of the United Nations and international custom , points to a serious shortcoming that must be eliminated and corrected by all possible means . 
National legal systems allowing for punitive or exemplary damages usually do so only where there has been a deliberate misdeed or gross negligence ; in such cases , the proper course of action for the Organization would be to bring disciplinary charges against the offending staff member or recovery action from him or her of the damages paid by the Organization for the actual loss suffered by the victim . 
It is also no longer acceptable from a legal , political or humanitarian point of view for an entire people to continue to suffer because of a mere suspicion that two persons may be connected with the bombing of an aircraft based on investigations that are not yet complete .  
[ Sustained economic growth and sustainable development can only be attained through improving the economic , social , political , legal and cultural status of women . ]  
The so-called Vance plan , an interim solution adopted prior to the international recognition of the Republic of Croatia and its admission to United Nations membership , is considered by the Croatian Parliament as an unacceptable legal and political basis for the continued presence and operation of international forces in the territory of the Republic of Croatia .  
In connection with article 6 , paragraph 5 , we are of the view that , in assuring the representation of the principal legal systems of the world , the representation of Islamic penal legislation as a comprehensive and independent system that is rich in human experience and is authoritative for a large number of countries should not be overlooked .  
Indeed , in such cases the legal rules governing jurisdiction would not be applicable , the criminal laws of the State that would normally have jurisdiction might be inadequate or there might be particular circumstances on the ground ( disorganization of the judicial apparatus , partiality of the courts because of internal or external conflict , a deliberate refusal to prosecute or extradite ) impeding the administration of justice .  
Rules that affect the operation of the court to this degree will require careful effort to draft , for they must be acceptable and workable in the light of the widely varying national legal systems involved .  
Work focuses on the practical problems that need to be resolved so that policies undertaken in respect of internalization do not impair the development efforts of developing countries and that they are consistent with the economic , financial , institutional , legal and social conditions of those countries .  
Work focuses on the practical problems that need to be resolved so that policies undertaken in respect of internalization do not impair the development efforts of developing countries and are consistent with the economic , financial , institutional , legal and social conditions of those countries .  See E / CN . 17 / 1994 / CRP . 2 .  
By its presence in Croatia over the past three years , UNPROFOR has contributed positively by keeping relative peace in Croatia and has given the international community time to establish a political framework and binding legal decisions that will assist in reintegrating the occupied territories and their residents into Croatia peacefully and in a manner consistent with Croatia \ x { e5b8 } sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
During the work on the new arrangement and the present draft resolution , which will be adopted today , one Member State , regrettably , expressed low tolerance for the legitimate interests of Croatia , a Member State , and instead directed efforts into forms of short-term political pragmatism , at the expense of legal and operative logic of the relevant United Nations documents .  
It believes that establishing a linkage between the Security Council , which is a political organ by nature and by virtue of its mandate and structure , and the international criminal court , whose establishment is intended to provide a neutral and impartial legal forum , will create enormous problems that will undermine confidence in the court 's neutrality and impartiality .  
[ Create , fund , and improve ] or develop the training of judicial , legal , medical , social , educational and police and immigration personnel , as appropriate , in order to avoid the abuse of power leading to violence against women and sensitize such personnel to the nature of gender-based acts and threats of violence so that fair treatment of female victims can be assured ;  
Sustainable development and economic growth that is both sustained and sustainable is only possible through improving the economic , social , political , legal and cultural status of women .

I have the honour , concerning the letter dated 3 April 1995 from Mr . H.E . Christos Zacharakis , Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations addressed to you ( S / 1995 / 257 ) , and in reference to Security Council resolution 817 ( 1993 ) , to remind you that the name of any Member State is an exclusive right and an internal affair of the State , which right has been respected and established in international legal norms and in the basic principles of the United Nations .  
At the same time , since ONUSAL will be withdrawing on 30 April 1995 , the Human Rights Division has been emphasizing the urgent need to implement those parts of the peace agreements concerning human rights which are still pending , a matter which is of the utmost importance if El Salvador is to complete the framework of legal and institutional safeguards required in order to achieve democracy and lasting peace .  
It should be noted that although this measure is , in theory , based on the Constitution , the spirit of the peace agreements requires that it be subject to legal rules which establish expressly and restrictively the requirements and conditions which must be met before domestic peace , tranquillity , order or public safety can be considered to be endangered , in exceptional cases , and before the normal means for their preservation can be considered to have been exhausted .  
This ignorance of norms is compounded by deficiencies of legal interpretation and reasoning , as evidenced in the literal and disjointed application of ordinary law and a marked emphasis on procedural - as opposed to substantive - issues .  
The Committee will also consider relevant organizational and supportive arrangements for technical cooperation among developing countries , such as administrative , legal , information and financial matters .  
Subparagraph ( c ) , it was stated , should be amended to make it clear that national law was a subsidiary means for determining general principles of law common to the major legal systems or , alternatively , should clearly indicate the relevant national law , the State whose law would apply and the circumstances in which such law would apply , particularly as national law was far from uniform .  
Some delegations felt that the question of the statute of limitations for the crimes within the jurisdiction of the court should be addressed in the statute in the light of divergencies between national laws and bearing in mind the importance of the legal principle involved , which reflected the decreasing social importance of bringing criminals to justice and the increasing difficulties in ensuring a fair trial as time elapsed .  
It is the Russian Federation 's firm position that the Treaty , as a major international legal document of the nuclear age ensuring an optimum balance in terms of halting the spread of nuclear weapons , nuclear disarmament and cooperation in the peaceful uses of the atom , must be extended indefinitely and unconditionally .  Such a decision by the Conference will lay the foundation for further progress in the twenty-first century towards a non-nuclear world in the future .  
This latter definition is the real meaning of " intrinsic " as used in these legal instruments , and in any case the words " essential " and " inherent " do not mean that the adverse effects on the environment per se constitute a form of harm which is independent of human beings .  
The Office provides legal advice and services in operational matters to United Nations organs , bodies and Secretariat units and is responsible for meeting the needs of Member States in dealing with legal , political , economic , scientific , technical and environmental aspects of the law of the sea and marine affairs .  
Their needs for coordinated information and advice will be addressed through the development and operation of a centralized system of integrated databases , inter alia , on marine legislation and marine policy , as well as by intensifying general legal advice and other advisory services and by focusing dissemination of information on national , regional and international developments in the law of the sea and ocean affairs .  
States Parties thus agree to initiate constitutional , legislative , administrative and other measures to ensure equality both generally and within specific contexts , including political and public life , nationality , education , work , health , legal and civil matters and the family .  
This means that the various cooperation agreements to be signed with the State institutions concerned must specify the commitments which these institutions are taking on ( political , institutional , administrative , technical , financial and legal , as the case may be ) and the specific contributions that will have to be made .  
During the discussion the Administrator also clarified that the programming emphasis on the enabling environment required for poverty elimination supported the first commitment of the World Summit for Social Development ( WSSD ) , which focused on creating an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment that will enable people to achieve social development .  
Measures to foster effective provision of infrastructure services by local government included ( a ) establishing a rational , transparent , legal foundation for local government with an appropriate degree of local discretion over issues of local interest ; ( b ) implementing a more appropriate assignment of revenues providing greater local autonomy over user charges and local taxes ; and ( c ) introducing more systematic and transparent criteria for allocating capital investment funding .  
It is India 's considered view that before the Security Council embarks on any action to formally give itself a " role in the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction " , all substantive , legal and institutional issues , including the role of specific treaty bodies , must be addressed and resolved through an open and transparent debate among the full membership of the United Nations .  
In governmental systems , this is the basic infrastructure for the exercise of legitimate authority : a legal system , a judicial system , a police system , a prison system for those who act outside the law , and the design of governmental institutions that ensure informed , voluntary choice by the citizens .  
Economic and social development , democratic consolidation and the promotion and protection of human rights all require a strong , rational and predictable legal system for their effective implementation .  
The question , which was considered against the background of political and ideological confrontation created by the cold war and its bipolar divisions , generated a certain amount of difficulty because it also involved legal , political and procedural elements which complicated the issue .  
Calls on all parties concerned to positively respond to the initiatives for dialogue and negotiations to secure a peaceful settlement to the crisis in conformity with Article 33 of Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter which calls for the settlement of disputes through negotiations , mediation and legal procedures in conformity with international law and calls for a fair trial of the two suspects in a neutral country to be agreed upon by all the parties concerned ;  
In many Latin American countries , the paradox of overabundant legislation and overemphasized democracy contrasting with the fragmentation of society , deep economic inequalities and the low level of political participation suggests that the ruling \ x { 5e68 } ite is attempting to overcome the weak integration of society by developing the legal framework of a democratic state of law addressing the whole people .  
This principle , first expressed in German law and in international law , is accepted as a general principle in all legal systems regarding public administration , but it is usually reflected in specific principles of more or less limited scope ;  
Where politics or interests oppose the development of the legal framework of public administration , regional integration processes , underpinned by economic globalization , may facilitate acceptance of a higher level of legality through the principles involved in the settlement by an international court of matters coming under the treaty .  
If the development of the legal framework of public administration is considered as progress for developing countries , just as for other countries , for the reasons stated above , three different resources can be mobilized : the legacy of foreign models subject to an appraisal with regard to present conditions and policy goals ; the national culture and legal tradition ( also subject to appraisal ) ; and universal values expressed in documents issued by the United Nations .  
At least two aspects of traditional culture are very widespread in developing countries and should be taken into consideration in legal reforms regarding public administration : in an oral society , the importance of personal relations and the importance of the group ( the community ) for the individual .  
Nevertheless the path explored by the reformist Arab writers of the nineteenth century should be pursued and legal principles elaborated capable of bridging the gap between various communities and modern public administration , a step which is needed for participation in the world economy .  
Since such claims result in additional and unintended financial obligations and often indeterminate liabilities , the Board recommends that precise legal agreements to establish mutual rights and obligations should be signed with all implementing agencies .  
The guidelines suggest numerous preventive measures that may be taken such as practical improvements in camp organization , location and design ; human resources management measures including the hiring of more female staff ; measures aimed at encouraging the host Government to take effective legal and other action ; and preventive measures involving education and training .  
This step taken by the international community following the signing by the Government and UNITA of the Lusaka Protocol , the new instrument setting forth the legal framework for the country 's transition from war to peace , gave a major boost to the peace process and helped curtail initial pessimism as did the positive unfolding of such a difficult and complex process , shrouded at first in a climate of deeply held mutual mistrust and hostility rooted in a long , destructive war .  
In the Agreement , the Government has committed itself to the effective protection of indigenous rights by promoting the creation of legal offices for the defence of those rights and the establishment of " popular law offices " to provide free legal assistance to persons of limited economic means in municipalities in which indigenous communities are prevalent .  
In the case of Belarus the problem of outstanding contributions for peace-keeping operations has taken on a particularly acute , and it would not be exaggerated to say , offensive character , primarily owing to the fact that the original motives for assigning Belarus to group ( b ) have become historically obsolete , its legal status under international law has changed and its economic situation has greatly deteriorated . 
" Create , improve or develop , as appropriate , and fund training programmes for judicial , legal , medical , social , educational , police and immigration personnel , in order to avoid the abuse of power leading to violence against women and sensitize such personnel to the nature of gender-based acts and threats of violence so that fair treatment of female victims can be assured " .  
" The ability of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to monitor implementation of the Convention should be strengthened through the provision of human and financial resources within the regular budget of the United Nations , including expert legal assistance and , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 49 / 164 and the decision made at the meeting of the States parties to the Convention held in May 1995 , sufficient meeting time for the Committee .  
In the first year of the Tribunal 's existence , the President of the Tribunal drew the attention of the Secretary-General to the necessity for Member States not only to designate , in their domestic legal systems , a body responsible for dealing with any request from the Tribunal , but also to adopt the legislative or regulatory provisions required to give effect to the Tribunal 's statute .  
The commission of inquiry might be of assistance here as well inasmuch as it might make recommendations concerning appropriate legal , political or administrative measures , for such measures are probably necessary if Burundi is in the future to avoid not only the vortex of Rwanda , but also the twin dangers of a dictatorship based on the predominant majority of one ethnic group as well as a dictatorship based on a firepower monopoly of the other ethnic group . 
Specific measures include the regulation of recruitment agencies ; legal , social and educational outreach to migrant women ; trained female police officers and protection from male officers ; training for embassy personnel ; enforcement of national labour standards for all workers that conform to international guidelines ; better enforcement of existing laws ; involvement of trade unions ; and implementation of relevant United Nations resolutions and reporting mandates .  
Today , it is impossible to deny the existence of private entities and public bodies which , under a legal cover , conduct clandestine criminal operations as a parallel activity by hiring people who , in exchange for payment , agree to participate in the commission of unconscionable and illegal acts .  
Tools prepared by UNDCP for the implementation of the conventions also included an annual directory listing national authorities competent to take action under specific articles of the conventions , such as article 7 ( on mutual legal assistance ) or article 17 ( on illicit traffic by sea ) of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 .  
The project aimed at consolidating major existing and emerging legal principles relating to environmental conservation and sustainable development into an internationally binding legal instrument , thus contributing to the progressive development of international environmental law .  
The Cook Islands suggested that the United Nations convene a meeting of the legal advisers of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of small States to discuss their role , the special operational and logistical problems they faced , inter alia , regarding participation in the multilateral treaty-making process and the fulfilment of reporting obligations , and possible means to resolve such problems through cooperation at the regional and global levels .  
The Consultative Committee also published the outcome and proceedings of the special meeting on developing legal and institutional guidelines for privatization and post-privatization regulatory framework , held at Tokyo in January 1994 , which included the draft text of such guidelines .  
These settlors need not only represent recognized legal experts in international military / peace / security issues , but also those having expertise in economic , social and cultural relations where disputes are most often the root cause of all disastrous conflicts .  
Recommends that the Commission to be appointed by the Secretary-General be composed of five to ten impartial and internationally respected persons , including legal , military and police experts , under the Chairmanship of an eminent person , and assisted by the appropriate support staff ;  
Recommends that the Commission to be appointed by the Secretary-General be composed of five to ten impartial and internationally respected persons , including legal , military and police experts , under the Chairmanship of an eminent person , and assisted by the appropriate support staff ;  
While approaches to reform vary widely across countries at different stages of development , the group 's work in the area of improving the business environment covers four areas : reducing barriers to competition and streamlining regulation , strengthening legal and judicial systems , supporting entrepreneurial development and promoting global integration through foreign direct investment and expansion of trade .  
Review national laws , including customary laws and legal practices in the areas of family , civil , penal , labour and commercial law in order to ensure the implementation of the principles and procedures of all relevant international human rights instruments by means of national legislation , and revoke any remaining laws that discriminate on the basis of sex and remove gender bias in the administration of justice ;  
Include information about international and regional instruments and standards in their public information and human rights education activities and in adult education and training programmes , particularly for groups such as the military , the police and other law enforcement personnel , the judiciary , and legal and health professionals to ensure that human rights are effectively protected ;  
The ability of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to monitor implementation of the Convention should be strengthened through the provision of human and financial resources within the regular budget of the United Nations , including expert legal assistance and , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 49 / 164 and the decision made by the meeting of States parties to the Convention held in May 1995 , sufficient meeting time for the Committee .  
Sustainable development and economic growth that is both sustained and sustainable are possible only through improving the economic , social , political , legal and cultural status of women .  
This research needs to be guided at all stages by users and from the perspective of gender , particularly the perspective of women , and should be carried out in strict conformity with internationally accepted legal , ethical , medical and scientific standards for biomedical research ;  
For example , the Vienna Convention has given rise to a wave of legislative activity at the national level , supported by the legal assistance programme of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , as well as to the adoption of numerous bilateral and regional agreements that implement and further the Convention 's provisions .  
The imposition of coercive economic measures ignores such principles as the sovereign equality of States , non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States , and violates international legal instruments with the intent of forcibly imposing the political will of the sending State and subverting the political , economic and social regime of the target State .  
In view of the replies sent to him by Governments , the Special Rapporteur felt that decisive steps should be taken at the international level to establish effective administrative and legal remedies which victims of intolerance or discrimination based on religion could avail themselves of in cases of violations of the rights set forth in the Declaration .  
Moreover , whether they were consultative or jurisdictional , national institutions must be based on the highest possible legal standard , which assured their legitimacy , so that they would be able to ensure the synergy between the State and civil society .  
The Government of Iraq , guided by paragraph 31 of the Vienna Declaration on Human Rights , which states that food and medicine should not be used as a tool for political pressure , looks to the United Nations and its humanitarian organizations to study the grave political , legal and humanitarian consequences of the imposition of the economic embargo , requesting that a mechanism should be sought to minimize those consequences and their dangerous repercussions on all human rights . 
National legal systems allowing for punitive or exemplary damages usually do so only where there has been a deliberate misdeed or gross negligence ; in such cases , the proper course of action for the Organization would be to bring disciplinary charges against the offending staff member or recovery action from him or her of the damages paid by the Organization for the actual loss suffered by the victim . 
NULLWith regard to the underlying assumptions under which the revised proposal was prepared , the Committee was informed that , taking into consideration legal requirements and the need to prepare presidential elections , it was assumed that the earliest possible date for holding presidential elections would be early December 1995 .  
In addition to the major summit meetings mentioned above , which have proved themselves a flexible and effective format for high-level decision-making , the enhanced activities of the Central American Integration System ( SICA ) have ensured that regional meetings within the institutional and legal framework it establishes are a constant of Central American political life .  
Finally , how to intervene most effectively has to be judged - through economic policy instruments , legal reform , law enforcement , intergovernmental cooperation , political , administrative or judicial discretion , education policies , research and development policies , technology development and dissemination , or empowerment of particular geographical or disadvantaged social groups , such as indigenous people , minorities and women .  
Such emphasis on women is warranted since women , who compose more than half of the world 's poor , often face special legal and social obstructions in carrying out business and economic activities , despite their record of being responsible entrepreneurs and the principal contributors to the welfare of the family .  
NULLLegally recognize the existence , identity and rights of indigenous people through constitutional reforms and the adoption of new laws to improve their legal status and guarantee their territorial , economic , social , cultural , political and civil rights .  
The formal financial system in Africa has faced a number of internal and external constraints , including inadequate technical and managerial capacity , antiquated legal and regulatory frameworks , inappropriate macroeconomic policies and pronounced government intervention , that not only hampered its growth but actually caused significant disintermediation in a number of countries .  
In the process , the intermediation mechanism grows more varied and complex , ranging from the informal financial system comprising all legal financial activities outside the orbit of institutional and officially regulated finance , to a more complex modern system , supervised by a central monetary authority , that facilitates the transfer of large quantities of money within and between countries .  
While historic factors such as the low level of African incomes and inadequate domestic technical expertise and capacity explain a part of this situation , it is also the general perception that inappropriate macroeconomic policies , combined with an antiquated and ineffective legal , regulatory and prudential framework , have been the main impediments .  
NULLPursuant to General Assembly resolution 36 / 151 , voluntary contributions to the Fund from Governments , non-governmental organizations and private individuals are to be distributed through established channels of assistance , as humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals whose human rights have been severely violated as a result of torture and to relatives of such victims .  
It was also agreed that funds reserved for the civilian component of the Mission should be increased to enable it to deploy constitutional legal experts , human rights monitors and mediators , and to facilitate the process of dialogue and national reconciliation in Burundi .  
This handbook reflects the unique nature of the commitments made in the Agreement , which focus on the constitutional , legal and administrative reforms considered necessary for the elimination of discrimination , both de facto and de jure , and for the effective exercise of the specific rights of indigenous peoples .  
NULLThe budget of UNDCP has two separate and complementary parts : the regular budget concerned with treaty implementation and legal affairs ; and the Fund budget supported by voluntary contributions and geared to assist developing countries in drug control .  
NULLDetermines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
The traditional mechanisms of the international codification process had also changed and new challenges had emerged which necessitated a quick and effective response to legal emergencies ; thus , under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency , two multilateral conventions had been adopted in 1986 relating to early warning and assistance in the case of nuclear accidents .  
In order to be included in the list of crimes in the draft Code , such infractions must correspond to the legal rules accepted by States , must be considered serious enough to be defined as crimes against the peace and security of mankind , and must refer to acts sufficiently identifiable to appear in a criminal text .  The matter should be dealt with only from a legal , not a political , perspective .  
If the level of women 's representation of between 30 and 35 per cent and above is considered to form a critical mass , the Secretariat can be considered to have achieved that status in such occupational groups as political affairs , legal affairs , public information , administration , social affairs , economic affairs , human resources and human rights .  
The United States legal system was an excellent example of a system based on laws that respected the basic civil and political rights of all individuals as a precondition for any society hoping to eliminate racial discrimination .  
If an international crime was to be designated as a qualified case of an international breach of law , there was a need for a special regime governing State responsibility , which must include a set of legal consequences going beyond the consequences of ordinary wrongful acts and which must put the instrumental consequences of the crime under the supervision of a judicial authority .  
International legal and related efforts in the field of environment continue to see rapid development , constituting a substantial framework of legal , administrative , economic , financial and technical measures to prevent , control and reduce the adverse impact of human activities on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems .  
With respect to persistent organic pollutants , proposals were advanced for the global programme to initiate , directly , an intergovernmental process to consider and negotiate a global , legally binding instrument .  However , much of this legal development may focus more within the broad field of chemical safety .  
From the point of view of international law , the State was an abstract legal entity consisting of a territory , a population and a set of institutions and , although it existed in the legal and political sense at the international level , in essence it was legally neither good nor bad , neither innocent nor guilty .  
The High Commissioner has raised issues relating to economic , social and cultural rights , as well as the right to development , promotion of the rights of women , the status of minorities , indigenous people , the status of non-citizens , the legal status of refugees and asylum-seekers , protection of the rights of children and conformity of national legislation with international standards .  
To the contrary , in the prevailing legal and political order in Iraq with life-threatening laws applicable to persons expressing any opposition to the Government , the conduct of the referendum made a mockery of relevant international human rights standards .  
Therefore , there must be a workable legal framework consistent with modern labour management practices that guarantees to all civil servants due process and equal protection equivalent to the rights and principles they would enjoy under relevant national laws . 
Bearing in mind that many national legal systems recognized the concept of environmental damage and that various international conventions protected the environment , his delegation considered it sensible to have included in the draft articles a clear and comprehensive definition of " harm " .  
An international and independent court that was free from political pressures , established on a solid legal basis , accepted by all States to deal with well-defined crimes and capable of offering maximum guarantees to the defendants would provide , particularly where prevention was concerned , an appropriate instrument for dealing with crises which had adverse effects on entire peoples .  
The Commission noted that growing awareness of the UNCITRAL legal texts in many countries , in particular developing countries and newly independent States , had resulted in increased requests for training and technical assistance from individual Governments or regional organizations .

The Security Council further recommended that the Commission be appointed by the Secretary-General and be composed of 5 to 10 impartial and internationally respected persons , including legal , military and police experts , under the chairmanship of an eminent person , and assisted by the appropriate support staff .  
Such a body , linked to the United Nations system and established on a solid legal basis accepted by all States , would be a useful tool which would allow the international community to prosecute and punish those guilty of particularly serious crimes whose hateful nature constituted an insult to the human conscience .  
Account also has to be taken of the consequential demands on the Registry of the Court for research and legal , library and documentary services and , particularly , translation and secretarial services owing to the expanded case-load of the Court and hence office space requirements for additional regular staff and those hired under temporary assistance for meetings and general temporary assistance .  
experience over the past four years , he has received from the JAB advice of uneven quality , which was not readily acceptable and required in each case an in-depth review to determine whether each recommendation was supported by the evidence and conformed to the relevant legal principles , rules and policies . 
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially in the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements , and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory ,

Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially in the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements , and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory ,  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;

Recognize the existence , identity and rights of indigenous people through constitutional reforms or the adoption of new laws , when appropriate , to improve their legal status and guarantee their economic , social , cultural , political and civil rights .  
stark contrast between the forceful abduction and subsequent torture of a Turkish Cypriot by the Greek Cypriot police and the humane manner in which the above-mentioned Greek Cypriot offender was treated by the Turkish Cypriot authorities , fully in accordance with the legal procedures , illustrates which side in Cyprus respects human rights and the rule of law and which side is responsible for gross violations .  
With regard to the programme of activities for the International Decade of the World 's Indigenous People , ILO had adopted the only international legal instrument addressing the question of the living and working conditions of indigenous and tribal peoples , the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention of 1989 , which recognized that such peoples had a unique cultural identity , and stressed the need to involve them in the making of decisions that would affect their future .

has been emphasized in Security Council resolution 1023 ( 1995 ) of 22 November 1995 , it should be clearly understood that the purpose of the transitional administration is to achieve the peaceful reintegration of the region into the Croatian legal and constitutional system following four years of war and hostility , which have created deep apprehension , fear and distrust between the Croatian Government and the local Serbs .  
Acknowledges that the administration of justice , including law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies and , especially , an independent judiciary and legal profession in full conformity with applicable standards contained in international human rights instruments , are essential to the full and non-discriminatory realization of human rights and indispensable to democratization processes and sustainable development ;  
the progress made thus far by the representative of the Secretary-General in developing a legal framework , studying the causes and manifestations of internal displacement , and analysing institutional arrangements , undertaking dialogue with Governments , issuing a series of reports on particular country situations together with proposals for remedial measures , and raising the level of awareness , at both the national and international levels , to the problem of internal displacement ,  
Invites Member States , the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue and intensify their efforts to contribute financial and technical support to the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda , particularly in the areas of the administration of justice , and welcomes the contributions made , including those at the Round Table Conference at Geneva and its mid-term review , and urges States and donor agencies to fulfil their earlier commitments ;  
it is of the utmost importance that the same legal standards , the same norms of law and the same critical objectivity are applied everywhere be it in the areas in question , in other parts of the former Yugoslavia or elsewhere in this world .  There must be no selectivity , no attempts to either diminish or enlarge violations of international humanitarian law committed by one side for partisan reasons of political convenience .  
It is plain to see that the United States authorities were fully aware of the existence of a group organized in United States territory , in possession of aeroplanes and engaged in carrying out activities not in line with the legal provision of international air service , using these aeroplanes with clearly provocative purposes , failing to recognize Cuban sovereignty and ignoring the very regulations of the State where those aeroplanes were registered and where the licences to fly them were issued to their pilots .  
To those who long ago declared invalid any legal measure of a foreign country against their businessmen and nationals , we here send a message of hope : Cuba , the island of the bold , is not going to turn away from the road it has taken ; it will not violate the hopes and trust of its friends or partners , in spite of threats and multilateral or bilateral measures that someone might try to impose upon it . 
A stable legal framework , fair and efficient law enforcement and equal access to public services and justice , in accordance with international standards of human rights , are essential conditions for the creation of transparent and accountable institutions , for the promotion of a public administration that is responsive to the needs of the population and for the prevention of and fight against all forms of corruption .  
Social trust can be increased , however difficult it may be to achieve consensus among those who have been combatants , through a predictable legal system , based on the rule of law , in which everyone can engage in social and economic activities knowing that a fair , impartial and predictable system of adjudication awaits any disputes .  
Despite differences or variances in legal systems , there was general agreement that extant laws governing administrative systems are too many and are redundant ; enforcement is slow , and some laws simply can not be implemented for a variety of reasons : lack of resources , operational or resource constraints , irrelevance or inapplicability of prevailing conditions .  
The lessons learned so far have proved that without supportive and predictable administrative and legal structures at all levels , and without access to public services particularly to a justice system the private sector and citizens would live in a state of uncertainty and insecurity , hindering the development of their full potential .  
This real accounting audit of personnel files , accompanied by a legal and organizational analysis , has revealed a certain number of failings that can be addressed through a proposed organizational arrangement linked to a permanent system of administrative management .  
We proceeded to achieve this with a special focus on India 's needs , and our Constitution set forth the institutional bases for resilient administrative processes , especially in the crucial areas of legal , judicial , parliamentary and democratic structures .  
Untiring efforts have also been made in the promotion of human rights , particularly in respect of information , democratic participation and the administrative and legal functions of democratic institutions guaranteeing the civil and political rights of the population , including documentation , the local administration of justice and civic education .  
These settlors need not only represent recognized legal experts in international military / peace / security issues , but also those having expertise in economic , social and cultural relations where disputes are most often the root cause of all disastrous conflicts .  
The representative reported on the Government 's priorities and future plans in implementing the Convention , including strengthening the national machinery for women ; vocational training for women and educational and awareness-raising efforts among teachers ; expansion of child care ; supplementing the recently reformed family law and the remaining legal instruments that involved unequal treatment of women ; improvements for rural women ; prevention of violence against women ; women 's participation in decision-making ; and possible creation of an equal opportunities commission .  
In our view , it is high time to concentrate the efforts of United Nations Member States on the formation of a legal basis which would allow us to implement this important initiative as one of the steps towards increasing the level of international economic security , securing the global coordination of the activities of international , regional and national economic institutions and preventing economic coercion and discrimination .  
The core objectives of the programme were , inter alia , to create and adjust the country 's macroeconomic policy , ensure a correct legal and regulatory framework for the development of a strong market economy , provide a transparent and accountable policy framework aimed at promoting investment , allocate adequate budgetary resources for social programmes , create the necessary conditions for the establishment and consolidation of democratic institutions and support good governance and political stability .  
There is no doubt that this singular situation , in which the creator of the rule of law is also its direct object , is less favourable to the development of a legal system which is balanced , whether as regards its normative scope or the material content of its rules .  
Given the new challenges of these final years of our millennium , the International Court of Justice today , half a century after its founding , has become the body to which States , both large and small , and international organizations are turning increasingly to seek justice or to request the Court 's authoritative opinion on disputes , differences or legal problems that arise or create differences between them , convinced that the only valid and lasting solution is one based on law .  
We consider that the unanimous opinion that there is in neither customary nor conventional international law any specific authorization of the threat or use of nuclear weapons should become the legal and political foundation for greater progress towards total denuclearization . 
The national programme on children is aimed at creating favourable conditions for : the development of children ; ensuring their legal and social protection ; preventing diseases ; providing the most reliable means of medical care and treatment to children ; implementing radical measures to prevent infectious diseases ; eliminating malnutrition among children ; and implementing measures to prevent crime , drug abuse , alcoholism and smoking among children .

Wilmot ( Ghana ) : At the World Summit for Social Development held in Copenhagen in March 1995 , world leaders took tough political decisions and committed themselves to create an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment that would enable people to achieve social development and social justice .  
Organized under the auspices of the United Nations , these global conferences have focused attention on the complex phenomenon of development in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , legal and related fields in a holistic manner .  
There is a widespread feeling of dissatisfaction sometimes veiled and sometimes explicit with an Organization that still embodies the loftiest ideals ever conceived by the human spirit in the search for peace and understanding among peoples .  Brazil is committed to the United Nations Charter and to the Organization 's political , legal and diplomatic legacy of the past 50 years .  
In addition , we commend the secretariat for playing an instrumental role in fostering the development of a global nuclear safety culture based on an improved international legal framework , recommended safety standards and advisory services .  
We are grateful to all Member States that supported our appeals and calls in the General Assembly for universal respect of international law as reflected , for instance , in General Assembly resolution 49 / 43 , which created the political conditions and legal framework for the peaceful reintegration of Eastern Slavonia .  
Poland believes , therefore , that the time has come to make a concerted international effort to agree on , and accede to a comprehensive legal instrument : a convention designed to enhance cooperation between States and facilitate the work of law enforcement agencies in fighting transnational organized crime .  
Therefore , any action taken by Israel since the beginning of the Madrid process to alter the political , legal or demographic status of Jerusalem is tantamount to creating a fait accompli to be imposed on the Arab party , which would constitute a judgement on the status of the Holy City before the beginning of the final status negotiations .  This is unacceptable and can not be conducive to the peace we all desire .  
Unless immediate steps are taken by the parties concerned for example , through the removal of administrative and legal barriers one of the most important provisions of the Peace Agreement will remain unfulfilled , with grave political and economic consequences for the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
This is being achieved through the pursuit of a sound and stable macroeconomic policy , supported by a prudent and disciplined fiscal and monetary stance , and the delivery of an investor-friendly institutional legal framework .  
It further emphasizes the paramount importance of strict compliance with existing arms limitations and disarmament agreements relevant to outer space , including bilateral agreements , and with the existing legal regime concerning the use of outer space , including wide participation in such a legal regime .  
The Working Group entrusted with this issue should also strive to reach an understanding on the possibility of harmonizing legal norms and existing national administrative procedures in the area of domestic control of weapons and in the import and export of arms , in order to establish a common and effective international arms control system that would make it impossible for arms to be diverted through clandestine or illicit channels .  
Stresses the need for Governments and relevant international institutions or organizations to examine how the rapid globalization of the world economy and the increased liberalization of trade is affecting the ability of States to design and implement effective strategies for eradicating poverty and to provide a stable legal framework that creates an enabling environment to achieve social development and to meet the basic human needs of all , in order to prevent greater inequality between different sectors of society ;  
Recommends that States consider more operational ways of integrating a social exclusion concept into the design of global strategies for eradicating poverty , notably through human rights , democracy , good governance and administration , a stable legal framework , participation in decision-making , non-discrimination , tolerance and mutual respect for and valuing of diversity , universal access to basic social services and adequate social protection ;  
In conclusion , since the Security Council has already decided that the UNCRO mandate in Croatia has ended effective 15 January , and thereby the United Nations mandate on the Prevlaka peninsula as well , and in view of the above-mentioned fact that the Prevlaka peninsula is an integral part of Croatia , the Croatian Government considers any and all requests designed and aimed at creating legal uncertainty and ambiguity regarding the status of parts of sovereign Croatian territory to be unacceptable , and contrary to the interest of peace and security in the region .  
The operative part of the resolution called on Israel to respect the relevant resolutions of the Security Council , declared invalid all Israeli acts in the occupied Syrian Golan , called on Israel to desist from attempting to alter the physical , demographic , institutional and legal character of the occupied Syrian Golan , and referred to the issue of settlements in that territory .  
Decide to combine their efforts to establish effective legal and judicial cooperation in the prevention of crime , especially transnational and organized crime , and the strengthening of criminal justice systems by developing and promoting international instruments pertaining to criminal justice , such as agreements concerning trafficking in women and children , genocide , war crimes , terrorism and drug-related offences .  
The human rights approach to women 's health implied that international and national policies must be based on recognition of women 's rights , including the right to reproductive and sexual health and family planning , and demanded full commitment to the removal of economic , social and legal disadvantages that denied women their right to health .  
The representative reported on the Government 's priorities and future plans in implementing the Convention , including strengthening the national machinery for women ; vocational training for women and educational and awareness-raising efforts among teachers ; expansion of child care ; supplementing the recently reformed family law and the remaining legal instruments that involved unequal treatment of women ; improvements for rural women ; prevention of violence against women ; women 's participation in decision-making ; and possible creation of an equal opportunities commission .

The Committee had played a vital role in promoting economic , social and cultural rights , by formulating final views on the way in which States had fulfilled their Covenant obligations , by defining its General Comments as a basis for jurisprudence in that area , by discussing the question of the elaboration of an optional protocol to the Covenant that would allow individuals and groups to present legal complaints with regard to the violation of one or several of the rights protected by the Covenant , and by successfully conducting its first technical assistance mission .  
Despite greater efforts by judicial officials to respect legal and constitutional guarantees - including procedural time-limits - arbitrary and illegal practices persist , including irregularities in the preparation of arrest warrants , restrictions on the right to defence , prolonged pre-trial detention and some cases of non-respect by prosecutors of decisions handed down by examining judges .

In his report to the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , the Secretary-General had stated that the lives of millions of Iraqis were threatened by hunger , which had not deterred the Power that currently dominated the world from deliberately ignoring the humanitarian and legal aspects of such threats or from using the pretext of human rights to serve its political purposes and seeking to overthrow the current legitimate Government of Iraq .  
Had the Special Rapporteur behaved in a neutral or objective manner , he would have called , without any hesitation and for purely humanitarian , legal and moral reasons , for the lifting of sanctions , at least in part on the grounds that human rights must be respected not only by individual countries but also by international organizations , particularly the Security Council .  
However , the Special Rapporteur indulged in an abstract political and legal analysis based on presumptions , allegations and misinformation with a view to emptying those decrees of their noble humanitarian content , seeking ways to exaggerate any shortcoming or weakness , presumed or real , in order to undermine the position of Iraq , thereby rendering his conclusions untrustworthy .  
At the same time , it is recognized that in a longer perspective the litmus test of internal peace and stability will be the ability of all social , ethnic and political groups in the country to advance effective processes for the construction of a civil society capable of solving disputes through legal , peaceful means .

In the specific area of the advancement of women , the emphasis would be placed on reinforcing women 's economic power , power-sharing between men and women , improving access to social services , raising their legal status through reform of the civil codes , reinforcing their role in the culture of peace , supporting women in particularly difficult circumstances and promoting and protecting the girl child .  
In view of the conclusions of the Colloquium , it had been decided that it would be worthwhile for UNCITRAL to attempt to provide a legislative framework to limit uncertainty in settlement of cross-border insolvency cases , for example , by drawing up model legal provisions and incorporating provisions on access and recognition in the text that it prepared .  The Commission had therefore decided to assign to a working group the task of developing a model legislative framework for judicial cooperation and for access and recognition .

Cuba has not violated the existing international ethical norms on the use of weapons against civil aircraft , nor has it violated any international legal norm or precept related to the safeguarding of international civil aviation , or the Chicago Convention , much less article 3 bis of the 1984 Montreal Protocol , for very concrete and evident reasons :  
The Government of Cuba has sound and undeniable proof , from the legal and political points of view , that the acts of violation and aggression against Cuban airspace perpetrated for more than 35 years , and most recently by aircraft of " Brothers to the Rescue " , have had a subversive , hostile , aggressive and terrorist character .  
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Azerbaijani Republic declares that the recent step taken by the Republic of Armenia in signing the aforementioned agreement with the illegal entity established in the Nagorny Karabakh region of the Azerbaijani Republic which is occupied by the Republic of Armenia constitutes gross and undisguised interference in the internal affairs of the Azerbaijani Republic and yet another infringement of the latter 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , and that it violates the universally accepted norms of international law and hence can have no legal force whatsoever .

Concerning the definition of an aerospace object , while we agree generally with question 1 , which considers the twofold capacity to travel and to fly into orbit as a specific characteristic of the aerospace object , we nevertheless admit that this interpretation is closely linked with the developing technology , and therefore we advise , in view of a possible legal definition consistent with the technological evolution , to thoroughly examine the aerospace object requisites .

That could include the development of model legislation dealing with matters such as the exercise of jurisdiction over stateless vessels on the high seas ; providing legal authority for stopping , boarding and searching vessels in accordance with article 17 of the 1988 Convention ; and the collection , translation and distribution of relevant legislation , of bilateral and multilateral agreements , and of national and international memoranda of understanding between States , agencies or other entities such as private companies .  
It was not really possible to develop a special legal status applicable to all the objects and systems concerned , because of their great dissimilarities ; it was more realistic to choose a legal status based on certain aspects , such as the capability of the aerospace object to travel through outer space and to remain in airspace for a certain period of time , and the technical design and nature of the object or system , for example whether it was single - or multi-staged , piloted or unpiloted , and launched vertically or horizontally .  
For geographical reasons Ecuador had demonstrated great interest in the geostationary orbit , which was a limited natural resource with special characteristics , and for which there should be a sui generis legal regime regulating access to and utilization of the orbit and guaranteeing equitable access to it , with account being taken of the relative disadvantages of the developing countries .  
The Subcommittee could contribute to establishing a special legal regime to regulate the use of the geostationary orbit ; ITU regulated only the technical aspects of its utilization , while the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its subcommittees were concerned with the political and legal aspects of the peaceful uses of outer space .  
Although it was a body that could boast of noteworthy achievements over the previous 30 years in the preparation of legal instruments governing outer space , there seemed to be a current of opinion to the effect that it had now served its purpose , since future space activities would tend to be regulated by market forces .  
The mission prepared a diagnostic study on the current socio-economic and political atmosphere for rural and urban micro-enterprises and on the current support being given to this sector by assistance agencies ; a set of recommendations for political , institutional and legal strategies for assistance and an operational approach to coordinating and harmonizing assistance ; and proposals for support programmes for access to credit and for the institutions supporting this sector .  
The United Nations system , the World Bank and International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) system and other multilateral and bilateral organizations have continued to provide invaluable support in the formulation of national mineral sector policies , in the enhancement of legal and fiscal systems , in facilitating forums for multi-disciplinary dialogue and in the deepening of necessary institutional infrastructure .  
However , while most developing countries and countries in transition are enthusiastic about encouraging foreign investment in mining , not all are capable of making the necessary macroeconomic changes and implementing the necessary legal and fiscal regimes that would be acceptable to the international mining community in a timely manner .  
The legal and fiscal frameworks should provide assured access to land for exploration , clear and transparent rules and procedures , security of tenure from exploration through production , a stable and equitable fiscal regime , equal opportunity to foreign investors and access to international arbitration .  
The United Nations system , World Bank and the IFC system and other multilateral and bilateral organizations have provided invaluable assistance to industry and host Governments in respect of mineral resource technical support and advice ; training of national staff in all skills required in mineral resource development ; hosting of regional promotional round-table forums to facilitate dialogue between industry , Government and facilitating organizations ; institutional structuring and reforms ; capacity building ; provision of research on trends in mineral , fiscal and legal policies ; and for commodity supply and demand studies .

Confronting mining issues , such as the technical , legal and financial constraints faced , as well as environmental pollution and degradation , is necessary but not sufficient for solving the problems inherent in artisanal mining , since one of the problems associated with this type of mining is that it may create immediate income but often does not create improved living conditions or social development for the regions in which it occurs .  
The seminar , which will take place at Bishkek , Kyrgyzstan , from 10 to 12 June 1996 , will deal with the following issues : national reports on drugs and organized crime , including a review of existing legislative and institutional frameworks for prevention and control ; impact of drugs and organized crime on security , democracy and economic reform ; prevention and control of corruption ; money-laundering ; legal and institutional reform ; and regional and international cooperation : conclusions and recommendations .  
It will require considerable technical expertise ( chemical , forensic , pharmacological and legal ) , as well as financial resources , at the country level .  
The new criminal provisions against money-laundering were based on the assumption that money-laundering could be defined as the systematic disguising of illegal assets , using the scope offered by the legal financial market , with a view to shielding them from seizure by the criminal prosecution authorities and preserving their economic value .  
The United States strongly supported the efforts of the United Nations and other global and regional initiatives designed to promote the harmonization of the world 's financial , regulatory and legal regimes , thereby achieving more effective control of the laundering of the proceeds of serious crime .  
Besides encouraging States to become parties to the 1988 Convention , to enact financial legislation that did not run counter to the guidelines of FATF , and to increase multilateral cooperation in investigations and prosecutions , the recommendations focused on the improvement of national legal systems to combat money-laundering , the enhancement of the role of the financial system , understood in its broadest sense , and the strengthening of international cooperation .  
Deregulation processes , new technologies , advancements in telecommunications and the creation of expanded economic spaces and market liberalization have had major implications on the development process , and have induced sizable productivity increases and new opportunities for profits , not only for the legal economy , but also , for organized transnational crime , which coexisted with , and benefited by , the legal economy .

Japan is of the view that , although it is necessary to consider the formulation of extensive and comprehensive measures , including the preparation of legal norms , in order to standardize the systems of Member States against organized crime , it hardly appears that there is currently an adequate common understanding among Member States regarding the actual pattern of illegal activity in question .  
However , in the absence of a general framework or model for international cooperation against organized transnational crime and in view of the diversity of legal systems , as well as the variety of the legislative agenda of countries , while desirable , it might not be appropriate and effective at present to effect world cooperation through such an international convention .  
On the contrary , this threat is an inevitable consequence of the activities of organizations that deny the State its legitimate monopoly of violence , corrupt State institutions , undermine the rule of law , threaten the integrity of financial and commercial sectors of society , contravene legal and social norms and conventions , transgress national sovereignty and violate national borders .

Such tools , revised to suit the local legal system and local practice , could be used at the regional and national levels and could form the basis for joint activities with other relevant international organizations .  
Following with increased concern and apprehension the continued Israeli occupation of the Syrian Arab Golan , Israel 's persistent refusal to implement the resolutions of the United Nations and to submit to the will of the international community , which considers the Israeli occupation and Israel 's decision to annex the Syrian Arab Golan as null and void and lacking any legal validity ,  
The idea of elaborating an international convention on the illicit traffic in children needed to be discussed further , taking due account of existing conventions in that specific area , which already provided a comprehensive legal framework ( for example , the International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children , concluded at Geneva on 30 September 1921 , as amended by the Protocol signed at Lake Success , New York , on 12 November 1947 ) .

Those who considered that the question deserved prompt consideration by the Commission stressed that rules concerning the nationality of legal persons might be more common in State practice and customary law , thus lending themselves more easily to systematization , in contrast to the striking absence of specific provisions on the nationality of natural persons in the context of State succession in the legislation of the majority of States .  
Create awareness among policy makers of women 's role in the conservation and regeneration of natural resources , including access to the required legal , scientific and technological means , and of their participation in environmental research by documenting and promoting women 's indigenous knowledge base ; advocate the increase of women 's participation and their perspectives in environment , science and technology research , policy and programmes , and more ethical science and technology ( UNIFEM , DAW / DPCSD , UNEP , Division for Science and Technology / UNCTAD , ECE , UNICEF ) .  
" Model guns " are toy guns made of metal that have forms similar to genuine handguns and that can be made into real guns .  In this context , " clean controlled delivery " involves secret replacement of an illegal handgun with a legal substitute .  
Its formulation of the legal aspects related to the application of the principle that the exploration and utilization of outer space should be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all States , taking into particular account the needs of developing countries , should consist of a set of legally binding principles governing international cooperation in those areas , rather than be a mere declaration having only political and moral force .  
During the consultations the following items proposed by some delegations in 1995 for possible inclusion in the agenda of the Subcommittee at its future sessions had been discussed : the status of the five outer space treaties ; commercial aspects of space activities , for example , property rights , insurance and liability ; a review of existing norms of international law applicable to space debris ; legal aspects of space debris ; and a comparative review of the principles of international space law and international environmental law .

However , it was pointed out that the scope of the draft Model Provisions was limited to matters of judicial relief and cooperation and that the issues to which article 14 pertained could not be adequately dealt with in the Model Provisions , without addressing a number of other substantive issues which were not covered in the current text ( such as set-offs and actions to reverse or render unenforceable legal acts detrimental to all creditors , see above para .  134 ) .

My delegation believes that our proposals on the size of the permanent membership and on the size and geographical composition of the non-permanent membership are a material and proper approach to the reform of the Security Council if the Council is to continue to have credibility as an institution which is representative of the international community as a whole and which therefore has the legal and moral authority to act on its behalf .

The Government has the power to establish the right macroeconomic environment , as well as a transparent , stable and predictable legal , regulatory and tax framework , and thus create favourable conditions for entrepreneurial and enterprise development .

Referring to the situation in Jammu and Kashmir , he said that India , despite having accepted the decision of the Security Council that a free and impartial plebiscite should be held to determine the legal status of that region , had resorted to unilateral measures to occupy the territory and had prevented the Kashmiris from exercising their right to self-determination as recognized in Security Council resolutions which were still valid and binding on all the parties : India , Pakistan and the United Nations .

The United Arab Emirates , which welcomes the peace process on the basis of international law and the land for peace principle , considers illegal and inadmissible all current Israeli measures aimed at changing the demographic composition and the legal status of the occupied Palestinian and other Arab territories , including the city of Jerusalem , Syrian Golan and southern Lebanon .  
Israel must fully implement its bilateral and international legal obligations , including , primarily , ending the construction and expansion of settlements , a complete and unconditional withdrawal from the city of Hebron , the release of Palestinian prisoners , and engaging in earnest negotiations in the permanent status talks with the Palestinian Authority in order to find a final and just solution to the question of Palestine .

Another view was that the concept of crimes in international law was well established and that for acts of exceptional gravity such a characterization with its legal , moral and political dimensions and negative and condemnatory connotations was quite appropriate .

The Commission 's new approach to the problem of deciding before which organ and on what legal basis a State could be accused of an international crime seemed reasonable , but the trouble with the choice of the Security Council and the General Assembly as the organs responsible for characterization of an international crime was that , as in the past , they might take a complaisant attitude towards extremely serious wrongful acts , and moreover their competence was limited by the Charter . 
Thirdly , the relationship between the States themselves : instead of waging propaganda wars and in some cases even resorting to economic coercion and the use of military force to deal with ethnic tensions and situations involving minorities in other countries , States should rely on the legal means provided by international human rights instruments , in particular the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , which contained a provision allowing States to make a complaint when they were not satisfied with the performance of another State in matters covered by the Convention .  
Nevertheless , the legal institution of reservations may well have to be reassessed in the light of the particular nature of human rights treaties ; this results from their specific object , which is to provide maximum protection for individuals victimized not only by their own Governments but also at the hands of private parties , from their recognition in international and regional jurisprudence as establishing non-reciprocal and objective obligations , and from the existence of treaty monitoring bodies .

In that connection , bearing in mind that the draft Code and the international criminal court would form part of a single international legal regime , he hoped that the court 's statute would provide more specific guidance on issues which were not clearly defined in , or omitted from , the draft Code .

In response to that suggestion it was observed that in legal systems that recognized insolvency proceedings of natural persons , such as individual traders or merchants , it would sometimes be difficult to establish a clear distinction between the debtors business and personal affairs , and that proceedings apparently falling in the latter category might well have influence on the debtors assets and liabilities .  
Furthermore , it was observed that the word was used in many international legal texts and that its objective and meaning were well understood : its purpose was to emphasize that public policy exceptions should be interpreted restrictively and that article 6 was only intended to be invoked under exceptional circumstances concerning matters of fundamental importance for the enacting State .  
The Commission considered the question whether the Model Provisions should expressly provide that a foreign representative had procedural " standing " ( a concept in some procedural systems referred to by expressions such as " active procedural legitimation " , " active legitimation " or " legitimation " ) to initiate actions to avoid or otherwise render ineffective legal acts detrimental to creditors ( such actions were sometimes referred to as " Paulian actions " ) .  
It was said that , if such standing was to be conferred on the foreign representative , it should extend only to actions that were available to the local insolvency administrator in the context of an insolvency proceeding opened in the enacting State ; care should be taken to avoid creating an impression that the foreign representative was equated with individual creditors , who under many legal systems had a right to initiate actions to avoid or otherwise render ineffective legal acts detrimental to creditors .

In response it was noted that the adjective " financial " had a narrow meaning in a number of legal systems , as related to transactions with currency , securities or stocks in the financial market .  Also the adjective " commercial " , which was used in some legal systems to refer to transactions covered by a particular body of law sometimes referred to as " commercial law " , might be interpreted as excluding certain categories of debtors whose transactions were not qualified as " commercial affairs " in those legal systems .  
Also , with a view to clarifying that paragraph ( 4 ) also covered insolvencies of individuals , it was proposed to redraft paragraph ( 4 ) to provide that , absent proof to the contrary , the registered office was deemed to be the centre of the main interests of a legal entity , and the habitual residence was deemed to be the centre of the main interests of an individual .

Their main objectives include assistance in drafting and implementing up-to-date legislation in the field of preventing and controlling organized transnational crime and associated criminal activities ; assistance to selected government departments in meeting problems raised by the legal reform process through training and the provision of short-term expertise ; and strengthening of the criminal justice system capacity to fight organized crime , also in cooperation with international counterparts .

Paragraph ( 2 ) , in turn , was not concerned with liability issues , but with the legal effects that might be produced directly by a foreign certificate , for example where that foreign certificate would be relied upon in the context of a dispute before the courts of the enacting State .

It was agreed that the reference to natural and legal persons should be complemented by a reference to electronic devices , which should be placed between square brackets , pending future consideration by the Working Group .  
Having completed its preliminary consideration of the legal issues and possible provisions to be considered in uniform rules on digital signatures , as reflected in part II of the present report , the Working Group noted that , for lack of sufficient time , it could not enter into any detailed discussion of the issues of incorporation by reference at the current session .

The view was expressed that in view of the special characteristics of the geostationary orbit , there was a need to establish a sui generis legal regime for regulating access to and use of that orbit , which was a limited natural resource , and that such a regime should guarantee actual and future equitable access to the geostationary orbit for all States , taking into particular account the needs of developing countries , including the equatorial countries , because of their special geographical characteristics .

Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods and the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework . 
In order to encourage domestic investment and to attract foreign direct investment , it is essential to have in place a stable , supportive , effective and transparent legal framework .

Nationwide municipal elections were scheduled for 13 and 14 September 1997 , just subsequent to the drafting of the present report .  
By monitoring sensitive trials and intervening with the responsible authorities , the Special Rapporteur and staff of UNHCR have played an active role in supporting the efforts of the Human Rights Coordination Centre of OHR to deter human rights abuses and build confidence in the legal system .  
The present legal and institutional framework through which legislative , executive and judicial powers continued to be exercised in Myanmar was not in conformity with established international norms governing human rights .  
This structured programme of technical cooperation in the field of human rights involves the principal elements of the administration of justice and legal reform ; penitentiary administration ; training and institutional support ; and genocide response and vulnerable groups .  
One of the principal reasons cited for the current situation of human rights in Afghanistan was the lack of central power , governmental institutions , unified legal system and a clear social , political and economic system .  
Development called for the private sector to act as the engine of sustained economic growth , in partnership with the public sector , which played a crucial role in basic infrastructure and services and in establishing and maintaining sound macroeconomic policies , protecting human rights and the environment and creating a conducive legal environment for private investment and entrepreneurship .  
The effective functioning of the justice system and , in particular , the independence of the judiciary have been seriously undermined by several factors , including military intimidation , political pressure , very low salaries and a limited level of legal training of the judges and prosecutors , publicly recognized corruption of the judicial personnel , and article 51 of the Civil Servants Act .  
In conclusion , the Special Representative urges the Government to complete its election preparations by agreeing on an appropriate legal framework , establishing an election commission that is clearly independent , taking legal and political steps to establish the Constitutional Council , creating guarantees that would give the political parties equal opportunities to express themselves via the media , demobilizing and disarming the armed troops of political parties , and ensuring political neutrality by all military and security forces .  
The Cambodia Office continued to benefit from the generous support of UNDP in several areas of its work , including the provision of legal advice to the National Assembly , supporting the National Assembly Commission on Human Rights and Reception of Complaints , provision of training for provincial judges and court staff , assisting the Government in developing forensic capability , and provision of training to police , commune leaders and military officers at the provincial level .  
By monitoring sensitive trials and intervening with the responsible authorities , the Special Rapporteur and staff of the High Commissioner for Human Rights have played an active role in supporting the efforts of the Human Rights Coordination Centre of the Office of the High Representative to deter human rights abuses and build confidence in the legal system .  
These included deferment of military service for Serbs in the region ; guarantees of Serb political representation at the local , regional and national levels ; and affirmation of the Government 's intention to protect Serbs ' civil and legal rights as required by Croatian law .  
The coastal State is also given the exclusive right to construct and to authorize and regulate the construction , operation and use of artificial islands.a * The legal status of offshore installations , the legislation applicable to workers thereon , the type of jurisdiction exercised by States over such installations and the possible obligations arising from licensing of the installation for the purposes of exploration and exploitation continue to be of concern to ILO , and work begun on this subject has not yet been completed . 
As in previous years , it is to be stressed that guidelines contained in General Assembly resolutions should be followed , in particular the desirability of using , as far as possible , the resources and facilities made available by Member States , international organizations and others ; as well as the need , in appointing lecturers for the seminars of the Fellowship Programme to secure representation of the major legal systems and to ensure balance among various geographical regions .

It was imperative that the international criminal court should be an organ that was universally accepted by all the principal legal systems as well as all the major geographical regions of the world so as to ensure its effectiveness and authority .  
In an indicative list , the Council identified macroeconomic questions , operational activities for development , poverty eradication , human rights , humanitarian assistance , budgeting , disarmament , peace and security , and legal and political matters as areas where gender mainstreaming needs to be pursued systematically .  
But it goes beyond a mere series of defined activities , combining political , economic , legal , social and environmental measures within a common framework .  
Similarly , any person entering the country had to declare cash in excess of $ 10,000 , and any lawyer or legal firm acting as the resident agent of a Panamanian company must know the client and keep sufficient information to identify him or it to the relevant authorities when required . 
The first , entitled Masses in Flight : The Global Crisis of Internal Displacement , a provides a global and regional overview of the problem of internal displacement , examines the legal framework for addressing it , details intergovernmental efforts at both the international and regional levels , and non-governmental efforts and offers strategies for improving the response at the global , regional , subregional , national and local levels during the various stages of displacement , covering prevention , protection and assistance in actual situations and the promotion of durable solutions .  
In the light of the current financial situation of the United Nations , the Committee 's attention is drawn to the established practice that all activities related to international conventions or treaties that , under their respective legal instruments , are to be financed outside the regular budget of the United Nations may only be undertaken when sufficient resources to cover the activities in question have been received from the States parties in advance .  
The number of such associations is constantly rising , and their diverse objectives include childcare , encouraging the work and education of women , raising women 's awareness of educational , health , social and legal matters and providing vocational training for women in skills such as dressmaking , printing and domestic food preparation .  
Given that the relevant international legal instruments have been put into effect , or are close to being put into effect , the Chinese delegation believes that the existing discriminatory and exclusive mechanisms and arrangements for non-proliferation not only run counter to those international agreements , but inhibit the social and economic development of various countries , especially developing countries .  They should therefore be rescinded ,  
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographical distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
Therefore , the Workshop considered areas in society where participation might be encouraged and developed , as in legal , political , economic and administrative areas , in addition to more traditional areas such as provision of social services , development of non-governmental organizations and access to information .  
Also emphasizes that an equitable and favourable national and international economic , political , social and legal environment , in accordance with the provisions of chapter 1 of the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , is essential for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographical distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
Invites States to allocate resources to provide comprehensive programmes designed to heal and to rehabilitate into society child victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation , including through job training , legal assistance and confidential health care , and to take all appropriate measures to promote their physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration ;  
Strongly urges all Governments to guarantee the respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , particularly the right to life , and to take urgent measures to prevent the killing of children living and / or working on the streets and to combat torture and violence against them , and to ensure strict compliance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other relevant human rights instruments , including the requirement that legal and juridical processes respect the rights of the child ;  
Among the cross-cutting development constraints hampering the private sector were an ineffective or shallow financial sector ; lack of a legal and regulatory system ; weak infrastructure ; obsolete technology , poor on - and off-farm storage facilities , high taxation , and generally inadequate support services ; an inadequate policy framework ; an inefficient and overly dominant public enterprise sector ; misdirected development assistance ; high transaction costs ; and lack of trust in the interaction between the Government and the private sector .  
Participation requires a guarantee of the rule of law and fair judicial procedures in order to reduce the likelihood of decisions that are arbitrary , corrupt and biased , which in turn requires a sound legal environment , including an independent judiciary with adequate resources .  
Other social groups that can be identified include ethnic and religious minorities ; indigenous people ; refugees and displaced persons ; migrants and migrant workers , both legal and illegal , as well as family members left behind ; prisoners and ex-offenders ; addicts and former addicts ; squatters ; street children ; people living in extreme poverty ; and landless rural workers .  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic , financial , political , social and legal environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
To that end , the Government is strongly encouraged to consider taking appropriate steps to develop a legal and institutional framework for public broadcasting to ensure that the State-financed broadcasting media can operate effectively as a public service broadcaster , with full guarantees of editorial and operational independence from Government and all other political influence on programming content .  
The Council recommended that the Commission be appointed by the Secretary-General and be composed of 5 to 10 impartial and internationally respected persons , including legal , military and police experts , under the chairmanship of an eminent person , and assisted by the appropriate support staff .  
The European Union accordingly supports unreservedly MINUGUA activities aimed at strengthening Guatemala \ x { e5b8 } institutions ; those activities focus most particularly on the legal system , public security , and the promotion of a multicultural , multilingual and multiethnic State , on education and promotion regarding the peace agreements and their dissemination , and on the creation of a national climate conducive to respect for human rights .  
It was noted , however , that the implementation of privately financed infrastructure projects required a favourable legal framework that fostered the confidence of potential investors , national and foreign , while protecting public interests .  
The Commission encouraged the Secretariat to devise ways to address the continuing and significant increase in the importance being attributed by Governments , by domestic and international business communities and by multilateral and bilateral aid agencies to improving the legal framework for international trade and investment .  
While acknowledging that the various working groups within the Organization were dealing with individual aspects of this problem , the sponsor noted that they were doing so in a context and manner which were primarily political and operational in nature , whereas the Special Committee , being a body with highly qualified legal expertise , was best suited for dealing with the mere legal aspects of the matter , which were the subject of the proposed declaration .  
Some other delegations considered the draft declaration to be a relevant , realistic and timely proposal , reflecting the need for consolidating and developing a proper legal basis and procedures for peacekeeping , preventive and other relevant operations of the United Nations .  
Among them , for example , are the requirements of article 20 of the statute of the Joint Inspection Unit and of article 21 of the statute of the International Civil Service Commission that their respective budgets be included in the regular budget of the United Nations . Another is the question of a legal basis for the United Nations , in the absence of an appropriation , to advance funds to the entities concerned , pending receipt of contributions from the participating agencies . 
A programme of technical assistance to municipalities is being implemented , with emphasis on improving local urban planning and management , the strengthening of municipal finances , and supporting the establishment of local institutional and legal frameworks .  
Among the issues that remain to be solved are the privatization of parts of the public rental housing stock , meeting the cost of renovation of private homes in mixed-ownership buildings , the future role of private rental housing , strengthening of market-type financial institutions in the housing sector and the introduction of legal and financial elements of real estate renting .  
During the next 12 months , we have to cope with a vast agenda covering a broad range of political , economic , social , disarmament and humanitarian issues , as well as legal , administrative and budgetary ones .  
The quality of the future to which humankind aspires depends on what we can do today to give human beings their dignity and guarantee that they can enjoy the fundamental rights recognized in the international legal instruments that reflect our collective conscience .  
This encouraging trend has been achieved through the adoption and pursuit by Governments of policies and measures aimed at ensuring , among others , macroeconomic stability , inflows of foreign direct investment , open and free markets and stable and transparent legal and regulatory frameworks .  
The key elements for attaining sustainable economic development are a sound policy framework that encourages stable growth , a vigorous private sector , the strengthening of institutional and legal foundations and , last but not least , good-governance and anti-corruption measures .  
The experience gained from the functioning of these two ad hoc tribunals has paved the way for the wider acceptance of the idea of an international criminal court , thus creating a firm legal basis at the universal level for the establishment of individual criminal responsibility with regard to war crimes and crimes against humanity .  
The present stage requires that we make effective use of every achievement by guiding United Nations action in an innovative and practical direction , based on operational legal aspects of multilateral activities against terrorism .  
Any move in this direction is bound to encourage certain dangerous phenomena that we have been witnessing of late , including legal and illegal emigration from developing to developed countries , that could sow the seeds of social , ethnic and cultural conflict . 
We also urge all parties to the FCCC to consider fully the Alliance of Small Island States ( AOSIS ) draft protocol during the ongoing negotiations , especially at the forthcoming Kyoto conference , in order to pursue the greatest possible level of net reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions by means of a legally binding protocol or other legal instrument .  
We have consistently extended our firm support to this legal regime , which has paved the path to securing our common goal of ensuring long-term , stable and sustainable living resources of the vast oceans and seas based on cooperation , mutual benefit and shared responsibility .  
These documents have established a legal order governing the ocean space which will contribute to the exploration of the sea for peaceful purposes and the equitable and efficient utilization of marine resources and facilitate the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order .  
In this connection , I am pleased to inform the Assembly that in October 1996 my country 's Parliament , at the initiative of the Executive , adopted a law that establishes norms and punishments for the crime of laundering money or goods derived from illicit traffic in narcotics , psychotropic substances or dangerous drugs , thereby significantly improving the legal framework for combating such crimes head on .  
This situation calls for urgent legal and humanitarian measures to establish a comprehensive global legal system banning all kinds of anti-personnel mines and to allay the pain and suffering caused to innocent civilians by the mines , which impede the social and economic activities of these peoples .  
The historical stance of Ecuador , a peace-loving country , has led it to reaffirm that the general and complete disarmament process , under effective international control , must move forward with firm steps , responding to the legal and moral conscience of the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean , which are pioneers in this area , as evidenced by the Treaty of Tlatelolco . 
The international community has acknowledged the extraordinary foresight of the authors of the Tlatelolco Treaty , who responded , in an intelligent and creative manner , to the challenge posed by the danger of nuclear proliferation by drafting an international legal instrument that has become an inspiration and a model for other countries wishing to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones .  
The differing provisions of each treaty may make the creation of formal legal linkages complex and difficult , but we see scope for developing political links between the four existing or potential nuclear-weapon-free zones .  
Article VII of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) and paragraphs 5 , 6 and 7 of the Principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament proclaimed at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the NPT established a sound legal foundation for creating new international nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of agreements freely entered into between the appropriate States for the purposes of strengthening peace and security on the global and regional levels .  
Among the measures taken by the Israeli authorities are the allocation of huge funds to change the basic features of Jerusalem and to erase its Arab character and the promulgation of special decrees and laws treating Jerusalem as a purely Israeli zone subject to the same organizational , legal and administrative rules applicable to other Israeli cities .  
In operative paragraph 2 , the Assembly would reaffirm that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that have altered or purported to alter the character , legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem are null and void and have no validity whatsoever .  
It was the Israeli decision to build a new settlement in Jabal Abu Ghneim in East Jerusalem that constituted its latest attempt at pre-empting the outcome of negotiations on the final status , by trying to change the legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem , a city which is of central importance for not only the Arab world but also the entire Muslim world , being the first Kiblah and the third Holy City of Islam , and for all three major religions , as well as for the international community . 
That will be possible only if the Security Council shoulders its full legal and political responsibilities : to defend its resolutions without applying double standards , especially since Israel , as we all know , continues to possess weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , that pose a threat to regional and international peace and security .  
There is a widespread need for more coherent and consistent policies , legal frameworks , fiscal and budgetary processes , institutional mechanisms , communication and education programmes , and better coordination between environmental and other ministries .  
In the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , 5 it is acknowledged that the family plays a key role in social development and , as such , should be strengthened , with attention to the rights , capabilities and responsibilities of its members .  Both call for creating an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment that will enable people to achieve social development .  
In this regard , the Habitat Agenda contains numerous suggestions for action , such as ensuring legal protection from discrimination in access to shelter and basic services ; helping the family in its supporting , educating and nurturing roles ; and encouraging social and economic policies that are designed to meet the housing needs of families and their individual members .  
Reducing budget deficits to manageable levels remains the major preoccupation of Governments , yet an inadequate legal basis , an unstable and exceedingly discretionary regulatory environment , high taxes and complicated tax systems and , in many cases , political uncertainties continue to force economic activity into the rapidly growing unregistered - and hence untaxed - shadow economy .  
In accordance with the resolution and arrangements : voluntary contributions paid to the Fund are distributed , through established channels of assistance , as humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals who have been tortured and to their relatives ; the Fund is administered by the Secretary-General with the advice of a board of trustees authorized to promote and solicit contributions and pledges ; and an annual report is submitted by the Secretary-General to the Assembly and , as appropriate , to the Commission on Human Rights .  
The basic principles governing these programmes were to respect and preserve , through bicultural education , the ethnic identity of each of the seven Mayan language groups , guaranteeing their legal stay and security in Mexico , until such time as they individually expressed their preference for voluntary repatriation , and to offer them a standard of living and opportunities for development and work equivalent to those of the Mexican population living in the same area .  
Decides to establish an Ad Hoc Committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies or of the International Atomic Energy Agency , to elaborate an international convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings and , subsequently , an international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism , to supplement related existing international instruments , and thereafter to address means of further developing a comprehensive legal framework of conventions dealing with international terrorism ;  
The legal system of every State shall provide for prompt and effective disciplinary , administrative , civil and criminal procedures so as to ensure readily accessible and adequate redress , and protection from intimidation and retaliation .  
In addition to the compensation fund and the retroactive promotion , the State Department agreed to reinstate four Black junior officers who were dismissed after failing to win permanent positions and to pay $ 2.1-million in legal fees to lawyers who represented the Black diplomats .  
In the context of the Programme of Action for the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education and in cooperation with relevant experts and organizations , HCHR / CHR has envisaged the preparation and publication of six new training manuals - for prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , legal professionals , national and local non-governmental organizations , mass media and for monitoring - and three handbooks on human rights and conflict resolution , human rights and parliament , and human rights and constitutions .  
If undertaken on the basis of an integrated and participatory approach - with the Governments as the formulators and enforcers of economic and legal policies , non-governmental organizations and the scientific community as the environmental agencies that know the most about the resilience and carrying capacity of the Earth , and the private sector as the prime mover for technological development , transfer and diffusion - TNAs can contribute to policy integration by making both public and private decision makers more aware of the environmental consequences of their actions .  
Consultation and information exchange , including through the use of interactive electronic networks , among existing NCPCs and with other parts of the local or national EST support structure ( for example , information systems and sources related to ESTs , technical advisory and consultation services , marketing support and legal advice services , and institutions of research and development ) , are important .  
The authorities of the National Committee for Aid to Refugees , Returnees and Displaced Persons ( CEAR ) have said that the working strategies in the area concerned the management of the process of return : consolidation of reintegration ; land-use planning in conjunction with agro _ ecological studies and definition of the population base ; consolidation of return : socio _ economic reintegration process to promote integrated community development , legal security of land , legal and moral responsibility in paying for property , and planning strategies .  
It is important to note that the Habitat II Conference reconfirmed the legal status of the human right to adequate housing as set forth in the relevant international instruments and stressed that this right should be progressively , but fully , realized .  
At present , the Programmes ' main activities concentrated on : ( i ) access to finance on international terms and conditions ; ( ii ) setting up regional centres to promote competitiveness ; ( iii ) developing suppliers ; ( iv ) disseminating information and promoting innovation and technical change ; ( v ) improving transport , communications and the legal framework .  
While legal and institutional instruments have definitely improved the basis for sustainable development of oceans and coastal areas , implementation lags behind owing , among other things , to ( a ) the difficulty in making political decisions regarding resources and wealth allocation ; ( b ) the difficulty of improving inadequate or inefficient institutions ; and ( c ) in many cases , difficulties in meeting the related financial commitments .  
The Amman Workshop reaffirms that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu .  
Member States shall promote bilateral , regional , multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements , to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .  
The Security Council welcomes the letter of 13 January 1997 ( S / 1997 / 27 , annex ) from the Government of Croatia on the completion of the peaceful reintegration of the region under the Transitional Administration , which guarantees the local Serb community representation and a voice at various levels of local , regional and national government , provides for a limited deferment of military service , and affirms the intention of the Government of Croatia to provide the local Serb population with the protection of their legal and civil rights under Croatian law .  
In central and eastern Europe , where the implementation rate according to the above figures is already somewhat higher than in the other two regions under review , recent regional initiatives aim at the introduction of harmonized legal , infrastructural and logistic conditions that would allow countries in the same subregion to conduct joint controlled deliveries .  
In addition , legal officers assigned to the investigation teams , with one exception , had little or no experience in criminal investigations ; yet they were charged with the task of advising the investigators on how to proceed to collect sufficient evidence , as well as drafting and defending the indictments .  This process has been corrected by the current Prosecutor .  
Further , despite pressure from staff in the Office of the Prosecutor and from both Prosecutors to provide day-to-day operational leadership as the senior officer , the Deputy Prosecutor did not assume the role : the Office continued to operate without sufficient staff and other resources ; without sufficient staff prosecutors who possessed enough relevant legal experience to direct the investigations and to prepare and conduct the trials ; and without critical day-to-day operational guidance . 
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographic distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and shall serve in their personal capacity and be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
More specifically , with regard to concerns expressed by the Inspectors , the Secretary-General proposes to follow the policy whereby gratis personnel would not be used to fill posts or discharge functions normally authorized under the regular programme budget , the peacekeeping budget or the peacekeeping support account , especially with respect to political , legal and administrative functions .  
In Israel , the Ministry of the Environment and its organs use all administrative , technical and legal measures provided by environmental laws , and by laws dealing with general issues , such as licensing , planning and public health , to implement bilateral and multilateral treaties that Israel has signed and ratified .  
While it was true that any enforcement of environmental administrative law was to some extent dependent on a general understanding that non-compliance with legal rules will not be tolerated , criminal law should only be applied as an ultima ratio , and should be restricted to the most severe cases of environmental damage .  
Further , the main focus of three OSCE seminars undertaken in the last two years was on global and regional partnership in the fields of environment management , environmental regulatory mechanisms and the transfer of environmentally safe technologies , international cooperation in protecting the environment , and promoting the economic and legal framework for environmentally sustainable development .  
Some States expressed the view that under the current legal system , there was no special regime that distinguished take-off and landing phases , but in the case of passage over the territorial airspace of another State after entry into airspace , international and national air law of relevant States could apply , in particular in relation to the sovereignty and security of the State concerned .  
Whereas in almost all countries of the world , with the exception of two , women have the legal right to vote and to hold public office on an equal basis with men , in practice relatively few women have been elected to national legislatures , and even fewer occupy key decision-making positions , including in international organizations such as the United Nations .  
At present , the Programmes ' main activities concentrated on : ( i ) access to finance on international terms and conditions ; ( ii ) setting up regional centres to promote competitiveness ; ( iii ) developing suppliers ; ( iv ) disseminating information and promoting innovation and technical change ; ( v ) improving transport , communications and the legal framework .  
This role was manifested at two levels : at the macro level in terms of creating an enabling environment , good macroeconomic policies , a sound legal , regulatory and tax framework and political stability ; and at the micro level inter alia through providing appropriate support measures and structures and investing in capacity _ building , including in the areas of education , training and health .  It could create an environment in which the private sector knew what was happening .  
Since UNCTAD did not have the resources to handle all the legal issues relevant to international trade and trade-related services , it could focus on a number of priority areas such as assisting developing countries in the modernization of trade-related national legislation , organization of educational programmes , preparation of information handbooks on legal aspects of international trade , advising Governments on measures to overcome legal impediments to the use of EDI , disseminating information on legislative reforms on issues such as electronic commerce and trade-related services , and legal assistance to Trade Points .  
Invites States to allocate resources to provide comprehensive programmes designed to heal and to rehabilitate into society child victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation , including through job training , legal assistance and confidential health care , and to take all appropriate measures to promote their physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration ;  
The South African political climate is fortunately relaxed and there is no persecution of any sector of opinion ; the rules in force are those of a State subject to the rule of law in which institutions such as the Parliament and the judiciary are respected and one of the main concerns is the solidity of the legal edifice , starting with the new Constitution , on the basis of which democracy is a stable system that is appreciated by all and capable of making South Africa a model country .  
What this report does want to draw attention to are the dangerous grey areas and the limits which need legal safeguards in order to prohibit such advisory services from becoming active armed participation in internal conflicts or in matters of the internal security of citizens that are connected with the exercise of the rights and political freedoms provided for in international human rights instruments .  
However , it is something that the Commission on Human Rights must not overlook and it has to be solved on the basis of more in _ depth knowledge of the facts , specific references and a systematic analysis concluding with suggestions and proposals for the adoption of political , legal and operational standards relating to mercenary activities and to companies which sell security internationally . 
Germany reported that illicit trafficking in motor vehicles was an area covered by the act to suppress illegal drug trafficking and other manifestations of organized crime ( OrgKG ) of 15 July 1992 , which contained specific legal provisions imposing severe penalties . 
Given the limited capacity of the judiciary , the lack of knowledge about national legislation among the population , and the lack of resources to make use of the court system , the large majority of the population will in practical terms have their legal status defined within the framework of traditional systems in the foreseeable future .  
Although the Commission was not yet fully functional at the time of the mission of the Special Rapporteur , standing committees had been established on relations with non _ governmental and community _ based organizations , and international and parliamentary liaison , on legal and constitutional matters , and on policy and planning matters , including those relating to women 's human rights .  
Most representatives agreed with the Commission 's proposed approach to separate consideration of the question of the nationality of natural persons from that of the nationality of legal persons and to give priority to the former , which , it was argued , involved human rights , while the latter raised problems of an economic order .  
In this regard , the Group expressed particular concern over the Israeli decision on 26 February 1997 to build a new settlement in Jabal abu Ghneim in East Jerusalem , which constitutes the latest attempt by Israel at pre-empting the outcome of the negotiations on final status by changing the legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem - a city which is of central importance to the Arab world and the world of Islam , the three major religions , as well as the international community in general . 
Given the fact that , on the one hand , legal rules were largely non-existent while existing rules were at times contradictory and , on the other hand , the use of electronic media had gained such overwhelming importance in international trade , it was clear that reliable and binding rules were badly needed .  
A deeper participatory role such as they seemed to crave would have been , in our view , wholly inconsistent with their function - to ensure a fair and impartial trial within accepted legal , procedural and evidential principles .  
In the light of the judicial nature of the International Tribunal , it is clear that any such determination would not affect ongoing legal proceedings or the obligation to surrender persons accused of having committed serious violations of international humanitarian law while the armed conflict was still ongoing .  
There is need for a coherent set of legislative measures with programmes to achieve strengthening of the small business [ and informal ] sector through the development of appropriate legal , management and financial structures , to enable the sector to develop in a sustained and organized way ; and to initiate and strengthen financing mechanism that enhance small business [ and informal ] sector access to financial services and to reduce the cost of providing and acquiring these services .  
We are concerned to see the Israeli authorities continuing to commit certain acts that are intended to change the Holy City 's demographic and institutional character in order to Judaize Arab Jerusalem and alter its legal , historical , religious and cultural reality .  
The Committee will consider relevant organizational and supportive arrangements for technical cooperation among developing countries , such as administrative , legal , informational and financial matters .  
In order to achieve this , the foundation for a single normative legal basis is to be laid by the end of 1997 , chiefly by developing general norms as well as unifying civil and customs codes and simultaneously introducing common taxation legislation .

States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural ] , administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
It is Japans fundamental view that the primary objective of any effort to codify a multilateral treaty on State responsibility is to provide an effective legal framework for the resolution of international disputes on that subject .  
Expresses its grave concern at the adoption by the Knesset of the law of 26 January 1999 and the legislation of 27 January 1999 , and reaffirms that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel , the occupying Power , which have altered or purport to alter the character , legal status and demographic composition of Occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory , are all null and void and have no validity whatsoever ;  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem ,  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949,3 and have no legal effect ;  
This first bilateral accord opposing the global sex trade in women committed considerable resources to legal initiatives and programmes of research , education and social services directed to eradicating trafficking and prostitution of women .  
In its report on its fourth session ( E / CN . 17 / 1997 / 12 ) , IPF concluded that there is a need for a broad set of reliable data of high integrity , covering social , cultural , economic , ecological , institutional and legal aspects of forests , in order to have an adequate grasp of progress as well as of the impact of the state of forests on the environment , human well-being and the economy .  
Moreover , juridical bodies for the protection of human rights , unlike those concerned with diplomatic protection , were well established in both the internal legal order and the international system ; that was a matter that the Commission should consider .  
A view was also expressed that a major difficulty lay in the virtual impossibility of distinguishing between unilateral acts aimed at creating a normative legal obligation and those which were purely political in nature .  
It was observed that , whichever term was selected , it was essential to clarify the legal consequences arising from the violation of the two categories of rules and to determine the degrees of responsibility in each case , in order to establish an objective criterion based not on the damage or blame ( dolus or culpa ) , but rather on the magnitude of the wrongful act and its effects . 
A view was expressed that the 1998 split session had been a success since the Commission had completed both the set of 17 draft articles on prevention of transboundary damage from hazardous activities and the draft guidelines on reservations to treaties and had offered the possibility to legal advisers of permanent missions at New York to observe the work of the Commission and to meet its members .  
There is thus a need for strengthened international cooperation with a view to enhancing the legal protection of vulnerable groups in internal conflict , to improve international monitoring and to promote an active role of the international community in protecting human rights and fundamental humanitarian standards in such situations .  
At the normative level , it is important to emphasize that , despite the specific nature of today 's armed conflicts , the international community seems to have at its disposal a sufficient arsenal of legal instruments to protect civilian populations .  
The real test of States as to the seriousness they attach to international humanitarian law comes when they face clear and immediate threats to their national security and nonetheless demonstrate a decisive determination to educate their armed forces , to incorporate their legal processes and to retain transparency in order to protect the rights of civilians in armed conflict .  
The Secretariat has accordingly pursued a policy of waiving the immunity from legal process enjoyed by force commanders and other peacekeeping personnel to the extent necessary to permit them to answer questions that seek to establish the existence of any of the elements of any of the crimes set out in the statutes of the international tribunals , or that might establish the existence , in respect of any individual , of circumstances of an exculpatory or mitigatory nature .  
Support to peacekeeping exercises focuses on the multidimensional and multinational aspects of this training and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations routinely provides not just military and civilian police role players and trainers , but also Special Representatives of the Secretary-General , political , legal and public information staff members and humanitarian , human rights and non-governmental organization coordinators .  
The degree of dangerousness will be assessed through a multidimensional approach based on different conceptual areas and related indicators that characterize organized criminal groups , such as financial strength , use of violence , capacity to infiltrate public institutions and legal environment in which they operate .  
The main elements that characterize a particular market structure include barriers to the entry of competitors of an economic , legal , technical or other nature , the degree of vertical or horizontal integration , the number of companies operating in the market as well as the availability of substitute products or services .  
Expresses its grave concern at the adoption by the Knesset of the law of 26 January 1999 and the legislation of 27 January 1999 , and reaffirms that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel , the occupying Power , which have altered or purport to alter the character , legal status and demographic composition of Occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory , are all null and void and have no validity whatsoever ;  
A protected area may be defined as an area of land and / or sea especially dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity , and of natural and associated cultural values , and managed through legal or other effective means .  
These could include making appropriate amendments to existing forms of intellectual property rights ; implementing new administrative procedures ( for example , with regard to the patent application process ) ; and using alternative standard forms of legal protection rather than by legislation ( for example , material transfer agreements , biodiversity contracts and licencing agreements ) .  
It was noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
It was pointed out , however , that the obligation to operate a CRL might be appropriate for high-value transactions and certificates ( i.e . , for those enhanced electronic signatures that were intended to produce legal effect ) but would be overly burdensome ( and contrary to existing practice ) if it were to be imposed with respect to all certificates ( including cheap certificates used in the context of significant numbers of digital signatures ) .  
We are therefore convinced of the need to address these issues linked with the risk of weaponization of outer space in the CD in a coherent manner and review those gaps and loopholes in existing legal instruments that need to be closed in order to preclude the possibility of military conflicts in , or including , outer space .  
Negotiation of a free _ standing new legal instrument dealing exclusively with a transfer ban , even in a fully compatible way with the provisions of the Ottawa Convention , would raise a number of political and legal problems , such as lack of global vocation , setting a precedent by negotiating a partial ban after a clear majority of States has signed a comprehensive one , proliferation of legal instruments dealing with the same content , just to name a few .  
The report of the Director-General of UNIDO ( A / 53 / 254 ) included a highly justified critique of the so-called gradual approach to economic and industrial development , which posited a first stage of macroeconomic reforms , followed by a second stage of socio-economic , institutional and legal reforms .  
Obviously , however , development of the private sector was impossible without support at the public level , which should include , inter alia , demonopolization , the introduction of tax incentives , a sound legal environment and the promotion of domestic and foreign investment .  
Mother and child protection is ensured through special occupational safety and health measures for women , the creation of conditions enabling women to combine work with motherhood and the provision of legal protection and economic and moral support for mothers and children , including paid leave and other benefits for pregnant women and mothers .

The view was expressed that any legal principles of a possible future legal regime of the geostationary orbit , which was a part of outer space , should be consistent with the principles and rules of the Outer Space Treaty , which was the common legal framework for all activities in outer space and that , therefore , it was not certain that the geostationary orbit required a sui generis regime .  
The view was expressed that , while the scientific principles formulated in the working paper submitted by the Czech Republic were acceptable , a comprehensive analysis of the legal aspects , as well as the scientific and technical aspects , of the geostationary orbit in one single document was required , taking into consideration the regulations of ITU , as the examination of those issues should not be approached in a piecemeal manner .  
Some delegations expressed the view that , with the rapid evolution of technology and organization of space activities , the Legal Subcommittee needed to maintain its leading role in the development of legal principles and the identification of improvements to the existing legal principles and instruments governing the peaceful uses of outer space .  
Some delegations expressed the view that the note by the Secretariat on the review of the status of the five international legal instruments governing outer space ( A / AC . 105 / C . 2 / L . 210 and Add . 1 ) contained valuable analyses of and concrete proposals on the elimination of obstacles preventing the universal acceptance of the five international legal instruments governing outer space that warranted further consideration .  
Examples of such issues included whether changes of historic realities had caused some existing legal provisions to become irrelevant , whether some instruments and / or mechanisms provided for within the instruments were too cumbersome or confusing and should therefore be improved , and whether some provisions within the instruments were being interpreted and implemented differently by various States parties .  
Where specific legislation is required in order for the contracting authority to carry out certain types of projects , the relevant statute often sets forth the conditions for the operation and maintenance of the relevant infrastructure facilities and is supplemented by more detailed provisions in regulations governing that particular infrastructure sector and in the project agreement , an approach that is common to various legal systems .  
In some legal systems , an entity operating under a governmental concession to provide certain essential services ( e.g . electricity or potable water ) to a community or territory and its inhabitants is held to assume an obligation to provide a service system that is reasonably adequate to meet the demand of the community or territory .

The Committee is particularly concerned at the high and increasing incidence of drug and substance abuse among youth ; the lack of legal provisions in relation to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances ; and the limited social and medical programmes and services available in this regard .  
Each State has a prime responsibility and duty to protect , promote and implement all human rights and fundamental freedoms , inter alia , by adopting such steps as may be necessary to create all conditions necessary in the social , economic , political and other fields , as well as the legal guarantees required to ensure that all persons under its jurisdiction , individually and in association with others , are able to enjoy all those rights and freedoms in practice .  
To complain about the policies and actions of individual officials and governmental bodies with regard to violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms , by petition or other appropriate means , to competent domestic judicial , administrative or legislative authorities or any other competent authority provided for by the legal system of the State , which should render their decision on the complaint without undue delay ;  
Accordingly , his delegation believed that the time had come to strengthen the theory and practice of peacekeeping operations through the adoption of a comprehensive and generally acceptable document which would establish a legal and political framework for current and future peacekeeping operations , taking into account the lessons learned in the past .  
Such negative attitudes often lead to passive or hidden discrimination against migrants , and recourse to civil remedies is constrained by the difficulty of proving formal violation of rights and the financial cost involved in the legal procedures .  
States , in particular those which have already included international human rights standards in national legislation , should be urged to extend these basic rights to migrants explicitly , through appropriate legal enactment , due account being taken of the special needs and conditions of the various types of migrants ( recruitment , job and housing security , family reunion , education and social security ) .

Although the Anti-Rape Law of 1997 reportedly expanded the definition of rape and recognized the existence of marital rape , it nonetheless provided that [ i ] n case it is the legal husband who is the offender , the subsequent forgiveness by the wife as the offended party shall extinguish the criminal action or the penalty : Provided that the crime shall not be extinguished or the penalty shall not be abated if the marriage is void ab initio .  
Training : The Special Rapporteur notes with concern the Government 's apparent adherence to a formal notion of justice , as highlighted by the statement that [ i ] n the light of the fact that the valid Penal Code of the Slovak Republic provides for equality of justice for both men and women in criminal proceedings , no special standards for legal procedures and the conduct of persons active within the system of criminal justice that would enforce justice and equality for women have been developed .  
It was therefore necessary to formulate specific legislation and policies in the legal , economic , political and social fields and , at the same time , to promote the participation of non-governmental organizations and of society as a whole , as well as greater coordination and participation by the specialized agencies of the United Nations system .  In that connection , it was vital to maintain the valuable contribution of UNICEF and of the Committee on the Rights of the Child .  
Solving that global problem , which affected adoptive parents abroad as well as the institutions and legal systems of the babies countries of origin , required adopting the Special Rapporteurs recommendation that international and regional registers of adopted children should be established worldwide .  
Not only had India taken institutional , legal and educational measures to strengthen the role of women at the political level , but it had also taken affirmative action to ensure that women filled one third of the seats in all elected local , village and municipal bodies , thereby providing them with the opportunity to exert influence in the formal structures of economic , political and social decision-making .  
The Russian Federation was implementing the provisions of the conference under difficult economic conditions , but within a firm legal framework which included a national plan of action for the advancement of women to the year 2000 and specific federal programmes .

The Republic of Colombia is constitutionally defined as a unitary , decentralized and autonomous State , which has a republican system of government and whose legal and political organization is based on respect for human dignity .  
The decisions of the Constitutional Court clearly show that , in the Colombian legal system , military jurisdiction is of a special and exceptional nature and may handle the offences committed only when the punishable acts have a clear _ cut , close and direct link with official duties .

In order to prepare for the high-level consideration of the topic of financing for development , it was important to focus on a number of key elements : States should begin with the mobilization of domestic resources , review the allocation of national expenditures and their fiscal priorities , look into the private sector and review their legal and administrative structures for rapid growth .  
The declining trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) and the increasingly frequent imposition of conditions of an economic and financial or a political , legal or humanitarian nature had forced many developing countries to resort to private capital flows , which had been concentrated in a small number of countries and had proved unstable and crisis-prone .  
The third report , devoted to the definition of reservations , covered the majority of chapter II of the provisional plan of the study set forth in the introductory chapter of the second report . 148-Two of the planned sections , Distinction between reservations and other procedures aimed at modifying the application of treaties and The legal regime of interpretive declarations , have , however , been omitted for different reasons .

The view was expressed that any legal principles of a possible future legal regime of the geostationary orbit , which was a part of outer space , should be consistent with the principles and rules of the Outer Space Treaty , which was the common legal framework for all activities in outer space and that , therefore , the future legal regime of the geostationary orbit should not be described in advance as a sui generis regime , since that status would depend on the rules and principles agreed upon .  
The view was expressed that , while the scientific principles formulated in the working paper submitted by the Czech Republic were acceptable , a comprehensive analysis of the legal aspects , as well as the scientific and technical aspects , of the geostationary orbit in one single document was required , taking into consideration the regulations of ITU , as the examination of those issues should not be approached in a piecemeal manner .

There has also been growing recognition in the crisis-affected countries that improving the institutional and legal framework , including a consistent campaign against corruption , extremism and organized crime , is essential for effective economic and social development .

For the purposes of extradition under this article , the offences established in articles 3 ( [ Criminalization of ] participation in an [ organized criminal group ] ) , 4 ( Money-laundering ) , and 4 ter ( Measures against corruption ) of this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional principles and basic concepts of the domestic legal systems of States Parties .  
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal [ corporate ] persons may be punished in an effective , proportionate and deterrent manner and that substantial economic penalties may be imposed on them .  
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural , ] administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
Annual meetings during which all the major problems of society are discussed , with very structured progressive legal proposals ( many of which served as the basis for national legislative systems ) : the right of women to equality in all fields , not out of a rather empty feminism but out of simple respect for human rights . 
Further , the resolutions reaffirmed that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel that have altered or purported to alter the character , legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem are null and void and have no validity whatsoever .  
Jordans policy targeted the humanitarian dimensions of the refugee problem and focused on satisfying the basic everyday needs of the refugees and on furthering their political and legal rights to return or compensation in accordance with the relevant resolutions .  
Internal enabling environment : policy framework incentives for domestic private savings , equitable tax systems ( development and enforcement of ) , macroeconomic policies , disincentives to corruption ; good governance ; transparency ; effective regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector ; banking infrastructure , pension funds ; corporate governance ; internationally accepted accounting standards , and a sound legal system ( land and property rights ) ;  
First to re-assert our right to self-determination , which we have demonstrated to you is firmly based on the political and legal rights applicable to all Non-Self-Governing Territories on the United Nations list as established by United Nations resolutions and Covenants and international law as determined by the International Court of Justice . . . . 
The role of the customary areas is to be enhanced by the revision of their current uncertain legal status and by the creation of customary institutions endowed with powers at the local and national levels .  
In many countries , particularly those of the British Commonwealth , exclusive use and occupancy of land from time immemorial gives rise to aboriginal title , a title that is good against all but the Sovereign , that is , the Government of the State . 22 / Where aboriginal title is recognized , indigenous peoples have at least some legal right that can be asserted in the domestic legal system .  
Another discriminatory legal doctrine that appears to be widespread is the doctrine that States have practically unlimited power to control or regulate the use of indigenous lands , without regard for constitutional limits on governmental power that would otherwise be applicable . 
Hence , the intractable problems and legal dilemmas posed by the human rights notions and pretexts invoked by the opposing sides engaged in this vicious circle of controversial aims and doubtful means .  
These included policy , legal and regulatory frameworks for sustained development of mineral resources best practices ; transnational corporations contribution in the mining and energy sectors ; new resources of capital for the development of Africas mineral resources : tapping capital markets ; and alternative approaches to financing energy and power development : case studies from African and other developing regions .  
It is essential to fight for respect of human rights and norms of international humanitarian law , but solely through political and legal methods on the firm basis of the United Nations Charter and the relevant multilateral instruments .  
Projects aimed at the strengthening of macroeconomic management capacity , legislative systems , the legal framework , the judiciary , civilian police and election management capacity , along with mechanisms for political reconciliation , public administration and civil service reform , inter alia , must be explored , particularly in Kosovo , taking advantage of national human resources , experience and skills .  
However , when considering the legal force of its provisions , it must be borne in mind that , together with treaties , a significant role in standard _ setting in international law is played by custom , which is formed as a result of the international practice of States and gradually becomes accepted by them as a binding legal norm .  
All of this demonstrates that human rights have become a matter of international legal regulation and international protection , and the individual is considered to be a subject of international law with a clearly defined legal personality .  
Promoting the formulation , adoption and implementation of appropriate technical , institutional , administrative and legal measures contributing to improved protection of marine and coastal environment , including the rational use and conservation of their resources .  
Promote and facilitate integrated island management programmes , including economic and legal instruments , administrative structures and management procedures , for the improved protection and use of the resources of small island developing States , encompassing the totality of the terrestrial environment , coastline and adjacent exclusive economic zones ;  
Nevertheless , the treaty has established a legal framework for the resolve of the international community to halt all explosive nuclear testing and an appropriate basis for its appeal to all countries to commit themselves not just to a narrow literal interpretation of the provisions of the Treaty but to its substance and spirit .  
This process was very complicated from both the legal and technical perspectives and required a lot of resources and international assistance , so for us it seems disgraceful and unjust that in the context of mentioning countries which have abandoned their military nuclear programmes or forsworn nuclear weapons the name of our country is sometimes not even found .  
Took note of the information provided by the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) on how to sign / ratify the Tampere Convention which provides a legal framework for the use of telecommunications in international humanitarian assistance ; ( i ) Noted that the considerable recent advances in seasonal weather and climate predictions , including of such phenomena as El Nio , enable improved preparedness of vulnerable communities against natural disasters .  
It was noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
While it was generally agreed that significant progress had been made at those sessions in the understanding of the legal issues of electronic signatures , it was also felt that the Working Group had been faced with difficulties in the building of a consensus as to the legislative policy on which the uniform rules should be based .  
Consequently , the conclusions and recommendations to be offered in the present report will mainly refer to three of the five juridical situations originally identified : ( i ) where there is proof of international treaties / agreements between indigenous peoples and States , ( ii ) where there are no specific bilateral legal instruments to govern relations between indigenous peoples and States ; and ( iii ) situations relating to the question of other constructive arrangements .  
A critical historiography of international relations clearly shows the dangers of this particular kind of reasoning , which projects into the past the current domesticated status of indigenous peoples as it evolved from developments that took place mainly in the second half of the nineteenth century under the impact of legal positivism and other theories advocated by European colonial powers and their continuators .  
In addition , these contradictions place a formidable burden on the formulation and realization of future negotiated legal instruments between indigenous peoples and States : the difficulties of negotiating those new instruments without having previously identified and settled key questions need not be stressed .  
First and foremost , it must be pointed out that , at present and with very few exceptions - national and international legal texts having a bearing on the living conditions of indigenous peoples are enacted and enforced by State institutions without direct indigenous input .  
In many places , successive waves of settler migration from the metropolis ( in the case of Hawaii ) or of royal trading companies representatives ( frequent in the East Indies ) , and certain legal modalities ( some highly innovative , such as the perpetual leasing of territories ) emerged alongside the traditional juridical forms ( bilateral agreements and treaties ) .  
Special Rapporteur Martnez Cobo thought it convenient to explore further issues as relevant as the areas covered today by the provisions of treaties and other international legal instruments involving indigenous peoples , whether or not they are observed , the consequences of their implementation or lack thereof for indigenous peoples ( an issue also addressed in chapter III above ) , as well as the present status of those legal instruments involving indigenous peoples .  
The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that to link the determination of the original legal status of indigenous peoples as nations ( in the contemporary sense of international law ) or as non-nations to the single factor of whether or not they have formalized relations with non-indigenous colonizing powers , is faulty .  
It is important to recall that modern non-indigenous law long ago dispelled the theory which advocated that the absence of formal legal / political recognition by one sovereign entity ( or a group of them ) could determine either the existence or the juridical international status of another .  
It is the obligation of the entire international presence in Kosovo and Metohija to strictly respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Kosovo and Metohija , which implies respect for its political , administrative , legal , economic and monetary system and an unhindered functioning of public services in accordance with all Yugoslav laws and regulations ;  
The Year 2000 Management Group is supported by a year 2000 team , an interdepartmental task force coordinating year 2000 issues in the areas of information management , peacekeeping operations , humanitarian affairs , economic and social affairs , development cooperation , security and safety , facility management , as well as legal , financial and administrative issues .  
Consideration of additional international legal instruments : 3 .  States Parties shall foster development programmes and cooperation at the national , regional and international levels , paying special attention to economically and socially depressed areas , in order to combat the root socio-economic causes of the trafficking of migrants .  
Generally speaking , where an unlawful act on the part of a state authority causes damage to another person ( physical or legal ) , the civil liability for that act is incurred by the authority ( i.e . the State ) , while the public official representing that authority may incur administrative or criminal liability , but may not incur full civil liability except in certain circumstances ( for example , if the damage suffered is minor ) .  
While it was generally agreed that significant progress had been made at those sessions in the understanding of the legal issues of electronic signatures , it was also felt that the Working Group had been faced with difficulties in the building of a consensus as to the legislative policy on which the uniform rules should be based .  
These include reorganization of divisions ; formal procedures for setting priorities and monitoring at regular monthly meetings with clients ; establishing a continuing legal education programme for its staff to keep abreast of developments in , for example , the financing , insurance , copyright and trademark and arbitration fields ; playing a larger role in the selection and training of legal officers for peacekeeping missions and establishment of a time-keeping system .  
Acknowledge and promote the central role of families , parents and other legal guardians in educating their children and shaping their attitudes , and ensure that parents and persons with legal responsibilities are educated about and involved in providing sexual and reproductive health information , in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of adolescents , so that they can fulfil their rights and responsibilities towards adolescents ;  
Other women-based policies since put in place deal with the elimination of female genital mutilation ; adolescent health ; legal reforms to eliminate domestic violence and to raise the minimum age for marriage to 18 years ; and the development of a strategic framework for the implementation of adolescent reproductive health , among others .  
Our main objectives are to eradicate absolute poverty , increase access to basic education for girls , eliminate gender disparities , increase access to reproductive health care , and reduce cultural and legal barriers that discriminate against women and girls , as well as to reduce maternal and infant mortality rates .  
It is aimed at addressing a range of interrelated challenges , protecting individual social and economic rights and human rights in general , providing legal protections and creating conditions to protect the cultural , spiritual and intellectual interests of our people .  
We are also committed to developing cooperation with countries of origin , but we believe that a constructive approach to international migration implies first and foremost the protection of the human rights and dignity of all migrants , irrespective of their legal status , including through the adoption and enforcement of legal instruments , both national and international . 
This plan revolves around seven priority areas : first , improvement of the living conditions of women ; second , improvement of the legal status of women ; third , development of female human resources in all the development sectors ; fourth , access by women to effective decision-making ; fifth , promotion and protection of the girl child ; sixth , combatting violence against women ; and seventh , improvement of the institutional framework .  
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal persons held liable in accordance with this article are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal or non-criminal sanctions , including monetary sanctions .  
The supporters of such a revitalized protection regime are united in the belief that international cooperation for the protection of refugees is not only an ethical and legal imperative but also a prudent insurance policy for an uncertain future .  
The States parties to the present Covenant undertake to have respect for the liberty of parents and , when applicable , legal guardians to choose for their children schools , other than those established by the public authorities , which conform to such minimum educational standards as may be laid down or approved by the State and to ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions .  
As an urgent priority , UNMIK will thoroughly assess the existing legal , financial , and fiscal structure and capacities in order to put in place policies for the recovery , development and future integration of Kosovo into a healthy and expanding regional economy in Southeastern Europe .  
The Special Rapporteur stressed that in order for a legal act to be valid under international law , it must be attributable to a State , the representative of that State must have the capacity to engage it at the international level , the act must be the expression of its will and free of irregularities and it must be formulated in the proper manner .  
It was agreed to exclude from the study unilateral acts subject to special legal regimes such as , inter alia , those based on conventional law , reservations to treaties and declarations accepting the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice .  
At the service delivery level , UNFPA assisted in the establishment of a womens centre for reproductive health care , social assistance , legal and psychological counselling and community education at Burej refugee camp , Gaza , which served some 13,000 refugee women in 1998 and is supporting the establishment of a similar centre in the Jabalia refugee camp , Gaza .  
In accordance with the international standards , " a substantial autonomy " implies that some specific powers and rights , such as the right to the use of language , education and information in one 's own tongue , protection and fostering of one 's own culture and tradition as well as local administration affairs , are transferred to the autonomous region , which takes place within the framework of a broader constitutional and legal order in a sovereign State .  
The Special Representative of the Secretary-General does not and can not enjoy the powers to decide at his own discretion the validity of Yugoslav laws in Kosovo and Metohija , because it is an integral part of the constitutional , legal , economic , financial , fiscal , monetary , foreign currency , customs , transport and other systems of the Republic of Serbia and those of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
_ that free legal and other assistance is provided to trafficked persons and persons in prostitution in the course of any criminal , civil and other action against traffickers and those who violate the human rights of trafficked persons and persons in prostitution , including a temporary or permanent residence permit and a safe shelter ;  
Two main issues will be addressed : ( i ) the legal and practical implications of the constitutional provisions relevant to indigenous and tribal peoples , and ( ii ) increasing cooperation between and among government officials , national and international organizations , and indigenous and tribal peoples within the framework of Convention No . 169 , which emphasizes consultation and participation .  
With regard to trust , proper legal and regulatory instruments were required at the international level , which would need to be adapted to national specificities .  
Potential barriers , whether cultural and organizational , political and legal , technical and programmatic or economic , needed to be identified and then removed or minimized .  
By contributing to the Fund , States demonstrate their commitment to combating torture and their solidarity with the victims , enabling the latter to receive medical , psychological , psychiatric , financial , social , legal or humanitarian assistance and to resume a normal life . 
Appeal to all Governments , organizations and individuals to contribute generously to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture , if possible on a regular basis , keeping in mind the increasing demand for medical , psychological , social , humanitarian and legal assistance to victims of torture and members of their families worldwide ,  
Civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights have been codified in the International Covenants and ratified by a large number of countries , but the Declaration on the Right to Development does not have the status of a treaty and therefore can not be enforced in a legal system .  
Security Council resolution 1244 ( 1999 ) clearly defined the framework for the international civil and security presences in Kosovo and Metohija , which constitutes an integral part of the unified constitutional , legal , economic , financial , monetary , customs and tax systems of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
Under international standards " substantial autonomy " implies that some specific competencies and rights , such as the right of minorities to use and receive education and information in their own language , as well as the right to protect and foster individual culture and tradition and the affairs concerning the local administration , are transferred to the field of autonomy within the wider constitutional and legal order of a sovereign State . 
Kosovo and Metohija is an autonomous province and constitutes an integral part of the single constitutional , legal , economic , financial , monetary , fiscal , foreign exchange , customs , traffic and other systems of the Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
In this context , the requests of the members of the Albanian ethnic national minority and KFOR to be granted full control over the Inland Revenue Office , the registry of immovable property , vital records books and other registry books that constitute a legal foundation for the exercise of the rights of citizens on the basis of ownership of both movable and immovable property are also unlawful .  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
Another fundamental international legal instrument elaborated by the CD is the CTBT , a treaty which was a long _ sought objective of the international community and which is supposed to block any further qualitative development of nuclear weapons .  
This shows that the net of international legal commitments relevant for economic , social and cultural rights is fairly wider than would be assumed by considering only the number of ratifications of the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .  
The pursuit of sound , growth-oriented macroeconomic policies , moreover , needs to be complemented by a general social , legal and political environment conducive to the efficient functioning of markets and , in particular , to the development of the private sector , whose investment decisions are at the centre of growth .  
The Committee is particularly concerned at the high and increasing incidence of drug and substance abuse among the youth ; the lack of legal provisions in relation to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances ; and the limited psycho _ social and medical programmes and services available in this regard .  
While welcoming the State party 's efforts to adopt measures , both legal and educational , to eradicate the practice of female genital mutilation and other harmful traditional practices affecting the health of children , the Committee remains concerned at the difficulties encountered in eliminating such practices .  
The outrage duly expressed by the international community , condemning the Taliban as the perpetrators of these killings , and particularly the special attention given to this tragic event by the United Nations as embodied in Security Council resolutions 1193 ( 1998 ) and 1214 ( 1998 ) laid the political , legal and international groundwork for the investigation of the issue , identification and prosecution of those responsible for the murders .  
In this connection , there is an obvious need for international legal regulation of the worldwide development of civilian and military information technology , and for the formulation of a coordinated international policy on information safety that meets the needs of international security .  
A set of legal , institutional , managerial and procedural measures for follow-up have been outlined , including developing the technical capabilities of officials involved in the formulation of insurance policy and determination of premiums and their allocation . 
The Year 2000 Management Group is supported by a year 2000 team , an interdepartmental task force coordinating Y2K issues in the areas of information technology , peacekeeping operations , humanitarian affairs , economic and social affairs , development cooperation , security and safety , facility management and legal , financial and administrative issues . 
It provides a basic set of contractual provisions which can ensure that electronic commercial transactions may subsequently be concluded by commercial partners within a sound legal framework .  
It was considered to have been an important occasion for taking stock of legal and regulatory developments at the national and international level , enabling experts to give consideration to all legal aspects of electronic commerce , including their impact , problem areas and possible solutions .  
This implies the full respect of the unified legal , economic , financial ( the dinar as the sole legal tender ) , tax , visa and passport systems and observance of the laws of the Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that are in force , in particular those relating to property , legal and status and administrative matters , registry of citizens and issuance of personal identification documents , passports and other identity papers .  
With regard to trust , proper legal and regulatory instruments were required at the international level , which would need to be adapted to national specificities .  
Under this Act , foreign legislation which is aimed , directly or indirectly , at restricting or impeding the free flow of trade and the movement of capital , goods or persons to the detriment of a given country or group of countries shall neither be applicable nor have legal effects of any kind within the national territory .  
Ecuador has stated on previous occasions that it has not adopted , nor will it adopt in future , any laws that run counter to freedom of international trade or violate the principle of non-interference in the internal and international policies of States , which is set forth in the Political Constitution of Ecuador and , accordingly , is reflected in each and every legal , political and economic action taken by Ecuador both domestically and internationally .  
At its twenty-fifth session , the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers also rejected any arbitrary or unilateral measures , whether political or legal , applied by one country against another one and urged all States to consider this law , which is against the international law and norms , as null and void ( A / 53 / 95-S / 1998 / 311 , para .  69 ) .  
In various international forums , Panama has expressed its opposition to the growing tendency to seek to apply unilaterally with extraterritorial effect national laws and measures that affect other States in the field of trade and international relations , since they are contrary to international law , violate the principles of the legal equality of States , respect for and the dignity of national sovereignty , and non-intervention , and are detrimental to their harmonious coexistence .  
Venezuela believes that unilateral measures that are extraterritorial and coercive in nature , such as the embargo imposed against Cuba , have a negative effect on the legal regime which defines economic and trade relations between nations and an adverse impact on the efforts that have been carried out in order to achieve economic integration at both the continental and subregional levels .  
Such legislative , regulatory or administrative measures could include the use of authenticated end-user certificates , enhanced legal and enforcement measures , as appropriate , to control arms-brokering activities , requirements to ensure that no retransfer of small arms and light weapons takes place without prior authorization of the original supplier State , and cooperation in the exchange of information on suspect financial activities .  
In addition , the Office has developed a specific anti-trafficking programme whose objective is to work towards the integration of human rights into international , regional and national anti-trafficking initiatives , with emphasis on legal and policy development .  
The focus on human rights standards is further reflected in the technical assistance provided to Governments and in the strengthening of the institutional and legal environment ; in the drafting of new constitutions ; the reform of civil and penal laws and the establishment or rehabilitation of juvenile courts .  
The theme would include human resource development through basic science education , research and development , as well as their interdisciplinary aspects ; the transfer , commercialization and diffusion of technology ; increasing public awareness and participation in science policy-making ; and bio-ethics , bio-safety , bio-diversity , and the legal and regulatory matters affecting these issues to ensure equitable treatment . 
No doubt the shared use of facilities increases the legal and jurisdictional complexities of project financing , but increasing experience on how to tackle ownership issues has been gained through international water-sharing projects . 47 Also , the private financing of multi-country infrastructure projects creates complementary interests between landlocked and coastal countries as transit infrastructure directly generates foreign exchange . 
The representative of the Economic Commission for Europe ( ECE ) stated that the Commission had developed a unique set of international legal instruments governing international transport of goods and passages of vehicles .  
The project will lead to the development or harmonization of relevant legal instruments and to improved coordination among the concerned institutions and , based on an analysis of the institutional capacity to respond to that form of crime , will contribute to the development of a national strategy and elements of a subregional strategy against trafficking in human beings .  
The Central American Governments must also contend with regional disparities among their countries in terms of human development , economic performance and their respective political and legal frameworks , all of which are obstacles to achieving integrated and sustainable arrangements for economic growth and stable political processes .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 53 / 155 of 9 December 1998 , stressed the importance of creating an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment that will enable people to achieve social development at the national and international levels .  
Mercenarism occurs in inverse proportion to peace , political stability , respect for the legal and democratic order , the ability to exploit natural resources in a rational manner , a well-integrated population and a fair distribution of development which prevents extreme poverty .  
To enhance the quality of legal services available to defend accused persons , the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the Tribunal were amended at the fifth plenary session in June 1998 , to require a minimum of 10 years ' experience in criminal law or international humanitarian law for inclusion in the roster of potential Defence lawyers .  
The provision to the effect that the revenues and budgets of all physical and legal persons will be made in foreign currencies is along the same lines , as well as the paradoxical provision that a compulsory payment may be paid in dinars with a charge of " an additional administrative fee to cover handling and transaction costs " .  
The Ad Hoc Committee , at its fourth session , held in Vienna from 28 June to 9 July 1999 , decided that at its fifth session it would focus on articles 4 , 4 bis , 7 , 7 bis , 7 ter , 10 , 14 ( paragraphs 14-22 ) and 15-19 , dealing with money-laundering , confiscation , extradition , mutual legal assistance , special investigative techniques , transfer of proceedings , establishment of criminal record , protection of witnesses and victims , and law enforcement cooperation .  
The Central American Governments must also contend with regional disparities between their countries in terms of human development , economic performance and their respective political and legal frameworks , all of which are obstacles to achieving integrated and sustainable arrangements for economic growth and stable political processes .  
The representative of the Economic Commission for Europe ( ECE ) stated that the Commission had developed a unique set of international legal instruments governing international transport of goods and passages of vehicles .  
Underlining the importance of the widest possible dissemination of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and of relevant training for , inter alia , civilian police , armed forces , members of the judicial and legal professions , civil society and personnel of international and regional organizations ,  
It is truly regrettable that , despite quite a number of basic instruments in international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law which provide for the essential legal protection of civilians in armed conflict , the gross violations of their rights around the world have not yet ceased .  
It was recognized that it is a duty of all States to hold accountable , through their national legal systems and through effective international tribunals , those responsible for the most heinous crimes .  
Underlining the importance of the widest possible dissemination of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and of relevant training for , inter alia , civilian police , armed forces , members of the judicial and legal professions , civil society and personnel of international and regional organizations ,  
He outlined the legal issues that needed to be resolved before the undertaking of actual proceedings , including the definition of applicable laws , both national and international , and procedural questions such as the appointment of personnel , the mechanism for appeals and the requirements for evidence .  
For some , the central piece in the struggle is the reform of the legal system , that is to say , the search for a system that is less arbitrary , less driven by ideology , less cruel towards its dissidents and criminals ; in short a system based on the rule of law built around respect for the personal dignity of all individuals .  
The awarding authority must , in each case , satisfy itself that the contract proposed has been examined and approved by the legal , financial and other officers as appropriate , that adequate tenders be requested , that , all other conditions being equal , the lowest price or bid be accepted and that the contract proposed is overall in accordance with the Agencys best interests .  
The Statutes of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries summarize the above in three general objectives : concerted action among its members at both the political and diplomatic level , particularly with the aim of asserting their presence in the international forums ; cooperation , particularly in the economic , social , cultural , legal and scientific spheres ; implementation of projects designed to promote and disseminate the Portuguese language .  
The only solution to this dilemma , therefore , is to further develop the existing United Nations system in such a way that in the future it is able to intervene in good time in cases of very grave human rights violations , but not until all means of settling conflicts peacefully have been exhausted and this is a crucial point within a strictly limited legal and controlled framework .  
This is what makes the ultimate sanction of the United Nations so indispensable , since an international legal standard can not except in exceptional temporary situations be the prerogative of any single group of States .  
It was noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
In contrast , the benefit expected from the Uniform Rules in favour of certain techniques , which were recognized as particularly reliable , irrespective of the circumstance in which they were used , was to create certainty ( through either a presumption or a substantive rule ) , at or before the time any such technique of electronic signature was used ( ex ante ) , that it would result in legal effects equivalent to those of a handwritten signature .  
Widespread concern was expressed that an enhanced electronic signature would be considered as if it were a distinct legal concept , rather than just a description of a collection of technical criteria , the use of which made a method of signing particularly reliable .  
My report to the Security Council on the protection of civilians in armed conflict ( S / 1999 / 957 ) , which was considered by the Council in September , contains detailed proposals on the legal and physical protection of civilians to enhance compliance with international humanitarian law and human rights law during armed conflict .  
As local institutions , including the court system , have for all practical purposes ceased to function , with the Indonesian civil service , police service , judges , prosecutors and other members of the legal profession having left the territory , the Transitional Administration will be entrusted with the task of rebuilding a structure of governance and administration capable of providing basic public services and a fully functioning administration of justice .  
This Convention sets universal legal norms which are intended to protect children from insufficient care , ill-treatment and exploitation and to ensure their enjoyment of their fundamental human rights , including the right to survival , development and full participation in social , cultural , educational and other activities .  
For the purpose of investigating the crimes [ covered by this Convention ] [ established in articles . . . of this Convention ] , if permitted by the basic principles of domestic legal systems , States Parties shall take appropriate measures , when necessary , to permit their competent authorities to use special investigative techniques such as controlled delivery and electronic surveillance within their own territories .  
Policy-oriented analytical work should be carried out by UNCTAD on : ( 1 ) the impact of electronic commerce on trade policies ; ( 2 ) the fiscal and financial implications of electronic commerce ; ( 3 ) the implications for developing countries of the legal and regulatory aspects of electronic commerce ; and ( 4 ) the impact of electronic commerce on employment , productivity and economic growth .  
The objective of the policy is to ensure that cooperatives , recognized as legal entities , are assured real equality with other types of associations and enterprises , and that this equality is extended to all organizations and institutions set up by the cooperative movement .  
Apart from universal adherence to the 11 existing international counter-terrorism conventions , along with adherence to various legal instruments adopted at the regional level , new legal instruments are needed to counter specific forms and manifestations of terrorism .  
In the light of the views expressed by the Presidents of the Administrative Tribunals , the legal advisers further considered the matter at their annual meeting in 1999 and decided to adjust their proposed amendment to accommodate the main concern expressed by the Presidents and to provide that the panel shall be composed of judges of the respective Tribunals designated by the Presidents , rather than the Presidents themselves .  
Whereas some emerging economies have taken full advantage of the possibility of attracting foreign capital , most LDCs were unable to do so due to a lack of adequate macro-economic policies and to the structural weakness of their institutional and legal framework , and in particular of their financial sector , as well as to the risks resulting from the volatility of financial markets .  Capital flow liberalisation must continue .  
Analytical work should be carried out on the establishment of a legal and regulatory framework conducive to the development of the private sector and favourable to FDI and to domestic investment and the development of local expertise as well as regional networks .  
I would like to emphasize that it was the Greek Cypriot armed onslaught in December 1963 against the Turkish Cypriots and the binational order that led to the division of the island when the Turkish Cypriots were forced to live in enclaves , deprived of all basic necessities and fundamental human rights , for 11 years prior to the legal Turkish intervention of 1974 .  
The UNITAR Fellowship Programme on the Legal Aspects of Debt and Financial Management has been developed to meet a need in providing training to public officials from sub-Saharan Africa in the various legal aspects of debt management with a view to developing sustainable capacity for the efficient management of international debt .  
As in previous years , it is to be stressed that guidelines contained in General Assembly resolutions should be followed , in particular , the desirability of using , as far as possible , the resources and facilities made available by Member States , international organizations and others ; as well as the need , in appointing lecturers for the seminars of the Fellowship Programme , to secure representation of the major legal systems and balance among various geographical regions .  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949,3 and have no legal effect ;

The Committee is similarly concerned by the different minimum legal ages for marriage , the absence of a defined minimum age of sexual consent for boys , the very high minimum age for consulting a doctor without parental consent and the extremely low minimum age of criminal responsibility - currently age seven .  
The Committee recommends that the State party conduct a comprehensive review of the Basic Law and domestic laws , including administrative regulations and legal procedural rules , to ensure that they conform to international human rights standards , including the Convention , that they are sufficiently clear and precise , are published , and are accessible to the public .  
Urges all Governments to continue contributing to the maintenance of a balance between the licit supply of and demand for opiate raw materials for medical and scientific needs , the achievement of which would be facilitated by maintaining , in so far as their constitutional and legal systems permit , support to the traditional and legal supplier countries , and to cooperate in preventing the proliferation of sources of production of opiate raw materials ;  
The theme will include : human resource development through basic science education , research and development , as well as their interdisciplinary aspects ; the transfer , commercialization and diffusion of technology ; increasing public awareness and participation in science policy-making ; and bioethics , biosafety , biodiversity , and the legal and regulatory matters affecting these issues to ensure equitable treatment .  10 .  Adoption of the report of the Commission on its fifth session .  
The theme would include human resource development through basic science education , research and development , as well as their interdisciplinary aspects ; the transfer , commercialization and diffusion of technology ; increasing public awareness and participation in science policy-making ; and bioethics , biosafety , biodiversity , and the legal and regulatory matters affecting these issues to ensure equitable treatment .  
The form of the assistance included study tours and training and the fields covered were corruption , crime detection , crime prevention strategies , criminal information collection and analysis , customs , drug-related crime , economic crime , evidence-gathering , extradition , financial investigation , institutional structures , institution-building , investigation materials , international standards and human rights , juvenile justice , money-laundering investigations , mutual legal assistance and organized crime .  
Elements of such an environment were considered to include sound macroeconomic policies , accountable and transparent governance , a sound domestic legal and regulatory framework , incentives for investment , the involvement of civil society in public decision-making and the strengthening of civil , political , economic and financial institutions .  
Each State Party , in accordance with its domestic legal principles , shall take the necessary measures to enable a legal entity located in its territory or organized under its laws to be held liable when a person responsible for the management or control of that legal entity has , in that capacity , committed an offence referred to in article 2 .  
Each State Party shall ensure , in particular , that legal entities liable in accordance with paragraph 1 above are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal , civil or administrative sanctions .  
States Parties shall further cooperate in the prevention of the offences set forth in article 2 by exchanging accurate and verified information in accordance with their national law , and by coordinating administrative and other measures , consistent with their respective domestic legal and administrative systems , taken as appropriate to prevent the commission of offences as set forth in article 2 , in particular by : ( a ) . . .  
Express our concern that beyond the material progress of racism is the disturbing fact that contemporary forms and manifestations of racism are striving to regain political , moral and even legal recognition in many ways , including through legislative prescriptions such as those relating to the freedom of expression , the platforms of some political parties and organizations , and the dissemination through modern communication technologies of ideas based on racial superiority ;  
Strongly reaffirm that States which pursued racist policies or acts of racial discrimination such as slavery and colonialism should assume their moral , economic , political and legal responsibilities within their national jurisdiction and before other appropriate international mechanisms or jurisdictions and provide adequate reparation to those communities or individuals who , individually or collectively , are victims of such racist policies or acts , regardless of when or by whom they were committed ;  
Also strongly reaffirm that as a pressing requirement of justice , victims of human rights violations as a result of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance should be assured effective protection and remedies as well as legal assistance , including the right to seek and receive just and adequate reparation or satisfaction for material and moral damage as a result of violations in the implementation of human rights standards ;  
Also affirm in particular that the victims right to have access to justice is of special importance to victims of racial discrimination in the light of their vulnerable situation , socially , culturally and economically , and that the principle of equality of victims in legal systems is meaningless unless it is accompanied by affirmative action ;  
The major political commitment of States is to take enhanced international action against corruption , through existing instruments , a new binding global legal instrument against corruption and other measures .  
By 2005 , most Member States that have not already done so will have developed , adopted and implemented the necessary domestic legal and administrative measures , which will create an infrastructure for preventing and controlling illicit transnational traffic in firearms and related items .  
International and regional forums will be established and expanded to bring together legal and technical experts in computer and telecommunications issues , from both the public and private sectors , to develop materials in support of the fight against transnational computer-related crime .  
To develop and disseminate policy , legal , technical and other expertise and information that will assist countries at all stages of legal , social and economic development in controlling computer-related crime in order to ensure that security concerns do not become an obstacle to bridging the digital divide between developed and developing countries .  
This will generally require basic policies relating to areas such as the balance between public - and private-sector control of such technologies , cooperation with other countries in technical and legal matters and the balance between the application of basic human rights such as the freedom of expression and privacy rights and the effective regulation of the technologies to maximize the benefits derived from them .  
Several representatives informed the Commission of initiatives taken by their Governments to promote judicial cooperation , as an essential tool to target drug-trafficking organizations and ensure the full implementation of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 .  [ 1 ] Several representatives referred to the bilateral and multilateral treaties and arrangements concluded by their Governments to facilitate the extradition of drug traffickers , promote mutual legal assistance in criminal matters , including the transfer of proceedings , and counter illicit traffic by sea .  
The action taken in response to that trend included the following : renewed support for law enforcement authorities in combating synthetic drugs ; the establishment of joint agency units ; specialist training for customs and police officials ; increased support for demand reduction programmes directed against ATS ; and further strengthening of treaties of mutual legal assistance to ensure successful investigation and prosecution of those engaged in such criminal activity .  
Stressing the variety of forms , modalities and experiences of democratic societies , taking into account national and regional particularities , the various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds , and the diversity of economic , political , cultural and legal systems ,  
The Subcommittee also agreed that there remained a number of issues and concerns to be addressed , in particular with regard to the relationship between that initiative and existing international space law and that , in view of its primary responsibility for the development of international space law , the Subcommittee should make every effort to deal effectively with that new subject of substantial legal significance . 
Firstly , those delegations were of the view that the fact that the preliminary draft protocol had been based largely on the draft protocol on matters specific to aircraft equipment failed to take into account to a sufficient extent the unique nature and utilization of space objects and equipment and their fundamental differences on technical , operational and legal levels from aircraft equipment .  
The view was expressed that the interaction and potential conflicts between the proposed system of international interests in mobile equipment and existing domestic legal regimes would require careful analysis .  
Critical factors to stimulate productive capacity include : stable macro-economic conditions , a conducive legal and regulatory framework , adequate institutional , physical and social infrastructure and a vibrant private sector .  
Stresses the necessity of establishing , at the national level , an enabling legal , political , economic and social environment for the realization of the right to development and emphasizes the importance of democratic , participatory , transparent and accountable governance , as well as the need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions , to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction ;  
To appeal to the United States of America to engage in a direct dialogue on equal terms with the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , in order to discuss and resolve whatever factors may be preventing the normalization of bilateral relations between the two countries , and allow the Lockerbie case to take its legal and judicial course , as required by the nature of the dispute and as agreed by all parties , free from pressures of any kind ;  
Tribute should be paid to the organizations of the United Nations system , Governments and the international community , especially non-governmental organizations , for the work they were doing to help , at both the psychological and the physical level , millions of children living in abject circumstances because they were victims of poverty , a precarious economic or social situation , sickness , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance , disabilities or lack of legal protection .  
In its view , the legal protection designed to counter the problem of the sale and abuse of children should not be confined to sexual exploitation ; it was also necessary to condemn the practices which violated international rules governing such matters as adoption .  
Despite the existence of an array of international legal instruments to protect children in armed conflict , the human rights of children continued to be violated with impunity ; there was clearly a need to reverse the trend from blatant disregard to strict observance of those instruments .  
Indonesia concurred with the observation made by the expert seminar that questions of racism and racial discrimination were complex and demanded comprehensive solutions that not only included legal provisions but also addressed social , economic and cultural issues .  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , while ensuring the right of every person to a fair and public hearing by a competent , independent and impartial tribunal established by law , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures , including legal and judicial measures in order to bring an end to impunity , to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
Invites States to take legislative , administrative , legal and other steps , including when a state of emergency has been declared , to take action at the national and regional levels and in cooperation with the United Nations , if appropriate through technical assistance , and to provide the Working Group with concrete information on the measures taken and the obstacles encountered in preventing enforced , involuntary or arbitrary disappearances and in giving effect to the principles set forth in the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance ;  
Stressing the variety of forms , modalities and experiences of democratic societies , taking into account national and regional particularities , the various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds , and the diversity of economic , political , cultural and legal systems ,  
The research was conducted in close cooperation with the Department of Legal Sciences , University of Venice , on the basis of extensive research , taking into account the normative framework related to the prevailing legal systems and examining difficulties arising from , and the implications related to , the constitutional , penal and administrative regimes of countries from all the regions of the world . 
IRU actively promotes the adoption and practical implementation of United Nations multilateral legal instruments on road transport in central and eastern Europe , in particular in newly independent States , as well as in Asia ; support and guidance to various EU aid projects on road transport .  It contributed to the elaboration of a draft revision of the European agreement concerning the work of crews of vehicles engaged in international road transport and to discussion on a draft revision of the consolidated resolution on the facilitation of road transport ;  
The role of developing countries in establishing or enhancing favourable conditions for a sustainable enabling environment for both domestic and international investments , including improving the legal , economic and social environment for investment .  
Other essential factors in promoting the mobilization of domestic resources for development are political stability , good governance and the rule of law , a sound and transparent legal system , guarantees for private investors , transparency in public administration , markets and companies , respect for contract law and private property , efforts to combat corruption at the national and international levels , the participation of citizens and civil society in public life , and equal access to resources for women and men .  
The Working Group is composed of five independent experts with the task of investigating cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the relevant international legal instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
The training and technical assistance programme carried out by the Secretariat under the mandate given by the Commission , in particular in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , encompasses two main lines of activity : ( a ) information activities aimed at promoting understanding of international commercial law conventions , model laws and other legal texts ; and ( b ) assistance to Member States with commercial law reform and adoption of UNCITRAL texts .  
However , the distinction between the validity of the contract creating or evidencing the security right and the validity of the security right as a property right is not universally prevalent , with some legal regimes extending the liberal validating rules of private international law applicable to the formal validity of contracts to the formal validity of the security right as a property right .  
As to the form that work might take , while a model law might be more desirable from the point of view of completeness and uniformity , to the extent that it would need to reflect certain fundamental guiding principles that would not be common ground to all legal systems , it would represent a significant change from current law in many countries and might , as a result , not meet with sufficient acceptance .  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and have no legal effect ;  
Stresses the necessity of establishing , at the national level , an enabling legal , political , economic and social environment for the realization of the right to development and emphasizes the importance of democratic , participatory , transparent and accountable governance , as well as the need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions , to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction ;  
Notes with concern the continued problems related to the rule of law and the functioning of the judiciary , inter alia , of corruption , including interference by the executive with the independence of the judiciary , welcomes the Governments continued commitment to reform the judiciary , commends its current efforts to prepare the laws and codes that are essential components of the basic legal framework , and urges the Government to continue to take the necessary measures to promote the independence and impartiality of the Supreme Council of the Magistracy and the judicial system as a whole ;  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of the persistence of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions in an increasingly globalized world economy , pandemics , in particular HIV / AIDS , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance , discrimination , disability and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
The view was expressed that , although the provisions of the treaties were managing well with the increasingly complex activities of outer space , member States should focus on their domestic legal regimes in order to ensure that the provisions of the treaties were being properly implemented , including putting in place appropriate domestic regulatory mechanisms to ensure effective compliance .  
Some delegations expressed the view that , with the rapid evolution of technology and the increasing commercialization of space activities , it was necessary to identify improvements or mechanisms to strengthen the existing legal framework governing the peaceful uses of outer space .  
The view was expressed that the increasing involvement of private industry in space activities required some clarification of specific terms within the legal instruments governing outer space activities in order to strengthen their application .  
While noting the work undertaken by ITU relating to the scientific and technical aspects of the utilization of the geostationary orbit , some delegations expressed the view that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Legal Subcommittee continued to be the competent bodies to discuss the legal and political aspects of the geostationary orbit .  
Firstly , those delegations were of the view that the fact that the preliminary draft protocol had been based largely on the draft protocol on matters specific to aircraft equipment failed to take into account to a sufficient extent the unique nature and utilization of space objects and equipment and their fundamental differences on technical , operational and legal levels from aircraft equipment .  
The view was expressed that the interaction and potential conflicts between the proposed system of international interests in mobile equipment and existing domestic legal regimes would require careful analysis .  
The view was expressed that determining the legal regime on the basis of where the object was located , that is , in airspace or in outer space , would result in practical problems relating to the law applicable and that a unified legal regime should be applied in the case of aerospace objects as long as such a regime was complementary to air law and flight safety regulations for aircraft ;  
Concern was expressed that , depending on the decisions to be made by the Working Group with respect to articles 2 and 13 , the remainder of the draft provisions might need to be re-examined to avoid creating a situation where the standard set by the uniform rules would apply equally to electronic signatures that ensured a high level of security and to low-value certificates that might be used in the context of electronic communications that were not intended to carry significant legal effect .  
It was noted that the Working Group on Arbitration had already begun discussing ways in which current legal instruments of a statutory nature might need to be amended or interpreted to authorize the use of electronic documentation and , in particular , to do away with existing requirements regarding the written form of arbitration agreements .  
It was noted that the Working Group on Arbitration was considering ways in which current legal instruments of a statutory nature might need to be amended or interpreted to authorize the use of electronic documentation and , in particular , to liberalize existing requirements regarding the written form of arbitration agreements .  
In the study , it was suggested that the most efficient technique for updating , under optimum conditions of speed and coverage , the definitions contained in all the different instruments inventoried in the survey conducted by CEFACT would appear to be the conclusion , at the initiative of UNCITRAL , of an interpretative agreement in simplified form for the purpose of specifying and supplementing the definitions of the terms signature , writing and document in all existing and future international instruments , irrespective of their legal status .  
The prevailing view within the Working Group , however , was that , although the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce was a useful basis for modernizing domestic legislation or interpreting international instruments , the legal barriers to the development of electronic commerce posed by international instruments , in particular multilateral treaties and conventions , required special attention .  
Thus , an analysis by the Working Group of legal issues related to the creation of electronic substitutes for paper-based transport documents would be a meaningful contribution to that other project , as it might result in the development of specific electronic commerce-focused provisions that might , at an appropriate time , become an integral part of that new international regime expected to be developed by the Commission .  
In view of the urgent need for the introduction of the legal rules that would be needed to bring certainty and predictability to the international regime governing Internet-based and other electronic commerce transactions , the view was expressed that the Working Group should initially focus its attention on issues raised by electronic contracting in the area of international sales of tangible goods .  
Urge those States in which the political and legal systems do not reflect their multiracial , multi-ethnic , multilingual and multicultural realities to review those systems , in consultation with representatives of the affected groups , with a view to improving democratic institutions so that they are more fully participatory and avoid marginalization , exclusion and discrimination of specific sectors of society , including indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other victims of racism ;  
At that time , the General Assembly confirmed the principle of adequate representation of the various legal and economic systems and of the developing and the developed world , as well as the principle of equitable geographical distribution of seats .  
Taking into account General Assembly resolution 55 / 25 of 15 November 2000 , in which it is stated that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime [ 3 ] constitutes an effective tool and the necessary legal framework for international cooperation in combating such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in endangered species of wild flora and fauna ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the bilateral , regional and multilateral legal instruments and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in species of wild flora and fauna and of illicit access to genetic resources , and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .  
Such legislative , regulatory or administrative measures could include the use of authenticated end-user certificates , enhanced legal and enforcement measures , as appropriate , to control arms-brokering activities , requirements to ensure that no retransfer of small arms and light weapons takes place without prior authorization of the original supplier State , and cooperation in the exchange of information on suspect financial activities .  
The Commission invited the intergovernmental open-ended expert group for preparing draft terms of reference for the negotiation of the future legal instrument against corruption , established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 55 / 61 , to take into consideration the observations contained in chapters III and IV of the report of the Commission on its tenth session in performing the functions assigned to it by the Assembly in its resolutions 55 / 61 and 55 / 188 .  
Apart from the advisory services provided by the Cooperative Branch specialists at Headquarters and ILO specialists in the field , the interregional COOPREFORM programme provides assistance in cooperative development policy , cooperative legislation , and cooperative support services , thus addressing the need to create a favourable legal , institutional and administrative environment for the development of genuine , viable cooperatives .  
It is advisable that a single department or office assume central coordinating , focal and liaison functions , of which the following might be most important : elaboration of a single national comprehensive policy in respect of cooperatives , formulation of guidelines for consistent execution throughout government , including monitoring and review of that execution ; collaboration with legal departments in drafting the general and any special laws ; and liaison , consultation and collaboration with the cooperative movement .  
In addition , public sector performance also depends on ( i ) appropriate sectoral policies in key social areas such as health and education ; ( ii ) productive capacity enhancement , depending on a vibrant financial sector ; and ( iii ) the streamlining of legal and regulatory frameworks .  
Political environment : It was broadly acknowledged that conflict prevention and resolution and good governance ( including a reliable , effective , and transparent legal and administrative system ) are indispensable elements for sustainable and people-centered development .  
Taking into account General Assembly resolution 55 / 25 of 15 November 2000 , in which it is stated that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime [ 3 ] constitutes an effective tool and the necessary legal framework for international cooperation in combating such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna , in furtherance of the principles of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the bilateral , regional and multilateral legal instruments and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna by organized criminal groups and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with illicit access to genetic resources and also the extent to which organized criminal groups are involved therein and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .  
The United Nations system should be conscious of these perceptions ; point to the accountability and transparency mechanisms that are built in the functioning of the different agencies ( from the tripartite structure of ILO , to the requirements for parliamentary ratification of World Trade Organization legal instruments ) ; and continue to expand its outreach to all elements of civil society , from parliamentarians and local authorities to professional societies .  
In its concluding observations on the initial report of Kuwait , the Committee noted that the interpretative declaration regarding articles 2 and 3 of the Covenant , which constituted core rights and overarching principles of international law , raised the serious issue of its compatibility with the object and purpose of the Covenant . 44 The Committee found that the interpretative declaration contravene [ d ] the State partys essential obligations under the Covenant and [ was ] therefore without legal effect and [ did ] not affect the powers of the Committee . 
It also decided to limit requests for written information to statistical data ; information requested in the Committees reporting guidelines , but missing from the report ; points of clarification regarding the report ; and information on key legal , structural , policy or institutional issues or new developments .  
Taking into account General Assembly resolution 55 / 25 of 15 November 2000 , in which it is stated that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime [ 11 ] constitutes an effective tool and the necessary legal framework for international cooperation in combating such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna , in furtherance of the principles of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , within existing resources or drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna by organized criminal groups and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to prepare , within existing resources or drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with illicit access to genetic resources and also the extent to which organized criminal groups are involved therein and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .  
Some speakers noted that those and other issues related to the return of funds of illicit origin were the subject of constitutional and other provisions of their domestic legislation and that those issues would need to be addressed by the intergovernmental open-ended expert group to prepare draft terms of reference for the negotiation of an international legal instrument against corruption and the ad hoc committee for the negotiation of such an instrument .  
The Commission invited the intergovernmental open-ended expert group for preparing draft terms of reference for the negotiation of the future legal instrument against corruption , established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 55 / 61 , to take into consideration the observations contained in chapters III and IV of the report of the Commission on its tenth session in performing the functions assigned to it by the Assembly in its resolutions 55 / 61 and 55 / 188 .  
Whereas it is important that initial reports are comprehensive , providing a detailed account of the national legal , administrative and practical system of implementation of the Covenant as requested in the guidelines , it is questionable whether it is useful for the Committee to ask States parties to repeat such information in their periodic reports .  
In future , it will limit requests for written information to statistical data , information requested in the guidelines but missing in the report points of clarification regarding the report , and information on key legal , structural , policy and institutional issues ( for the initial report ) or new developments ( with regard to periodic reports ) .  
With a view to achieving sustainable development of production , the agreements established the need for legal , institutional and financial reforms in order to consolidate a democratic , inclusive , decentralized and participatory State .  
They therefore include commitments on amending the legal framework , strengthening and decentralizing the Ministry of Labour and Social Security , providing occupational training and education , improving social security and expanding its coverage , protecting the most vulnerable categories of workers and promoting collective bargaining and consensus methods of settling labour disputes .  
ILO Convention No . 97 further provides that migrant workers receive treatment no less favourable than that which is applied to nationals with respect to remuneration ; membership in trade unions and the enjoyment of the benefits of collective bargaining ; accommodation ; and social security including legal provision regarding employment injury , maternity , sickness , invalidity , old age , death , unemployment and family responsibilities , and any other contingency which , according to national laws or regulations , is covered by a social security scheme .  
The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child guarantees the rights therein to every child and states further that [ e ] very child shall be entitled to the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms recognized and guaranteed in this Charter irrespective of the childs or his / her parents or legal guardians race , ethnic group , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national and social origin , fortune , birth or other status ( art . 
If we look seriously at the current situation prevailing in the way that outer space is used and other related developments in outer space , it would not be difficult to draw the conclusion that negotiating such an international legal instrument is not merely a necessity , but an urgent necessity in the field of multilateral arms control and disarmament . 
It would be quite a different matter , however , if the real intentions regarding outer space were to flout the obligations of international legal instruments and to seek unilateral and absolute military and strategic superiority based on political , economic and military strength .  
We appeal once again to all countries to negotiate and conclude an international legal instrument on the prevention of the weaponization of and an arms race in outer space , based on strict compliance with existing multilateral and bilateral treaties and agreements applicable to outer space . 
Critical factors to stimulate productive capacity include : stable macro-economic conditions , a conducive legal and regulatory framework , adequate institutional , physical and social infrastructure and a vibrant private sector .  
We resolve to promote increased and equal access for all people to open , efficient , effective and appropriate housing finance , to support savings mechanisms in the informal sector , where appropriate , and to strengthen regulatory and legal frameworks and financial management capacity at all appropriate levels .  
Acknowledging that non-discriminatory legislation and protective laws create a supportive legal and political environment for the success of public health development and national HIV / AIDS prevention efforts , the Latvian Government revised and adopted an adequate legislative infrastructure .  
In this context , encourage that the end results of these cooperative research findings and technologies be owned by all parties to the research , reflecting their relevant contribution and dependent upon their providing legal protection to such findings ; and affirm that all such research should be free from bias ;  
This legal / political controversy , however , belongs not in the debate on terrorism but in debates on which provisions of humanitarian law apply - those governing civil wars or those governing wars identified in article 1.4 of Additional Protocol I . [ 109 ] That debate would have to take into account , of course , the principle of self-determination , as set out in the Charter of the United Nations , human rights instruments and resolutions , with regard to the armed conflict in question . 
While reminding all States of their existing international legal obligations in the field of disarmament , the European Union further urges those States that have not yet done so to accede to the relevant international agreements and instruments designed to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the spread of anti-personnel mines , and further to join in the global effort to prevent the destabilizing accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons , thereby facilitating peaceful cooperation between States , which is crucial to socio-economic development .  
Calls upon States to promote and implement legal provisions and public policies ensuring Roma communities institutional development , their equal enjoyment of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights , their equal access to development resources and their full participation in decision-making process in central and local public administration , as recommended by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in its General Recommendation XXVII entitled Discrimination against Roma .  
Urges States to promote [ strive for ] full and effective equality justice for / to all without discrimination by providing appropriate affirmative action , especially to vulnerable groups victims of discrimination , / by ensuring equity , social justice and fair distribution of aid and community strategies and economic , political and social participation / [ equality of opportunity ] through adoption and exchange of good practices on implementation of legal and policy measures ;  
To guarantee and promote [ strive for ] full and effective equality justice for / to all without discrimination by providing appropriate affirmative action , especially to vulnerable groups victims of discrimination , / by ensuring equity , social justice and fair distribution of aid and community strategies and economic , political and social participation / [ equality of opportunity ] through adoption and exchange of good practices on implementation of legal and policy measures ;  
Urges States to take all necessary measures to address , as a matter of urgency , the pressing requirement for justice for the victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and to ensure that victims have full access to information , support , effective protection and national , administrative and judicial remedies , as well as legal assistance , including the right to seek and receive just and adequate reparation or satisfaction for material and moral damage ;  
One approach , associated with Anzilotti , described the legal consequences deriving from an internationally wrongful act exclusively in terms of a binding bilateral relationship thereby established between the wrongdoing State and the injured State , in which the obligation of the former State to make reparation is set against the subjective right of the latter State to require reparation . 
The Government of Kuwait also provided information on a series of legal , practical and other measures that it had taken , including accession to international conventions , promotion of forms of international cooperation through bilateral agreements , support for regional endeavours and , at the internal level , measures to develop its national legislation and regulations .  
Some serious breaches are distinct legal wrongs in themselves , since the definition of the wrong of itself ensures that only severe or extreme cases are covered ( e.g . genocide , crimes against humanity ) , whereas others are general wrongs which in circumstances of extreme or systematic application may amount to serious breaches which affect all members of the international community . 
Following the Iraqi declaration of a comprehensive and eternal merger with Kuwait , the Security Council in Resolution 662 ( 1990 ) , decided that the annexation had no legal validity , and is considered null and void , and called upon all States , international organizations and specialized agencies not to recognize that annexation and to refrain from any action or dealing that might be interpreted as a recognition of it , whether direct or indirect .  
To ensure that all confiscated , seized or collected small arms and light weapons are destroyed , subject to any legal constraints associated with the preparation of criminal prosecutions , unless another form of disposition or use has been officially authorized , and provided that such weapons have been duly marked and registered .  
To ensure , subject to the respective constitutional and legal systems of States , that the armed forces , police or any other body authorized to hold small arms and light weapons establish adequate and detailed standards and procedures relating to the management and security of their stocks of these weapons .  
To regularly review , subject to the respective constitutional and legal systems of States , where appropriate , the stocks of small arms and light weapons held by armed forces , police and other authorized bodies and to ensure that such stocks declared by competent national authorities to be surplus to requirements are clearly identified , and that programmes for the responsible disposal , preferably through destruction , of such stocks are established and implemented and that such stocks are adequately safeguarded until disposal .  
States are encouraged , subject to their national practices , to enhance , according to their respective constitutional and legal systems , mutual legal assistance and other forms of cooperation in order to assist investigations and prosecutions in relation to the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects .  
ICRC , the organization charged with systematically defending and developing international humanitarian law , argues that armed conflict is one of the key reasons for the lack of food and violations of the right to food , yet the international debate on the right to food has made little reference to international humanitarian law . 23 ICRC argues that humanitarian law contains many provisions that relate to the protection of access to food in armed conflict situations and must therefore be seen as an essential component of the legal framework that protects the right to food .

Annette Lu is a so-called master of law , but unexpectedly she knows nothing about the history and geography of her own nation .  She has ignored logic , reasoning and legal principles , and wantonly spread splittist ideas .

This kind of " international interference " can only be applicable within the commonwealth of sovereign states basically sharing similar political systems , legal standards , and value concepts and reaching a common view on human rights .  
Li Peng said : Since the standing committee was established in each of the local people 's congresses at and above the county level , local people 's congresses , holding legislative powers , and their standing committees have formulated a batch of local laws and regulations .  They have made a positive , catalytic contribution to the consummation of the socialist legal system and to promoting the development of various local causes .

The Chinese government practices a policy of respecting and protecting freedom of religious belief , pursuing the principle of keeping religion , political power and education separate .

The judicial and administrative sector has a huge force formed by 110,000 lawyers , 30,000 notaries public , 120,000 grassroots legal service workers , one-million mediatory groups , and 10-million people 's mediators .  This force plays a very important role in safeguarding social stability .  
After two years ' efforts , the " 148 " legal service hotline , which originated from Shandong , has spread all over the country .  It has become an important channel for party and government leaders and the public to know and understand judicial and administrative work , and an important means to bring the complex functional advantages of grassroots judicial and administrative departments into play and to strengthen grassroots judicial and administrative work .  
The " 148 " hotline is a socialized , mass , complex legal service project , which needs to be run after an operational pattern characterized by persistent , unified leadership of the party committee , close support by related departments , and comprehensive coordination among judicial and administrative organs .  
ensure social stability at the grassroots level , ensure the security of grassroots political power , and ensure normal local economic and social development .

Meanwhile , military lawyers , as political workers , should consider the ultimate goal of their legal services as one of serving the armed forces ' political and ideological construction and increasing the relevancy and effectiveness of ideological and political work in the new period while performing their professional duties .  
Like their civilian counterparts , the legal affairs that military lawyers have to handle involve those relevant to criminal , civil , economic , administrative , maritime , and financial laws , and so they must be totally familiar with the laws and regulations of the country so that they can properly handle the legal affairs in the armed forces and legal affairs that involve both military and civilian departments ;

our socialist system is not perfect , the socialist market economic system and socialist legal system are still immature and unsound , while decadent feudal and capitalist ideologies and small-scale production as a force of habit still have widespread influence on society .  To be sure , there are many tasks for us to undertake during the initial stage of socialism .  
In the wake of the development of the economic structural reform and socialist modernization in China , and in view of objective needs , General Secretary Jiang Zemin expressly pointed out during the 15th CPC National Congress : on the premise that the four cardinal principles are upheld , we must continue to forward the reform of the political structure , further expand socialist democracy , develop a sound socialist legal system , rule the country by law , and build a socialist legal state .  
It is worth mentioning that the Fifth " Five-Year Plan " period was timed with the Third " Five-Year " campaign launched in China to spread legal knowledge among the citizens , which was held in the course of China 's building a socialist market economic system and under the great backdrop of the party putting forward , at the 15th CPC national congress , the proposal of administering the country according to laws and of building China into a socialist country that is ruled by laws .

the legal system of market economy is still unsound , the phenomenon of corruption is spread wide , and there are plenty of ecological environmental problems and so on .

" Special privilege " mentality , patriarchal style , obsession of hierarchy and other feudal things , in conjunction with the corrosion by decadent capitalist ideas and culture , have inflicted damage on the party building with regard to ideology , organization , and style of work , such that some leading cadres have obscured the nature and purpose of the party , even to the deterioration of the socialist democratic legal system .  
However , China 's current legal system is yet to be refined .  According to the guideline set by the 15th CPC National Congress , by 2010 , China should establish a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics .  As such , legislation is still an arduous task lying ahead for people 's congresses at all levels and their standing committees .  
Holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping theory , continuing to step up the building of democracy and the legal system , and building China into a country ruled by law having a high degree of socialist democracy and a sound socialist legal system , are an important assurance for the Chinese nation to realize the grand goal of rejuvenation , as well as an important contribution of the Chinese nation to mankind 's historical progress .  
In order to attain their unspeakable aims , cults always take advantage of loopholes in state laws and social management policies ; to the outside world they are cloaked in religious practice and working to improve people 's health , while internally they draw up strict regulations and prohibitions , and establish a strictly graded illegal organizational structure in a vain attempt to form a " secret kingdom " backed by " religious " beliefs outside the framework of a society with a legal system .  
- - We will perfect the mechanism for withdrawing enterprises from the market ; comprehensively resort to economic , legal , and other necessary administrative means to undertake bankruptcy proceedings against those chronically loss-making enterprises with debts in excess of assets and with no hopes of climbing out of the red ; actively and prudently close down those mines that are exhausting resources ; continue to close down the " five small industrial enterprises " in accordance with the law ; and eliminate backward production capability .  
Since the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy , we have been paying full attention to regulating people 's conduct with legal means in order to meet the requirements of developing the socialist market economy .

They practiced a double standard on the issue of handling heretical cults .  In its own country , the US has adopted resolute measures to deal with heretic cult organizations such as the " Planet " and " Branch Davidians " heretic cults .  However , in the name of " safeguarding human rights , " it has made a fuss about China 's legal activities to outlaw the heretic cult of " Falungong , " and this will gradually become an integral part of its China strategy .  
These Interim Procedures have replaced the non-selection resettlement model based on assignment with a model that combines assignment with self-assignment .  This model will help make full use of the expertise of retired cadres and help these cadres obtain their desired goal .  This model also provides a legal guarantee the reasonable distribution of high-quality professional human resources .  
Judging from the present condition , for a considerably long time to come , Sino-foreign joint ventures will still be our principal method to attract foreign direct investments .  There is no doubt that improving the relevant legal systems , freeing such enterprises from unwarranted control and making things easy for them , and eliminating the negative impact of legal factors on the investment environment will greatly enhance the confidence and enthusiasm of overseas investors and quasi-investors and touch off another round of investment high tide .  
The economic , legal , and necessary administrative means should be used comprehensively to shut down enterprises which produce goods of inferior quality , waste resources , cause serious pollution , and do not have production safety conditions ; eliminate backward equipment , technology , and techniques ; cut down on surplus production capacity , and prevent these enterprises from reviving .  
To put it in concrete terms , first , we will institute a standard modern enterprise system , encouraging large and medium-sized SOEs to practice the joint-stock system , amplify the legal person management structure , and change their operational mechanism through such forms as standardized listing in the stock markets , joint ventures between Chinese and foreign investors , mutual share-holding , and so on .

To carry out the struggle to " strike hard " and put things , it is necessary to build a contingent of political and legal workers into a strong contingent of political and legal workers who are up to standard in politics , highly disciplined , perfect in work styles , proficient in professional work , and firm in administering justice .  
Party committees and governments at all levels must provide the political and legal front with carefully selected cadres , who are ideologically and politically sound , proficient in professional work , bold and resolute , and able to meet the needs of the political and legal front , and strengthen the leading bodies at all levels of the political and legal front .

Everybody who has little , elementary knowledge of the international law knows that the exclusive economic zone is the major outcome of the long-term struggle waged by numerous developing countries for their legal rights and interests after World War II .  
According to the relevant stipulations of the 1982 " UN Convention on the Law of the Sea , " exclusive economic zones are neither territorial waters nor international waters , and they themselves have formed a category of regions with a special legal regime .  
To exercise sovereign right and exclusive jurisdiction over its exclusive economic zone , the coastal state is entitled to draw up relevant laws and rules to restrict the overflight freedom enjoyed by another state 's aircraft in the airspace over the exclusive economic zone .  Doing so , the coastal state can safeguard the aerial traffic order and flight safety in the zone and protect its legal rights and interest .  
China 's military plane tailed after and conducted surveillance over the US military reconnaissance plane , which intruded into the airspace of our coastal exclusive economic zone to conduct military reconnaissance activities , according to the international law and China 's law .  Exercising sovereign right in the exclusive economic zone , and safeguarding the national defense security is just and legal behavior .  
Jin Chanrong said : Currently , the political and diplomatic channels remain the main channels for solving the plane collision incident .  The denunciations made by the Chinese Communist side against the US side 's violation of international law and the mainland 's domestic laws were mainly aimed at supporting its own position , not aimed at taking any legal action .  
Although a number of developing countries or countries making an economic switch are practicing a market economy legal system , the market is unable to operate efficiently because the law and rule of law is not on a sound basis ; on the one hand lack of clarity in individual and enterprise property rights means that economic efficiency falls , contracts can not be effectively enforced , and disputes can not be settled in fair fashion ;

While maintaining social stability , it also aims to expedite development , strengthen the democratic legal system , promote spiritual civilization , and continuously push forward the development of the human rights cause .  
Overseas Chinese leaders expressed indignation at the hegemonic act of the U.S . spy plane 's collision with a Chinese military aircraft and the illegal invasion by the American plane of Chinese territorial air space and territory .  They reproached the United States one after another , saying that overseas Chinese and the Chinese people commonly consider this incident to wholly be the legal and moral responsibility of the United States , that the attitude of the United States is unreasonable , and its way of handling the situation inferior .  
We must build , in accordance with the requirement of " enforcing laws strictly and rendering warmhearted service " that was set by General Secretary Jiang , our contingent of political and legal workers into a strong contingent of political and legal workers who are up to standard in politics , highly disciplined , perfect in work styles , proficient in professional work , and firm in administering justice .  
The Standing Committee has also made a assessment of how administrative organs , judicial organs , and procuratorial organs carried out administration according to law and how the corporate law is implemented and an assessment of the work reports submitted by the cadres , who are selected and appointed by local people 's congresses , on how they discharged their legal functions and powers , enforced laws , and did official duties honestly and diligently .  
The Chinese Government has also revised the " Law on Regional Autonomy of Ethnic Groups , " adopted more policies for providing necessary preferential and favored treatments in the financial , monetary , taxation , and foreign trade aspects for areas exercising regional autonomy of ethnic groups , and provided a legal guarantee for the great development of the western areas .  
The circular stressed : The trial of cases should guarantee that basic facts are clear , basic evidence is sufficient and reliable .  It is necessary to strictly guarantee that facts and evidence are fully verified , the legal procedures and the application of the laws are proper and sound , thus guaranteeing the quality of case handling .  
Apart from similar stipulations on a country 's territorial airspace and legal status , the " International Civil Aviation Treaty , " concluded in Chicago in 1944 , in order to strictly classify the different legal status between civil and military aircraft , clearly stipulates in Article 3 : " The national aircraft of a signatory must not fly over the airspace of another signatory or land on its territory without special permission or other form of permission and abide by its rules . "  
The entire process of the incident was connected to historical , legal , cultural , language , and religious issues , and the only thing that was conspicuously absent was its military aspect .  US Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld did not even appear in public during the development of the incident .  It was not until 13 April that he held a news conference at which he complained that it was only the Chinese Communist plane 's provocative act that was the underlying cause of the collision .  
Moreover , it is necessary to use the positive and negative examples to conduct vivid and lively education on legal system in light of the realities of the economic and social life so that the vast number of people will know how to safeguard their legitimate interests and rights with the law and dare to wage the struggle against all sorts of conducts in violation of law .  
While instituting and developing a socialist legal system suited to the socialist market economy , we need to institute a moral system commensurate with it , and be good at merging the basic , important moral requirements into relevant laws and regulations and into various kinds of management in society , so as to ceaselessly promote the formation and perfection of the socialist ideological and ethical system .

It is necessary to unremittingly enhance rural grassroots cadres ' ability to lead the masses in readjusting the economic structure and developing the rural economy , try hard to improve their understanding of policy , enhance their legal sense , and try hard to raise their level and ability in correctly understanding and handling the people 's internal contradictions in the new period .

At the beginning of reform and opening up , China began to institute an intellectual property system .  After more than 20 years of endeavor , a relatively complete legal system of intellectual property rights has taken shape , and an intellectual property protection system that integrates judiciary with administrative law enforcement has been instituted .  In the protection of intellectual property rights , a lot of work has been done , which has made contributions to the promotion of scientific and technological advancement and economic and social development .

Among the prohibitive clauses , the revised law has added the stipulations of prohibiting the married people from cohabiting with the persons other than their spouses and prohibiting domestic violence .  This has enhanced , in legislation , the dynamics of safeguarding monogamy and protecting the personal rights of family members .  This has also provided a basis in basic law for stemming unlawful behaviors of this kind through other legal means .  
With the exception of the regulations regarding change and revocation of applicable regulations in Articles 6 through 9 of these regulations , the principal responsible person and signatory of a local people 's government or its subsidiary department acting in violation of these regulations or formulating and implementing regulations that stipulate implementation of regional blockades or contain reference to regional blockades shall be given disciplinary sanctions of either demotion or dismissal in accordance with legal procedure and based on the severity of the offense .

Over the past few years , our country 's social order situation has witnessed some new situations and new problems owing to some complicated social factors , and also because the leaders in some regions have laid one-sided emphasis on economic growth but neglected the work of maintaining social order and a legal system , and this has become a major contributing factor .  
After several months of diligent work , the task force uncovered the truth about rampant fraudulent claims for export tax rebates by some of the localities , units , and enterprises in the Chaoshan region .  They investigated to check if some large , key cases , and political and legal agencies followed the law in arresting criminal elements engaged in fraud .  Corrupt elements in party and political agencies and law enforcement departments with ties to criminal elements on the outside were also uncovered .  
Party committees and political science and legal commissions at all levels must better guide and coordinate the struggle to strike hard and put things in order , work together to study and unify thinking on major cases and actions , and ensure the smooth and healthy progress of the strike-hard struggle .  
We must conduct a law-enforcement inspection drive while carrying out the struggle to strike hard and put things in order , make a special endeavor to resolve the pronounced problems facing the contingent of political and legal workers , resolutely purge the tiny number who have brought disgrace to the contingent , and vigorously commend and foster advanced models .  
Referring to the situation where cadres still lack a democratic and legal system , the 13th Party Congress consequently proposed to regard the establishment of a state public functionary system as the focus for reforming the personnel system of cadres to conduct scientific management of the contingent of cadres according to law ; thus transforming the previous outdated unitary management pattern and allowing the establishment of a new-type personnel system of cadres based on the principles of attaching importance to solid performance , encouraging competition , and exercising democratic and separated supervisions .

The factors that have enabled triad-related and evil forces to survive and expand over a long period of time in the past have also proved a key issue for the concentrated study and analysis of procuratorial organs at all levels in their current case-handling work of examining and rectifying arrests and instituting legal proceedings .  The Supreme People 's Court has stressed that cases involving the " protective umbrellas " of triad-related and evil forces which are reported to the authorities by the masses shall be resolutely investigated and dealt with as key cases .  
To put it another way , we believe that like the natural world , the world of mankind is rich and colorful in nature , and the layout of world political and economic systems and order [ based on ] legal principles of international relations must fit and promote the realization of this diversity .  
Conducting propaganda and education on the socialist legal system in a thoroughgoing way and enhancing the legal sense and quality of the all the citizens , leading cadres at all levels in the first place , is an important aspect of the implementation of the basic general plan for managing the country according to the law and building a socialist country ruled by law and also an important task set by the 10th Five-Year Plan and an important legal guarantee for the implementation of the 10th Five-Year Plan .  
With the improvement of the legal quality of the entire people and the strengthening of the effort to manage the whole society in an institutionalized way as the objective , they must persist in combining study with application , make concerted efforts to promote the management of administrative matters according to the law and impartial administration of justice , and unceasingly push ahead the propaganda and education on the legal system among all citizens and the work of managing government affairs according to the law of all localities , departments , and units .  
All comrades of the party , leading cadres at all levels in particular , must unceasingly enhance their legal sense and ability to act according to the law and strive to promote the improvement of the entire people 's legal sense and quality and lay a solid foundation for building a socialist country ruled by law .  
General knowledge of the law has been widespread , and education in the legal system has been combined closely with the practice of law .  As a result , citizens ' awareness of the law has noticeably increased , and various social undertakings are vigorously managed according to law .  All this has played an important role in implementing the basic plan for governing the country according to law and building a country under the rule of the socialist legal system and played a guaranteeing role in maintaining the overall situation in reform , development , and stability .  
We should further improve the quality of all people 's knowledge of law and the level of institutionalized management in society and create an ever more favorable legal environment for the building of the material and spiritual civilizations .  To do so , it is necessary for us to continue to give in-depth publicity to and conduct extensive education in the legal system among the citizens .  
By implementing the Fourth Five-Year Plan for Disseminating the General Knowledge of Law , we should strive to shift from enhancing all the people 's awareness of law to improving the quality of all the people 's knowledge of law and from management by relying on administrative means to management by using legal means ; we should promote the management of all undertaking according to law in an all-round way in order to lay a solid foundation for governing the country according to law and building a country under the rule of the socialist legal system .

Attention should be paid to raising the theoretical level of the socialist legal system among large numbers of cadres , especially among the leading cadres , and increasing their ability to make decisions , perform their official duties , and exercise management according to law .  
To continue to give in-depth publicity to and conduct extensive education in the legal system nationwide , it involves large areas and arduous tasks ; under the unified leadership of party committees and governments at corresponding levels and with the vigorous support and supervision of people 's congresses and local committees of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference , various regions should persist in integrating themselves with relevant departments , take coordinated action , and bring the enthusiasm of localities , industries , and departments into full play in order to form a joint force in work .  
There are 21 provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities that have formulated rules and regulations on the study and application of laws among the leading cadres , and have clearly defined that whether a cadre possesses necessary legal knowledge and whether he is capable of managing affairs strictly according to law should be taken as a major content for the assessment of his work performance .

It is necessary to increase the pertinence of legal system education for leading cadres .  The practice of replacing laws with their own words or trying to transcend laws with the powers in their hands among a small number of leading cadres should be overcome .  Leading cadres should use their own exemplary behavior of abiding by the laws to influence the broad masses and promote the forming of a benign social atmosphere of studying , applying , observing , and safeguarding laws .  
Profoundly conducting legal system propaganda and education and enhancing the law-abiding quality of the entire citizens and first of all , leading cadres at all levels , is an important requirement and prerequisite for the implementation of the basic principle of governing the country on the basis of laws and building a socialist rule-by-law country , and is also an important task in the Tenth Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development .

Over the past 20-odd years since reform and opening up , China 's economic legislation work has scored tremendous achievements , but it is still a considerable distance from the institution of a comparatively perfect socialist market economic and legal system .

A large number of facts can prove that this organization of " Falungong " is totally a cult organization opposing the government and the people .

While concentrating our energies on achieving agricultural and rural economic development , we must really have a good grasp of the building of rural grassroots organizations , democratic legal system , and socialist spiritual civilization , maintain social stability in the rural areas , and give impetus to the rural economic and social development in a comprehensive way .

This includes the establishment of a statutory framework for the rendition of fugitive offenders , the transfer of sentenced prisoners and mutual legal assistance in criminal matters .

On the contrary , developments in both areas can go hand-in-hand .  Both areas depend on our future lawyers being adequately educated and trained ; both areas depend upon our civil justice system being cost-effective and speedy ; and both areas depend upon our ability to identify and meet the needs of those with legal problems .

Without attempting to repeat all the legal arguments which Law Officer ( Civil Law ) has clearly set out in his article , suffice for me to say that we have thought long and hard on this matter and have come to the conclusion that legislation is the only viable means to implement with certainty a justified decision of a modest pay reduction made strictly in accordance with the established mechanism for civil service pay adjustment .

" The legal proceedings brought by a public housing tenant challenging the Authority 's decision to defer the rent review has raised important questions on an important premise upon which the deliberations of the Ad Hoc Committee have been based , i.e . , the HA is under no statutory obligation to review public rental housing rent every three years , nor is it required by law to maintain the median rent-to-income ratio ( MRIR ) below 10% at all times , " Mr Ng said . 
" The Government has expressed grave concern over this incident .  We consider that such an act has damaged our social and moral values .  This is not acceptable and should be condemned by the society and subject to legal sanction .

It was Mr Pannick 's opinion that none of the provisions set out in the Consultation Document are objectionable as a matter of legal principle . 
Human rights in Hong Kong are founded on the rule of law , an independent judiciary , the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance ( Cap . 383 ) which incorporated provisions of the ICCPR as applied to Hong Kong in our domestic law and empowered the court to grant remedies for contravention of the Ordinance and a sound and comprehensive legal aid system that assures the individuals of access to the courts to seek redress and reparation for alleged violations of human rights .

Some public housing tenants have recently expressed certain demands in connection with the judicial review .  Since their demands are closely linked to the Authority 's decision to appeal , the Authority therefore decided this morning that upon conclusion of the legal proceedings and clear judgment from the court on the proper interpretation and implementation of the relevant legal provisions , it would proceed to review its domestic rent policy and identify a satisfactory arrangement for rent adjustment immediately in accordance with the law .

" Hong Kong 's free economy , transparent legal system and skilled labour force are all key elements that make the city an ideal partner for Mainland companies to manage their international expansion .  Our multicultural make-up also provides an excellent testing ground for Mainland products " he added .  
Hong Kong has always been the world 's freest economy .  It has built up sound market mechanisms and its goodwill is recognised internationally .  We have robust legal institutions , legislation to protect intellectual property , an efficient and transparent government , and a business community with a well-earned reputation for fulfilling its contractual obligations .  
Unless otherwise specified in CEPA , a " natural person " means a Hong Kong permanent resident , whereas a " juridical person " means any legal entity duly constituted or otherwise organised under the applicable laws of Hong Kong and which has engaged in substantive business operations in Hong Kong for three to five years .  
Many different aspects of language and the law have been explored : the plain language movement has grown in strength and influence ; a formidable body of literature has been established in respect of forensic linguistics ; and multi-lingual legal issues are the subject of ongoing research .  
At a joint meeting of Legislative Council 's Panel on Planning , Lands and Works and Panel on Environmental Affairs this ( October 13 ) afternoon , some members expressed that the Government and its legal representatives had led the court to believe that reclamation was not irreversible and the Government would suffer huge financial losses if the court ordered the work be stopped pending the outcome of a judicial review .  
Under the risk-based supervisory approach mentioned earlier , the objective of a comprehensive on-site examination is to review whether the risk management systems in place are effective and adequate to identify , measure , monitor and control the various risks commonly associated with an authorized institution , namely , credit , interest rate , market , liquidity , operational , legal , reputation , and strategic .  
This includes a level playing field and unrestricted movement of capital , together with a transparent regulatory structure , an independent legal system and a simple , low tax regime . "  
He further remarked that the Chinese people place equal emphasis on human nature , reasonableness and law . The work of the mediation council is based on the first two considerations , and the agreements it makes possible must have legal standing . Mayor Lee said that the function of mediation councils is a unique feature in the nation 's political history . He is convinced that once the mediation council fully develops its role , people will no longer need to go to the courts to settle their disputes .  
If mental illness is involved , Lifeline can call on a panel of professional volunteers . Expert help is also available for people with social , psychological , educational , legal , nursing , medical , or religious problems .

Many importing countries , strapped by foreign debt , pay particularly close attention to the terms and amount proposed by bidders . In 1979 the ROC government established the Export-Import Bank to assist local makers , granting long-term repayment schedules at low interest rates . In addition , should a foreign customer fail to make good on his payments , the bank will reimburse the Chinese firm and take legal action overseas to recover the debt .  
Because the legal requirement for twelve years of compulsory education has been set , the extremely tough competition for vacancies in a restricted number of pre-college institutions will gradually relax its stranglehold . This will give students and educators more leeway to pursue a balanced development of aesthetic skills and the capacity for aesthetic appreciation , coupled with the social graces needed for community living . Within colleges and universities , a well-rounded education will make up the deficiencies of an unbalanced curriculum and give due attention to the humanities .  
Japan 's environmental movement has been joined by doctors , lawyers and experts in various fields who have helped to set up research and legal channels to follow and even to educate the local populace in environmental issues enabling disputes to be resolved within the system and at the same time raising environmental awareness . "  
Furthermore , based on the many years of experience we have accumulated in implementing our Constitution and on the needs arising from the current national environment , forward-looking and necessary revisions will be made to portions of the Constitution concerning such matters as the parliamentary organs of the central government , the system of local government , and government organization to provide the Chinese people with a legal code that is in accord with the trends of our times , and to establish a great model of political democracy for all times .  
Currently , the government has already ordered that the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion be terminated . In the foreseeable future , cases involving the two sides will develop in the direction of " private international law . " That is , Taiwan and the mainland will be treated as two separate " legal jurisdictions " and the concepts for dealing with " conflicts of law between two jurisdictions " will be employed .  
New Environment Foundation founder Prof . Ch'ai Sung-lin , who has written on Taiwan folk beliefs , maintains the popularity of divination reflects modern man 's inner uncertainty and helplessness in the face of rapid social changes and confused values . Apparent social injustices , such as businessmen profiting by exploiting legal loopholes , or lackluster politicians getting to the top , have led people to conclude that success depends more on good luck than personal effort . This explains why so many people resort to casting fortunes and interpreting horoscopes .  
At the time , Cantonese could be heard everywhere in Mexicali and checks written out in Chinese Characters were accepted as legal tender . Neat rows of social halls , temples and other Chinese organizations sprung up throughout the bustling city . Every evening in the tea houses and Chinese theaters you could hear the beating of Chinese drums and the rasping of Chinese fiddles .  
In the conservative period of martial law , not only was the showing of violent films illegal , it was also not legal to publicly show most classic films because their " excessive sexuality is not fit for the national situation " or because they were considered politically sensitive . This left most classic film lovers no place to turn .  
The government has set up a treatment plant for highly concentrated electroplating fluid in the Taichung area , and it is encouraging operators to use collective methods to turn their waste water over to specialists for disposal . Yet there are those who would rather sneak around and evade legal restraints .  
Regarding governmental affairs , Premier lien has actively promoted setting out a legal structure for local autonomy . For foreign relations , he has worked toward opening up bilateral and multilateral relations . Besides taking an active part in regional organizations ( such as APEC ) and seeking entry to organizations that are functional in nature ( such as GATT ) , he has also established a small policy group for working out a strategy for getting the R . O . C . admitted to the United Nations .  
They have been put off for more than 40 years . Though local self-government has been implemented on schedule , its only legal foundation has been the literally paperthin ( only one page long ) executive order " Main Points for Implementation of Local Self-Government by the Cities and Counties of Taiwan Province . " Even the most basic laws for provincial level government have been held up .  
In the absence of a legal foundation , inevitably the division of powers and responsibilities between various levels of government has been unclear , causing frequent disputes . During the state of emergency , these disputes were often resolved or regulated by resort to administrative decrees at the central level . The lower levels of government had no basis for making objections .  
Lu Kuang-yang says that although musk deer , certain tortoises and horned toads are protected animals , if there is clear documentation about the sources of domestically sold medicinal ingredients and a ban on the use of threatened species , then associations of doctors and pharmacists can control themselves . With the Board of Foreign Trade handling all imports , medicinal ingredients can be stamped to show that they are legal and thus prevent smuggling . With " complete rules of the game , " he would then not object to unthreatened animals being used in limited quantities .  
But with the present lack of an overall system of control , conservationists agree with the Department of Health 's extreme step of a temporary complete ban on medicinal ingredients taken from protected animals ; otherwise the situation will arise where legal behavior will obscure illegal behavior .  
The initiator of illegal radio programs - - " People 's Radio " - - received a legal frequency one and a half years after they transmitted their first program without permission . They have moved from the underground out into the open air . Admits Ho Ma-li , chief of the " People 's Radio " program office , " Underground radio station programs are easier . "  
Loopholes in the law " The Voice of Taiwan " violated criminal laws , was investigated by the prosecutor 's office which found sufficient evidence to act , and then was closed down for its unlawful behavior . Meanwhile , the " Green Peace Taiwan Cultural Broadcasting Station " and " Taiwan News Transfer " have not been set up in accord with legal procedures . They should have applied to set up , and by not doing so they have violated their responsibilities under the Broadcasting Law . These are two different situations .  
Yet when ordinary folks hear that the total budget for many of the things they care about most - - such as the judicial system , the legislative process , legal affairs , civil administration , foreign policy , or relations with mainland China - - adds up to less than 10% of total outlays ( the same level as interest payments ) , they are at a loss for words .  
But today , when there is a greater emphasis on morality and humane treatment of other living beings , many countries are hard at work creating animal protection laws in the hope that in addition to wild animals , the pets with whom people have ever closer relationships , livestock and other animals that serve economic functions can also have legal protection . Humans will never stop eating and using animals , but some of the pain and hardship can be eliminated from how they use them . Such laws could also prevent unnecessary abuse .  
Traditional Chinese placed great emphasis on proper rituals or patterns of behavior , and failure to observe these was deemed to be criminal . For example , these days a lack of filial piety is considered to be a personal moral problem , in which outsiders should not get too involved . But in the past it was a serious offense . Not only could the individual be punished through the state legal system , family law was even more rigorous and inescapable , and violators were expelled from the clan .  
According to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission , there are currently about 260,000 overseas Chinese eligible to register for the presidential election . This figure was arrived at by starting with the number of people who " formerly had legal residence in Taiwan but then moved abroad , " minus the number of minors ( people below 20 ) and deceased persons . ( The latter two figures were calculated on the basis of the percentage of non-adult persons and the death rate in Taiwan . )  
Benjamin Lu , Taiwan 's representative in the US , was even more optimistic in an estimate he made last December while on a trip back to Taiwan . He guessed that 300,000 people living in the US would vote in the presidential election . ( His guess exceeded the theoretical limit of 260,000 because he also considered the number of ROC citizens in the US who still have legal residence in Taiwan , and thus are not included in the estimate of 260,000 eligible " overseas Chinese . "  
As the harmful effects of drugs came to be understood , drug trafficking changed from being legal to being a criminal offense around the world . There has been a significant trend toward international cooperation in fighting the drug trade . Producer , transshipment , and consumer nations have joined hands to clamp down at every link in the chain . Only in this way can narcotics activities be completely rooted out .  
As in the cultural , agricultural , and economic fields , cross-strait narcotics exchanges and mutual reliance among dealers have also grown significantly these past several years . Cross-strait anti-drug cooperation should be implemented with urgency , but it is stagnating amidst disputes over sovereignty and legal jurisdiction , and it has proven difficult to make any breakthroughs .  
" Assuming that the initial French recording process was in violation of the law , then all future uses of this unauthorized material , including those by Enigma and the IOC , would all be unlawful as well , " explains Huang Hsiu-lan , Difag 's attorney , in a firm tone of voice . She has received approval from Difag to use " the most intensive legal methods " to handle the case .  
Of Mr . Shih 's six years of employment , he spent the first three doing clerical work in the inspection department of a pharmaceuticals manufacturer . After seeing an ad in the paper in which an advertising company was looking for a legal assistant , he rushed to apply . In the company , he wrote letters demanding loan repayment and drafted complaints to be used in lawsuits . The job was extremely interesting to him , but , unfortunately , " the boss was too demanding and the workload was too heavy . "  
In other words , even though the production base moves overseas , the " headquarters " and " logistical support center " remain in Taiwan . Operations items stay in Taiwan , along with capital sourcing , legal , tax , and financial planning , and training of internationalized personnel . All these could service the production bases located in surrounding countries .  
There are also detailed descriptions of the SEF 's legal , trade and cultural services . The Mainland Affairs section presents the current state of cross-strait exchanges , and regulations governing cross-strait news reporting , publishing and electronic media work . All this information should provide a valuable reference resource for Taiwanese firms investing in the mainland , and for people both inside and outside the ROC who are engaged in cross-strait business or other affairs .  
The judicial training center has lately increased the training it provides to prepare the judges in these areas , for example , taking the students abroad and having them tour legal gambling establishments ( all gambling is illegal in Taiwan ) and sex operations . In order to competently handle the traffic accidents which are more and more prevalent , the students must all learn to drive ; in order to combat the new styles of economic crimes , the aspiring judges must also make visits to securities exchanges .  
The female prosecutors tend to be a bit more cautious in these matters , paying careful attention to legal and procedural demands . Although this is only proper in respecting human rights , still the police often feel frustrated as a result .  
Kan adds an even more ridiculous case of how hard it has been to change men 's attitudes . In ROC criminal law , rape is defined as a " crime damaging to social morality . " In other words , according to the legal interpretation , the real evil in rape is that it offends the requirement for women to remain chaste and virtuous . As for the woman , it seems that the violation of her person is secondary !  
Moreover , " acquaintance rape " is generally less violent than rape by a stranger . Therefore , under a maledominated legal system , and given the cultural script which calls for men to take the sexual initiative , the rate of conviction is very low . Indeed , victims often have no recourse at all . Worst of all , violation by a known person often leaves much deeper psychological and emotional scars on the victim than violence by a stranger .  
The civil code guarantees that the husband will manage , use , and receive the earnings from property . A divorced woman may win custody of her children , but with laws on the division of property incomplete , if her husband is something less than generous and tries to make things difficult for her , she may be left caring for her children without a penny to her name . In principle , the legal code is for " people " ; there should not be any distinctions made on the basis of sex .  
The company was to be headed by Rojas , the stock to be floated on the Mexican market . The Mexican City market was to be its base , chiefly responsible for financial and legal services . Miami was to be the operational and transport hub , responsible for sales , technical assistance , product planning , dispersal , warehousing , and so on .  
It 's just that state firms often are less efficient than private ones because they have three burdens to bear : implementing state policies based on non-economic concerns , accepting legal restraints and interference from government agencies , and the human failing of usually performing public tasks more poorly than those involving private profit . Thus people often are dismayed with state firms .  
At the National Development Conference , Huang was a major proponent of freezing provincial elections . Since becoming minister of the interior he has worried the provincial government by stating , " The provincial government was established by the central government , and has no status as an independent legal entity . "  
After consulting legal community opinion , Kao proposed revisions that included adopting the principle of " malicious intent " as determined by the US Supreme Court in its landmark 1964 decision " New York Times v . Sullivan . " In that case the court ruled that to be found not guilty journalists need only to do a reasonable job of gathering evidence and obtaining assurances of truth and show no malicious intent to destroy someone 's character .  
On the heels of legal rulings that granted mothers greater rights to the custody of children and wives equal rights to a couple 's shared assets , Taiwan 's women 's groups in April of this year celebrated another victory when a decision by the Grand Council of Justices granted wives " the freedom to choose their place of residence . " The ruling represented another major step on the road toward equal rights in the ROC .  
Chung Shi-kai , a professor in the psychology department at National Chengchi University , says that under the current medical system , professionals of every stripe , including doctors of every specialty and nurses , all have legal requirements to meet and tests to pass . All have a certification system . What is infuriating to him is that there is no such certification system for psychological counselors , psychological testers or clinical psychologists . Because no legal standards or sanctions are stipulated , you ca n't go after Yu for practicing without a license .  
She adds , with particular reference to the problem of overtime pay , " It is especially unfair given that employer and employee interact as economic entities , a status in which every individual should be equal . " The final irony of all is that the overtime regulations are frequently not observed by employers , so the people who are punished most are those single women who obediently agree to work past the legal limits on their overtime hours .  
" In traditional Chinese thinking there were human rights , there just was n't the term for them , " says Chai Sung-lin , chairman of the Chinese Human Rights Association . Apart from the support for human rights expressed in pre-Qin thought , when Liu Bang ruled at the end of the Qin , he and the elders mandated in law that those who killed would die themselves , and those who injured and robbed would be punished . " This provided a legal basis for protecting people 's rights to life and property . "

When animal protection has to be implemented in specific legal regulations the assistance of scientific research is usually required , so that concepts such as cruelty and pain are no longer vague or left to the kind of subjective judgements to which Zhuangzi retorted " I am not a fish-how can I know a fish 's suffering ? " Science also allows appropriate protective rules to be drafted according to the specific needs of different animals .

Yu Shyi-kun , Secretary-General of the Presidential Office , stated that the president would respect the ruling of the Grand Justices , but said the language of the ruling does not appear to require a Cabinet reshuffle .

When patients are dissatisfied with or doubtful about the treatment they receive at hospitals and clinics , the majority choose to remain silent and put their experience down to bad luck , while some voice their concerns directly to the doctor , hospital or local health bureau . But others seek out their elected representatives , complain to the media , throw eggs , carry coffins through the streets in protest , or institute legal proceedings .

One representative drew attention to the fact that , increasingly , national courts were enforcing international legal instruments for punishing perpetrators of international crimes and that it should , therefore , not be felt that the granting of universal jurisdiction to national courts and judicial cooperation among States for the purpose of the administration of justice would no longer be valid after the establishment of the Court .  
It was stated that , if established under the Charter , the Court would be supported by the Organization 's moral authority and its universality , and furthermore the unity of the international legal order in respect of criminal matters would be assured .  
In this context it was noted that , since international criminal law was not a fully developed area and since the statute of the Court was certain to have an impact upon national legal systems , the jurisdiction should be established on a consensual basis in full regard to the fundamental principle of sovereignty , which should be reflected in all its provisions .  
It was further stated that the political question of whether a country had perpetrated an act of aggression was in principle separate from the legal question of whether an individual from a particular country could be held responsible for the act and that the Court would be perfectly capable of taking note of an act of aggression without the Security Council having first determined it .

These unconstitutional and illegal acts , which in essence , constituted political and legal aggression against a sovereign State , namely the Azerbaijani Republic , have never been repudiated by the Republic of Armenia , thus proving that Armenia should bear sole responsibility as the organizer and principal agent of the aggression against Azerbaijan .

Our efforts have helped develop a text that , in its final version , makes no mention of Chapter VII of the Charter , addresses requests to States that are not binding in nature and specifies that any detentions will be effected in accordance with their national law which , in our view , means that only those States that have domestic legislation enabling them to act along the requested lines will be able to do so , as the resolution can not serve by itself alone as a legal basis for arresting anyone . 
All these complaints , which account for 16 per cent of the overall total , refer to violations of procedural guarantees ( presumption of innocence ( 4 ) , the right to a hearing by a competent , independent and impartial tribunal within a reasonable period of time ( 3 ) , the right of habeas corpus ( 8 ) and the legal duty of the State to investigate and administer punishment ( 31 ) ) .

With regard to governance issues , national institutions and professionals from the public and private sectors , grass-roots organizations and political parties have been actively involved in discussions , round-table meetings and national conferences on governance issues , constitutional and legal reforms , etc . alongside high calibre international experts and consultants .  
Improved and innovative institutional , legal and financial arrangements relating to private sector collaboration , university-industry linkage , strategic business alliances and venture capital have been extensively developed to address the emerging issues relating to new biotechnology .  
Biotechnology applications have the potential for making major contributions to the health and welfare of humanity , although biotechnology is still perceived by many to have undesirable and partly unforeseeable ecological , socio-economic , legal and ethical implications .  
Noting that , following the cease-fire of 18 July 1994 , a new Government of Rwanda has been established and has made efforts to restore the rule of law and reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , physical , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda after the extensive damage inflicted by the civil conflict ,  
Invites Member States , the organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to intensify their efforts to contribute financial and technical support to the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , physical , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda ;  
Also convinced that through their own national legal and judicial systems States must provide appropriate civil , criminal and administrative remedies for violations of human rights ,  
This allegation is in radical conflict with the texts of the reports of the tripartite committee and its technical subcommittee , which make it absolutely clear that Iraq is completely serious about observing its legal , humanitarian and moral responsibilities in this field , and that the competent Iraqi authorities have dealt with many of the missing persons ' dossiers within the context of the circumstances and data relating to the matter .  
In response , in a letter of 24 July 1991 , 9 / my predecessor shared the Committee 's understanding of the problem and also expressed the view that , in order to find workable solutions to those problems , certain legal and practical difficulties must be overcome with the active assistance of all concerned , including the competent authorities of the host country .  
Much of its work has focused on establishing the necessary international legal and policy framework for ensuring women 's full and equal enjoyment of their rights in the political , economic , civil , social and educational fields .  
The reasons for this vary and include a lack of political commitment ; an unresponsive legal system ; attitudinal obstacles to the incorporation of international standards when these are believed to be in conflict with religious , cultural or customary practices ; the absence of effective domestic groups that can lobby for change effectively and without fear of intimidation ; and an absence of effective enforcement mechanisms even where legislation exists .  
Nevertheless , several countries state that in order to have a more sustainable impact , legal literacy should include developing an awareness of rights in general and of existing national statutory rights in particular , since penal and civil codes protect everyone .  
The notion of " economic integration " in fact implies specific and obvious political and legal consequences , particularly when it is linked to the continuation of the military occupation and the total political dependence of the Cypriot territories in question on Ankara .  
It was stated that existing legislation governing communication and storage of information was inadequate or outdated precisely because it did not contemplate the use of EDI and related means of communication , thus creating uncertainty with respect to the legal regime of transactions operated by electronic means and restricting the use of such means .  
This continuing practice by the United States of America , which is unwarranted and contrary to its legal and moral obligations under the Headquarters Agreement , the Charter of the United Nations and international custom , points to a serious shortcoming that must be eliminated and corrected by all possible means . 
National legal systems allowing for punitive or exemplary damages usually do so only where there has been a deliberate misdeed or gross negligence ; in such cases , the proper course of action for the Organization would be to bring disciplinary charges against the offending staff member or recovery action from him or her of the damages paid by the Organization for the actual loss suffered by the victim . 
It is also no longer acceptable from a legal , political or humanitarian point of view for an entire people to continue to suffer because of a mere suspicion that two persons may be connected with the bombing of an aircraft based on investigations that are not yet complete .  
[ Sustained economic growth and sustainable development can only be attained through improving the economic , social , political , legal and cultural status of women . ]  
The so-called Vance plan , an interim solution adopted prior to the international recognition of the Republic of Croatia and its admission to United Nations membership , is considered by the Croatian Parliament as an unacceptable legal and political basis for the continued presence and operation of international forces in the territory of the Republic of Croatia .  
In connection with article 6 , paragraph 5 , we are of the view that , in assuring the representation of the principal legal systems of the world , the representation of Islamic penal legislation as a comprehensive and independent system that is rich in human experience and is authoritative for a large number of countries should not be overlooked .  
Indeed , in such cases the legal rules governing jurisdiction would not be applicable , the criminal laws of the State that would normally have jurisdiction might be inadequate or there might be particular circumstances on the ground ( disorganization of the judicial apparatus , partiality of the courts because of internal or external conflict , a deliberate refusal to prosecute or extradite ) impeding the administration of justice .  
Rules that affect the operation of the court to this degree will require careful effort to draft , for they must be acceptable and workable in the light of the widely varying national legal systems involved .  
Work focuses on the practical problems that need to be resolved so that policies undertaken in respect of internalization do not impair the development efforts of developing countries and that they are consistent with the economic , financial , institutional , legal and social conditions of those countries .  
Work focuses on the practical problems that need to be resolved so that policies undertaken in respect of internalization do not impair the development efforts of developing countries and are consistent with the economic , financial , institutional , legal and social conditions of those countries .  See E / CN . 17 / 1994 / CRP . 2 .  
By its presence in Croatia over the past three years , UNPROFOR has contributed positively by keeping relative peace in Croatia and has given the international community time to establish a political framework and binding legal decisions that will assist in reintegrating the occupied territories and their residents into Croatia peacefully and in a manner consistent with Croatia \ x { e5b8 } sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
During the work on the new arrangement and the present draft resolution , which will be adopted today , one Member State , regrettably , expressed low tolerance for the legitimate interests of Croatia , a Member State , and instead directed efforts into forms of short-term political pragmatism , at the expense of legal and operative logic of the relevant United Nations documents .  
It believes that establishing a linkage between the Security Council , which is a political organ by nature and by virtue of its mandate and structure , and the international criminal court , whose establishment is intended to provide a neutral and impartial legal forum , will create enormous problems that will undermine confidence in the court 's neutrality and impartiality .  
[ Create , fund , and improve ] or develop the training of judicial , legal , medical , social , educational and police and immigration personnel , as appropriate , in order to avoid the abuse of power leading to violence against women and sensitize such personnel to the nature of gender-based acts and threats of violence so that fair treatment of female victims can be assured ;  
Sustainable development and economic growth that is both sustained and sustainable is only possible through improving the economic , social , political , legal and cultural status of women .

I have the honour , concerning the letter dated 3 April 1995 from Mr . H.E . Christos Zacharakis , Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations addressed to you ( S / 1995 / 257 ) , and in reference to Security Council resolution 817 ( 1993 ) , to remind you that the name of any Member State is an exclusive right and an internal affair of the State , which right has been respected and established in international legal norms and in the basic principles of the United Nations .  
At the same time , since ONUSAL will be withdrawing on 30 April 1995 , the Human Rights Division has been emphasizing the urgent need to implement those parts of the peace agreements concerning human rights which are still pending , a matter which is of the utmost importance if El Salvador is to complete the framework of legal and institutional safeguards required in order to achieve democracy and lasting peace .  
It should be noted that although this measure is , in theory , based on the Constitution , the spirit of the peace agreements requires that it be subject to legal rules which establish expressly and restrictively the requirements and conditions which must be met before domestic peace , tranquillity , order or public safety can be considered to be endangered , in exceptional cases , and before the normal means for their preservation can be considered to have been exhausted .  
This ignorance of norms is compounded by deficiencies of legal interpretation and reasoning , as evidenced in the literal and disjointed application of ordinary law and a marked emphasis on procedural - as opposed to substantive - issues .  
The Committee will also consider relevant organizational and supportive arrangements for technical cooperation among developing countries , such as administrative , legal , information and financial matters .  
Subparagraph ( c ) , it was stated , should be amended to make it clear that national law was a subsidiary means for determining general principles of law common to the major legal systems or , alternatively , should clearly indicate the relevant national law , the State whose law would apply and the circumstances in which such law would apply , particularly as national law was far from uniform .  
Some delegations felt that the question of the statute of limitations for the crimes within the jurisdiction of the court should be addressed in the statute in the light of divergencies between national laws and bearing in mind the importance of the legal principle involved , which reflected the decreasing social importance of bringing criminals to justice and the increasing difficulties in ensuring a fair trial as time elapsed .  
It is the Russian Federation 's firm position that the Treaty , as a major international legal document of the nuclear age ensuring an optimum balance in terms of halting the spread of nuclear weapons , nuclear disarmament and cooperation in the peaceful uses of the atom , must be extended indefinitely and unconditionally .  Such a decision by the Conference will lay the foundation for further progress in the twenty-first century towards a non-nuclear world in the future .  
This latter definition is the real meaning of " intrinsic " as used in these legal instruments , and in any case the words " essential " and " inherent " do not mean that the adverse effects on the environment per se constitute a form of harm which is independent of human beings .  
The Office provides legal advice and services in operational matters to United Nations organs , bodies and Secretariat units and is responsible for meeting the needs of Member States in dealing with legal , political , economic , scientific , technical and environmental aspects of the law of the sea and marine affairs .  
Their needs for coordinated information and advice will be addressed through the development and operation of a centralized system of integrated databases , inter alia , on marine legislation and marine policy , as well as by intensifying general legal advice and other advisory services and by focusing dissemination of information on national , regional and international developments in the law of the sea and ocean affairs .  
States Parties thus agree to initiate constitutional , legislative , administrative and other measures to ensure equality both generally and within specific contexts , including political and public life , nationality , education , work , health , legal and civil matters and the family .  
This means that the various cooperation agreements to be signed with the State institutions concerned must specify the commitments which these institutions are taking on ( political , institutional , administrative , technical , financial and legal , as the case may be ) and the specific contributions that will have to be made .  
During the discussion the Administrator also clarified that the programming emphasis on the enabling environment required for poverty elimination supported the first commitment of the World Summit for Social Development ( WSSD ) , which focused on creating an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment that will enable people to achieve social development .  
Measures to foster effective provision of infrastructure services by local government included ( a ) establishing a rational , transparent , legal foundation for local government with an appropriate degree of local discretion over issues of local interest ; ( b ) implementing a more appropriate assignment of revenues providing greater local autonomy over user charges and local taxes ; and ( c ) introducing more systematic and transparent criteria for allocating capital investment funding .  
It is India 's considered view that before the Security Council embarks on any action to formally give itself a " role in the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction " , all substantive , legal and institutional issues , including the role of specific treaty bodies , must be addressed and resolved through an open and transparent debate among the full membership of the United Nations .  
In governmental systems , this is the basic infrastructure for the exercise of legitimate authority : a legal system , a judicial system , a police system , a prison system for those who act outside the law , and the design of governmental institutions that ensure informed , voluntary choice by the citizens .  
Economic and social development , democratic consolidation and the promotion and protection of human rights all require a strong , rational and predictable legal system for their effective implementation .  
The question , which was considered against the background of political and ideological confrontation created by the cold war and its bipolar divisions , generated a certain amount of difficulty because it also involved legal , political and procedural elements which complicated the issue .  
Calls on all parties concerned to positively respond to the initiatives for dialogue and negotiations to secure a peaceful settlement to the crisis in conformity with Article 33 of Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter which calls for the settlement of disputes through negotiations , mediation and legal procedures in conformity with international law and calls for a fair trial of the two suspects in a neutral country to be agreed upon by all the parties concerned ;  
In many Latin American countries , the paradox of overabundant legislation and overemphasized democracy contrasting with the fragmentation of society , deep economic inequalities and the low level of political participation suggests that the ruling \ x { 5e68 } ite is attempting to overcome the weak integration of society by developing the legal framework of a democratic state of law addressing the whole people .  
This principle , first expressed in German law and in international law , is accepted as a general principle in all legal systems regarding public administration , but it is usually reflected in specific principles of more or less limited scope ;  
Where politics or interests oppose the development of the legal framework of public administration , regional integration processes , underpinned by economic globalization , may facilitate acceptance of a higher level of legality through the principles involved in the settlement by an international court of matters coming under the treaty .  
If the development of the legal framework of public administration is considered as progress for developing countries , just as for other countries , for the reasons stated above , three different resources can be mobilized : the legacy of foreign models subject to an appraisal with regard to present conditions and policy goals ; the national culture and legal tradition ( also subject to appraisal ) ; and universal values expressed in documents issued by the United Nations .  
At least two aspects of traditional culture are very widespread in developing countries and should be taken into consideration in legal reforms regarding public administration : in an oral society , the importance of personal relations and the importance of the group ( the community ) for the individual .  
Nevertheless the path explored by the reformist Arab writers of the nineteenth century should be pursued and legal principles elaborated capable of bridging the gap between various communities and modern public administration , a step which is needed for participation in the world economy .  
Since such claims result in additional and unintended financial obligations and often indeterminate liabilities , the Board recommends that precise legal agreements to establish mutual rights and obligations should be signed with all implementing agencies .  
The guidelines suggest numerous preventive measures that may be taken such as practical improvements in camp organization , location and design ; human resources management measures including the hiring of more female staff ; measures aimed at encouraging the host Government to take effective legal and other action ; and preventive measures involving education and training .  
This step taken by the international community following the signing by the Government and UNITA of the Lusaka Protocol , the new instrument setting forth the legal framework for the country 's transition from war to peace , gave a major boost to the peace process and helped curtail initial pessimism as did the positive unfolding of such a difficult and complex process , shrouded at first in a climate of deeply held mutual mistrust and hostility rooted in a long , destructive war .  
In the Agreement , the Government has committed itself to the effective protection of indigenous rights by promoting the creation of legal offices for the defence of those rights and the establishment of " popular law offices " to provide free legal assistance to persons of limited economic means in municipalities in which indigenous communities are prevalent .  
In the case of Belarus the problem of outstanding contributions for peace-keeping operations has taken on a particularly acute , and it would not be exaggerated to say , offensive character , primarily owing to the fact that the original motives for assigning Belarus to group ( b ) have become historically obsolete , its legal status under international law has changed and its economic situation has greatly deteriorated . 
" Create , improve or develop , as appropriate , and fund training programmes for judicial , legal , medical , social , educational , police and immigration personnel , in order to avoid the abuse of power leading to violence against women and sensitize such personnel to the nature of gender-based acts and threats of violence so that fair treatment of female victims can be assured " .  
" The ability of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to monitor implementation of the Convention should be strengthened through the provision of human and financial resources within the regular budget of the United Nations , including expert legal assistance and , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 49 / 164 and the decision made at the meeting of the States parties to the Convention held in May 1995 , sufficient meeting time for the Committee .  
In the first year of the Tribunal 's existence , the President of the Tribunal drew the attention of the Secretary-General to the necessity for Member States not only to designate , in their domestic legal systems , a body responsible for dealing with any request from the Tribunal , but also to adopt the legislative or regulatory provisions required to give effect to the Tribunal 's statute .  
The commission of inquiry might be of assistance here as well inasmuch as it might make recommendations concerning appropriate legal , political or administrative measures , for such measures are probably necessary if Burundi is in the future to avoid not only the vortex of Rwanda , but also the twin dangers of a dictatorship based on the predominant majority of one ethnic group as well as a dictatorship based on a firepower monopoly of the other ethnic group . 
Specific measures include the regulation of recruitment agencies ; legal , social and educational outreach to migrant women ; trained female police officers and protection from male officers ; training for embassy personnel ; enforcement of national labour standards for all workers that conform to international guidelines ; better enforcement of existing laws ; involvement of trade unions ; and implementation of relevant United Nations resolutions and reporting mandates .  
Today , it is impossible to deny the existence of private entities and public bodies which , under a legal cover , conduct clandestine criminal operations as a parallel activity by hiring people who , in exchange for payment , agree to participate in the commission of unconscionable and illegal acts .  
Tools prepared by UNDCP for the implementation of the conventions also included an annual directory listing national authorities competent to take action under specific articles of the conventions , such as article 7 ( on mutual legal assistance ) or article 17 ( on illicit traffic by sea ) of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 .  
The project aimed at consolidating major existing and emerging legal principles relating to environmental conservation and sustainable development into an internationally binding legal instrument , thus contributing to the progressive development of international environmental law .  
The Cook Islands suggested that the United Nations convene a meeting of the legal advisers of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of small States to discuss their role , the special operational and logistical problems they faced , inter alia , regarding participation in the multilateral treaty-making process and the fulfilment of reporting obligations , and possible means to resolve such problems through cooperation at the regional and global levels .  
The Consultative Committee also published the outcome and proceedings of the special meeting on developing legal and institutional guidelines for privatization and post-privatization regulatory framework , held at Tokyo in January 1994 , which included the draft text of such guidelines .  
These settlors need not only represent recognized legal experts in international military / peace / security issues , but also those having expertise in economic , social and cultural relations where disputes are most often the root cause of all disastrous conflicts .  
Recommends that the Commission to be appointed by the Secretary-General be composed of five to ten impartial and internationally respected persons , including legal , military and police experts , under the Chairmanship of an eminent person , and assisted by the appropriate support staff ;  
Recommends that the Commission to be appointed by the Secretary-General be composed of five to ten impartial and internationally respected persons , including legal , military and police experts , under the Chairmanship of an eminent person , and assisted by the appropriate support staff ;  
While approaches to reform vary widely across countries at different stages of development , the group 's work in the area of improving the business environment covers four areas : reducing barriers to competition and streamlining regulation , strengthening legal and judicial systems , supporting entrepreneurial development and promoting global integration through foreign direct investment and expansion of trade .  
Review national laws , including customary laws and legal practices in the areas of family , civil , penal , labour and commercial law in order to ensure the implementation of the principles and procedures of all relevant international human rights instruments by means of national legislation , and revoke any remaining laws that discriminate on the basis of sex and remove gender bias in the administration of justice ;  
Include information about international and regional instruments and standards in their public information and human rights education activities and in adult education and training programmes , particularly for groups such as the military , the police and other law enforcement personnel , the judiciary , and legal and health professionals to ensure that human rights are effectively protected ;  
The ability of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to monitor implementation of the Convention should be strengthened through the provision of human and financial resources within the regular budget of the United Nations , including expert legal assistance and , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 49 / 164 and the decision made by the meeting of States parties to the Convention held in May 1995 , sufficient meeting time for the Committee .  
Sustainable development and economic growth that is both sustained and sustainable are possible only through improving the economic , social , political , legal and cultural status of women .  
This research needs to be guided at all stages by users and from the perspective of gender , particularly the perspective of women , and should be carried out in strict conformity with internationally accepted legal , ethical , medical and scientific standards for biomedical research ;  
For example , the Vienna Convention has given rise to a wave of legislative activity at the national level , supported by the legal assistance programme of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , as well as to the adoption of numerous bilateral and regional agreements that implement and further the Convention 's provisions .  
The imposition of coercive economic measures ignores such principles as the sovereign equality of States , non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States , and violates international legal instruments with the intent of forcibly imposing the political will of the sending State and subverting the political , economic and social regime of the target State .  
In view of the replies sent to him by Governments , the Special Rapporteur felt that decisive steps should be taken at the international level to establish effective administrative and legal remedies which victims of intolerance or discrimination based on religion could avail themselves of in cases of violations of the rights set forth in the Declaration .  
Moreover , whether they were consultative or jurisdictional , national institutions must be based on the highest possible legal standard , which assured their legitimacy , so that they would be able to ensure the synergy between the State and civil society .  
The Government of Iraq , guided by paragraph 31 of the Vienna Declaration on Human Rights , which states that food and medicine should not be used as a tool for political pressure , looks to the United Nations and its humanitarian organizations to study the grave political , legal and humanitarian consequences of the imposition of the economic embargo , requesting that a mechanism should be sought to minimize those consequences and their dangerous repercussions on all human rights . 
National legal systems allowing for punitive or exemplary damages usually do so only where there has been a deliberate misdeed or gross negligence ; in such cases , the proper course of action for the Organization would be to bring disciplinary charges against the offending staff member or recovery action from him or her of the damages paid by the Organization for the actual loss suffered by the victim . 
NULLWith regard to the underlying assumptions under which the revised proposal was prepared , the Committee was informed that , taking into consideration legal requirements and the need to prepare presidential elections , it was assumed that the earliest possible date for holding presidential elections would be early December 1995 .  
In addition to the major summit meetings mentioned above , which have proved themselves a flexible and effective format for high-level decision-making , the enhanced activities of the Central American Integration System ( SICA ) have ensured that regional meetings within the institutional and legal framework it establishes are a constant of Central American political life .  
Finally , how to intervene most effectively has to be judged - through economic policy instruments , legal reform , law enforcement , intergovernmental cooperation , political , administrative or judicial discretion , education policies , research and development policies , technology development and dissemination , or empowerment of particular geographical or disadvantaged social groups , such as indigenous people , minorities and women .  
Such emphasis on women is warranted since women , who compose more than half of the world 's poor , often face special legal and social obstructions in carrying out business and economic activities , despite their record of being responsible entrepreneurs and the principal contributors to the welfare of the family .  
NULLLegally recognize the existence , identity and rights of indigenous people through constitutional reforms and the adoption of new laws to improve their legal status and guarantee their territorial , economic , social , cultural , political and civil rights .  
The formal financial system in Africa has faced a number of internal and external constraints , including inadequate technical and managerial capacity , antiquated legal and regulatory frameworks , inappropriate macroeconomic policies and pronounced government intervention , that not only hampered its growth but actually caused significant disintermediation in a number of countries .  
In the process , the intermediation mechanism grows more varied and complex , ranging from the informal financial system comprising all legal financial activities outside the orbit of institutional and officially regulated finance , to a more complex modern system , supervised by a central monetary authority , that facilitates the transfer of large quantities of money within and between countries .  
While historic factors such as the low level of African incomes and inadequate domestic technical expertise and capacity explain a part of this situation , it is also the general perception that inappropriate macroeconomic policies , combined with an antiquated and ineffective legal , regulatory and prudential framework , have been the main impediments .  
NULLPursuant to General Assembly resolution 36 / 151 , voluntary contributions to the Fund from Governments , non-governmental organizations and private individuals are to be distributed through established channels of assistance , as humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals whose human rights have been severely violated as a result of torture and to relatives of such victims .  
It was also agreed that funds reserved for the civilian component of the Mission should be increased to enable it to deploy constitutional legal experts , human rights monitors and mediators , and to facilitate the process of dialogue and national reconciliation in Burundi .  
This handbook reflects the unique nature of the commitments made in the Agreement , which focus on the constitutional , legal and administrative reforms considered necessary for the elimination of discrimination , both de facto and de jure , and for the effective exercise of the specific rights of indigenous peoples .  
NULLThe budget of UNDCP has two separate and complementary parts : the regular budget concerned with treaty implementation and legal affairs ; and the Fund budget supported by voluntary contributions and geared to assist developing countries in drug control .  
NULLDetermines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
The traditional mechanisms of the international codification process had also changed and new challenges had emerged which necessitated a quick and effective response to legal emergencies ; thus , under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency , two multilateral conventions had been adopted in 1986 relating to early warning and assistance in the case of nuclear accidents .  
In order to be included in the list of crimes in the draft Code , such infractions must correspond to the legal rules accepted by States , must be considered serious enough to be defined as crimes against the peace and security of mankind , and must refer to acts sufficiently identifiable to appear in a criminal text .  The matter should be dealt with only from a legal , not a political , perspective .  
If the level of women 's representation of between 30 and 35 per cent and above is considered to form a critical mass , the Secretariat can be considered to have achieved that status in such occupational groups as political affairs , legal affairs , public information , administration , social affairs , economic affairs , human resources and human rights .  
The United States legal system was an excellent example of a system based on laws that respected the basic civil and political rights of all individuals as a precondition for any society hoping to eliminate racial discrimination .  
If an international crime was to be designated as a qualified case of an international breach of law , there was a need for a special regime governing State responsibility , which must include a set of legal consequences going beyond the consequences of ordinary wrongful acts and which must put the instrumental consequences of the crime under the supervision of a judicial authority .  
International legal and related efforts in the field of environment continue to see rapid development , constituting a substantial framework of legal , administrative , economic , financial and technical measures to prevent , control and reduce the adverse impact of human activities on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems .  
With respect to persistent organic pollutants , proposals were advanced for the global programme to initiate , directly , an intergovernmental process to consider and negotiate a global , legally binding instrument .  However , much of this legal development may focus more within the broad field of chemical safety .  
From the point of view of international law , the State was an abstract legal entity consisting of a territory , a population and a set of institutions and , although it existed in the legal and political sense at the international level , in essence it was legally neither good nor bad , neither innocent nor guilty .  
The High Commissioner has raised issues relating to economic , social and cultural rights , as well as the right to development , promotion of the rights of women , the status of minorities , indigenous people , the status of non-citizens , the legal status of refugees and asylum-seekers , protection of the rights of children and conformity of national legislation with international standards .  
To the contrary , in the prevailing legal and political order in Iraq with life-threatening laws applicable to persons expressing any opposition to the Government , the conduct of the referendum made a mockery of relevant international human rights standards .  
Therefore , there must be a workable legal framework consistent with modern labour management practices that guarantees to all civil servants due process and equal protection equivalent to the rights and principles they would enjoy under relevant national laws . 
Bearing in mind that many national legal systems recognized the concept of environmental damage and that various international conventions protected the environment , his delegation considered it sensible to have included in the draft articles a clear and comprehensive definition of " harm " .  
An international and independent court that was free from political pressures , established on a solid legal basis , accepted by all States to deal with well-defined crimes and capable of offering maximum guarantees to the defendants would provide , particularly where prevention was concerned , an appropriate instrument for dealing with crises which had adverse effects on entire peoples .  
The Commission noted that growing awareness of the UNCITRAL legal texts in many countries , in particular developing countries and newly independent States , had resulted in increased requests for training and technical assistance from individual Governments or regional organizations .  
The growth of a dynamic private enterprise sector should be underpinned by an appropriate economic , fiscal and legal framework with the following essential features : stable and predictable policies ; tax , monetary and trade policies that ensure adequate incentives for investment ; and a legal system which protects property rights and commercial contracts .  
Three legal experts have worked with the Ministry of Justice and , in cooperation with the Ministry and UNDP , the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda developed a plan to deploy 50 foreign legal experts to assist the Government in restarting all the essential functions of the judicial system , which presently suffers from an acute shortage of qualified local personnel .  
Further , over 40 Member States already have agreed to issue legal tender coins honouring the anniversary , pursuant to the provisions of General Assembly resolution 49 / 11 .  In addition to gold and silver coins for collectors , a number of base metal coins will be issued at face value for general circulation .  
The Security Council further recommended that the Commission be appointed by the Secretary-General and be composed of 5 to 10 impartial and internationally respected persons , including legal , military and police experts , under the chairmanship of an eminent person , and assisted by the appropriate support staff .  
Such a body , linked to the United Nations system and established on a solid legal basis accepted by all States , would be a useful tool which would allow the international community to prosecute and punish those guilty of particularly serious crimes whose hateful nature constituted an insult to the human conscience .  
Account also has to be taken of the consequential demands on the Registry of the Court for research and legal , library and documentary services and , particularly , translation and secretarial services owing to the expanded case-load of the Court and hence office space requirements for additional regular staff and those hired under temporary assistance for meetings and general temporary assistance .  
experience over the past four years , he has received from the JAB advice of uneven quality , which was not readily acceptable and required in each case an in-depth review to determine whether each recommendation was supported by the evidence and conformed to the relevant legal principles , rules and policies . 
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially in the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements , and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory ,  
With the prospect of peace in sight , there was hope that the process of healing the wounds left by acts of unspeakable brutality could be successful if underpinned by firm institutional and legal guarantees and adequate rehabilitation efforts .  
Further , over 40 Member States already have agreed to issue legal tender coins honouring the anniversary , pursuant to the provisions of General Assembly resolution 49 / 11 .  In addition to gold and silver coins for collectors , a number of base metal coins will be issued at face value for general circulation .  
Recognize the existence , identity and rights of indigenous people through constitutional reforms or the adoption of new laws to improve their legal status and guarantee their territorial , economic , social , cultural , political and civil rights .  
The Council recommended that the Commission be appointed by the Secretary-General and be composed of 5 to 10 impartial and internationally respected persons , including legal , military and police experts , under the chairmanship of an eminent person , and assisted by the appropriate support staff .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially in the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements , and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory ,  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
The Charter of the United Nations devoted an entire chapter ( Chapter VIII ) to regional arrangements or agencies in which it set forth the basic principles governing their activities and established the legal framework for cooperation between regional agencies or arrangements and the United Nations in the area of the maintenance of international peace and security .  
over 40 Member States already have agreed to issue legal tender coins honouring the anniversary , pursuant to the provisions of General Assembly resolution 49 / 11 .

Recognize the existence , identity and rights of indigenous people through constitutional reforms or the adoption of new laws , when appropriate , to improve their legal status and guarantee their economic , social , cultural , political and civil rights .  
stark contrast between the forceful abduction and subsequent torture of a Turkish Cypriot by the Greek Cypriot police and the humane manner in which the above-mentioned Greek Cypriot offender was treated by the Turkish Cypriot authorities , fully in accordance with the legal procedures , illustrates which side in Cyprus respects human rights and the rule of law and which side is responsible for gross violations .  
With regard to the programme of activities for the International Decade of the World 's Indigenous People , ILO had adopted the only international legal instrument addressing the question of the living and working conditions of indigenous and tribal peoples , the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention of 1989 , which recognized that such peoples had a unique cultural identity , and stressed the need to involve them in the making of decisions that would affect their future .

has been emphasized in Security Council resolution 1023 ( 1995 ) of 22 November 1995 , it should be clearly understood that the purpose of the transitional administration is to achieve the peaceful reintegration of the region into the Croatian legal and constitutional system following four years of war and hostility , which have created deep apprehension , fear and distrust between the Croatian Government and the local Serbs .  
Acknowledges that the administration of justice , including law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies and , especially , an independent judiciary and legal profession in full conformity with applicable standards contained in international human rights instruments , are essential to the full and non-discriminatory realization of human rights and indispensable to democratization processes and sustainable development ;  
the progress made thus far by the representative of the Secretary-General in developing a legal framework , studying the causes and manifestations of internal displacement , and analysing institutional arrangements , undertaking dialogue with Governments , issuing a series of reports on particular country situations together with proposals for remedial measures , and raising the level of awareness , at both the national and international levels , to the problem of internal displacement ,  
Invites Member States , the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue and intensify their efforts to contribute financial and technical support to the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda , particularly in the areas of the administration of justice , and welcomes the contributions made , including those at the Round Table Conference at Geneva and its mid-term review , and urges States and donor agencies to fulfil their earlier commitments ;  
it is of the utmost importance that the same legal standards , the same norms of law and the same critical objectivity are applied everywhere be it in the areas in question , in other parts of the former Yugoslavia or elsewhere in this world .  There must be no selectivity , no attempts to either diminish or enlarge violations of international humanitarian law committed by one side for partisan reasons of political convenience .  
It is plain to see that the United States authorities were fully aware of the existence of a group organized in United States territory , in possession of aeroplanes and engaged in carrying out activities not in line with the legal provision of international air service , using these aeroplanes with clearly provocative purposes , failing to recognize Cuban sovereignty and ignoring the very regulations of the State where those aeroplanes were registered and where the licences to fly them were issued to their pilots .  
To those who long ago declared invalid any legal measure of a foreign country against their businessmen and nationals , we here send a message of hope : Cuba , the island of the bold , is not going to turn away from the road it has taken ; it will not violate the hopes and trust of its friends or partners , in spite of threats and multilateral or bilateral measures that someone might try to impose upon it . 
A stable legal framework , fair and efficient law enforcement and equal access to public services and justice , in accordance with international standards of human rights , are essential conditions for the creation of transparent and accountable institutions , for the promotion of a public administration that is responsive to the needs of the population and for the prevention of and fight against all forms of corruption .  
Social trust can be increased , however difficult it may be to achieve consensus among those who have been combatants , through a predictable legal system , based on the rule of law , in which everyone can engage in social and economic activities knowing that a fair , impartial and predictable system of adjudication awaits any disputes .  
Despite differences or variances in legal systems , there was general agreement that extant laws governing administrative systems are too many and are redundant ; enforcement is slow , and some laws simply can not be implemented for a variety of reasons : lack of resources , operational or resource constraints , irrelevance or inapplicability of prevailing conditions .  
The lessons learned so far have proved that without supportive and predictable administrative and legal structures at all levels , and without access to public services particularly to a justice system the private sector and citizens would live in a state of uncertainty and insecurity , hindering the development of their full potential .  
This real accounting audit of personnel files , accompanied by a legal and organizational analysis , has revealed a certain number of failings that can be addressed through a proposed organizational arrangement linked to a permanent system of administrative management .  
We proceeded to achieve this with a special focus on India 's needs , and our Constitution set forth the institutional bases for resilient administrative processes , especially in the crucial areas of legal , judicial , parliamentary and democratic structures .  
Untiring efforts have also been made in the promotion of human rights , particularly in respect of information , democratic participation and the administrative and legal functions of democratic institutions guaranteeing the civil and political rights of the population , including documentation , the local administration of justice and civic education .  
These settlors need not only represent recognized legal experts in international military / peace / security issues , but also those having expertise in economic , social and cultural relations where disputes are most often the root cause of all disastrous conflicts .  
The representative reported on the Government 's priorities and future plans in implementing the Convention , including strengthening the national machinery for women ; vocational training for women and educational and awareness-raising efforts among teachers ; expansion of child care ; supplementing the recently reformed family law and the remaining legal instruments that involved unequal treatment of women ; improvements for rural women ; prevention of violence against women ; women 's participation in decision-making ; and possible creation of an equal opportunities commission .  
In our view , it is high time to concentrate the efforts of United Nations Member States on the formation of a legal basis which would allow us to implement this important initiative as one of the steps towards increasing the level of international economic security , securing the global coordination of the activities of international , regional and national economic institutions and preventing economic coercion and discrimination .  
The core objectives of the programme were , inter alia , to create and adjust the country 's macroeconomic policy , ensure a correct legal and regulatory framework for the development of a strong market economy , provide a transparent and accountable policy framework aimed at promoting investment , allocate adequate budgetary resources for social programmes , create the necessary conditions for the establishment and consolidation of democratic institutions and support good governance and political stability .  
There is no doubt that this singular situation , in which the creator of the rule of law is also its direct object , is less favourable to the development of a legal system which is balanced , whether as regards its normative scope or the material content of its rules .  
Given the new challenges of these final years of our millennium , the International Court of Justice today , half a century after its founding , has become the body to which States , both large and small , and international organizations are turning increasingly to seek justice or to request the Court 's authoritative opinion on disputes , differences or legal problems that arise or create differences between them , convinced that the only valid and lasting solution is one based on law .  
We consider that the unanimous opinion that there is in neither customary nor conventional international law any specific authorization of the threat or use of nuclear weapons should become the legal and political foundation for greater progress towards total denuclearization . 
The national programme on children is aimed at creating favourable conditions for : the development of children ; ensuring their legal and social protection ; preventing diseases ; providing the most reliable means of medical care and treatment to children ; implementing radical measures to prevent infectious diseases ; eliminating malnutrition among children ; and implementing measures to prevent crime , drug abuse , alcoholism and smoking among children .  
Working with partners in 18 countries , USAID is undertaking a learning process designed to explore and document new ways to build capacity and linkages among groups at the local level ; to forge solid society-to-society linkages between these local groups and their United States counterparts ; and to foster a legal , regulatory and fiscal environment conducive to citizen participation and community initiative .  
Wilmot ( Ghana ) : At the World Summit for Social Development held in Copenhagen in March 1995 , world leaders took tough political decisions and committed themselves to create an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment that would enable people to achieve social development and social justice .  
Organized under the auspices of the United Nations , these global conferences have focused attention on the complex phenomenon of development in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , legal and related fields in a holistic manner .  
There is a widespread feeling of dissatisfaction sometimes veiled and sometimes explicit with an Organization that still embodies the loftiest ideals ever conceived by the human spirit in the search for peace and understanding among peoples .  Brazil is committed to the United Nations Charter and to the Organization 's political , legal and diplomatic legacy of the past 50 years .  
In addition , we commend the secretariat for playing an instrumental role in fostering the development of a global nuclear safety culture based on an improved international legal framework , recommended safety standards and advisory services .  
We are grateful to all Member States that supported our appeals and calls in the General Assembly for universal respect of international law as reflected , for instance , in General Assembly resolution 49 / 43 , which created the political conditions and legal framework for the peaceful reintegration of Eastern Slavonia .  
Poland believes , therefore , that the time has come to make a concerted international effort to agree on , and accede to a comprehensive legal instrument : a convention designed to enhance cooperation between States and facilitate the work of law enforcement agencies in fighting transnational organized crime .  
Therefore , any action taken by Israel since the beginning of the Madrid process to alter the political , legal or demographic status of Jerusalem is tantamount to creating a fait accompli to be imposed on the Arab party , which would constitute a judgement on the status of the Holy City before the beginning of the final status negotiations .  This is unacceptable and can not be conducive to the peace we all desire .  
Unless immediate steps are taken by the parties concerned for example , through the removal of administrative and legal barriers one of the most important provisions of the Peace Agreement will remain unfulfilled , with grave political and economic consequences for the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
This is being achieved through the pursuit of a sound and stable macroeconomic policy , supported by a prudent and disciplined fiscal and monetary stance , and the delivery of an investor-friendly institutional legal framework .  
It further emphasizes the paramount importance of strict compliance with existing arms limitations and disarmament agreements relevant to outer space , including bilateral agreements , and with the existing legal regime concerning the use of outer space , including wide participation in such a legal regime .  
The Working Group entrusted with this issue should also strive to reach an understanding on the possibility of harmonizing legal norms and existing national administrative procedures in the area of domestic control of weapons and in the import and export of arms , in order to establish a common and effective international arms control system that would make it impossible for arms to be diverted through clandestine or illicit channels .  
Stresses the need for Governments and relevant international institutions or organizations to examine how the rapid globalization of the world economy and the increased liberalization of trade is affecting the ability of States to design and implement effective strategies for eradicating poverty and to provide a stable legal framework that creates an enabling environment to achieve social development and to meet the basic human needs of all , in order to prevent greater inequality between different sectors of society ;  
Recommends that States consider more operational ways of integrating a social exclusion concept into the design of global strategies for eradicating poverty , notably through human rights , democracy , good governance and administration , a stable legal framework , participation in decision-making , non-discrimination , tolerance and mutual respect for and valuing of diversity , universal access to basic social services and adequate social protection ;  
In conclusion , since the Security Council has already decided that the UNCRO mandate in Croatia has ended effective 15 January , and thereby the United Nations mandate on the Prevlaka peninsula as well , and in view of the above-mentioned fact that the Prevlaka peninsula is an integral part of Croatia , the Croatian Government considers any and all requests designed and aimed at creating legal uncertainty and ambiguity regarding the status of parts of sovereign Croatian territory to be unacceptable , and contrary to the interest of peace and security in the region .  
The operative part of the resolution called on Israel to respect the relevant resolutions of the Security Council , declared invalid all Israeli acts in the occupied Syrian Golan , called on Israel to desist from attempting to alter the physical , demographic , institutional and legal character of the occupied Syrian Golan , and referred to the issue of settlements in that territory .  
Decide to combine their efforts to establish effective legal and judicial cooperation in the prevention of crime , especially transnational and organized crime , and the strengthening of criminal justice systems by developing and promoting international instruments pertaining to criminal justice , such as agreements concerning trafficking in women and children , genocide , war crimes , terrorism and drug-related offences .  
The human rights approach to women 's health implied that international and national policies must be based on recognition of women 's rights , including the right to reproductive and sexual health and family planning , and demanded full commitment to the removal of economic , social and legal disadvantages that denied women their right to health .  
The representative reported on the Government 's priorities and future plans in implementing the Convention , including strengthening the national machinery for women ; vocational training for women and educational and awareness-raising efforts among teachers ; expansion of child care ; supplementing the recently reformed family law and the remaining legal instruments that involved unequal treatment of women ; improvements for rural women ; prevention of violence against women ; women 's participation in decision-making ; and possible creation of an equal opportunities commission .

The Committee had played a vital role in promoting economic , social and cultural rights , by formulating final views on the way in which States had fulfilled their Covenant obligations , by defining its General Comments as a basis for jurisprudence in that area , by discussing the question of the elaboration of an optional protocol to the Covenant that would allow individuals and groups to present legal complaints with regard to the violation of one or several of the rights protected by the Covenant , and by successfully conducting its first technical assistance mission .  
Despite greater efforts by judicial officials to respect legal and constitutional guarantees - including procedural time-limits - arbitrary and illegal practices persist , including irregularities in the preparation of arrest warrants , restrictions on the right to defence , prolonged pre-trial detention and some cases of non-respect by prosecutors of decisions handed down by examining judges .  
The host countries may request the Secretariat of the United Nations , within existing resources , to disseminate information which would be helpful to the diplomatic community in resolving the debt problems , including , inter alia , provisions of relevant international legal instruments and United Nations documents as well as information provided by the host countries on cost of living at a location concerned and relevant provisions of national legislation ;  
In his report to the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , the Secretary-General had stated that the lives of millions of Iraqis were threatened by hunger , which had not deterred the Power that currently dominated the world from deliberately ignoring the humanitarian and legal aspects of such threats or from using the pretext of human rights to serve its political purposes and seeking to overthrow the current legitimate Government of Iraq .  
Had the Special Rapporteur behaved in a neutral or objective manner , he would have called , without any hesitation and for purely humanitarian , legal and moral reasons , for the lifting of sanctions , at least in part on the grounds that human rights must be respected not only by individual countries but also by international organizations , particularly the Security Council .  
However , the Special Rapporteur indulged in an abstract political and legal analysis based on presumptions , allegations and misinformation with a view to emptying those decrees of their noble humanitarian content , seeking ways to exaggerate any shortcoming or weakness , presumed or real , in order to undermine the position of Iraq , thereby rendering his conclusions untrustworthy .  
At the same time , it is recognized that in a longer perspective the litmus test of internal peace and stability will be the ability of all social , ethnic and political groups in the country to advance effective processes for the construction of a civil society capable of solving disputes through legal , peaceful means .  
Concerned about the continuing violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel , the occupying Power , especially in the use of collective punishment , closure of areas , annexation and establishment of settlements , and the continuing actions by it designed to change the legal status , geographical nature and demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory ,

Ukraine afforded women equal rights and opportunities in the areas of education and specialized training , labour , remuneration , promotion and socio-political and cultural activities and also implemented special measures to protect the labour and health of women , enable women to combine work with motherhood , and extend legal protection and material and moral support to mothers and children .  
In the specific area of the advancement of women , the emphasis would be placed on reinforcing women 's economic power , power-sharing between men and women , improving access to social services , raising their legal status through reform of the civil codes , reinforcing their role in the culture of peace , supporting women in particularly difficult circumstances and promoting and protecting the girl child .  
In view of the conclusions of the Colloquium , it had been decided that it would be worthwhile for UNCITRAL to attempt to provide a legislative framework to limit uncertainty in settlement of cross-border insolvency cases , for example , by drawing up model legal provisions and incorporating provisions on access and recognition in the text that it prepared .  The Commission had therefore decided to assign to a working group the task of developing a model legislative framework for judicial cooperation and for access and recognition .

Although many countries , particularly developing countries , lack legal , institutional , financial , technological and human resources to respond adequately to rapid urbanization , many local authorities are taking on these challenges with open , accountable and effective leadership and are eager to bring people into the sustainable development process .  
Adopt an enabling legal and regulatory framework based on an enhanced knowledge , understanding and acceptance of existing practices and land delivery mechanisms so as to stimulate partnerships with the private business and community sectors , specifying recognized types of land tenure and prescribing procedures for the regularization of tenure , where needed ;  
The tools for achieving a physically more balanced development include not only specific urban and regional policies and legal , economic , financial , cultural and other measures , but also innovative methods of urban planning and design and of urban development , renewal and management .  
We commit ourselves to the goal of improving living and working conditions on an equitable and sustainable basis , so that everyone will have adequate shelter that is healthy , safe , secure , accessible , and affordable and that includes basic services , facilities and amenities and the enjoyment of freedom from discrimination in housing and legal security of tenure .

In the present instance , Cuba is requesting reopening of the item entitled " United Nations Decade of International Law " , in particular the consideration of respect for international law and its progressive development and codification , which today are under threat from unilateral interpretations by a super-Power which is seeking to impose its bilateral policy interest not only on the political action of the Organization but also on the legal thinking of the sovereign States Members of the international community .  
Recognize the existence , identity and rights of indigenous people through constitutional reforms or the adoption of new laws , when appropriate , to improve their legal status and guarantee their economic , social , cultural , political and civil rights .

Cuba has not violated the existing international ethical norms on the use of weapons against civil aircraft , nor has it violated any international legal norm or precept related to the safeguarding of international civil aviation , or the Chicago Convention , much less article 3 bis of the 1984 Montreal Protocol , for very concrete and evident reasons :  
The Government of Cuba has sound and undeniable proof , from the legal and political points of view , that the acts of violation and aggression against Cuban airspace perpetrated for more than 35 years , and most recently by aircraft of " Brothers to the Rescue " , have had a subversive , hostile , aggressive and terrorist character .  
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Azerbaijani Republic declares that the recent step taken by the Republic of Armenia in signing the aforementioned agreement with the illegal entity established in the Nagorny Karabakh region of the Azerbaijani Republic which is occupied by the Republic of Armenia constitutes gross and undisguised interference in the internal affairs of the Azerbaijani Republic and yet another infringement of the latter 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , and that it violates the universally accepted norms of international law and hence can have no legal force whatsoever .

Concerning the definition of an aerospace object , while we agree generally with question 1 , which considers the twofold capacity to travel and to fly into orbit as a specific characteristic of the aerospace object , we nevertheless admit that this interpretation is closely linked with the developing technology , and therefore we advise , in view of a possible legal definition consistent with the technological evolution , to thoroughly examine the aerospace object requisites . 
Invites States concerned , specifically those sending and receiving women migrant workers , to conduct regular consultations for the purpose of identifying problem areas in promoting and protecting the rights of women migrant workers and ensuring health , legal and social services for them , adopting specific measures to address these problems , setting up , as appropriate , linguistically and culturally accessible services and mechanisms to implement those measures and , in general , creating conditions that foster greater harmony and tolerance between women migrant workers and the rest of society in which they reside ;

It was not really possible to develop a special legal status applicable to all the objects and systems concerned , because of their great dissimilarities ; it was more realistic to choose a legal status based on certain aspects , such as the capability of the aerospace object to travel through outer space and to remain in airspace for a certain period of time , and the technical design and nature of the object or system , for example whether it was single - or multi-staged , piloted or unpiloted , and launched vertically or horizontally .  
For geographical reasons Ecuador had demonstrated great interest in the geostationary orbit , which was a limited natural resource with special characteristics , and for which there should be a sui generis legal regime regulating access to and utilization of the orbit and guaranteeing equitable access to it , with account being taken of the relative disadvantages of the developing countries .  
The Subcommittee could contribute to establishing a special legal regime to regulate the use of the geostationary orbit ; ITU regulated only the technical aspects of its utilization , while the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its subcommittees were concerned with the political and legal aspects of the peaceful uses of outer space .  
Although it was a body that could boast of noteworthy achievements over the previous 30 years in the preparation of legal instruments governing outer space , there seemed to be a current of opinion to the effect that it had now served its purpose , since future space activities would tend to be regulated by market forces .  
The mission prepared a diagnostic study on the current socio-economic and political atmosphere for rural and urban micro-enterprises and on the current support being given to this sector by assistance agencies ; a set of recommendations for political , institutional and legal strategies for assistance and an operational approach to coordinating and harmonizing assistance ; and proposals for support programmes for access to credit and for the institutions supporting this sector .  
The United Nations system , the World Bank and International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) system and other multilateral and bilateral organizations have continued to provide invaluable support in the formulation of national mineral sector policies , in the enhancement of legal and fiscal systems , in facilitating forums for multi-disciplinary dialogue and in the deepening of necessary institutional infrastructure .  
However , while most developing countries and countries in transition are enthusiastic about encouraging foreign investment in mining , not all are capable of making the necessary macroeconomic changes and implementing the necessary legal and fiscal regimes that would be acceptable to the international mining community in a timely manner .  
The legal and fiscal frameworks should provide assured access to land for exploration , clear and transparent rules and procedures , security of tenure from exploration through production , a stable and equitable fiscal regime , equal opportunity to foreign investors and access to international arbitration .  
The United Nations system , World Bank and the IFC system and other multilateral and bilateral organizations have provided invaluable assistance to industry and host Governments in respect of mineral resource technical support and advice ; training of national staff in all skills required in mineral resource development ; hosting of regional promotional round-table forums to facilitate dialogue between industry , Government and facilitating organizations ; institutional structuring and reforms ; capacity building ; provision of research on trends in mineral , fiscal and legal policies ; and for commodity supply and demand studies .

Provide funding for research on and assistance in the development and implementation of appropriate mineral resource , investment , legal , fiscal , environmental and other related policy and procedural frameworks to improve the enabling environment in order to attract and secure long-term private investment ;  
Confronting mining issues , such as the technical , legal and financial constraints faced , as well as environmental pollution and degradation , is necessary but not sufficient for solving the problems inherent in artisanal mining , since one of the problems associated with this type of mining is that it may create immediate income but often does not create improved living conditions or social development for the regions in which it occurs .

The United States strongly supported the efforts of the United Nations and other global and regional initiatives designed to promote the harmonization of the world 's financial , regulatory and legal regimes , thereby achieving more effective control of the laundering of the proceeds of serious crime .  
Besides encouraging States to become parties to the 1988 Convention , to enact financial legislation that did not run counter to the guidelines of FATF , and to increase multilateral cooperation in investigations and prosecutions , the recommendations focused on the improvement of national legal systems to combat money-laundering , the enhancement of the role of the financial system , understood in its broadest sense , and the strengthening of international cooperation .

The hiring of mercenaries to guarantee internal security and public order in African States could be regarded as a threat to the inalienable sovereign responsibility of States for their own internal order and security and to their responsibility to prevent the repression of their citizens or the violation of their human rights ; and the international community should examine the extent to which it considered the recruitment of mercenaries to be legal .

The Government has the power to establish the right macroeconomic environment , as well as a transparent , stable and predictable legal , regulatory and tax framework , and thus create favourable conditions for entrepreneurial and enterprise development .

Accordingly , the Governments role should be confined to its core functions , namely creating a sound legal and macroeconomic framework , protecting the environment , ensuring order and security and providing infrastructure , education , social protection and essential public services .  
Referring to the situation in Jammu and Kashmir , he said that India , despite having accepted the decision of the Security Council that a free and impartial plebiscite should be held to determine the legal status of that region , had resorted to unilateral measures to occupy the territory and had prevented the Kashmiris from exercising their right to self-determination as recognized in Security Council resolutions which were still valid and binding on all the parties : India , Pakistan and the United Nations .

The United Arab Emirates , which welcomes the peace process on the basis of international law and the land for peace principle , considers illegal and inadmissible all current Israeli measures aimed at changing the demographic composition and the legal status of the occupied Palestinian and other Arab territories , including the city of Jerusalem , Syrian Golan and southern Lebanon .  
Israel must fully implement its bilateral and international legal obligations , including , primarily , ending the construction and expansion of settlements , a complete and unconditional withdrawal from the city of Hebron , the release of Palestinian prisoners , and engaging in earnest negotiations in the permanent status talks with the Palestinian Authority in order to find a final and just solution to the question of Palestine .

Since Israel 's occupation of East Jerusalem , more than 28 years ago , the Israeli Government has tried to judaize the city by distorting its identity , changing its demographic character , deporting Palestinian inhabitants and reducing their numbers through the application of military , administrative and legal measures , moving settlers into the city and expanding Jerusalem 's borders to prejudice the final status of the city .

According to the Standard Professional Code for German Physicians , which underlies all individual professional codes in this respect , all physicians , prior to conducting any clinical trial on a human person or epidemiological research using personal data , must seek the advice of a medical ethics commission on the medical and legal issues involved .

Another view was that the concept of crimes in international law was well established and that for acts of exceptional gravity such a characterization with its legal , moral and political dimensions and negative and condemnatory connotations was quite appropriate .  
The concept of an international crime , which was not strictly identical to the notion of criminal responsibility in national law , indicated clearly that the violation of the legal and moral obligations essential to the peace , survival and prosperity of the international community was considered to be on a par with the most serious criminal offences punishable under national law .  
While different legal systems contained varying provisions concerning the validity of an arbitral award , no existing international instrument or customary practice envisaged the possibility that an arbitral award in an international dispute would not be implemented as a result of objections raised by one party to the dispute .  
Given that the rules they set forth were complementary , and that States parties to the Code would , ipso facto , be called upon to recognize the existence of an international criminal court , her delegation considered that the Commission should concentrate on drafting two harmonious and complementary texts of equal legal value , whether separate or incorporated .  
The Commission 's new approach to the problem of deciding before which organ and on what legal basis a State could be accused of an international crime seemed reasonable , but the trouble with the choice of the Security Council and the General Assembly as the organs responsible for characterization of an international crime was that , as in the past , they might take a complaisant attitude towards extremely serious wrongful acts , and moreover their competence was limited by the Charter . 
Thirdly , the relationship between the States themselves : instead of waging propaganda wars and in some cases even resorting to economic coercion and the use of military force to deal with ethnic tensions and situations involving minorities in other countries , States should rely on the legal means provided by international human rights instruments , in particular the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , which contained a provision allowing States to make a complaint when they were not satisfied with the performance of another State in matters covered by the Convention .  
Nevertheless , the legal institution of reservations may well have to be reassessed in the light of the particular nature of human rights treaties ; this results from their specific object , which is to provide maximum protection for individuals victimized not only by their own Governments but also at the hands of private parties , from their recognition in international and regional jurisprudence as establishing non-reciprocal and objective obligations , and from the existence of treaty monitoring bodies .

In that connection , bearing in mind that the draft Code and the international criminal court would form part of a single international legal regime , he hoped that the court 's statute would provide more specific guidance on issues which were not clearly defined in , or omitted from , the draft Code .  
His wise and courageous leadership and vast experience and legal expertise will indeed be crucial in guiding the Tribunal in its critical role of re-establishing public confidence in the rule of law in Rwanda .

According to its statute , the members of the Commission were elected , not on the basis of political representation , but so as to represent the main forms of civilization and principal legal systems of the world , in addition to which its members must of course individually possess the requisite qualifications of competence in international law .  
It is appropriate , therefore , that at this meeting of the Council the international community is renewing its support for further efforts to bring about continued progress towards lasting peace , economic reconstruction , the strengthening of national institutions , the promotion of human rights and justice and , more importantly , respect for the independence , sovereignty , legal continuity and territorial integrity of a unified Bosnia and Herzegovina within its internationally recognized borders .

These actors include international and regional intergovernmental organizations ; individual States ; parliamentarians ; non-governmental organizations from the local to the global levels ; and private actors such as legal professionals , the media , academics , private institutions and civic associations , including ethnic , cultural and religious groups .  
Such a culture is built upon a societal consensus not about policy , but about the process and framework of democratic political life : that the will of the people is the basis of governmental authority ; that all individuals have a right to take part in government ; that there shall be periodic and genuine elections ; that power changes hands through popular suffrage rather than intimidation or force ; that political opponents and minorities have a right to express their views ; and that there can be loyal and legal opposition to the Government in power .

In response to that suggestion it was observed that in legal systems that recognized insolvency proceedings of natural persons , such as individual traders or merchants , it would sometimes be difficult to establish a clear distinction between the debtors business and personal affairs , and that proceedings apparently falling in the latter category might well have influence on the debtors assets and liabilities .  
Furthermore , it was observed that the word was used in many international legal texts and that its objective and meaning were well understood : its purpose was to emphasize that public policy exceptions should be interpreted restrictively and that article 6 was only intended to be invoked under exceptional circumstances concerning matters of fundamental importance for the enacting State .  
The Commission considered the question whether the Model Provisions should expressly provide that a foreign representative had procedural " standing " ( a concept in some procedural systems referred to by expressions such as " active procedural legitimation " , " active legitimation " or " legitimation " ) to initiate actions to avoid or otherwise render ineffective legal acts detrimental to creditors ( such actions were sometimes referred to as " Paulian actions " ) .  
It was said that , if such standing was to be conferred on the foreign representative , it should extend only to actions that were available to the local insolvency administrator in the context of an insolvency proceeding opened in the enacting State ; care should be taken to avoid creating an impression that the foreign representative was equated with individual creditors , who under many legal systems had a right to initiate actions to avoid or otherwise render ineffective legal acts detrimental to creditors .

At a time of universal consensus that the international protection of human beings against gross and systematic violations of their basic human rights is no longer considered as interference with the sovereignty and internal affairs of the State , we also have to recognize the legal , moral and political responsibility of the international community , above all the powerful States in the region , to prevent acts of genocide and to protect the population against other gross and systematic violations of human rights .

In the light of the current financial situation of the United Nations , the Committee 's attention is drawn to the established practice that all activities related to international conventions or treaties that , under their respective legal instruments , are to be financed outside the regular budget of the United Nations may only be undertaken when sufficient resources to cover the activities in question have been received from the States parties in advance .  
The number of such associations is constantly rising , and their diverse objectives include childcare , encouraging the work and education of women , raising women 's awareness of educational , health , social and legal matters and providing vocational training for women in skills such as dressmaking , printing and domestic food preparation .  
Given that the relevant international legal instruments have been put into effect , or are close to being put into effect , the Chinese delegation believes that the existing discriminatory and exclusive mechanisms and arrangements for non-proliferation not only run counter to those international agreements , but inhibit the social and economic development of various countries , especially developing countries .  They should therefore be rescinded ,  
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographical distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
Therefore , the Workshop considered areas in society where participation might be encouraged and developed , as in legal , political , economic and administrative areas , in addition to more traditional areas such as provision of social services , development of non-governmental organizations and access to information .  
Also emphasizes that an equitable and favourable national and international economic , political , social and legal environment , in accordance with the provisions of chapter 1 of the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , is essential for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographical distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
Invites States to allocate resources to provide comprehensive programmes designed to heal and to rehabilitate into society child victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation , including through job training , legal assistance and confidential health care , and to take all appropriate measures to promote their physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration ;  
Strongly urges all Governments to guarantee the respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , particularly the right to life , and to take urgent measures to prevent the killing of children living and / or working on the streets and to combat torture and violence against them , and to ensure strict compliance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other relevant human rights instruments , including the requirement that legal and juridical processes respect the rights of the child ;  
Among the cross-cutting development constraints hampering the private sector were an ineffective or shallow financial sector ; lack of a legal and regulatory system ; weak infrastructure ; obsolete technology , poor on - and off-farm storage facilities , high taxation , and generally inadequate support services ; an inadequate policy framework ; an inefficient and overly dominant public enterprise sector ; misdirected development assistance ; high transaction costs ; and lack of trust in the interaction between the Government and the private sector .  
Participation requires a guarantee of the rule of law and fair judicial procedures in order to reduce the likelihood of decisions that are arbitrary , corrupt and biased , which in turn requires a sound legal environment , including an independent judiciary with adequate resources .  
Other social groups that can be identified include ethnic and religious minorities ; indigenous people ; refugees and displaced persons ; migrants and migrant workers , both legal and illegal , as well as family members left behind ; prisoners and ex-offenders ; addicts and former addicts ; squatters ; street children ; people living in extreme poverty ; and landless rural workers .  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic , financial , political , social and legal environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
To that end , the Government is strongly encouraged to consider taking appropriate steps to develop a legal and institutional framework for public broadcasting to ensure that the State-financed broadcasting media can operate effectively as a public service broadcaster , with full guarantees of editorial and operational independence from Government and all other political influence on programming content .  
The Council recommended that the Commission be appointed by the Secretary-General and be composed of 5 to 10 impartial and internationally respected persons , including legal , military and police experts , under the chairmanship of an eminent person , and assisted by the appropriate support staff .  
The European Union accordingly supports unreservedly MINUGUA activities aimed at strengthening Guatemala \ x { e5b8 } institutions ; those activities focus most particularly on the legal system , public security , and the promotion of a multicultural , multilingual and multiethnic State , on education and promotion regarding the peace agreements and their dissemination , and on the creation of a national climate conducive to respect for human rights .  
It was noted , however , that the implementation of privately financed infrastructure projects required a favourable legal framework that fostered the confidence of potential investors , national and foreign , while protecting public interests .  
The Commission encouraged the Secretariat to devise ways to address the continuing and significant increase in the importance being attributed by Governments , by domestic and international business communities and by multilateral and bilateral aid agencies to improving the legal framework for international trade and investment .  
While acknowledging that the various working groups within the Organization were dealing with individual aspects of this problem , the sponsor noted that they were doing so in a context and manner which were primarily political and operational in nature , whereas the Special Committee , being a body with highly qualified legal expertise , was best suited for dealing with the mere legal aspects of the matter , which were the subject of the proposed declaration .  
Some other delegations considered the draft declaration to be a relevant , realistic and timely proposal , reflecting the need for consolidating and developing a proper legal basis and procedures for peacekeeping , preventive and other relevant operations of the United Nations .  
Among them , for example , are the requirements of article 20 of the statute of the Joint Inspection Unit and of article 21 of the statute of the International Civil Service Commission that their respective budgets be included in the regular budget of the United Nations . Another is the question of a legal basis for the United Nations , in the absence of an appropriation , to advance funds to the entities concerned , pending receipt of contributions from the participating agencies . 
A programme of technical assistance to municipalities is being implemented , with emphasis on improving local urban planning and management , the strengthening of municipal finances , and supporting the establishment of local institutional and legal frameworks .  
Among the issues that remain to be solved are the privatization of parts of the public rental housing stock , meeting the cost of renovation of private homes in mixed-ownership buildings , the future role of private rental housing , strengthening of market-type financial institutions in the housing sector and the introduction of legal and financial elements of real estate renting .  
During the next 12 months , we have to cope with a vast agenda covering a broad range of political , economic , social , disarmament and humanitarian issues , as well as legal , administrative and budgetary ones .  
The quality of the future to which humankind aspires depends on what we can do today to give human beings their dignity and guarantee that they can enjoy the fundamental rights recognized in the international legal instruments that reflect our collective conscience .  
This encouraging trend has been achieved through the adoption and pursuit by Governments of policies and measures aimed at ensuring , among others , macroeconomic stability , inflows of foreign direct investment , open and free markets and stable and transparent legal and regulatory frameworks .  
The key elements for attaining sustainable economic development are a sound policy framework that encourages stable growth , a vigorous private sector , the strengthening of institutional and legal foundations and , last but not least , good-governance and anti-corruption measures .  
The experience gained from the functioning of these two ad hoc tribunals has paved the way for the wider acceptance of the idea of an international criminal court , thus creating a firm legal basis at the universal level for the establishment of individual criminal responsibility with regard to war crimes and crimes against humanity .  
The present stage requires that we make effective use of every achievement by guiding United Nations action in an innovative and practical direction , based on operational legal aspects of multilateral activities against terrorism .  
Any move in this direction is bound to encourage certain dangerous phenomena that we have been witnessing of late , including legal and illegal emigration from developing to developed countries , that could sow the seeds of social , ethnic and cultural conflict . 
We also urge all parties to the FCCC to consider fully the Alliance of Small Island States ( AOSIS ) draft protocol during the ongoing negotiations , especially at the forthcoming Kyoto conference , in order to pursue the greatest possible level of net reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions by means of a legally binding protocol or other legal instrument .  
We have consistently extended our firm support to this legal regime , which has paved the path to securing our common goal of ensuring long-term , stable and sustainable living resources of the vast oceans and seas based on cooperation , mutual benefit and shared responsibility .  
These documents have established a legal order governing the ocean space which will contribute to the exploration of the sea for peaceful purposes and the equitable and efficient utilization of marine resources and facilitate the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order .  
In this connection , I am pleased to inform the Assembly that in October 1996 my country 's Parliament , at the initiative of the Executive , adopted a law that establishes norms and punishments for the crime of laundering money or goods derived from illicit traffic in narcotics , psychotropic substances or dangerous drugs , thereby significantly improving the legal framework for combating such crimes head on .  
This situation calls for urgent legal and humanitarian measures to establish a comprehensive global legal system banning all kinds of anti-personnel mines and to allay the pain and suffering caused to innocent civilians by the mines , which impede the social and economic activities of these peoples .  
The historical stance of Ecuador , a peace-loving country , has led it to reaffirm that the general and complete disarmament process , under effective international control , must move forward with firm steps , responding to the legal and moral conscience of the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean , which are pioneers in this area , as evidenced by the Treaty of Tlatelolco . 
The international community has acknowledged the extraordinary foresight of the authors of the Tlatelolco Treaty , who responded , in an intelligent and creative manner , to the challenge posed by the danger of nuclear proliferation by drafting an international legal instrument that has become an inspiration and a model for other countries wishing to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones .  
The differing provisions of each treaty may make the creation of formal legal linkages complex and difficult , but we see scope for developing political links between the four existing or potential nuclear-weapon-free zones .  
Article VII of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) and paragraphs 5 , 6 and 7 of the Principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament proclaimed at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the NPT established a sound legal foundation for creating new international nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of agreements freely entered into between the appropriate States for the purposes of strengthening peace and security on the global and regional levels .  
Among the measures taken by the Israeli authorities are the allocation of huge funds to change the basic features of Jerusalem and to erase its Arab character and the promulgation of special decrees and laws treating Jerusalem as a purely Israeli zone subject to the same organizational , legal and administrative rules applicable to other Israeli cities .  
In operative paragraph 2 , the Assembly would reaffirm that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that have altered or purported to alter the character , legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem are null and void and have no validity whatsoever .  
It was the Israeli decision to build a new settlement in Jabal Abu Ghneim in East Jerusalem that constituted its latest attempt at pre-empting the outcome of negotiations on the final status , by trying to change the legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem , a city which is of central importance for not only the Arab world but also the entire Muslim world , being the first Kiblah and the third Holy City of Islam , and for all three major religions , as well as for the international community . 
That will be possible only if the Security Council shoulders its full legal and political responsibilities : to defend its resolutions without applying double standards , especially since Israel , as we all know , continues to possess weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , that pose a threat to regional and international peace and security .  
There is a widespread need for more coherent and consistent policies , legal frameworks , fiscal and budgetary processes , institutional mechanisms , communication and education programmes , and better coordination between environmental and other ministries .  
In the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , 5 it is acknowledged that the family plays a key role in social development and , as such , should be strengthened , with attention to the rights , capabilities and responsibilities of its members .  Both call for creating an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment that will enable people to achieve social development .  
In this regard , the Habitat Agenda contains numerous suggestions for action , such as ensuring legal protection from discrimination in access to shelter and basic services ; helping the family in its supporting , educating and nurturing roles ; and encouraging social and economic policies that are designed to meet the housing needs of families and their individual members .  
Reducing budget deficits to manageable levels remains the major preoccupation of Governments , yet an inadequate legal basis , an unstable and exceedingly discretionary regulatory environment , high taxes and complicated tax systems and , in many cases , political uncertainties continue to force economic activity into the rapidly growing unregistered - and hence untaxed - shadow economy .  
In accordance with the resolution and arrangements : voluntary contributions paid to the Fund are distributed , through established channels of assistance , as humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals who have been tortured and to their relatives ; the Fund is administered by the Secretary-General with the advice of a board of trustees authorized to promote and solicit contributions and pledges ; and an annual report is submitted by the Secretary-General to the Assembly and , as appropriate , to the Commission on Human Rights .  
The basic principles governing these programmes were to respect and preserve , through bicultural education , the ethnic identity of each of the seven Mayan language groups , guaranteeing their legal stay and security in Mexico , until such time as they individually expressed their preference for voluntary repatriation , and to offer them a standard of living and opportunities for development and work equivalent to those of the Mexican population living in the same area .  
Decides to establish an Ad Hoc Committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies or of the International Atomic Energy Agency , to elaborate an international convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings and , subsequently , an international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism , to supplement related existing international instruments , and thereafter to address means of further developing a comprehensive legal framework of conventions dealing with international terrorism ;  
The legal system of every State shall provide for prompt and effective disciplinary , administrative , civil and criminal procedures so as to ensure readily accessible and adequate redress , and protection from intimidation and retaliation .  
In addition to the compensation fund and the retroactive promotion , the State Department agreed to reinstate four Black junior officers who were dismissed after failing to win permanent positions and to pay $ 2.1-million in legal fees to lawyers who represented the Black diplomats .  
In the context of the Programme of Action for the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education and in cooperation with relevant experts and organizations , HCHR / CHR has envisaged the preparation and publication of six new training manuals - for prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , legal professionals , national and local non-governmental organizations , mass media and for monitoring - and three handbooks on human rights and conflict resolution , human rights and parliament , and human rights and constitutions .  
If undertaken on the basis of an integrated and participatory approach - with the Governments as the formulators and enforcers of economic and legal policies , non-governmental organizations and the scientific community as the environmental agencies that know the most about the resilience and carrying capacity of the Earth , and the private sector as the prime mover for technological development , transfer and diffusion - TNAs can contribute to policy integration by making both public and private decision makers more aware of the environmental consequences of their actions .  
Consultation and information exchange , including through the use of interactive electronic networks , among existing NCPCs and with other parts of the local or national EST support structure ( for example , information systems and sources related to ESTs , technical advisory and consultation services , marketing support and legal advice services , and institutions of research and development ) , are important .  
The authorities of the National Committee for Aid to Refugees , Returnees and Displaced Persons ( CEAR ) have said that the working strategies in the area concerned the management of the process of return : consolidation of reintegration ; land-use planning in conjunction with agro _ ecological studies and definition of the population base ; consolidation of return : socio _ economic reintegration process to promote integrated community development , legal security of land , legal and moral responsibility in paying for property , and planning strategies .  
It is important to note that the Habitat II Conference reconfirmed the legal status of the human right to adequate housing as set forth in the relevant international instruments and stressed that this right should be progressively , but fully , realized .  
At present , the Programmes ' main activities concentrated on : ( i ) access to finance on international terms and conditions ; ( ii ) setting up regional centres to promote competitiveness ; ( iii ) developing suppliers ; ( iv ) disseminating information and promoting innovation and technical change ; ( v ) improving transport , communications and the legal framework .  
While legal and institutional instruments have definitely improved the basis for sustainable development of oceans and coastal areas , implementation lags behind owing , among other things , to ( a ) the difficulty in making political decisions regarding resources and wealth allocation ; ( b ) the difficulty of improving inadequate or inefficient institutions ; and ( c ) in many cases , difficulties in meeting the related financial commitments .  
The Amman Workshop reaffirms that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu .  
Member States shall promote bilateral , regional , multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements , to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .  
The Security Council welcomes the letter of 13 January 1997 ( S / 1997 / 27 , annex ) from the Government of Croatia on the completion of the peaceful reintegration of the region under the Transitional Administration , which guarantees the local Serb community representation and a voice at various levels of local , regional and national government , provides for a limited deferment of military service , and affirms the intention of the Government of Croatia to provide the local Serb population with the protection of their legal and civil rights under Croatian law .  
In central and eastern Europe , where the implementation rate according to the above figures is already somewhat higher than in the other two regions under review , recent regional initiatives aim at the introduction of harmonized legal , infrastructural and logistic conditions that would allow countries in the same subregion to conduct joint controlled deliveries .  
In addition , legal officers assigned to the investigation teams , with one exception , had little or no experience in criminal investigations ; yet they were charged with the task of advising the investigators on how to proceed to collect sufficient evidence , as well as drafting and defending the indictments .  This process has been corrected by the current Prosecutor .  
Further , despite pressure from staff in the Office of the Prosecutor and from both Prosecutors to provide day-to-day operational leadership as the senior officer , the Deputy Prosecutor did not assume the role : the Office continued to operate without sufficient staff and other resources ; without sufficient staff prosecutors who possessed enough relevant legal experience to direct the investigations and to prepare and conduct the trials ; and without critical day-to-day operational guidance . 
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographic distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and shall serve in their personal capacity and be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
More specifically , with regard to concerns expressed by the Inspectors , the Secretary-General proposes to follow the policy whereby gratis personnel would not be used to fill posts or discharge functions normally authorized under the regular programme budget , the peacekeeping budget or the peacekeeping support account , especially with respect to political , legal and administrative functions .  
In Israel , the Ministry of the Environment and its organs use all administrative , technical and legal measures provided by environmental laws , and by laws dealing with general issues , such as licensing , planning and public health , to implement bilateral and multilateral treaties that Israel has signed and ratified .  
While it was true that any enforcement of environmental administrative law was to some extent dependent on a general understanding that non-compliance with legal rules will not be tolerated , criminal law should only be applied as an ultima ratio , and should be restricted to the most severe cases of environmental damage .  
Further , the main focus of three OSCE seminars undertaken in the last two years was on global and regional partnership in the fields of environment management , environmental regulatory mechanisms and the transfer of environmentally safe technologies , international cooperation in protecting the environment , and promoting the economic and legal framework for environmentally sustainable development .  
Some States expressed the view that under the current legal system , there was no special regime that distinguished take-off and landing phases , but in the case of passage over the territorial airspace of another State after entry into airspace , international and national air law of relevant States could apply , in particular in relation to the sovereignty and security of the State concerned .  
Whereas in almost all countries of the world , with the exception of two , women have the legal right to vote and to hold public office on an equal basis with men , in practice relatively few women have been elected to national legislatures , and even fewer occupy key decision-making positions , including in international organizations such as the United Nations .  
At present , the Programmes ' main activities concentrated on : ( i ) access to finance on international terms and conditions ; ( ii ) setting up regional centres to promote competitiveness ; ( iii ) developing suppliers ; ( iv ) disseminating information and promoting innovation and technical change ; ( v ) improving transport , communications and the legal framework .  
This role was manifested at two levels : at the macro level in terms of creating an enabling environment , good macroeconomic policies , a sound legal , regulatory and tax framework and political stability ; and at the micro level inter alia through providing appropriate support measures and structures and investing in capacity _ building , including in the areas of education , training and health .  It could create an environment in which the private sector knew what was happening .  
Since UNCTAD did not have the resources to handle all the legal issues relevant to international trade and trade-related services , it could focus on a number of priority areas such as assisting developing countries in the modernization of trade-related national legislation , organization of educational programmes , preparation of information handbooks on legal aspects of international trade , advising Governments on measures to overcome legal impediments to the use of EDI , disseminating information on legislative reforms on issues such as electronic commerce and trade-related services , and legal assistance to Trade Points .  
Invites States to allocate resources to provide comprehensive programmes designed to heal and to rehabilitate into society child victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation , including through job training , legal assistance and confidential health care , and to take all appropriate measures to promote their physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration ;  
The South African political climate is fortunately relaxed and there is no persecution of any sector of opinion ; the rules in force are those of a State subject to the rule of law in which institutions such as the Parliament and the judiciary are respected and one of the main concerns is the solidity of the legal edifice , starting with the new Constitution , on the basis of which democracy is a stable system that is appreciated by all and capable of making South Africa a model country .  
What this report does want to draw attention to are the dangerous grey areas and the limits which need legal safeguards in order to prohibit such advisory services from becoming active armed participation in internal conflicts or in matters of the internal security of citizens that are connected with the exercise of the rights and political freedoms provided for in international human rights instruments .  
However , it is something that the Commission on Human Rights must not overlook and it has to be solved on the basis of more in _ depth knowledge of the facts , specific references and a systematic analysis concluding with suggestions and proposals for the adoption of political , legal and operational standards relating to mercenary activities and to companies which sell security internationally . 
Germany reported that illicit trafficking in motor vehicles was an area covered by the act to suppress illegal drug trafficking and other manifestations of organized crime ( OrgKG ) of 15 July 1992 , which contained specific legal provisions imposing severe penalties . 
Given the limited capacity of the judiciary , the lack of knowledge about national legislation among the population , and the lack of resources to make use of the court system , the large majority of the population will in practical terms have their legal status defined within the framework of traditional systems in the foreseeable future .  
Although the Commission was not yet fully functional at the time of the mission of the Special Rapporteur , standing committees had been established on relations with non _ governmental and community _ based organizations , and international and parliamentary liaison , on legal and constitutional matters , and on policy and planning matters , including those relating to women 's human rights .  
Most representatives agreed with the Commission 's proposed approach to separate consideration of the question of the nationality of natural persons from that of the nationality of legal persons and to give priority to the former , which , it was argued , involved human rights , while the latter raised problems of an economic order .  
In this regard , the Group expressed particular concern over the Israeli decision on 26 February 1997 to build a new settlement in Jabal abu Ghneim in East Jerusalem , which constitutes the latest attempt by Israel at pre-empting the outcome of the negotiations on final status by changing the legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem - a city which is of central importance to the Arab world and the world of Islam , the three major religions , as well as the international community in general . 
Given the fact that , on the one hand , legal rules were largely non-existent while existing rules were at times contradictory and , on the other hand , the use of electronic media had gained such overwhelming importance in international trade , it was clear that reliable and binding rules were badly needed .  
A deeper participatory role such as they seemed to crave would have been , in our view , wholly inconsistent with their function - to ensure a fair and impartial trial within accepted legal , procedural and evidential principles .  
In the light of the judicial nature of the International Tribunal , it is clear that any such determination would not affect ongoing legal proceedings or the obligation to surrender persons accused of having committed serious violations of international humanitarian law while the armed conflict was still ongoing .  
There is need for a coherent set of legislative measures with programmes to achieve strengthening of the small business [ and informal ] sector through the development of appropriate legal , management and financial structures , to enable the sector to develop in a sustained and organized way ; and to initiate and strengthen financing mechanism that enhance small business [ and informal ] sector access to financial services and to reduce the cost of providing and acquiring these services .  
We are concerned to see the Israeli authorities continuing to commit certain acts that are intended to change the Holy City 's demographic and institutional character in order to Judaize Arab Jerusalem and alter its legal , historical , religious and cultural reality .  
The Committee will consider relevant organizational and supportive arrangements for technical cooperation among developing countries , such as administrative , legal , informational and financial matters .  
In order to achieve this , the foundation for a single normative legal basis is to be laid by the end of 1997 , chiefly by developing general norms as well as unifying civil and customs codes and simultaneously introducing common taxation legislation .  
Secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity and human resources , and adequate access to technology may promote the implementation of international legal instruments .  
Each State has a prime responsibility and duty to protect , promote and implement all human rights and fundamental freedoms , inter alia by adopting such steps as may be necessary to create all conditions necessary in the social , economic , political as well as other fields and the legal guarantees required to ensure that all persons under its jurisdiction , individually and in association with others , are able to enjoy all these rights and freedoms in practice .  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
While the precise legal basis for such measures will need to be rooted in the text of each of the relevant treaties , the principal foundation is to be found in a teleological approach to interpretation which acknowledges that any other outcome is absurd in that it enables a delinquent State party to defeat the object and purpose of the implementation provisions .  
The measures to prevent and control the phenomenon , which need to be elaborated and implemented at the national and international levels , cut across the economic , social , cultural , political and legal fields .  
Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;  
The reason for this is that , although children unquestionably require protection from enlistment in the ranks of these groups , the political and military circumstances of these entities vary to an extent that makes it not only difficult to subject them to a standard rule but also dangerous to accord them international legal status , which might be misinterpreted as granting them implicit recognition .  
Therefore , the members of such groups should either be covered by the conditions applicable to popular armed resistance groups , thereby subjecting them to the provisions and obligations of international humanitarian law to a certain extent , or should be regarded as groups that fail to meet the international requirements for classification as legal combatants , either as members of a regular army or a legitimate resistance movement , in which case , being totally beyond the pale of the law , there would be no point in placing them under any obligation . 
The technological advances that were often readily available to potential terrorists called for a higher degree of political cooperation , and new challenges would undoubtedly emerge that would require innovative legal approaches and techniques to meet them , and joint efforts with other international and regional bodies . 
However , the functioning of local government remains incomplete in important financial and legal areas : most municipalities can not provide basic communal services because they have not received sufficient funds ; only half of them have finalized plans for economic reconstruction ; and the boundaries of the new municipalities drawn before the April elections have not been legally recognized , creating doubts as to their existence after the end of UNTAES .  
The pace of future movements is inhibited by three main factors : legal and financial obstacles to the recovery of property ; unrealistic government deadlines for Serb applications for reconstruction assistance and delays in government funding for reconstruction of Serb houses ; and the uncertain economic and social situation in areas of potential return .  
Another school of thought , while recognizing the responsibility of the State to protect those living in its territory , held that the international community should also hold private individuals who perpetrated violence accountable , under the Protocols additional to the Geneva Conventions , especially Protocol II , and that ethical and legal position had been gaining ground . 
Austria continued to be sceptical about the feasibility of elaborating a useful convention against organized transnational crime , as organized crime was a complex phenomenon that raised a number of legal issues that were not adequately covered in the draft .  
While continuing to expand and strengthen its existing web of bilateral mutual legal assistance treaties with other States , Canada also supported the effective implementation by Member States of the measures contained in international legal instruments , as well as the useful practical and operational measures recommended at various international forums .  
Canada pointed out that , while the idea of an " omnibus convention " on organized transnational crime was an attractive proposition that might have the effect of sending a strong public signal that the international community would not accept criminal abuse of the very positive global trend to loosen international boundaries , it had concerns about that proposal , particularly as far as the possible duplication with other legal instruments and cooperative mechanisms was concerned , at least until the issue of whether such a convention was intended to supersede or supplement existing instruments was clarified .  
Finally , Canada expressed the view that the ratification and implementation of existing international instruments represented a first step towards creating a comprehensive and successful legal framework for international cooperation against organized transnational crime .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , economic and sexual exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance and disability , and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;  
Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;  
This frequently results in inadequate and inharmonious legal approaches , which hamper the rescue of financially troubled businesses , are not conducive to a fair and efficient administration of cross-border insolvencies , impede the protection of the insolvent debtor 's assets against dissipation and hinder maximization of the value of those assets .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , economic and sexual exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance and disability , and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
While the private sector is the " engine of development " , the Government has to lay and maintain the " tracks " that is , create and maintain the legal and regulatory environment for private ownership and fair competition , correct appropriately for market failures , protect the disadvantaged and maintain economic stability , law and order .  
UNHCR \ x { e5b8 } promotional activities sought to raise public awareness , strengthen knowledge and understanding of refugee issues , as well as to foster the effective implementation of international legal standards on behalf of refugees , returnees and other persons of concern to UNHCR , including through their incorporation into national legislation and administrative procedures .  
Reaffirms that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that have altered or purported to alter the character , legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem are null and void and have no validity whatsoever ;  
The central thrust of the subprogramme is the promotion of the Convention and the related agreements by facilitating their understanding , their widest possible acceptance , their uniform and consistent application and their effective implementation , as well as assisting States in their efforts to derive full practical benefits from the international legal regime , and in the enjoyment of their rights and the fulfilment of their obligations arising therefrom .  
Provision of specialized data and information products and services in computer-generated formats on the status of the Convention and the related Agreements ; bilateral and multilateral treaties and other legal instruments ; national legislation ; charts and geographical coordinates of maritime zones ; the limits of the continental shelf ; and national maritime profile ;

The view was expressed that any legal principles of a possible future legal regime of the geostationary orbit , which was a part of outer space , should be consistent with the principles and rules of the Outer Space Treaty , which was the common legal framework for all activities in outer space and that , therefore , it was not certain that the geostationary orbit required a sui generis regime .  
The view was expressed that , while the scientific principles formulated in the working paper submitted by the Czech Republic were acceptable , a comprehensive analysis of the legal aspects , as well as the scientific and technical aspects , of the geostationary orbit in one single document was required , taking into consideration the regulations of ITU , as the examination of those issues should not be approached in a piecemeal manner .

Where specific legislation is required in order for the contracting authority to carry out certain types of projects , the relevant statute often sets forth the conditions for the operation and maintenance of the relevant infrastructure facilities and is supplemented by more detailed provisions in regulations governing that particular infrastructure sector and in the project agreement , an approach that is common to various legal systems .

Training : The Special Rapporteur notes with concern the Government 's apparent adherence to a formal notion of justice , as highlighted by the statement that [ i ] n the light of the fact that the valid Penal Code of the Slovak Republic provides for equality of justice for both men and women in criminal proceedings , no special standards for legal procedures and the conduct of persons active within the system of criminal justice that would enforce justice and equality for women have been developed .  
It was therefore necessary to formulate specific legislation and policies in the legal , economic , political and social fields and , at the same time , to promote the participation of non-governmental organizations and of society as a whole , as well as greater coordination and participation by the specialized agencies of the United Nations system .  In that connection , it was vital to maintain the valuable contribution of UNICEF and of the Committee on the Rights of the Child .

The declining trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) and the increasingly frequent imposition of conditions of an economic and financial or a political , legal or humanitarian nature had forced many developing countries to resort to private capital flows , which had been concentrated in a small number of countries and had proved unstable and crisis-prone .

The view was expressed that any legal principles of a possible future legal regime of the geostationary orbit , which was a part of outer space , should be consistent with the principles and rules of the Outer Space Treaty , which was the common legal framework for all activities in outer space and that , therefore , the future legal regime of the geostationary orbit should not be described in advance as a sui generis regime , since that status would depend on the rules and principles agreed upon .  
The view was expressed that , while the scientific principles formulated in the working paper submitted by the Czech Republic were acceptable , a comprehensive analysis of the legal aspects , as well as the scientific and technical aspects , of the geostationary orbit in one single document was required , taking into consideration the regulations of ITU , as the examination of those issues should not be approached in a piecemeal manner .

However , in order to effectively and efficiently meet the heavy and varied demands of the United Nations for legal services provided under this subprogramme , which requires a range of expertise , all attorneys of the Division , whether funded from the regular budget of the United Nations , from peacekeeping assessments or from resources provided by the separately funded , subsidiary organs , are treated as an integral part of the Division .  
The central thrust of the subprogramme is the promotion of the Convention and the related agreements by facilitating their understanding , their widest possible acceptance , their uniform and consistent application and their effective implementation , as well as assisting States in their efforts to derive full practical benefits from the international legal regime and in the enjoyment of their rights and the fulfilment of their obligations arising therefrom .

Areas that have been identified as involving legal issues relevant to electronic commerce include data protection , taxation , customs duties , security and authentication , intellectual property rights , liability of Internet service providers , illegal and harmful content , Internet governance ( more specifically , domain names ) , electronic payments systems , and consumer protection .  
The main objective of the Model Law was to offer national legislators a set of internationally acceptable rules allowing a number of legal obstacles to be removed and a more secure legal environment created for electronic commerce .  
In this regard , it is instructive to note that the international organizations and public or private sector entities that have studied electronic commerce from a variety of perspectives have tended to focus on certain common elements that would be present in any favourable legal environment .  
In other words , a Government or a State should possess on a permanent basis , a legal system and material resources sufficient to ensure the fulfilment of [ its ] international obligations under normal conditions . 30 In particular , the State must have established , and maintain , an administrative apparatus that is minimally sufficient to permit it to fulfil those obligations ; 
A unilateral act formulated by a person who can not be considered under article 7 as authorized to represent a State for that purpose and to engage it at the international level is without legal effect unless expressly confirmed by that State .

First to re-assert our right to self-determination , which we have demonstrated to you is firmly based on the political and legal rights applicable to all Non-Self-Governing Territories on the United Nations list as established by United Nations resolutions and Covenants and international law as determined by the International Court of Justice . . . . 
The role of the customary areas is to be enhanced by the revision of their current uncertain legal status and by the creation of customary institutions endowed with powers at the local and national levels .  
In many countries , particularly those of the British Commonwealth , exclusive use and occupancy of land from time immemorial gives rise to aboriginal title , a title that is good against all but the Sovereign , that is , the Government of the State . 22 / Where aboriginal title is recognized , indigenous peoples have at least some legal right that can be asserted in the domestic legal system .  
Another discriminatory legal doctrine that appears to be widespread is the doctrine that States have practically unlimited power to control or regulate the use of indigenous lands , without regard for constitutional limits on governmental power that would otherwise be applicable . 
Hence , the intractable problems and legal dilemmas posed by the human rights notions and pretexts invoked by the opposing sides engaged in this vicious circle of controversial aims and doubtful means .

It is essential to fight for respect of human rights and norms of international humanitarian law , but solely through political and legal methods on the firm basis of the United Nations Charter and the relevant multilateral instruments .  
Projects aimed at the strengthening of macroeconomic management capacity , legislative systems , the legal framework , the judiciary , civilian police and election management capacity , along with mechanisms for political reconciliation , public administration and civil service reform , inter alia , must be explored , particularly in Kosovo , taking advantage of national human resources , experience and skills .  
However , when considering the legal force of its provisions , it must be borne in mind that , together with treaties , a significant role in standard _ setting in international law is played by custom , which is formed as a result of the international practice of States and gradually becomes accepted by them as a binding legal norm .  
All of this demonstrates that human rights have become a matter of international legal regulation and international protection , and the individual is considered to be a subject of international law with a clearly defined legal personality .  
Promoting the formulation , adoption and implementation of appropriate technical , institutional , administrative and legal measures contributing to improved protection of marine and coastal environment , including the rational use and conservation of their resources .  
Promote and facilitate integrated island management programmes , including economic and legal instruments , administrative structures and management procedures , for the improved protection and use of the resources of small island developing States , encompassing the totality of the terrestrial environment , coastline and adjacent exclusive economic zones ;  
Nevertheless , the treaty has established a legal framework for the resolve of the international community to halt all explosive nuclear testing and an appropriate basis for its appeal to all countries to commit themselves not just to a narrow literal interpretation of the provisions of the Treaty but to its substance and spirit .  
This process was very complicated from both the legal and technical perspectives and required a lot of resources and international assistance , so for us it seems disgraceful and unjust that in the context of mentioning countries which have abandoned their military nuclear programmes or forsworn nuclear weapons the name of our country is sometimes not even found .  
Took note of the information provided by the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) on how to sign / ratify the Tampere Convention which provides a legal framework for the use of telecommunications in international humanitarian assistance ; ( i ) Noted that the considerable recent advances in seasonal weather and climate predictions , including of such phenomena as El Nio , enable improved preparedness of vulnerable communities against natural disasters .  
It was noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
While it was generally agreed that significant progress had been made at those sessions in the understanding of the legal issues of electronic signatures , it was also felt that the Working Group had been faced with difficulties in the building of a consensus as to the legislative policy on which the uniform rules should be based .  
Consequently , the conclusions and recommendations to be offered in the present report will mainly refer to three of the five juridical situations originally identified : ( i ) where there is proof of international treaties / agreements between indigenous peoples and States , ( ii ) where there are no specific bilateral legal instruments to govern relations between indigenous peoples and States ; and ( iii ) situations relating to the question of other constructive arrangements .  
A critical historiography of international relations clearly shows the dangers of this particular kind of reasoning , which projects into the past the current domesticated status of indigenous peoples as it evolved from developments that took place mainly in the second half of the nineteenth century under the impact of legal positivism and other theories advocated by European colonial powers and their continuators .  
In addition , these contradictions place a formidable burden on the formulation and realization of future negotiated legal instruments between indigenous peoples and States : the difficulties of negotiating those new instruments without having previously identified and settled key questions need not be stressed .  
First and foremost , it must be pointed out that , at present and with very few exceptions - national and international legal texts having a bearing on the living conditions of indigenous peoples are enacted and enforced by State institutions without direct indigenous input .  
In many places , successive waves of settler migration from the metropolis ( in the case of Hawaii ) or of royal trading companies representatives ( frequent in the East Indies ) , and certain legal modalities ( some highly innovative , such as the perpetual leasing of territories ) emerged alongside the traditional juridical forms ( bilateral agreements and treaties ) .  
Special Rapporteur Martnez Cobo thought it convenient to explore further issues as relevant as the areas covered today by the provisions of treaties and other international legal instruments involving indigenous peoples , whether or not they are observed , the consequences of their implementation or lack thereof for indigenous peoples ( an issue also addressed in chapter III above ) , as well as the present status of those legal instruments involving indigenous peoples .  
The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that to link the determination of the original legal status of indigenous peoples as nations ( in the contemporary sense of international law ) or as non-nations to the single factor of whether or not they have formalized relations with non-indigenous colonizing powers , is faulty .  
It is important to recall that modern non-indigenous law long ago dispelled the theory which advocated that the absence of formal legal / political recognition by one sovereign entity ( or a group of them ) could determine either the existence or the juridical international status of another .  
It is the obligation of the entire international presence in Kosovo and Metohija to strictly respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Kosovo and Metohija , which implies respect for its political , administrative , legal , economic and monetary system and an unhindered functioning of public services in accordance with all Yugoslav laws and regulations ;  
The Year 2000 Management Group is supported by a year 2000 team , an interdepartmental task force coordinating year 2000 issues in the areas of information management , peacekeeping operations , humanitarian affairs , economic and social affairs , development cooperation , security and safety , facility management , as well as legal , financial and administrative issues .  
Consideration of additional international legal instruments : 3 .  States Parties shall foster development programmes and cooperation at the national , regional and international levels , paying special attention to economically and socially depressed areas , in order to combat the root socio-economic causes of the trafficking of migrants .  
Generally speaking , where an unlawful act on the part of a state authority causes damage to another person ( physical or legal ) , the civil liability for that act is incurred by the authority ( i.e . the State ) , while the public official representing that authority may incur administrative or criminal liability , but may not incur full civil liability except in certain circumstances ( for example , if the damage suffered is minor ) .  
While it was generally agreed that significant progress had been made at those sessions in the understanding of the legal issues of electronic signatures , it was also felt that the Working Group had been faced with difficulties in the building of a consensus as to the legislative policy on which the uniform rules should be based .  
These include reorganization of divisions ; formal procedures for setting priorities and monitoring at regular monthly meetings with clients ; establishing a continuing legal education programme for its staff to keep abreast of developments in , for example , the financing , insurance , copyright and trademark and arbitration fields ; playing a larger role in the selection and training of legal officers for peacekeeping missions and establishment of a time-keeping system .  
Acknowledge and promote the central role of families , parents and other legal guardians in educating their children and shaping their attitudes , and ensure that parents and persons with legal responsibilities are educated about and involved in providing sexual and reproductive health information , in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of adolescents , so that they can fulfil their rights and responsibilities towards adolescents ;  
Other women-based policies since put in place deal with the elimination of female genital mutilation ; adolescent health ; legal reforms to eliminate domestic violence and to raise the minimum age for marriage to 18 years ; and the development of a strategic framework for the implementation of adolescent reproductive health , among others .  
Our main objectives are to eradicate absolute poverty , increase access to basic education for girls , eliminate gender disparities , increase access to reproductive health care , and reduce cultural and legal barriers that discriminate against women and girls , as well as to reduce maternal and infant mortality rates .  
It is aimed at addressing a range of interrelated challenges , protecting individual social and economic rights and human rights in general , providing legal protections and creating conditions to protect the cultural , spiritual and intellectual interests of our people .  
We are also committed to developing cooperation with countries of origin , but we believe that a constructive approach to international migration implies first and foremost the protection of the human rights and dignity of all migrants , irrespective of their legal status , including through the adoption and enforcement of legal instruments , both national and international . 
This plan revolves around seven priority areas : first , improvement of the living conditions of women ; second , improvement of the legal status of women ; third , development of female human resources in all the development sectors ; fourth , access by women to effective decision-making ; fifth , promotion and protection of the girl child ; sixth , combatting violence against women ; and seventh , improvement of the institutional framework .  
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal persons held liable in accordance with this article are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal or non-criminal sanctions , including monetary sanctions .  
The supporters of such a revitalized protection regime are united in the belief that international cooperation for the protection of refugees is not only an ethical and legal imperative but also a prudent insurance policy for an uncertain future .  
The States parties to the present Covenant undertake to have respect for the liberty of parents and , when applicable , legal guardians to choose for their children schools , other than those established by the public authorities , which conform to such minimum educational standards as may be laid down or approved by the State and to ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions .  
As an urgent priority , UNMIK will thoroughly assess the existing legal , financial , and fiscal structure and capacities in order to put in place policies for the recovery , development and future integration of Kosovo into a healthy and expanding regional economy in Southeastern Europe .  
The Special Rapporteur stressed that in order for a legal act to be valid under international law , it must be attributable to a State , the representative of that State must have the capacity to engage it at the international level , the act must be the expression of its will and free of irregularities and it must be formulated in the proper manner .  
It was agreed to exclude from the study unilateral acts subject to special legal regimes such as , inter alia , those based on conventional law , reservations to treaties and declarations accepting the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice .  
At the service delivery level , UNFPA assisted in the establishment of a womens centre for reproductive health care , social assistance , legal and psychological counselling and community education at Burej refugee camp , Gaza , which served some 13,000 refugee women in 1998 and is supporting the establishment of a similar centre in the Jabalia refugee camp , Gaza .  
In accordance with the international standards , " a substantial autonomy " implies that some specific powers and rights , such as the right to the use of language , education and information in one 's own tongue , protection and fostering of one 's own culture and tradition as well as local administration affairs , are transferred to the autonomous region , which takes place within the framework of a broader constitutional and legal order in a sovereign State .  
The Special Representative of the Secretary-General does not and can not enjoy the powers to decide at his own discretion the validity of Yugoslav laws in Kosovo and Metohija , because it is an integral part of the constitutional , legal , economic , financial , fiscal , monetary , foreign currency , customs , transport and other systems of the Republic of Serbia and those of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
_ that free legal and other assistance is provided to trafficked persons and persons in prostitution in the course of any criminal , civil and other action against traffickers and those who violate the human rights of trafficked persons and persons in prostitution , including a temporary or permanent residence permit and a safe shelter ;  
Two main issues will be addressed : ( i ) the legal and practical implications of the constitutional provisions relevant to indigenous and tribal peoples , and ( ii ) increasing cooperation between and among government officials , national and international organizations , and indigenous and tribal peoples within the framework of Convention No . 169 , which emphasizes consultation and participation .  
With regard to trust , proper legal and regulatory instruments were required at the international level , which would need to be adapted to national specificities .  
Potential barriers , whether cultural and organizational , political and legal , technical and programmatic or economic , needed to be identified and then removed or minimized .  
By contributing to the Fund , States demonstrate their commitment to combating torture and their solidarity with the victims , enabling the latter to receive medical , psychological , psychiatric , financial , social , legal or humanitarian assistance and to resume a normal life . 
Appeal to all Governments , organizations and individuals to contribute generously to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture , if possible on a regular basis , keeping in mind the increasing demand for medical , psychological , social , humanitarian and legal assistance to victims of torture and members of their families worldwide ,  
Civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights have been codified in the International Covenants and ratified by a large number of countries , but the Declaration on the Right to Development does not have the status of a treaty and therefore can not be enforced in a legal system .  
Security Council resolution 1244 ( 1999 ) clearly defined the framework for the international civil and security presences in Kosovo and Metohija , which constitutes an integral part of the unified constitutional , legal , economic , financial , monetary , customs and tax systems of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
Under international standards " substantial autonomy " implies that some specific competencies and rights , such as the right of minorities to use and receive education and information in their own language , as well as the right to protect and foster individual culture and tradition and the affairs concerning the local administration , are transferred to the field of autonomy within the wider constitutional and legal order of a sovereign State . 
Kosovo and Metohija is an autonomous province and constitutes an integral part of the single constitutional , legal , economic , financial , monetary , fiscal , foreign exchange , customs , traffic and other systems of the Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
In this context , the requests of the members of the Albanian ethnic national minority and KFOR to be granted full control over the Inland Revenue Office , the registry of immovable property , vital records books and other registry books that constitute a legal foundation for the exercise of the rights of citizens on the basis of ownership of both movable and immovable property are also unlawful .  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
Another fundamental international legal instrument elaborated by the CD is the CTBT , a treaty which was a long _ sought objective of the international community and which is supposed to block any further qualitative development of nuclear weapons .  
This shows that the net of international legal commitments relevant for economic , social and cultural rights is fairly wider than would be assumed by considering only the number of ratifications of the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .  
The pursuit of sound , growth-oriented macroeconomic policies , moreover , needs to be complemented by a general social , legal and political environment conducive to the efficient functioning of markets and , in particular , to the development of the private sector , whose investment decisions are at the centre of growth .  
The Committee is particularly concerned at the high and increasing incidence of drug and substance abuse among the youth ; the lack of legal provisions in relation to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances ; and the limited psycho _ social and medical programmes and services available in this regard .  
While welcoming the State party 's efforts to adopt measures , both legal and educational , to eradicate the practice of female genital mutilation and other harmful traditional practices affecting the health of children , the Committee remains concerned at the difficulties encountered in eliminating such practices .  
The outrage duly expressed by the international community , condemning the Taliban as the perpetrators of these killings , and particularly the special attention given to this tragic event by the United Nations as embodied in Security Council resolutions 1193 ( 1998 ) and 1214 ( 1998 ) laid the political , legal and international groundwork for the investigation of the issue , identification and prosecution of those responsible for the murders .  
In this connection , there is an obvious need for international legal regulation of the worldwide development of civilian and military information technology , and for the formulation of a coordinated international policy on information safety that meets the needs of international security .  
A set of legal , institutional , managerial and procedural measures for follow-up have been outlined , including developing the technical capabilities of officials involved in the formulation of insurance policy and determination of premiums and their allocation . 
The Year 2000 Management Group is supported by a year 2000 team , an interdepartmental task force coordinating Y2K issues in the areas of information technology , peacekeeping operations , humanitarian affairs , economic and social affairs , development cooperation , security and safety , facility management and legal , financial and administrative issues . 
It provides a basic set of contractual provisions which can ensure that electronic commercial transactions may subsequently be concluded by commercial partners within a sound legal framework .  
It was considered to have been an important occasion for taking stock of legal and regulatory developments at the national and international level , enabling experts to give consideration to all legal aspects of electronic commerce , including their impact , problem areas and possible solutions .  
This implies the full respect of the unified legal , economic , financial ( the dinar as the sole legal tender ) , tax , visa and passport systems and observance of the laws of the Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that are in force , in particular those relating to property , legal and status and administrative matters , registry of citizens and issuance of personal identification documents , passports and other identity papers .  
With regard to trust , proper legal and regulatory instruments were required at the international level , which would need to be adapted to national specificities .  
Under this Act , foreign legislation which is aimed , directly or indirectly , at restricting or impeding the free flow of trade and the movement of capital , goods or persons to the detriment of a given country or group of countries shall neither be applicable nor have legal effects of any kind within the national territory .  
Ecuador has stated on previous occasions that it has not adopted , nor will it adopt in future , any laws that run counter to freedom of international trade or violate the principle of non-interference in the internal and international policies of States , which is set forth in the Political Constitution of Ecuador and , accordingly , is reflected in each and every legal , political and economic action taken by Ecuador both domestically and internationally .  
At its twenty-fifth session , the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers also rejected any arbitrary or unilateral measures , whether political or legal , applied by one country against another one and urged all States to consider this law , which is against the international law and norms , as null and void ( A / 53 / 95-S / 1998 / 311 , para .  69 ) .  
In various international forums , Panama has expressed its opposition to the growing tendency to seek to apply unilaterally with extraterritorial effect national laws and measures that affect other States in the field of trade and international relations , since they are contrary to international law , violate the principles of the legal equality of States , respect for and the dignity of national sovereignty , and non-intervention , and are detrimental to their harmonious coexistence .  
Venezuela believes that unilateral measures that are extraterritorial and coercive in nature , such as the embargo imposed against Cuba , have a negative effect on the legal regime which defines economic and trade relations between nations and an adverse impact on the efforts that have been carried out in order to achieve economic integration at both the continental and subregional levels .  
Such legislative , regulatory or administrative measures could include the use of authenticated end-user certificates , enhanced legal and enforcement measures , as appropriate , to control arms-brokering activities , requirements to ensure that no retransfer of small arms and light weapons takes place without prior authorization of the original supplier State , and cooperation in the exchange of information on suspect financial activities .  
In addition , the Office has developed a specific anti-trafficking programme whose objective is to work towards the integration of human rights into international , regional and national anti-trafficking initiatives , with emphasis on legal and policy development .  
The focus on human rights standards is further reflected in the technical assistance provided to Governments and in the strengthening of the institutional and legal environment ; in the drafting of new constitutions ; the reform of civil and penal laws and the establishment or rehabilitation of juvenile courts .  
The theme would include human resource development through basic science education , research and development , as well as their interdisciplinary aspects ; the transfer , commercialization and diffusion of technology ; increasing public awareness and participation in science policy-making ; and bio-ethics , bio-safety , bio-diversity , and the legal and regulatory matters affecting these issues to ensure equitable treatment . 
No doubt the shared use of facilities increases the legal and jurisdictional complexities of project financing , but increasing experience on how to tackle ownership issues has been gained through international water-sharing projects . 47 Also , the private financing of multi-country infrastructure projects creates complementary interests between landlocked and coastal countries as transit infrastructure directly generates foreign exchange . 
The representative of the Economic Commission for Europe ( ECE ) stated that the Commission had developed a unique set of international legal instruments governing international transport of goods and passages of vehicles .  
The project will lead to the development or harmonization of relevant legal instruments and to improved coordination among the concerned institutions and , based on an analysis of the institutional capacity to respond to that form of crime , will contribute to the development of a national strategy and elements of a subregional strategy against trafficking in human beings .  
The Central American Governments must also contend with regional disparities among their countries in terms of human development , economic performance and their respective political and legal frameworks , all of which are obstacles to achieving integrated and sustainable arrangements for economic growth and stable political processes .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 53 / 155 of 9 December 1998 , stressed the importance of creating an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment that will enable people to achieve social development at the national and international levels .  
Mercenarism occurs in inverse proportion to peace , political stability , respect for the legal and democratic order , the ability to exploit natural resources in a rational manner , a well-integrated population and a fair distribution of development which prevents extreme poverty .  
To enhance the quality of legal services available to defend accused persons , the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the Tribunal were amended at the fifth plenary session in June 1998 , to require a minimum of 10 years ' experience in criminal law or international humanitarian law for inclusion in the roster of potential Defence lawyers .  
The provision to the effect that the revenues and budgets of all physical and legal persons will be made in foreign currencies is along the same lines , as well as the paradoxical provision that a compulsory payment may be paid in dinars with a charge of " an additional administrative fee to cover handling and transaction costs " .  
The Ad Hoc Committee , at its fourth session , held in Vienna from 28 June to 9 July 1999 , decided that at its fifth session it would focus on articles 4 , 4 bis , 7 , 7 bis , 7 ter , 10 , 14 ( paragraphs 14-22 ) and 15-19 , dealing with money-laundering , confiscation , extradition , mutual legal assistance , special investigative techniques , transfer of proceedings , establishment of criminal record , protection of witnesses and victims , and law enforcement cooperation .  
The Central American Governments must also contend with regional disparities between their countries in terms of human development , economic performance and their respective political and legal frameworks , all of which are obstacles to achieving integrated and sustainable arrangements for economic growth and stable political processes .  
The representative of the Economic Commission for Europe ( ECE ) stated that the Commission had developed a unique set of international legal instruments governing international transport of goods and passages of vehicles .  
Underlining the importance of the widest possible dissemination of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and of relevant training for , inter alia , civilian police , armed forces , members of the judicial and legal professions , civil society and personnel of international and regional organizations ,  
It is truly regrettable that , despite quite a number of basic instruments in international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law which provide for the essential legal protection of civilians in armed conflict , the gross violations of their rights around the world have not yet ceased .  
It was recognized that it is a duty of all States to hold accountable , through their national legal systems and through effective international tribunals , those responsible for the most heinous crimes .  
Underlining the importance of the widest possible dissemination of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and of relevant training for , inter alia , civilian police , armed forces , members of the judicial and legal professions , civil society and personnel of international and regional organizations ,  
He outlined the legal issues that needed to be resolved before the undertaking of actual proceedings , including the definition of applicable laws , both national and international , and procedural questions such as the appointment of personnel , the mechanism for appeals and the requirements for evidence .  
For some , the central piece in the struggle is the reform of the legal system , that is to say , the search for a system that is less arbitrary , less driven by ideology , less cruel towards its dissidents and criminals ; in short a system based on the rule of law built around respect for the personal dignity of all individuals .  
The awarding authority must , in each case , satisfy itself that the contract proposed has been examined and approved by the legal , financial and other officers as appropriate , that adequate tenders be requested , that , all other conditions being equal , the lowest price or bid be accepted and that the contract proposed is overall in accordance with the Agencys best interests .  
The Statutes of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries summarize the above in three general objectives : concerted action among its members at both the political and diplomatic level , particularly with the aim of asserting their presence in the international forums ; cooperation , particularly in the economic , social , cultural , legal and scientific spheres ; implementation of projects designed to promote and disseminate the Portuguese language .  
The only solution to this dilemma , therefore , is to further develop the existing United Nations system in such a way that in the future it is able to intervene in good time in cases of very grave human rights violations , but not until all means of settling conflicts peacefully have been exhausted and this is a crucial point within a strictly limited legal and controlled framework .  
This is what makes the ultimate sanction of the United Nations so indispensable , since an international legal standard can not except in exceptional temporary situations be the prerogative of any single group of States .  
It was noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
In contrast , the benefit expected from the Uniform Rules in favour of certain techniques , which were recognized as particularly reliable , irrespective of the circumstance in which they were used , was to create certainty ( through either a presumption or a substantive rule ) , at or before the time any such technique of electronic signature was used ( ex ante ) , that it would result in legal effects equivalent to those of a handwritten signature .  
Widespread concern was expressed that an enhanced electronic signature would be considered as if it were a distinct legal concept , rather than just a description of a collection of technical criteria , the use of which made a method of signing particularly reliable .  
My report to the Security Council on the protection of civilians in armed conflict ( S / 1999 / 957 ) , which was considered by the Council in September , contains detailed proposals on the legal and physical protection of civilians to enhance compliance with international humanitarian law and human rights law during armed conflict .  
As local institutions , including the court system , have for all practical purposes ceased to function , with the Indonesian civil service , police service , judges , prosecutors and other members of the legal profession having left the territory , the Transitional Administration will be entrusted with the task of rebuilding a structure of governance and administration capable of providing basic public services and a fully functioning administration of justice .  
This Convention sets universal legal norms which are intended to protect children from insufficient care , ill-treatment and exploitation and to ensure their enjoyment of their fundamental human rights , including the right to survival , development and full participation in social , cultural , educational and other activities .  
For the purpose of investigating the crimes [ covered by this Convention ] [ established in articles . . . of this Convention ] , if permitted by the basic principles of domestic legal systems , States Parties shall take appropriate measures , when necessary , to permit their competent authorities to use special investigative techniques such as controlled delivery and electronic surveillance within their own territories .  
Policy-oriented analytical work should be carried out by UNCTAD on : ( 1 ) the impact of electronic commerce on trade policies ; ( 2 ) the fiscal and financial implications of electronic commerce ; ( 3 ) the implications for developing countries of the legal and regulatory aspects of electronic commerce ; and ( 4 ) the impact of electronic commerce on employment , productivity and economic growth .  
The objective of the policy is to ensure that cooperatives , recognized as legal entities , are assured real equality with other types of associations and enterprises , and that this equality is extended to all organizations and institutions set up by the cooperative movement .  
Apart from universal adherence to the 11 existing international counter-terrorism conventions , along with adherence to various legal instruments adopted at the regional level , new legal instruments are needed to counter specific forms and manifestations of terrorism .  
In the light of the views expressed by the Presidents of the Administrative Tribunals , the legal advisers further considered the matter at their annual meeting in 1999 and decided to adjust their proposed amendment to accommodate the main concern expressed by the Presidents and to provide that the panel shall be composed of judges of the respective Tribunals designated by the Presidents , rather than the Presidents themselves .  
Whereas some emerging economies have taken full advantage of the possibility of attracting foreign capital , most LDCs were unable to do so due to a lack of adequate macro-economic policies and to the structural weakness of their institutional and legal framework , and in particular of their financial sector , as well as to the risks resulting from the volatility of financial markets .  Capital flow liberalisation must continue .  
Analytical work should be carried out on the establishment of a legal and regulatory framework conducive to the development of the private sector and favourable to FDI and to domestic investment and the development of local expertise as well as regional networks .  
I would like to emphasize that it was the Greek Cypriot armed onslaught in December 1963 against the Turkish Cypriots and the binational order that led to the division of the island when the Turkish Cypriots were forced to live in enclaves , deprived of all basic necessities and fundamental human rights , for 11 years prior to the legal Turkish intervention of 1974 .  
The UNITAR Fellowship Programme on the Legal Aspects of Debt and Financial Management has been developed to meet a need in providing training to public officials from sub-Saharan Africa in the various legal aspects of debt management with a view to developing sustainable capacity for the efficient management of international debt .  
As in previous years , it is to be stressed that guidelines contained in General Assembly resolutions should be followed , in particular , the desirability of using , as far as possible , the resources and facilities made available by Member States , international organizations and others ; as well as the need , in appointing lecturers for the seminars of the Fellowship Programme , to secure representation of the major legal systems and balance among various geographical regions .  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949,3 and have no legal effect ;  
In addition , it was pointed out that draft article 27 could be deleted , since it addressed the contractual aspects of assignment , namely a matter which was not the main focus of the draft Convention and might already be sufficiently regulated by private international law ( even though the principle of freedom of choice of the applicable law might not be common to all legal systems ) .  
One new P-3 legal adviser ( litigation ) , to be located in Arusha , is also proposed to review and analyse all judicial documents filed in Tribunal cases , to carry out research involving international criminal law and national jurisdictions , coordinate periodic revision of the Prosecutors Guidelines and to establish a database of the Prosecutors positions on relevant legal and factual issues .  
The Year 2000 Management Group is supported by a year 2000 team , an interdepartmental task force coordinating year 2000 issues in the areas of information technology , peacekeeping operations , humanitarian affairs , economic and social affairs , development cooperation , security and safety , facility management and legal , financial and administrative issues . 
Profoundly concerned that the situation of girls and boys in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions in an increasingly globalized world economy , pandemics , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance , discrimination and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Governments should establish or maintain legal and / or administrative measures to enable consumers or , as appropriate , relevant organizations to obtain redress through formal or informal procedures that are expeditious , fair , inexpensive and accessible .  
In keeping with that commitment , the countries of the Central American Group had established the legal and institutional framework for social development based on the principles of mutual cooperation , solidarity and realization of the full potential of men and women in the region as well as on overcoming the structural factors that gave rise to poverty in the subregion .  
It had developed a legislative framework for environmental protection and a national concept of sustainable development , and was working on legal , administrative and economic instruments to ensure sustainable development .  
Progress towards sustainable development required the establishment of an international legal framework for managing deteriorating natural resources , enhanced coordination among international institutions in the environmental field , global guidance for the emerging environmental agenda and the pursuit of feasible solutions for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
This policy should include , as a minimum , culmination of the process of adapting the substantive and procedural legal framework to the requirements of international norms governing collective bargaining and trade union freedom , and the review of State institutions in order to ensure that the planning process throughout the country will include educational , preventive and promotional dimensions , with the necessary budgetary appropriation to make them sustainable .  
If the interpretation is indicative and descriptive , it falls within the purview of sciences such as archaeology , general history , including the history of cultures and civilizations , ethnology , political sociology , social psychology and political philosophy ; if the interpretation is prescriptive , it is a matter for ethics and the moral sciences , philosophy and the legal sciences , international relations and educational psychology .

Each State Party , in accordance with its domestic legal principles , shall take the necessary measures to enable a legal entity located in its territory or organized under its laws to be held liable when a person responsible for the management or control of that legal entity has , in that capacity , committed an offence set forth in article 2 .  Such liability may be criminal , civil or administrative .  
Each State Party shall ensure , in particular , that legal entities liable in accordance with paragraph 1 above are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal , civil or administrative sanctions .  
Under the terms of operative paragraph 12 , the General Assembly would , inter alia , request the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to convene expert meetings , as requested in previous General Assembly resolutions in the past , to study and update the international legislation in force and to propose recommendations for a clearer legal definition of mercenaries that would make for more efficient prevention and punishment of mercenary activities .  
The question of nationality was further complicated when , as a result of a succession of States , two or more legal systems collided or overlapped , and ostensibly logical and transparent criteria of nationality proved to be obscure and elusive when applied in real circumstances . 
The representatives of the people of Iraq urge an immediate halt to the daily attacks being carried out by United States and British aircraft under the cloak of the so-called aerial exclusion zones imposed on Iraq without any legal basis , inasmuch as these attacks target civilian and services-related installations such as electric power stations and water treatment plants in such a way as to affect the lives of Iraqis in an adverse manner and inflict harm on them .  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949,23 and have no legal effect ;  
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal persons held liable in accordance with this article are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal or non-criminal sanctions , including monetary sanctions .  
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural , ] administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
Legislative acts adopted in recent years would make it possible to define the legal field for developing traditional types of economic activity as a basis for ensuring the viability of small indigenous peoples , developing local self-government and establishing relations based on partnership with governmental bodies at various levels .  
Each State was entitled to protect its citizens and the human rights of the victims of the most serious crimes as it saw fit , and depending on its social , moral , cultural , legal and economic specificities .  
It was noted that the Working Group , throughout its thirty-first and thirty-second sessions , had experienced manifest difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues that arose from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures .  
While it was generally agreed that significant progress had been made at those sessions in the understanding of the legal issues of electronic signatures , it was also felt that the Working Group had been faced with difficulties in the building of a consensus as to the legislative policy on which the uniform rules should be based .  
In spite of its economic , geopolitical and developmental constraints , the Jordanian Government continued to review the human rights guarantees provided through its legal , judicial and administrative systems .  
Despite that welcome development , the Israeli Government was continuing its policy of establishing Jewish settlements and confiscating Palestinian land , especially in East Jerusalem , in the area around Jerusalem , and in the Syrian Golan , and was still engaging in practices that adversely affected the human rights of the Palestinian people , with the result that in Jerusalem , the demographic , legal , cultural and historic situation was being altered .  
It also has an idea of the roots of the problem and has made attempts to address the three key areas of access to justice through changes in the legal and judicial system ; promotion of the democratic process by introducing electoral and other reforms ; and strengthening local communities by trying to initiate dialogue and attempting economic and political empowerment .  
The theme will include human resource development through basic science education , research and development , as well as their interdisciplinary aspects ; the transfer , commercialization and diffusion of technology ; increasing public awareness and participation in science policy-making ; and bioethics , biosafety and legal and regulatory matters affecting these issues to ensure equal treatment ;  
Calls upon the international community to consider supporting the creation of special economic zones and development corridors in the Community , with the active participation of the private sector , while recognizing the responsibilities and the ongoing efforts of the countries concerned to create the necessary environment , including the appropriate legal and economic framework for such activities ;

To appeal to the United States of America to engage in a direct dialogue on equal terms with the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , in order to discuss and resolve whatever factors may be preventing the normalization of bilateral relations between the two countries , and allow the Lockerbie case to take its legal and judicial course , as required by the nature of the dispute and as agreed by all parties , free from pressures of any kind ;  
Tribute should be paid to the organizations of the United Nations system , Governments and the international community , especially non-governmental organizations , for the work they were doing to help , at both the psychological and the physical level , millions of children living in abject circumstances because they were victims of poverty , a precarious economic or social situation , sickness , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance , disabilities or lack of legal protection .  
In its view , the legal protection designed to counter the problem of the sale and abuse of children should not be confined to sexual exploitation ; it was also necessary to condemn the practices which violated international rules governing such matters as adoption .  
Despite the existence of an array of international legal instruments to protect children in armed conflict , the human rights of children continued to be violated with impunity ; there was clearly a need to reverse the trend from blatant disregard to strict observance of those instruments .  
Indonesia concurred with the observation made by the expert seminar that questions of racism and racial discrimination were complex and demanded comprehensive solutions that not only included legal provisions but also addressed social , economic and cultural issues .  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , while ensuring the right of every person to a fair and public hearing by a competent , independent and impartial tribunal established by law , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures , including legal and judicial measures in order to bring an end to impunity , to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
Invites States to take legislative , administrative , legal and other steps , including when a state of emergency has been declared , to take action at the national and regional levels and in cooperation with the United Nations , if appropriate through technical assistance , and to provide the Working Group with concrete information on the measures taken and the obstacles encountered in preventing enforced , involuntary or arbitrary disappearances and in giving effect to the principles set forth in the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance ;  
Stressing the variety of forms , modalities and experiences of democratic societies , taking into account national and regional particularities , the various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds , and the diversity of economic , political , cultural and legal systems ,  
The research was conducted in close cooperation with the Department of Legal Sciences , University of Venice , on the basis of extensive research , taking into account the normative framework related to the prevailing legal systems and examining difficulties arising from , and the implications related to , the constitutional , penal and administrative regimes of countries from all the regions of the world . 
IRU actively promotes the adoption and practical implementation of United Nations multilateral legal instruments on road transport in central and eastern Europe , in particular in newly independent States , as well as in Asia ; support and guidance to various EU aid projects on road transport .  It contributed to the elaboration of a draft revision of the European agreement concerning the work of crews of vehicles engaged in international road transport and to discussion on a draft revision of the consolidated resolution on the facilitation of road transport ;  
The role of developing countries in establishing or enhancing favourable conditions for a sustainable enabling environment for both domestic and international investments , including improving the legal , economic and social environment for investment .  
Other essential factors in promoting the mobilization of domestic resources for development are political stability , good governance and the rule of law , a sound and transparent legal system , guarantees for private investors , transparency in public administration , markets and companies , respect for contract law and private property , efforts to combat corruption at the national and international levels , the participation of citizens and civil society in public life , and equal access to resources for women and men .  
The Working Group is composed of five independent experts with the task of investigating cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the relevant international legal instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
The training and technical assistance programme carried out by the Secretariat under the mandate given by the Commission , in particular in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , encompasses two main lines of activity : ( a ) information activities aimed at promoting understanding of international commercial law conventions , model laws and other legal texts ; and ( b ) assistance to Member States with commercial law reform and adoption of UNCITRAL texts .  
However , the distinction between the validity of the contract creating or evidencing the security right and the validity of the security right as a property right is not universally prevalent , with some legal regimes extending the liberal validating rules of private international law applicable to the formal validity of contracts to the formal validity of the security right as a property right .  
As to the form that work might take , while a model law might be more desirable from the point of view of completeness and uniformity , to the extent that it would need to reflect certain fundamental guiding principles that would not be common ground to all legal systems , it would represent a significant change from current law in many countries and might , as a result , not meet with sufficient acceptance .  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and have no legal effect ;  
Stresses the necessity of establishing , at the national level , an enabling legal , political , economic and social environment for the realization of the right to development and emphasizes the importance of democratic , participatory , transparent and accountable governance , as well as the need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions , to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction ;  
Notes with concern the continued problems related to the rule of law and the functioning of the judiciary , inter alia , of corruption , including interference by the executive with the independence of the judiciary , welcomes the Governments continued commitment to reform the judiciary , commends its current efforts to prepare the laws and codes that are essential components of the basic legal framework , and urges the Government to continue to take the necessary measures to promote the independence and impartiality of the Supreme Council of the Magistracy and the judicial system as a whole ;  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of the persistence of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions in an increasingly globalized world economy , pandemics , in particular HIV / AIDS , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance , discrimination , disability and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
The view was expressed that , although the provisions of the treaties were managing well with the increasingly complex activities of outer space , member States should focus on their domestic legal regimes in order to ensure that the provisions of the treaties were being properly implemented , including putting in place appropriate domestic regulatory mechanisms to ensure effective compliance .  
Some delegations expressed the view that , with the rapid evolution of technology and the increasing commercialization of space activities , it was necessary to identify improvements or mechanisms to strengthen the existing legal framework governing the peaceful uses of outer space .  
The view was expressed that the increasing involvement of private industry in space activities required some clarification of specific terms within the legal instruments governing outer space activities in order to strengthen their application .  
While noting the work undertaken by ITU relating to the scientific and technical aspects of the utilization of the geostationary orbit , some delegations expressed the view that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Legal Subcommittee continued to be the competent bodies to discuss the legal and political aspects of the geostationary orbit .  
Firstly , those delegations were of the view that the fact that the preliminary draft protocol had been based largely on the draft protocol on matters specific to aircraft equipment failed to take into account to a sufficient extent the unique nature and utilization of space objects and equipment and their fundamental differences on technical , operational and legal levels from aircraft equipment .  
The view was expressed that the interaction and potential conflicts between the proposed system of international interests in mobile equipment and existing domestic legal regimes would require careful analysis .  
The view was expressed that determining the legal regime on the basis of where the object was located , that is , in airspace or in outer space , would result in practical problems relating to the law applicable and that a unified legal regime should be applied in the case of aerospace objects as long as such a regime was complementary to air law and flight safety regulations for aircraft ;  
Concern was expressed that , depending on the decisions to be made by the Working Group with respect to articles 2 and 13 , the remainder of the draft provisions might need to be re-examined to avoid creating a situation where the standard set by the uniform rules would apply equally to electronic signatures that ensured a high level of security and to low-value certificates that might be used in the context of electronic communications that were not intended to carry significant legal effect .  
It was noted that the Working Group on Arbitration had already begun discussing ways in which current legal instruments of a statutory nature might need to be amended or interpreted to authorize the use of electronic documentation and , in particular , to do away with existing requirements regarding the written form of arbitration agreements .  
It was noted that the Working Group on Arbitration was considering ways in which current legal instruments of a statutory nature might need to be amended or interpreted to authorize the use of electronic documentation and , in particular , to liberalize existing requirements regarding the written form of arbitration agreements .  
In the study , it was suggested that the most efficient technique for updating , under optimum conditions of speed and coverage , the definitions contained in all the different instruments inventoried in the survey conducted by CEFACT would appear to be the conclusion , at the initiative of UNCITRAL , of an interpretative agreement in simplified form for the purpose of specifying and supplementing the definitions of the terms signature , writing and document in all existing and future international instruments , irrespective of their legal status .  
The prevailing view within the Working Group , however , was that , although the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce was a useful basis for modernizing domestic legislation or interpreting international instruments , the legal barriers to the development of electronic commerce posed by international instruments , in particular multilateral treaties and conventions , required special attention .  
Thus , an analysis by the Working Group of legal issues related to the creation of electronic substitutes for paper-based transport documents would be a meaningful contribution to that other project , as it might result in the development of specific electronic commerce-focused provisions that might , at an appropriate time , become an integral part of that new international regime expected to be developed by the Commission .  
In view of the urgent need for the introduction of the legal rules that would be needed to bring certainty and predictability to the international regime governing Internet-based and other electronic commerce transactions , the view was expressed that the Working Group should initially focus its attention on issues raised by electronic contracting in the area of international sales of tangible goods .  
Urge those States in which the political and legal systems do not reflect their multiracial , multi-ethnic , multilingual and multicultural realities to review those systems , in consultation with representatives of the affected groups , with a view to improving democratic institutions so that they are more fully participatory and avoid marginalization , exclusion and discrimination of specific sectors of society , including indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other victims of racism ;  
At that time , the General Assembly confirmed the principle of adequate representation of the various legal and economic systems and of the developing and the developed world , as well as the principle of equitable geographical distribution of seats .  
Taking into account General Assembly resolution 55 / 25 of 15 November 2000 , in which it is stated that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime [ 3 ] constitutes an effective tool and the necessary legal framework for international cooperation in combating such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in endangered species of wild flora and fauna ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the bilateral , regional and multilateral legal instruments and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in species of wild flora and fauna and of illicit access to genetic resources , and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .  
Such legislative , regulatory or administrative measures could include the use of authenticated end-user certificates , enhanced legal and enforcement measures , as appropriate , to control arms-brokering activities , requirements to ensure that no retransfer of small arms and light weapons takes place without prior authorization of the original supplier State , and cooperation in the exchange of information on suspect financial activities .  
The Commission invited the intergovernmental open-ended expert group for preparing draft terms of reference for the negotiation of the future legal instrument against corruption , established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 55 / 61 , to take into consideration the observations contained in chapters III and IV of the report of the Commission on its tenth session in performing the functions assigned to it by the Assembly in its resolutions 55 / 61 and 55 / 188 .  
Apart from the advisory services provided by the Cooperative Branch specialists at Headquarters and ILO specialists in the field , the interregional COOPREFORM programme provides assistance in cooperative development policy , cooperative legislation , and cooperative support services , thus addressing the need to create a favourable legal , institutional and administrative environment for the development of genuine , viable cooperatives .  
It is advisable that a single department or office assume central coordinating , focal and liaison functions , of which the following might be most important : elaboration of a single national comprehensive policy in respect of cooperatives , formulation of guidelines for consistent execution throughout government , including monitoring and review of that execution ; collaboration with legal departments in drafting the general and any special laws ; and liaison , consultation and collaboration with the cooperative movement .  
In addition , public sector performance also depends on ( i ) appropriate sectoral policies in key social areas such as health and education ; ( ii ) productive capacity enhancement , depending on a vibrant financial sector ; and ( iii ) the streamlining of legal and regulatory frameworks .  
Political environment : It was broadly acknowledged that conflict prevention and resolution and good governance ( including a reliable , effective , and transparent legal and administrative system ) are indispensable elements for sustainable and people-centered development .  
Taking into account General Assembly resolution 55 / 25 of 15 November 2000 , in which it is stated that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime [ 3 ] constitutes an effective tool and the necessary legal framework for international cooperation in combating such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna , in furtherance of the principles of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the bilateral , regional and multilateral legal instruments and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna by organized criminal groups and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with illicit access to genetic resources and also the extent to which organized criminal groups are involved therein and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .  
The United Nations system should be conscious of these perceptions ; point to the accountability and transparency mechanisms that are built in the functioning of the different agencies ( from the tripartite structure of ILO , to the requirements for parliamentary ratification of World Trade Organization legal instruments ) ; and continue to expand its outreach to all elements of civil society , from parliamentarians and local authorities to professional societies .  
In its concluding observations on the initial report of Kuwait , the Committee noted that the interpretative declaration regarding articles 2 and 3 of the Covenant , which constituted core rights and overarching principles of international law , raised the serious issue of its compatibility with the object and purpose of the Covenant . 44 The Committee found that the interpretative declaration contravene [ d ] the State partys essential obligations under the Covenant and [ was ] therefore without legal effect and [ did ] not affect the powers of the Committee . 
It also decided to limit requests for written information to statistical data ; information requested in the Committees reporting guidelines , but missing from the report ; points of clarification regarding the report ; and information on key legal , structural , policy or institutional issues or new developments .  
Taking into account General Assembly resolution 55 / 25 of 15 November 2000 , in which it is stated that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime [ 11 ] constitutes an effective tool and the necessary legal framework for international cooperation in combating such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna , in furtherance of the principles of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , within existing resources or drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna by organized criminal groups and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to prepare , within existing resources or drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with illicit access to genetic resources and also the extent to which organized criminal groups are involved therein and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .  
Some speakers noted that those and other issues related to the return of funds of illicit origin were the subject of constitutional and other provisions of their domestic legislation and that those issues would need to be addressed by the intergovernmental open-ended expert group to prepare draft terms of reference for the negotiation of an international legal instrument against corruption and the ad hoc committee for the negotiation of such an instrument .  
The Commission invited the intergovernmental open-ended expert group for preparing draft terms of reference for the negotiation of the future legal instrument against corruption , established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 55 / 61 , to take into consideration the observations contained in chapters III and IV of the report of the Commission on its tenth session in performing the functions assigned to it by the Assembly in its resolutions 55 / 61 and 55 / 188 .  
Whereas it is important that initial reports are comprehensive , providing a detailed account of the national legal , administrative and practical system of implementation of the Covenant as requested in the guidelines , it is questionable whether it is useful for the Committee to ask States parties to repeat such information in their periodic reports .  
In future , it will limit requests for written information to statistical data , information requested in the guidelines but missing in the report points of clarification regarding the report , and information on key legal , structural , policy and institutional issues ( for the initial report ) or new developments ( with regard to periodic reports ) .  
With a view to achieving sustainable development of production , the agreements established the need for legal , institutional and financial reforms in order to consolidate a democratic , inclusive , decentralized and participatory State .  
They therefore include commitments on amending the legal framework , strengthening and decentralizing the Ministry of Labour and Social Security , providing occupational training and education , improving social security and expanding its coverage , protecting the most vulnerable categories of workers and promoting collective bargaining and consensus methods of settling labour disputes .  
ILO Convention No . 97 further provides that migrant workers receive treatment no less favourable than that which is applied to nationals with respect to remuneration ; membership in trade unions and the enjoyment of the benefits of collective bargaining ; accommodation ; and social security including legal provision regarding employment injury , maternity , sickness , invalidity , old age , death , unemployment and family responsibilities , and any other contingency which , according to national laws or regulations , is covered by a social security scheme .  
The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child guarantees the rights therein to every child and states further that [ e ] very child shall be entitled to the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms recognized and guaranteed in this Charter irrespective of the childs or his / her parents or legal guardians race , ethnic group , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national and social origin , fortune , birth or other status ( art . 
If we look seriously at the current situation prevailing in the way that outer space is used and other related developments in outer space , it would not be difficult to draw the conclusion that negotiating such an international legal instrument is not merely a necessity , but an urgent necessity in the field of multilateral arms control and disarmament . 
It would be quite a different matter , however , if the real intentions regarding outer space were to flout the obligations of international legal instruments and to seek unilateral and absolute military and strategic superiority based on political , economic and military strength .  
We appeal once again to all countries to negotiate and conclude an international legal instrument on the prevention of the weaponization of and an arms race in outer space , based on strict compliance with existing multilateral and bilateral treaties and agreements applicable to outer space . 
Critical factors to stimulate productive capacity include : stable macro-economic conditions , a conducive legal and regulatory framework , adequate institutional , physical and social infrastructure and a vibrant private sector .  
We resolve to promote increased and equal access for all people to open , efficient , effective and appropriate housing finance , to support savings mechanisms in the informal sector , where appropriate , and to strengthen regulatory and legal frameworks and financial management capacity at all appropriate levels .  
Acknowledging that non-discriminatory legislation and protective laws create a supportive legal and political environment for the success of public health development and national HIV / AIDS prevention efforts , the Latvian Government revised and adopted an adequate legislative infrastructure .  
In this context , encourage that the end results of these cooperative research findings and technologies be owned by all parties to the research , reflecting their relevant contribution and dependent upon their providing legal protection to such findings ; and affirm that all such research should be free from bias ;  
This legal / political controversy , however , belongs not in the debate on terrorism but in debates on which provisions of humanitarian law apply - those governing civil wars or those governing wars identified in article 1.4 of Additional Protocol I . [ 109 ] That debate would have to take into account , of course , the principle of self-determination , as set out in the Charter of the United Nations , human rights instruments and resolutions , with regard to the armed conflict in question . 
While reminding all States of their existing international legal obligations in the field of disarmament , the European Union further urges those States that have not yet done so to accede to the relevant international agreements and instruments designed to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the spread of anti-personnel mines , and further to join in the global effort to prevent the destabilizing accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons , thereby facilitating peaceful cooperation between States , which is crucial to socio-economic development .  
Calls upon States to promote and implement legal provisions and public policies ensuring Roma communities institutional development , their equal enjoyment of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights , their equal access to development resources and their full participation in decision-making process in central and local public administration , as recommended by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in its General Recommendation XXVII entitled Discrimination against Roma .  
Urges States to promote [ strive for ] full and effective equality justice for / to all without discrimination by providing appropriate affirmative action , especially to vulnerable groups victims of discrimination , / by ensuring equity , social justice and fair distribution of aid and community strategies and economic , political and social participation / [ equality of opportunity ] through adoption and exchange of good practices on implementation of legal and policy measures ;  
To guarantee and promote [ strive for ] full and effective equality justice for / to all without discrimination by providing appropriate affirmative action , especially to vulnerable groups victims of discrimination , / by ensuring equity , social justice and fair distribution of aid and community strategies and economic , political and social participation / [ equality of opportunity ] through adoption and exchange of good practices on implementation of legal and policy measures ;  
Urges States to take all necessary measures to address , as a matter of urgency , the pressing requirement for justice for the victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and to ensure that victims have full access to information , support , effective protection and national , administrative and judicial remedies , as well as legal assistance , including the right to seek and receive just and adequate reparation or satisfaction for material and moral damage ;  
One approach , associated with Anzilotti , described the legal consequences deriving from an internationally wrongful act exclusively in terms of a binding bilateral relationship thereby established between the wrongdoing State and the injured State , in which the obligation of the former State to make reparation is set against the subjective right of the latter State to require reparation . 
The Government of Kuwait also provided information on a series of legal , practical and other measures that it had taken , including accession to international conventions , promotion of forms of international cooperation through bilateral agreements , support for regional endeavours and , at the internal level , measures to develop its national legislation and regulations .  
Some serious breaches are distinct legal wrongs in themselves , since the definition of the wrong of itself ensures that only severe or extreme cases are covered ( e.g . genocide , crimes against humanity ) , whereas others are general wrongs which in circumstances of extreme or systematic application may amount to serious breaches which affect all members of the international community . 
Following the Iraqi declaration of a comprehensive and eternal merger with Kuwait , the Security Council in Resolution 662 ( 1990 ) , decided that the annexation had no legal validity , and is considered null and void , and called upon all States , international organizations and specialized agencies not to recognize that annexation and to refrain from any action or dealing that might be interpreted as a recognition of it , whether direct or indirect .  
To ensure that all confiscated , seized or collected small arms and light weapons are destroyed , subject to any legal constraints associated with the preparation of criminal prosecutions , unless another form of disposition or use has been officially authorized , and provided that such weapons have been duly marked and registered .  
To ensure , subject to the respective constitutional and legal systems of States , that the armed forces , police or any other body authorized to hold small arms and light weapons establish adequate and detailed standards and procedures relating to the management and security of their stocks of these weapons .  
To regularly review , subject to the respective constitutional and legal systems of States , where appropriate , the stocks of small arms and light weapons held by armed forces , police and other authorized bodies and to ensure that such stocks declared by competent national authorities to be surplus to requirements are clearly identified , and that programmes for the responsible disposal , preferably through destruction , of such stocks are established and implemented and that such stocks are adequately safeguarded until disposal .  
States are encouraged , subject to their national practices , to enhance , according to their respective constitutional and legal systems , mutual legal assistance and other forms of cooperation in order to assist investigations and prosecutions in relation to the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects .  
ICRC , the organization charged with systematically defending and developing international humanitarian law , argues that armed conflict is one of the key reasons for the lack of food and violations of the right to food , yet the international debate on the right to food has made little reference to international humanitarian law . 23 ICRC argues that humanitarian law contains many provisions that relate to the protection of access to food in armed conflict situations and must therefore be seen as an essential component of the legal framework that protects the right to food . 
Clearly economic , social , cultural and hence nutritional situations tend to be extremely varied from one country to another and a model law would fail to address the problems experienced by people in their everyday lives and produce legislative solutions ill-adapted to legal and political systems in different countries .  
Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be taken by Israel , the occupying Power , that purport to alter the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan are null and void , constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , and have no legal effect ;  
A State may not bring an international claim arising out of an injury to a national , whether a natural or legal person , before the injured national has , subject to Article 15 , exhausted all available local legal remedies in the State alleged to be responsible for the injury .  
It has formulated a national cooperative policy with the primary objective to create solid economic , legal and institutional environment conducive to growth and development of all types of cooperatives in the country .  
The Government considers the success of cooperative development is fully dependent on the ability of cooperatives to overcome difficulties , including : the power of local monopolies ; unpredictable legal , administrative , customs and taxation rules ; lack of professionalism in economic and administrative control ; low level of business discipline ; and corruption .  
The enabling environments component of the framework focuses on government actions , such as fair trade policies , removal of technical , legal and administrative barriers to technology transfer , sound economic policy , regulatory frameworks and transparency , all of which create an environment conducive to private and public sector technology transfer .  
There are also other factors underlying the low levels of foreign direct investment in the least advanced countries : their low productive capacity ; political factors , especially those connected with political instability in those countries ; the concomitant legal insecurity ; their landlocked situation in the case of some countries ; the high cost of transport ; the inadequacy of qualified human resources ; consumer poverty ; extremely low income levels , etc .  
This illegal action , which was authorized by the Israeli high court , aims to alter the legal status and the religious and cultural character of Occupied Jerusalem , in flagrant violation of relevant Security Council resolutions and the fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 1949 . 
It was necessary to promote a broad legal framework that combined adequate recognition of customary law with other instruments of modern law , as well as its adequate protection at the international level .  
[ 27 ] Thus , in the absence of a uniform legal framework , voluntary systems are being developed ( discussed below , paras . 52-62 ) which replicate the functions of the traditional bills of lading and are supported by contractual rules binding on the parties . 
The Ministry calls upon all concerned countries and specialized international organizations to strictly adhere to the legal regime and the constitution of Georgia , which stipulate that the Georgian supreme bodies have the exclusive right to administer a system of environmental protection , as well as legislation on land , minerals and natural resources for the whole territory of Georgia .  
To tackle these problems , the landlocked developing countries need extensive cooperation and assistance from the international community , in order to deal with the complex legal frameworks of the multilateral trading system , their impact on external trade performance and competitiveness and effective participation in WTO negotiations .  
Some members reiterated the importance of the topic and expressed satisfaction with references made in the report to doctrine and judicial decisions on unilateral acts , though it was also stated that additional factual information on the cases cited would be most helpful in analysing the legal validity of unilateral acts .  
Such projects have included peoples sensitization campaigns on indigenous people issues in Chile ; training sessions for school teachers and representatives of social groups in Chile ; the establishment of a centre in Mexico where human rights violations can be reported and which provides legal assistance to vulnerable groups , such as rural populations , street children , prisoners and people living with HIV / AIDS . France Liberts has also been advocating against the death penalty ; a CD-ROM against racism was also produced and distributed among schools and for public awareness purposes . 
As regards FDI and other private external flows , the Programme of Action recognizes that a stable economic , legal and institutional framework is crucial in order to attract foreign investment and to promote sustainable development through investment .  
He further requested that the Working Group pay attention to and report on the emerging standards based on precedent and existing legal instruments by which indigenous peoples and nations were seeking justice and reparations for the past and present abuses of mining and other corporations , including in the home countries of transnational corporations .  
The Advisory Group has also pursued the creation of a legal framework for international urban search and rescue operations , a project that received considerable support from Member States in the recently concluded humanitarian affairs segment of the Economic and Social Council .  
On 31 July 2000 , the Government of Denmark reported that immigrants and refugees generally enjoyed legal equality with Danish citizens and , like all citizens , they were protected by law against discrimination on the basis of race , colour , religious belief , political observation , sexual orientation or national , social or ethnic origin .  
In fact , over the past decade the Conference on Disarmament has focused on the expansion of its membership on a more or less regular basis , thus trying to find a mutually acceptable solution to the legal as well as moral dilemma , created by the existing tension between the limited membership of the Conference on the one hand and the universal scope of its task on the other , to quote Ambassador Hofer of Switzerland , who served as Special Coordinator in 1998 and with whom I had the pleasure to begin my consultations . 
In other words , States that were previously in a position to ensure a legal regime of information exchange at their own internal level find themselves defenceless , in the new situation , against the transmission from abroad to their territory of information which may be unlawful or destructive , including pornography , disinformation , information indicative of racial discrimination or intolerance , information aimed at inciting social , national or religious hatred , information of a subversive nature or information emanating from and serving the interests of international criminal and terrorist groups .  
We must pledge today in a joint , coordinated and concerted way , and for the medium and long term as is expected of this Organization , to fulfil our moral , legal and political obligation to construct , for ourselves and for future generations , a legacy of democracy , freedom , peace and security .  
In designing the global legal framework against terrorism , the complexity and scope of the definition of terrorism should not and must not hinder the international communitys adoption of urgent , practical and effective measures to prevent and punish acts of terrorism and to establish appropriate punishment for their perpetrators .  
It is an act that flagrantly violated a basic , fundamental right on which is based the functioning and entire legal , political , moral and religious structure of our societies and of human coexistence : respect for the right to life of every human being . 
The United Nations must play a crucial role in combating international terrorism by adopting a global strategy that should include clear political , military , diplomatic , economic and legal measures in order to eliminate it . 
It is also extremely urgent that the Conference on Disarmament be reactivated and reach agreement on its programme of work , and that , as the sole multilateral negotiation body , it tackle the essential questions before it , such as the preparation of binding legal instruments on the prohibition of the production of fissile material and the prevention of an arms race in outer space .  
Therefore , besides the legal instruments prohibiting weapons of mass destruction , it is vitally important today for the international community to promote closer cooperation to upgrade the physical protection of nuclear material , combat illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other radioactive sources and enhance the protection and control of nuclear facilities against acts of terrorism and sabotage .  
In a document circulated last year , the Group of 21 stated that the prevention of an arms race in outer space has assumed greater urgency because of legitimate concerns that existing legal instruments are inadequate to deter imminent attempts for the further militarization of outer space .  
Beyond complying with the Tribunal , the Framework Agreement places responsibility on the domestic authorities to undertake crucial measures , including the prosecution , dismissal or transfer , as appropriate , of persons in military , paramilitary and police forces and other public servants , responsible for serious violations of the basic rights of persons belonging to ethnic or minority groups . 2 It is essential to the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina that an adequate legal framework to effect such duties be established .
