increased wages for personnel at institutions ; improved the three social security levels , namely basic living subsidies for laid-off workers at state enterprises , unemployment insurance , and minimum living allowance for city and town dwellers , and the treatment for retirees ; and paid retroactively overdue pensions to retirees at state enterprises in order to boost residents ' purchasing power and expand consumer demand .  
At present , we must make continued efforts to guarantee basic living expenses for staff and workers , who have been laid off by the state-owned enterprises , and must pay in full amount and on schedule both the old-age pension to retired personnel and the minimum living expenses to the urban residents .  We should more rapidly build or refine our social security system ; should build both an unemployment insurance system and an old-age insurance system for the staff and workers ;  
Amid the series of eye-catching reforms of the cadre and personnel system , appointment to posts by competition has become a glittering point , which has opened up people 's vision regarding selection and employment , effectively prevented unhealthy trends in employing people , and reduced to the minimum the phenomenon of " selecting the wrong person " in cadre selection ; it has played a positive role in building a high-quality civil service force and allowing the emergence of more outstanding talent .

During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , our government energetically pushed ahead with the reform of the endowment , unemployment , and medical insurance systems ; made a special point of safeguarding the basic livelihood of employees laid off from state enterprises and ensuring that the pensions for retired employees of enterprises be paid in full , on time ; and developed the " triple-safeguard system , " i.e . the subsistence guarantee system and unemployment insurance system for employees laid off from state enterprises and the minimum livelihood guarantee system for urban residents .  
Those measures significantly strengthened the guarantee mechanism for the basic livelihood of low-income urban dwellers .  By the end of 1999 , the minimum livelihood guarantee system for urban residents had been established in all cities at and above the prefectural level and the seats of county-level people 's governments nationwide .  
We should gradually establish and perfect the basic pension insurance system and basic medical insurance system for urban workers , the unemployment insurance system , and the system for ensuring minimum living necessities for urban residents , and speed up the formation of a social security system with a variety of fund sources , regulated security systems , and socialized management and services .  
At the same time , the level of social security for low-income people in society will be raised by a big margin , and this will be aimed mainly at increasing incomes for workers and staff members laid off by state-owned enterprises , retired personnel , and those receiving special care from the state in order to enable them to keep a minimum living standard and to maintain social stability .  
Over the past few years , our country has made much headway in furthering a social security structural reform in light of such needs as developing a socialist market economy ; has preliminarily established a basic old-age security system , a basic medical security system , an unemployment security system for staff and workers of urban enterprises , and a minimum livelihood security system for urban residents ; and has laid down a basic framework for a social security system .
