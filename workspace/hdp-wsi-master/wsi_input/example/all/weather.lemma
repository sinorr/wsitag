He Xiaohong , a senior engineer with the autonomous region 's meteorological bureau , said such weather phenomenon was formed due to a recent significant cold air current coming southward down from the north of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau . When it merged with the warm northward up current from the Indian Ocean between the Mount Nyainqentanglha and the Himalayas , rain or sleet was formed .  
It is said there was one hour of heavy rainfall over the airport between 8:00-9:00am on the 10th , accompanied by thunderstorm and strong wind .  It was impossible to guarantee normal taking off and landing of flights with such weather .  Affected by this , over 2,000 passengers in total were held up on that day .  
But with unfavorable terrain and weather conditions , it was impossible to effectively attack mobile tactical targets and concealed targets at such altitudes , let alone tell genuine and false targets apart .  
Just before the battle the training emphasized technical and tactical training for individual soldiers and small sections , and importance was also attached to coordination between different branches and joint training of major units ; at the same time the topography and weather conditions of the training areas were as far as possible similar to those of the target area .  
However , the FRY also took advantage of the battlefield environment , including the complex topography of the country , the dense vegetation , and the extremely variable weather conditions to make it difficult for NATO 's reconnaissance and bombing to be effective , and they actually destroyed or damaged numerous U.S . planes , including an F-117 stealth fighter .  
In future regional wars , our strong adversaries who possess high-tech weaponry may engage us in aerial battles with their superior technology .  These battles will be abrupt and decisive .  Our adversaries will go all out to seize the initiative by taking full advantage of nighttime and complex weather conditions .  
and conduct a trial of wisdom and courage with the " enemy " forces by displaying super combat skills whenever needed under such odious conditions as unbearably hot weather , unknown terrain , lack of cooked food , and so on .  The exercise command center revealed that the training exercise would surpass a scout contest of an international standard in terms of arduousness , intensity , and danger .  
According to CMB , the " collective and numerical weather forecast system " , which was built using the " Shenwei " Computer , was a major key project in the state 's " Ninth Five-Year Plan " .  Thanks to its successful development , our country has entered the world 's advanced ranks in major meteorological application , and has become one of a few countries in the world to perform collective forecasts .  
They aim for the target of accomplishing combat task requirements without going through real battle training and without replenishing personnel and equipment .  Through reform of flight training , this unit has realized new breakthroughs in combat strength in the following five areas .  In the area of basic flight skill training , flying has been evolved from normal conditions to flying under bad weather conditions or under other extreme conditions .  
In the drill , on one hand , this department attached prime importance to theoretical study , scientifically analyzed and evaluated the present situation of the theater 's support capacity , especially its own units , and comprehensively grasped the characteristics of the theater 's topography , weather , social situation , popular feelings , and the actual conditions of the equipment and combat readiness , and provided guidance for troops ' practical work .  
Equipped with such a portable tent , a patrol or inspection team is capable of taking a rest or staying in an area at any time , should it fail to reach a destination in time or encounter bad weather , and this has also enhanced the regiment 's control over some key areas or sandy areas , to which access is difficult .  
The frozen river had begun melting , and the grass had begun sprouting , for the weather had turned warm .  However , after leaving their barracks , the recruits had no time to watch the natural scenery , for they knew that countless hardships and difficulties were waiting for them on their way forward .  
Yunnan Province has rich tourism resources as it has beautiful natural scenes and pleasant weather .  There are many scenic spots and a rich variety of cultural features and customs of minority ethnic groups .  All this is huge economic potential to be tapped .  
The armed helicopters conceal themselves by using complicated weather conditions , and make a sudden attack by conducting low-altitude flights and hedgehopping .  The armed helicopters land behind the " enemy " lines , and transport special task forces to press straight on the important target when conducting sabotage operations behind the enemy lines .  This kind of sudden attack is commonly seen in modern warfare , and is called figuratively as the " surgical operation " on the combat field .  
Through repeated drills , the pilots have explored ways to cleverly avoid enemies by using such unfavorable weather conditions as before dawn , at dusk , and at dark night , and mastered various skills of rapid and precise landing on a multiple points , and coordination between helicopters and the special task forces on the ground to launch an assault against the enemy .  
They began another consecutive , intensified , night flight training exercise under bad weather conditions .  The training was based on the following scenario : They experienced defeats before .  They want to enhance their continuous fighting capability by improving their almost-real combat training .  
These programs include interception attacks under bad conditions of poor visibility , fighting in the clouds , and fighting in the rain .  They also have organized night training programs with high difficulty and great dynamics under complicated weather conditions .  As a result , they have improved their overall capability in conducing continuous fighting at night .  
The mainland 's military media reported yesterday that the Air Force fleet of the Nanjing Military Region recently conducted an airborne long-distance contingency drill based on actual battle requirements .  The troops overcame difficulties arising from changes in weather conditions and an unfamiliar flight route and airport , and carried out a remarkable mock attack on the " enemy 's " radar , thereby realizing a successful first-entry , first-discovery , first-attack , and first-hit .  
All leading pilots of this division unit are commanding officers and instructors capable of dealing with " four kinds " of weather .  With their perfect command of flying technology , they were on the forefront of training reform and achieved breakthrough progress in a number of reform tasks .  They resolved in succession scores of technical problems in training such as long-distance striking operations and urgent dispatch of large groups of aircraft , and succeeded in promoting the deepening of combat tactics training and enhancing the troops ' capability in air warfare .  
A certain airborne unit has put the emphasis of its airborne training reform this year on having a communications support from an officially and systematically organized , well-equipped follow-up airborne signal unit .  It has organized parachute jumping training programs for officers and men of signal unit , including fully armed individual jumping , fully armed and heavy-load unit jumping , and field communications support training in complex terrain and adverse weather conditions .  
They have also dispatched the fleet to the sea to conduct test training in different sea areas and under different weather conditions .  They have successively completed more than 30 difficult training courses , including replenishment in rocky areas at night , round-the-clock comprehensive supplies from all directions , replenishment in strong waves and winds , and joint logistical replenishment tasks by military and civilian vessels .  
To make a breakthrough in this logistical support at sea , this base has organized missile technology experts and officers and men of battleships and logistical support ships to jointly study various operational measures for overcoming adverse weather conditions and formulated scientific plans on missile replenishment .  
We can still expect the national economic growth rate for the whole year to reach or exceed the 7 percent target that was determined early this year , provided that the global economy does not deteriorate further , weather conditions are basically normal , and the policy for macroeconomic regulation and control is implemented rather well .  
Thus far , pilots of this flight squadron have independently fulfilled the highly difficult tasks of two planes flying parallel at night , landing under the guidance of airport lights , and flying at night in extremely complicated weather .  As a result , the night flexible operation capacity of this squadron has been enhanced greatly .  
It can move : it can carry special combat operations elements , exploit the cover of complex weather and climatic conditions , break through defenses at low and extra low altitude , and conduct destructive combat operations in the enemy 's rear .  
In view of southwest China 's complex terrains , changeable climates , and harsh environments , they have trained a number of " all-weather " contingency units that have strong weaponry support - - through setting up courses that train units for highland operations with long-range weaponry support in the theater under inclement weather conditions .  Meanwhile , they have come up with new operational and training methods that meet the needs of actual operations and the special features of new weaponry .  
In accordance with the requirements of actual combat , the division has vigorously developed and strengthened its training .  It conducted successfully for the first time a tactical bombing training program in the small hours of the morning .  It has increased the proportion and intensity of training in highly difficult programs such as landing in adverse weather and through the use of marking lights .  
Beijing Municipality in recent years has achieved new vistas in revolution and liberalization , and its economic development is flourishing .  The standard of living of the people has been steadily rising , and there have been many positive changes in the face of the city , with more parks , green spaces , and beautification projects being undertaken .  The city 's air quality has also improved , opening the way for some new weather phenomena there .  
Since early June , the larger part north of the Huang He has experienced a hot weather with hardly any rain .  During this period , high temperatures lasted for several consecutive days in northwest China , north China , northeast China , as well as the Huang He and Huai He regions , worsening the drought that began to break out in north and northwest China in the spring of this year and causing the drought in the western part of northeast China to drastically deteriorate .  
To guarantee the quality of maritime training , the Nanjing Military Region organized leaders of all units to check the areas scheduled for maritime training and formulated careful training plans on the basis of comprehensively mastering the regular weather patterns , the morning and evening tides , the sea currents , and the characteristics of beaches and coastal sea beds .  
The Taiwan public believes that " diplomatic relations " established on " money " are like " fair weather friends , " and will not last long .  Moreover , the " financial aid " countries are all weak and backward countries , and are of absolutely no use .  
He also disclosed : The flight squadrons currently stationed in the southeast coastal region are all crack troops with the most advanced equipment and weaponry in the Chinese air force , the most superb military technology , and the pilots with the greatest wealth of experience that can take off and conduct operations in all weather .  
In a training preview , after a new-model fighter plane took off , the weather suddenly turned nasty , and soon , the base was covered with thunder and lightning .  For the sake of safety , the fighting eagle turned to another airfield on the southeast coast and landed there .  
In winning the award , Dr Lam was cited for his outstanding services and distinguished contributions to the Hong Kong Observatory which has committed itself for over a hundred years to natural disaster prevention and promoting public awareness and emergency preparedness through the provision of timely warnings to the community , thereby minimizing the loss of life and damage to property due to severe weather . 
Apart from the key components of upper air sounding , weather radars , wind profilers and oceanographic observations , an automatic weather station network located in the Pearl River Delta area ( see attached diagram ) will also be mobilized to collect the necessary surface data .  
Banks ' finances are generally healthy and well cushioned , the Government holds substantial fiscal and foreign exchange reserves and is not burdened by any public debt , the corporate sector is slimming and rationalising its operations for greater efficiency and competitiveness , the labour force is adapting promptly to more stringent employment conditions , inflation is moderating , and the economy as a whole is displaying the profound flexibility that is indeed required for it to weather the present difficulties . 
Members of the public are reminded to continue to be on the alert in the prevention of cholera as the current hot and humid weather in Hong Kong provides optimum condition for the growth and spread of the bacteria .  
" In the coming rainy seasons , the Observatory will give , to the extent possible , some advance indication of the issuance of warnings and signals so that people will have sufficient time to take precautions against severe weather .  " We have maintained the thrust on development works aimed at improving the forecasting of heavy rains in the coming rainy season , " he said .  
The weather was fine and sunny on April 13 but it became cloudy with some light rain patches again that evening as an intense replenishment of the northeast monsoon reached the south China coastal areas .  Winds strengthened from the east and persisted the next day .  
To ensure that the relocation exercise was implemented smoothly , the company set up a Focus Group comprising representatives of both management and staff well in advance of the target date .  Surveys were conducted to collect the employees ' views on various issues of concern to them such as transport arrangement , working hours , the new working environment , procedural changes , structural changes , arrangement during inclement weather etc .  
A cold front crossed the south China coastal areas on the morning of November 1 .  It brought a few rain patches to the New Territories . Winds strengthened from the north and the weather was mainly cloudy .  
He pointed out that since the 1980s , the HKO had been using solar energy to power remote automatic weather stations which helped to give early warnings on impending weather such as tropical cyclones , heavy rain , high wind and cold fronts .  
However , based on intelligence , experience and alertness of the force , when suspicious consignments were found aboard cross-boundary lorries , the officers would check them thoroughly , sometimes even have to dig into the inner compartment by unloading the cargoes onto the examination compound , " she added .  Despite the heavy workload and unfavourable weather conditions , the working spirit of the task force has been regularly sharpened by the good progress of cases or hefty court punishments .  
The larger year-on-year decrease in the Composite CPI in August 2001 than in July 2001 was mainly attributable to a fall in the prices of basic foodstuffs .  In particular , the prices of fresh vegetables eased back distinctly in August , from a relatively high level in July as supply was disrupted by the rainy weather .  
A weak cold front arrived at the south China coastal areas on October 4 .  The weather in Hong Kong turned hazy at first and became cloudy with thundery showers in the afternoon .  Around 80 millimetres of rainfall were recorded over parts of the Lantau Island .  
There is a strong need for an authoritative source of official weather information produced by national meteorological services ( NMSs ) who operate the WMO-regulated worldwide weather observing network .  
The champion Mr KO Sum-yuen said the winning design was based on cute and adorable children characters .  Their bona fide characteristics symbolise issuance of authentic weather reports by the Observatory and bring out the caring image of the Observatory .  
" The third principle is Accessibility and Comfort . The pedestrian walkways should be easily accessible , free from pollution , and properly designed with landscaping , weather protection installations and seating facilities to provide a comfortable and pleasant walking environment .  
With an active trough of low pressure lingering over the vicinity of the south China coast for about two thirds of the month , the weather of June was marked by persistent heavy rain and thunderstorms .  The monthly rainfall amounted to 1083.6 millimetres , about three times the normal figure .  
The remaining project is located in a public housing estate and is delayed due to rainy weather and unforeseen technical difficulties in piling .  HD has taken follow-up actions and will closely monitor the progress .  
In view of the prevailing humid and hot weather , the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department ( FEHD ) strongly urged the public to remain vigilant to mosquito breeding and the spread of mosquito transmitted diseases like dengue fever , a spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department ( FEHD ) advised today ( May 22 ) .  
In view of the persistent hot and humid weather , members of the public should remain vigilant to the spread of mosquito-transmitted diseases like dengue fever and should spare no effort in the removal of stagnant water to curb mosquito breeding .  
( a ) The high Air Pollution Index ( API ) readings recorded at the Tung Chung air monitoring station in August and September this year were due to high concentrations of ozone formed and accumulated in the Pearl River Delta Region and Hong Kong when we were under the influence of tropical cyclones with hot and sunny weather , and almost stagnant wind .  
" We still can not rule out the possibility of sporadic cases of dengue fever even during the cooler seasons , as mosquitoes can breed and grow if the weather is mild and wet , " he said , adding that heavy rainfalls were recorded last week , which provided a favourable environment for mosquito breeding .  
These meteorological authorities are responsible for operating the official world-wide weather observing network regulated by the WMO . They are the ones who have first-hand weather information from the front line .  Therefore , they are the most authoritative source of weather forecasts in their regions of responsibility .  
Forecasts in this web page are based on the official weather information provided by national meteorological authorities .  Apart from text , the information is also presented in simple graphic for easy appreciation .  
Currently , weather information gathered from local automatic weather stations are made available real-time on the Internet . The public can access the information and make decisions best suited to their specific circumstances .  A detailed and timely weather information service like this is among the best in the world .  
As the Hong Kong Observatory issued the very hot weather warning today ( July 6 ) , the Department of Health ( DH ) advised members of the public , particularly those engaged in outdoor activities , to take measures to prevent heat stroke in view of the prevailing hot weather .  
" Since the prevailing weather conditions are favourable to mosquito breeding , all local residents should keep drains free of blockages , make sure all ground surfaces are level and conduct regular inspections to eradicate all breeding grounds for mosquitoes in Tin Shui Wai .  
Amid the beautiful scenery and mild weather in this secluded paradise , the residents , who are mostly farmers , can enjoy a simple life which is enhanced by the most modern material conveniences .  
Sunbathers and swimmers flock to the protected waters of the bay all year round , drawn by the balmy weather and clear waters . K'enting Gardens lie nestled in the hills above the Nanwan . They were established during the days of the Japanese occupation .  
Fresh seafood is arranged in front of Temple Entrance restaurants , where the customers can select their own seafood and have it prepared to their taste . Others may prefer to buy spring rolls , rice cakes , curry or noodle dishes , tempura , or oyster omelets at the smaller stands , and top them off with a dessert of traditional sweets or luscious pre-cut fruits . Keelung , whether by means of bright new public construction or traditional local color , has managed to overcome the original drab appearance caused by its rainy weather .  
Six years ago , on a windy winter afternoon , three friends , Ch'en Ch'ing-hui , a diver , Yue Li-jen , a surfer , and Chan Chi-hung , an avid sailor , were strolling on a deserted beach decrying the unpleasant weather conditions which were too windy for surfing , and too wavy for sailing . Suddenly , from the distance they spied an apparition-like scene - - a smooth riding craft skimming across the rolling breakers .  
In earlier days , the majority of schools and athletic centers in the ROC surfaced their tracks and baseball diamonds with either crushed brick or cinder . In fair weather the air was filled with dust and grit and when it rained the surfaces were pocked with puddles , causing numerous headaches and much inconvenience for their users .  
Rainy , humid weather is required for frogs to lay their eggs . Because winter is southern Taiwan 's dry season , the Taipei tree frog is found only in mountainous areas under 1,000 meters in altitude north of Nantou County . Their mating season is from October to April .  
Springtime in the south of China has but a few days of warm sunlight and gentle breezes ; soon the weather turns cloudy or cold , burying that rare and precious fragrance .  
Having passed from a typical transient psychology to hopes of settling down permanently , and now again to thoughts of moving away , Tahitian Chinese will probably waver between the mindsets of a naturalized native and a transient resident for many years to come . Their story over the past hundred years , of crossing the seas to seek a better life , continues to play itself out . Fortunately , the latest generation of Tahitian Chinese are in a much better position than their forebears were to make a rational choice and to weather the storm . (  
Today seven teams with 29 members are active in 12 farming areas . Their agenda includes experimental cultivation of crops such as maize , paddy rice and sorghum ; soil and weather surveys to establish the suitability of crops ; hydrological and topographical surveys to establish data for irrigation and drainage projects ; and social surveys to learn more about the farming population 's willingness to work and their technical level .  
Out here in the mountains the air 's fresh and pleasant all year round , on a clear day you can see Mt . Kuanyin and in rainy weather all the luxuriant vegetation looks just wonderful . " Co-planner with her husband of the " Chinese Style Promotion Centre , " Yang Wen-yuan says they 'd always admired the leisurely lifestyle of the old Chinese literati , so they 're happy to put up with the inconvenience to enjoy a breath of fresh air .  
Before the discovery of the microscope , and before " ecological observation " became popular , when our ancestors saw these insects emerge from soft earth and light up , they imagined that the firefly was a metamorphosis from rotting leaves or decaying bamboo . The saying , " On summer nights , rotting grass turns into fireflies , " was a natural result of observing transformations as the weather changed from season to season .  
It seems that Taichung has now become the " great grey mullet harbor . " This is also related to the fact that the cold fronts have not been able to come further southward . Improvements in fishing gear over the past few years , such as two boats cooperating to create a single large trap , increasing the horsepower of fishing boat motors , and improvements in two-way radios , have enabled the work of catching the fish in winter , unattainable in recent years , to go along swimmingly in the warmer weather .  
During the warm period prior to the ice age , which is to say at the same time that the Han Chinese legend of Hou Yi ( who shot down nine of the ten suns with his bow and arrow ) was said to take place , the Taiya version has it that another sun appeared in the sky . There were two suns , one above and one below , so that the distinction between day and night was lost . The weather became oppressively hot , and illnesses spread rampantly ; all living things faced extinction .  
When the R . O . C . film The Wedding Banquet won top honors at the Berlin Film Festival , another feast for film lovers was opening back home . The films on offer here were black and white : pure and clean , yet warm and sweet . After a spell of cold and wet weather , the sun finally shows his face .  
And on sweltering summer days , people gather here to enjoy the cool shade . True , when that hard and cold cement road was paved just beyond the reach of its roots , it was a little uncomfortable , but for the most part it had nothing much to complain about . Enjoying largely mild weather , it has dug its roots deep and firm .  
For a long time , the WCB has only built wall-type dikes which stand perpendicular to the surface . In the past the main purpose of the sea dikes was to prevent intense waves brought by bad weather from heading inland . Today the coast suffers from the effects of inland gravel extraction and ground water extraction and is continually eroding .  
A heavy load of paper work , mostly administrative in nature , stirred in him strong feelings of nostalgia for the simple life he led as a straight weather forecaster . Hence , when a television station invited him to serve primarily as a weather forecaster , this tallied with his special interests , and after only a moment 's reflection he agreed .  
The section chief of the division for agricultural weather forecasts , Liu Fu-cheng , nicknamed " the old turtle , " has known Jen Li-yu for thirty years as classmate , fellow conscript , and colleague . He laughingly commented on the fact that Jen Li-yu was a mild-mannered civil servant , always meek and always humble . But because the timbre of his voice was clear and resonant , far more so than the average , he gained enormous popularity .  
Apparently the work of weather forecaster was divided into 12 hr . shifts on a rotational basis . And every five persons constituted a section , administered and governed by a head forecaster . After Jen Li-yu was promoted to serve as head forecaster , an unexpected turn of events turned him overnight into a star media performer . At the time , the Chinese Television System had decided to arrange a more factual and scientific weather forecast after the evening news broadcast .  
And very recently , with the arrival of spring , climatic conditions are highly unstable , so it is very difficult to ascertain whether it will rain or not . After his weather forecasts have turned out to be totally incorrect , a patient afflicted with bronchitis could not resist calling up TTV in order to complain . " Jen Li-yu 's ability to forecast the weather is not half as accurate as my own bronchial tubes . "  
He explains that the animal world , because of the proliferation of varieties , must be rigidly economical with resources and efficient in distribution . During cloudy weather , therefore , ever-teeming honey bees can only consume foodstuff stored in the hive ; lacking provisions of pollen , their mood naturally turns less benevolent . " They lose their temper " and attack people . " I can understand their emotional disposition , " he says .  
Lots of people listen to the weather report every day , but you probably did n't know that the Central Weather Bureau operates an astronomical observatory which is not devoted to predicting the weather . It is responsible for calculating the precise timing of the 24 Solar Terms of the Chinese calendar every year . And after examining the data , the Ministry of the Interior includes it in the annual farmer 's almanac , distributed every year to each agricultural worker .  
The original content of the 24 Solar Terms was very simple , but over many years , they slowly developed into focal points for an extremely fertile cultural milieu . They are guides to farming life , reference dates for weather forecasting and holidays for all sorts of ceremonial activities . Almanacs , the weather , agriculture , the general life of the community - - all abide under the shadow of the Solar Terms !  
At this time the autumn farming activities went into a phase of decline , and in the north the weather turned cold . There was always some fear that barbarian tribes might " descend south to graze their horses . " At this time everyone began to brush up on their martial skills , even actively going out to kill the barbarians or steal the fat horses and goats that they raised !  
In terms of meteorological significance , Solar Terms can at most indicate ' the most probable period of sunlight , ' " states Wu Ming-chin . If the weather is favorable , planting according to the Solar Terms will yield the most abundant harvest . Luckily , the Solar Terms are still quite popular among farmers , who are not accustomed to calculating so precisely .  
In northern Taiwan all the old farmers can recite the saying " Before the Awakening of Insects , do n't plant rice seedlings . " This is because the weather around the Awakening of Insects is just beginning to warm up but can still be a little chilly . If the first crop of seedlings is frozen by a late cold spell , then the farmers ' labors will be left unrewarded .  
It has temperate zone grasses , beautiful and imposing Precipices , an elegant volcanic crater lake , and the delightful Tsui Tsui Valley . But after it was placed within the conservation area of the park , the trails became overgrown . With the treacherous weather brought by the northeast winds six months a year added in , many cases of people losing their way are reported .  
When I was very little , I often heard some old folks mention a Place called Kuoyeh , on the east shores of Penghu [ the principal island of the Penghuarchipelago , traditionally referred to in English as the Pescadores ] . At dawnwhen the weather is good , one can stand on the east edge of the village and gazing across the distant waters catch a glimpse of the towering mountains of the main island of Taiwan , rising up to the east .  
But recently , at the request of international organizations , the Directorate General of Telecommunications set up a weather balloon station on the island to monitor the upper atmosphere . To ensure that the data gathered is valid and accurate , the directorate also shipped a generator to the island to supply the equipment with electricity at a stable voltage .  
Normally such a ritual would not be performed during Ghost Month ( the seventh lunar month ) , out of consideration for the " good brothers " ( " homeless " spirits ) who are only allowed out into the world for this one month every year . But Li Jen-chi consulted Alimu and obtained a special dispensation . she has never doubted Alimu 's power . 12 August , Saturday , weather cloudy with scattered showers .  
It 's a long read homeThe weather tended to be hot and dry , and the road went from being asphalt or grass to an uneven stone surface , strewn with pot-holes . As they rushed their journey both day and night , the elephants ' feet quickly blistered and tore , even becoming infected and festering .  
This is the time of year when the weather is affected by cold high-pressure areas from the continent . These create sharp differences in temperature , generating strong upward currents . Also , humidity is low , and there is less concern about rain caused by hot air currents running into cold air at high altitudes .  
On one occasion , a KMT candidate in the southern part of the island held an outdoor rally , but cold weather kept voters at home . Fortunately the 80-plus strong overseas support group showed up , saving the candidate from a rather embarrassing situation .  
This type of technology does n't require the user to have any special input-output devices to block out the real environment . Instead it employs the so-called " blueboard technique " using cameras . It makes a composite of images shot of the user along with computer generated virtual world images so that people can see themselves acting within the setting on the screen . One use for this is already visible in the weather programs of Taiwan 's three main TV stations .  
Satellites , in accordance with their different functions and missions , can be divided into five categories : scientific satellites are used to conduct scientific research in space ; surveillance satellites are used to obtain military intelligence ; resource satellites collect information on global resources ; weather satellites monitor atmospheric conditions and collect information for meteorological prediction ; and finally communication satellites , which are in high demand for their wide range of communication applications .  
As the southern weather turns hot and stuffy , the ducks , missing the spring breezes which they need for their breeding season , grow bored and their hormones subside . At the same time , spring is gradually spreading across the north , melting the Earth 's icy veil . With natural enemies there few in number but food plentiful , one after the other the ducks and geese start to return home .  
After cold fronts pass through , however , bird associations are always telling bird watchers to rush off to the seashore and mouths of rivers . If their luck is good , they may be able to see wild geese blown off course by the rough weather .  
The most novel interpretation of the tales of love between immortals and regular human beings appears in a book published in Taiwan , in which the author argues that the denizens of heaven are sapped of their sex drive by perpetually fair weather , beautiful clothing , delectable food , and centuries of living at a metabolic rate of zero .  
Most of the plants used by Taiwan 's herbalists come from mainland China . This makes both the supply and the quality unstable because the same plant grown in different regions , or under different weather and climatic conditions , will produce different medicinal effects . This makes necessary the use of biotechnology in the artificial cultivatation of Chinese herbal medicines .  
When Sun wore a long jacket while shooting a music video , people could tell how excited she was at wearing a winter coat for the first time . At that moment , Taiwan did n't seem to be that far from Singapore , despite the latter 's endless summer weather . We all could sense a young woman 's joy at being accepted in foreign land that seemed at once familiar and exotic .  
Typhoon Trami , a " mini " typhoon with a radius of just 100 km , closed in on southern Taiwan on July 11 . The storm had been downgraded to a tropical depression by the time it passed over land that evening , but no sooner had the typhoon warning been lifted than the ensuing weather system unleashed a torrential downpour on Kaohsiung , causing the worst flooding in the city 's history .  
In fact , " freak " Typhoon Nari seems very much to fit the trend of climate change . Liao Chung-ming , director of National Taiwan University 's department of atmospheric sciences , says that with global warming , extreme and unusual weather patterns will occur with increasing frequency .  
Although the seminar was held in early November , the weather in Kinmen was still warm and sunny , with a sky so blue you could practically reach up and squeeze the water out of it . Scattered here and there amidst newly constructed five-story apartment blocks were traditional southern Fujian-style homes , with their rounded roof ridges and flying eaves . If it were n't for the camouflaged bunkers scattered all over the island , one might well have forgotten that the area once reeked of gunpowder and was stationed with 100,000 troops .  
When the weather in Taiwan 's low-lands begins to gradually turn cool , in the island 's high mountains the mercury is already plummeting , and all kinds of living things are getting ready for their winter rest . But despite the cold , high up on Mt . Hehuan , Yushan , Mt . Ali and elsewhere one can often see a unique Taiwanese bird species-the collared bush robin-hopping busily along the ground alone in search of food , like a solitary little knight-errant .  
According to the IPCC : " Global warming is not a smooth , gradual shift . It is possible that just as at the end of the last ice age , there may be an unusual and dramatic jump , and a great increase in the frequency of disasters such as storms , tidal surges , torrential rainfall , drought and extensive forest fires , caused by aberrant weather . "  
A study of weather data from the last 100 years that the National Science Council commissioned from a number of local universities revealed that Taiwan 's average temperature has increased by 1-1.4 �X C over the last century . While this increase was greater than the 0.6 �X C increase in average global temperature , it was in line with the increase in the average surface temperature on land . However , Taiwan 's summer temperatures have risen more than its winter temperatures , indicating a trend towards the hot getting hotter .  
Early flowering seasons in Yang - mingshan , mullet failing to swim south after the winter solstice , dengue fever crossing the Tropic of Cancer , unusual butterfly migrations , coral bleaching . . . . Global warming is blamed for rising sea levels , freak weather and frequent floods , but is it also responsible for some of the unusual phenomena in Taiwan 's natural world in recent years ?  
In fact it is not unusual for a change of seasons to occasionally come early or late and upset the sequence of nature , and it is quite common for plants to be fooled by the weather . In ancient times farmers were aware that " if a fruit tree that normally flowers in spring blossoms in autumn , it will not set fruit . "  
During the daytime the sunlight in a cockpit can be blinding , so it must be possible for the monitor to be adjusted to extreme brightness , otherwise the screen will just be a sheet of white . Indeed , whether it is the black of night or the middle of a lightning storm , all kinds of weather conditions and topography are variables in the use of instruments in flight , and must be carefully considered .  
In winter , the northeast monsoon makes for cold and wet weather with frequent fog and gusting rains on the northern side of the pass , while the southern side stays clear and dry . The very distinct climates make for radically different kinds of vegetation on the two sides of the pass .  
He once broke out with dermatitis while working on the eve of Chinese New Year . His entire body turned red and swelled , itching set in , and he had to soak all evening in a tub despite the cold winter weather . While everyone else was enjoying the most festive night of the year , Lai suffered through the bleakest New Year 's Eve of his life .  
As the old Chinese saying goes , " weather has unexpected twists ; fortunes can turn in a day . " Just one example : A man living in Taipei City 's Anping Borough who supported his family by cleaning building exteriors lost his footing in January and fell to his death , leaving behind a disabled wife and three young children . There was n't even enough money for the funeral , and the fatherless family suddenly found itself in the direst of straits .  
But in less than half an hour , the calm weather changed drastically . A violent wind blew in laden with snow . The Russian pilot , experienced in polar transportation and supply , decided to withdraw immediately . On hearing the shouts of the other crewmembers the groups that were dispersed around the pole taking photos raced toward the helicopter .  
He does n't rest easy until his ink has finished drying . In Taiwan , the best time of year for making ink runs from the eighth month of the lunar calendar through the second month of the following year , when the weather is relatively cool and there is little rain . The best ink is made in the winter because the ink blocks shrink in the cold , dry quickly , and keep their shape .  
It was only then that I learned hot showers are regarded as an extravagance . On the very highest point of the north peak , the weather station is almost entirely dependent on rain and snowfall for its water . When the Japanese first built the station in 1943 they constructed a water storage tank in the basement , designed to hold ten tons of water . Unfortunately , the tank is now old and cracked , and leaks so badly it can only hold two or three tons at a time .  
Before climbing Yushan I had been told there were several professional photographers staying at the weather station . One of them , Li Tai-chun , discussed his photographic experience with me . In 1990 CWB chief Tsai Ching-yen visited Yushan , where he saw a particularly stunning sunset over a sea of clouds . This made him consider the possibility of producing an Yushan calendar filled with such breathtaking vistas , and Yushan Weather Station was put in charge of the project .  
The data collected by low-elevation weather stations lacks detailed information on high altitude cloud cover and air current changes , among other things . Although it is now possible to use satellite technology , high-altitude weather balloons and other advanced technology to measure the temperature , air pressure and humidity at high altitudes , the collection of data on such things as visibility , cloud type and cloud height depends on visual observation and can not be achieved by automated instruments .  
Apart from its high altitude , the Yushan Weather Station is also located on the Tropic of Cancer . This is a special location combining high altitude with low longitude , precisely where the Pacific and continental air masses interact . That means meteorological data observed here has an important reference value for local weather forecasts .  
Whenever heavy weather approaches , Taiwan 's beautiful landscape is increasingly marred by fear . The typhoon also flooded the city of Sanchung , Taipei County for the first time in over 30 years , after contractors cut corners in the construction of a subway line . The government now faces a compensation bill of NT $ 2 billion . The incident holds lessons for us all .  
They attributed the crisis , one of the most severe agricultural disasters in southern Africa over the past 10 years , to " the area 's weakened farm production and supply after two years of production decline caused by bad weather coupled with economic crisis and the suspension of agricultural activities in some areas . "  
He explained that the meeting of transient cold weather and warm and damp air mass , which is comparatively active this winter , has brought about the two snowfalls , which are bound to bring down the temperature in the Beijing area  
MACAO , December 13 ( Xinhua ) It is expected to be cloudy and cool with intermittent sunshine on Dec 20 , the day when Macao returns to China after being ruled by the Portuguese for more than 150 years , according to a weather forecast released by the local meteorological station today  
Development is not sustainable if 17 hurricanes are to trample through our region each year ; yet climate experts have given us notice that the phenomenon known as global warming will generate a greater number of extreme weather events , more ferocious and monstrous in each succeeding year . 
Since 1959 , the scope and importance of space applications have expanded from a narrow field of science and technology to a wide range of applications that are essential to operational communications , weather forecasting , resource management , prevention and mitigation of disaster , environmental monitoring and other social and economic activities in virtually every country .  
In recognition of the vital role of national meteorological services in providing warnings of severe weather events to the community , WMO 's Public Weather Services Programme includes specific projects directed at strengthening the capacities of national meteorological services and in raising the awareness and level of public understanding about the services provided .  
El Ni �� is a warm inshore current annually flowing south along the coast of Ecuador around the end of December and extending about every 7 to 10 years down the coast of Peru ; it can bring devastating weather to several global regions , including heavy rains and flooding as well as colder than normal winters across the United States , and severe droughts and dust storms in Australia .  
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) reported that the 1995 agricultural season has been significantly more successful than had been anticipated , in part because of both favourable weather conditions and the timely provision of agricultural support by the international donor community .  
Data acquired by meteorological satellites are used in global atmospheric and ocean models for numerical weather prediction and environmental quality assessment , as well as climate monitoring and medium-range , long-range , seasonal and multi-seasonal climate prediction .  
There were currently four types of lidar systems under development : ( a ) the back scatter lidar , with a wide range of possible applications in meteorology and climatology ; ( b ) the differential absorption lidar ( DIAL ) , which could provide precise measurements of atmospheric humidity , temperature and pressure ; ( c ) the Doppler lidar , with the capability of improved weather forecasting and applications in global atmospheric studies ; and ( d ) the ranging and altimeter lidar , which could provide very accurate measurements of Earth 's surface features .  
As we have indicated , three of them are out of service for lack of essential spare parts , which are supposed to be exempt from the provisions of resolution 748 ( 1992 ) for humanitarian reasons , and because of their advanced age and constant need of maintenance . inclement weather .  
Barring adverse weather conditions , the progress made in enhancing political and social stability in some countries and the benefits accruing from the impact of domestic economic-policy reforms , coupled with favourable developments in the international economic environment , lead to estimates of regional growth in output of 2.9 per cent in 1996 , as against 2.3 per cent in 1995 .  
In this regard , operative paragraph 4 of today 's draft resolution ( S / 1996 / 1002 ) is essential because close cooperation between the Government of Haiti and international financial institutions is expected to permit the mobilization of additional financial support to assist the economic , social and institutional development which is so needed for Haiti to weather the winds of instability .  
The Global Conference on Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , held at Bridgetown , Barbados , in 1994 , noted that small island developing States are prone to extremely damaging natural disasters , primarily in the form of severe weather , volcanic eruptions and earth-quakes ( A / CONF . 167 / 9 ) .  
The resulting improved and sustained macroeconomic stability in several least developed countries and the good weather conditions and strength in the international demand for the exports of African least developed countries are the main reasons for the third year of relatively strong growth and rising per capita output in the least developed countries .  
A wide range of applications were planned through those services , including distance learning , corporate training , collaborative work-groups , telecommuting , telemedicine , wireless backbone interconnection ( that is , wireless Local Area Network-Wide Area Network ) , video distribution , DTH video and satellite newsgathering , as well as the distribution of software , music , scientific data and global financial and weather information .  
That would lead to improved aviation and marine and maritime safety and efficiency , agricultural productivity , forest and range management , weather forecasting for the public , environmental quality and understanding of the climatology and climate variability .  
This reflects growth impulses from recovery from recession in developed countries ( even if sometimes halting ) , greater capacity to act on growth impulses in some transition economies and , for the developing countries , incentives from higher international commodity prices in recent years , as well as the strong growth of international trade and burgeoning international capital flows in the middle 1990s , not to mention better weather in Africa in 1996 .  Barring unforseen shocks , 116 countries are forecast to achieve this minimal benchmark of rising per capita output in 1997 .  
The rural population , especially in and around the areas of the two principal front lines , has experienced numerous and severe hardships as a result of the fighting which were often compounded by inclement weather .  
Variances may occur to the actual physical distribution as a result of changes in cropping patterns , varying food demands , weather restrictions , location of weed , insect and disease infestations , future machinery malfunctions that were not foreseen , the number of contracts approved and / or blocked , plus seasonal machinery activities ( e.g . the majority of harvesters move to the south for the early harvest and migrate north as the crops ripen and become ready for harvest ) .  
The Forum recognized and endorsed the deep concerns regarding the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on rising sea levels and changing weather patterns on all Forum members , especially low-lying island nations , as recorded in the Statement on Climate Change and Sea Level Rise issued by the seventh Economic Summit of Smaller Island States Leaders held in Rarotonga on 12 and 13 September 1997 .  
Weather forecasts based on numerical weather prediction utilize , among other things , operational satellite measurements of both surface and upper air winds and atmospheric temperature fields ;  
The effects of natural disasters and bad weather on agricultural production notwithstanding , hunger and the lack of sustainable agricultural development were not solely the result of chance but rather of human choices and poor decisions .  
Still other cooperative mechanisms , such as the WMO World Weather Watch programme , support the coordination of global scientific activity for prompt and accurate weather information and other services for public , private and commercial use .  
Concerned that global warming may be contributing to the worsening of weather , and concluding that further scientific investigation of the impacts of climate change and its relationship to extremes of weather is critical ,  
The El Nino phenomenon has a recurring character , often with severe impacts on regional weather patterns , which in their turn can result in large material , economic , human and environmental losses .  
Satellites are today an essential tool for weather forecasting , direct television broadcasting , telecommunications , geographical positioning , air , sea and land traffic control , environmental protection and many other operations that are increasing in number and producing a broad economic and social impact .  
A combination of good weather , which led to significant improvements in agricultural output , and an improved policy environment as evidenced , inter alia , by low fiscal deficits and inflation has been responsible for increased economic growth in a number of countries .  
Took note of the information provided by the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) on how to sign / ratify the Tampere Convention which provides a legal framework for the use of telecommunications in international humanitarian assistance ; ( i ) Noted that the considerable recent advances in seasonal weather and climate predictions , including of such phenomena as El Nio , enable improved preparedness of vulnerable communities against natural disasters .  
Developing countries need to be encouraged to utilize space in support of their national developmental activities and to address the basic requirements of their people : education , pollution monitoring , health , telecommunications , environmental management , weather and climate applications , utilization of natural resources , food security , urban and rural infrastructure , land-use management and many other local-level resource problems ;  
Wide-ranging applications being planned include distance learning , corporate training , collaborative work groups , telecommuting , telemedicine , electronic commerce , direct-to-home video and satellite news-gathering , as well as the distribution of music , software , scientific data and global financial and weather information .  
While its close-knit families and strong agricultural base had enabled Thailand to weather the 1997 financial crisis , the existing social safety nets had been severely tested and the crisis had served as a reminder that social development could not be treated as secondary to economic development .  
At the international level , small island developing States have made strenuous efforts to persuade the international community to take earnest and effective measures to arrest global warming and the consequent rise in sea level , and changes in climatic and weather patterns .  
However , while economic growth has remained positive on average , the rate of growth has not been sustainable because it was based on external factors such as good weather and favourable commodity prices .  
Considering ways in which early warning systems for extreme weather events might be strengthened or established in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to help address the climatechange related requirements of particularly vulnerable countries ;  
We are exposed to sudden external shocks , such as regional conflicts , increases in international oil prices , declines in copper prices , harsh weather patterns and financial crises .  
Strengthening existing [ and , where needed , establishing ] early warning systems for extreme weather events in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to assist developing country Parties , in particular those most vulnerable to climate change ;  
Warnings of bad weather and natural disasters to remote areas and ships : satellite telecommunications offer increased reliability compared to the standard terrestrial maritime communications facilities that were used in the past ;  
In addition , a large number of public information systems such as local news and weather , entertainment , tourism , maps and sports are developed based on local content and will stimulate the development of the domestic information services industry and raise the living standard of the local people .  
Under the direct supervision of the Chief , GIS Cell ( GISC ) , the incumbent would be responsible for the overall operating , developing and implementing of the GIS-related matters in terms of logistics in peacekeeping operations ; provide geographic / terrain analysis using GIS technology , produce terrain studies and predict the effects of weather , terrain and logistics situations in peacekeeping operations , compile textual , graphic products from text , electronic format of geographic data ( vector , raster , satellite images ) and other sources of data .  
Impacts of global warming include an accelerated rise in sea levels , increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events , changes in patterns and levels of precipitation , the drying of arid and semi-arid areas from decreased precipitation , and the spread of vector borne diseases .  
The countrys size and economic dimensions , with a variety of climate characteristics , large areas with agricultural activity , some highly concentrated areas of population and industrial production , and the largest area of tropical forest in the world , make evident the importance of weather and climate forecasting for Brazil .  
Strengthening existing and , where needed , establishing early warning systems for extreme weather events in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to assist developing country Parties , in particular those most vulnerable to climate change ;  
He Xiaohong , a senior engineer with the autonomous region 's meteorological bureau , said such weather phenomenon was formed due to a recent significant cold air current coming southward down from the north of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau . When it merged with the warm northward up current from the Indian Ocean between the Mount Nyainqentanglha and the Himalayas , rain or sleet was formed .  
It is said there was one hour of heavy rainfall over the airport between 8:00-9:00am on the 10th , accompanied by thunderstorm and strong wind .  It was impossible to guarantee normal taking off and landing of flights with such weather .  Affected by this , over 2,000 passengers in total were held up on that day .  
But with unfavorable terrain and weather conditions , it was impossible to effectively attack mobile tactical targets and concealed targets at such altitudes , let alone tell genuine and false targets apart .  
Just before the battle the training emphasized technical and tactical training for individual soldiers and small sections , and importance was also attached to coordination between different branches and joint training of major units ; at the same time the topography and weather conditions of the training areas were as far as possible similar to those of the target area .  
However , the FRY also took advantage of the battlefield environment , including the complex topography of the country , the dense vegetation , and the extremely variable weather conditions to make it difficult for NATO 's reconnaissance and bombing to be effective , and they actually destroyed or damaged numerous U.S . planes , including an F-117 stealth fighter .  
In future regional wars , our strong adversaries who possess high-tech weaponry may engage us in aerial battles with their superior technology .  These battles will be abrupt and decisive .  Our adversaries will go all out to seize the initiative by taking full advantage of nighttime and complex weather conditions .  
and conduct a trial of wisdom and courage with the " enemy " forces by displaying super combat skills whenever needed under such odious conditions as unbearably hot weather , unknown terrain , lack of cooked food , and so on .  The exercise command center revealed that the training exercise would surpass a scout contest of an international standard in terms of arduousness , intensity , and danger .  
According to CMB , the " collective and numerical weather forecast system " , which was built using the " Shenwei " Computer , was a major key project in the state 's " Ninth Five-Year Plan " .  Thanks to its successful development , our country has entered the world 's advanced ranks in major meteorological application , and has become one of a few countries in the world to perform collective forecasts .  
They aim for the target of accomplishing combat task requirements without going through real battle training and without replenishing personnel and equipment .  Through reform of flight training , this unit has realized new breakthroughs in combat strength in the following five areas .  In the area of basic flight skill training , flying has been evolved from normal conditions to flying under bad weather conditions or under other extreme conditions .  
In the drill , on one hand , this department attached prime importance to theoretical study , scientifically analyzed and evaluated the present situation of the theater 's support capacity , especially its own units , and comprehensively grasped the characteristics of the theater 's topography , weather , social situation , popular feelings , and the actual conditions of the equipment and combat readiness , and provided guidance for troops ' practical work .  
Equipped with such a portable tent , a patrol or inspection team is capable of taking a rest or staying in an area at any time , should it fail to reach a destination in time or encounter bad weather , and this has also enhanced the regiment 's control over some key areas or sandy areas , to which access is difficult .  
The frozen river had begun melting , and the grass had begun sprouting , for the weather had turned warm .  However , after leaving their barracks , the recruits had no time to watch the natural scenery , for they knew that countless hardships and difficulties were waiting for them on their way forward .  
Yunnan Province has rich tourism resources as it has beautiful natural scenes and pleasant weather .  There are many scenic spots and a rich variety of cultural features and customs of minority ethnic groups .  All this is huge economic potential to be tapped .  
The armed helicopters conceal themselves by using complicated weather conditions , and make a sudden attack by conducting low-altitude flights and hedgehopping .  The armed helicopters land behind the " enemy " lines , and transport special task forces to press straight on the important target when conducting sabotage operations behind the enemy lines .  This kind of sudden attack is commonly seen in modern warfare , and is called figuratively as the " surgical operation " on the combat field .  
Through repeated drills , the pilots have explored ways to cleverly avoid enemies by using such unfavorable weather conditions as before dawn , at dusk , and at dark night , and mastered various skills of rapid and precise landing on a multiple points , and coordination between helicopters and the special task forces on the ground to launch an assault against the enemy .  
They began another consecutive , intensified , night flight training exercise under bad weather conditions .  The training was based on the following scenario : They experienced defeats before .  They want to enhance their continuous fighting capability by improving their almost-real combat training .  
These programs include interception attacks under bad conditions of poor visibility , fighting in the clouds , and fighting in the rain .  They also have organized night training programs with high difficulty and great dynamics under complicated weather conditions .  As a result , they have improved their overall capability in conducing continuous fighting at night .  
The mainland 's military media reported yesterday that the Air Force fleet of the Nanjing Military Region recently conducted an airborne long-distance contingency drill based on actual battle requirements .  The troops overcame difficulties arising from changes in weather conditions and an unfamiliar flight route and airport , and carried out a remarkable mock attack on the " enemy 's " radar , thereby realizing a successful first-entry , first-discovery , first-attack , and first-hit .  
All leading pilots of this division unit are commanding officers and instructors capable of dealing with " four kinds " of weather .  With their perfect command of flying technology , they were on the forefront of training reform and achieved breakthrough progress in a number of reform tasks .  They resolved in succession scores of technical problems in training such as long-distance striking operations and urgent dispatch of large groups of aircraft , and succeeded in promoting the deepening of combat tactics training and enhancing the troops ' capability in air warfare .  
A certain airborne unit has put the emphasis of its airborne training reform this year on having a communications support from an officially and systematically organized , well-equipped follow-up airborne signal unit .  It has organized parachute jumping training programs for officers and men of signal unit , including fully armed individual jumping , fully armed and heavy-load unit jumping , and field communications support training in complex terrain and adverse weather conditions .  
They have also dispatched the fleet to the sea to conduct test training in different sea areas and under different weather conditions .  They have successively completed more than 30 difficult training courses , including replenishment in rocky areas at night , round-the-clock comprehensive supplies from all directions , replenishment in strong waves and winds , and joint logistical replenishment tasks by military and civilian vessels .  
To make a breakthrough in this logistical support at sea , this base has organized missile technology experts and officers and men of battleships and logistical support ships to jointly study various operational measures for overcoming adverse weather conditions and formulated scientific plans on missile replenishment .  
We can still expect the national economic growth rate for the whole year to reach or exceed the 7 percent target that was determined early this year , provided that the global economy does not deteriorate further , weather conditions are basically normal , and the policy for macroeconomic regulation and control is implemented rather well .  
Thus far , pilots of this flight squadron have independently fulfilled the highly difficult tasks of two planes flying parallel at night , landing under the guidance of airport lights , and flying at night in extremely complicated weather .  As a result , the night flexible operation capacity of this squadron has been enhanced greatly .  
It can move : it can carry special combat operations elements , exploit the cover of complex weather and climatic conditions , break through defenses at low and extra low altitude , and conduct destructive combat operations in the enemy 's rear .  
In view of southwest China 's complex terrains , changeable climates , and harsh environments , they have trained a number of " all-weather " contingency units that have strong weaponry support - - through setting up courses that train units for highland operations with long-range weaponry support in the theater under inclement weather conditions .  Meanwhile , they have come up with new operational and training methods that meet the needs of actual operations and the special features of new weaponry .  
In accordance with the requirements of actual combat , the division has vigorously developed and strengthened its training .  It conducted successfully for the first time a tactical bombing training program in the small hours of the morning .  It has increased the proportion and intensity of training in highly difficult programs such as landing in adverse weather and through the use of marking lights .

The standard of living of the people has been steadily rising , and there have been many positive changes in the face of the city , with more parks , green spaces , and beautification projects being undertaken .  The city 's air quality has also improved , opening the way for some new weather phenomena there .  
Since early June , the larger part north of the Huang He has experienced a hot weather with hardly any rain .  During this period , high temperatures lasted for several consecutive days in northwest China , north China , northeast China , as well as the Huang He and Huai He regions , worsening the drought that began to break out in north and northwest China in the spring of this year and causing the drought in the western part of northeast China to drastically deteriorate .  
To guarantee the quality of maritime training , the Nanjing Military Region organized leaders of all units to check the areas scheduled for maritime training and formulated careful training plans on the basis of comprehensively mastering the regular weather patterns , the morning and evening tides , the sea currents , and the characteristics of beaches and coastal sea beds .  
The Taiwan public believes that " diplomatic relations " established on " money " are like " fair weather friends , " and will not last long .  Moreover , the " financial aid " countries are all weak and backward countries , and are of absolutely no use .  
He also disclosed : The flight squadrons currently stationed in the southeast coastal region are all crack troops with the most advanced equipment and weaponry in the Chinese air force , the most superb military technology , and the pilots with the greatest wealth of experience that can take off and conduct operations in all weather .  
In a training preview , after a new-model fighter plane took off , the weather suddenly turned nasty , and soon , the base was covered with thunder and lightning .  For the sake of safety , the fighting eagle turned to another airfield on the southeast coast and landed there .  
In winning the award , Dr Lam was cited for his outstanding services and distinguished contributions to the Hong Kong Observatory which has committed itself for over a hundred years to natural disaster prevention and promoting public awareness and emergency preparedness through the provision of timely warnings to the community , thereby minimizing the loss of life and damage to property due to severe weather .

" We have maintained the thrust on development works aimed at improving the forecasting of heavy rains in the coming rainy season , " he said .  
The weather was fine and sunny on April 13 but it became cloudy with some light rain patches again that evening as an intense replenishment of the northeast monsoon reached the south China coastal areas .  Winds strengthened from the east and persisted the next day .  
To ensure that the relocation exercise was implemented smoothly , the company set up a Focus Group comprising representatives of both management and staff well in advance of the target date .  Surveys were conducted to collect the employees ' views on various issues of concern to them such as transport arrangement , working hours , the new working environment , procedural changes , structural changes , arrangement during inclement weather etc .  
A cold front crossed the south China coastal areas on the morning of November 1 .  It brought a few rain patches to the New Territories . Winds strengthened from the north and the weather was mainly cloudy .  
He pointed out that since the 1980s , the HKO had been using solar energy to power remote automatic weather stations which helped to give early warnings on impending weather such as tropical cyclones , heavy rain , high wind and cold fronts .  
However , based on intelligence , experience and alertness of the force , when suspicious consignments were found aboard cross-boundary lorries , the officers would check them thoroughly , sometimes even have to dig into the inner compartment by unloading the cargoes onto the examination compound , " she added .  Despite the heavy workload and unfavourable weather conditions , the working spirit of the task force has been regularly sharpened by the good progress of cases or hefty court punishments .  
The larger year-on-year decrease in the Composite CPI in August 2001 than in July 2001 was mainly attributable to a fall in the prices of basic foodstuffs .  In particular , the prices of fresh vegetables eased back distinctly in August , from a relatively high level in July as supply was disrupted by the rainy weather .  
A weak cold front arrived at the south China coastal areas on October 4 .  The weather in Hong Kong turned hazy at first and became cloudy with thundery showers in the afternoon .  Around 80 millimetres of rainfall were recorded over parts of the Lantau Island .  
There is a strong need for an authoritative source of official weather information produced by national meteorological services ( NMSs ) who operate the WMO-regulated worldwide weather observing network .  
The champion Mr KO Sum-yuen said the winning design was based on cute and adorable children characters .  Their bona fide characteristics symbolise issuance of authentic weather reports by the Observatory and bring out the caring image of the Observatory .

With an active trough of low pressure lingering over the vicinity of the south China coast for about two thirds of the month , the weather of June was marked by persistent heavy rain and thunderstorms .  The monthly rainfall amounted to 1083.6 millimetres , about three times the normal figure .  
The remaining project is located in a public housing estate and is delayed due to rainy weather and unforeseen technical difficulties in piling .  HD has taken follow-up actions and will closely monitor the progress .  
In view of the prevailing humid and hot weather , the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department ( FEHD ) strongly urged the public to remain vigilant to mosquito breeding and the spread of mosquito transmitted diseases like dengue fever , a spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department ( FEHD ) advised today ( May 22 ) .  
In view of the persistent hot and humid weather , members of the public should remain vigilant to the spread of mosquito-transmitted diseases like dengue fever and should spare no effort in the removal of stagnant water to curb mosquito breeding .  
( a ) The high Air Pollution Index ( API ) readings recorded at the Tung Chung air monitoring station in August and September this year were due to high concentrations of ozone formed and accumulated in the Pearl River Delta Region and Hong Kong when we were under the influence of tropical cyclones with hot and sunny weather , and almost stagnant wind .  
" We still can not rule out the possibility of sporadic cases of dengue fever even during the cooler seasons , as mosquitoes can breed and grow if the weather is mild and wet , " he said , adding that heavy rainfalls were recorded last week , which provided a favourable environment for mosquito breeding .  
These meteorological authorities are responsible for operating the official world-wide weather observing network regulated by the WMO . They are the ones who have first-hand weather information from the front line .  Therefore , they are the most authoritative source of weather forecasts in their regions of responsibility .  
Forecasts in this web page are based on the official weather information provided by national meteorological authorities .  Apart from text , the information is also presented in simple graphic for easy appreciation .  
Currently , weather information gathered from local automatic weather stations are made available real-time on the Internet . The public can access the information and make decisions best suited to their specific circumstances .  A detailed and timely weather information service like this is among the best in the world .  
As the Hong Kong Observatory issued the very hot weather warning today ( July 6 ) , the Department of Health ( DH ) advised members of the public , particularly those engaged in outdoor activities , to take measures to prevent heat stroke in view of the prevailing hot weather .

Fresh seafood is arranged in front of Temple Entrance restaurants , where the customers can select their own seafood and have it prepared to their taste . Others may prefer to buy spring rolls , rice cakes , curry or noodle dishes , tempura , or oyster omelets at the smaller stands , and top them off with a dessert of traditional sweets or luscious pre-cut fruits . Keelung , whether by means of bright new public construction or traditional local color , has managed to overcome the original drab appearance caused by its rainy weather .  
Six years ago , on a windy winter afternoon , three friends , Ch'en Ch'ing-hui , a diver , Yue Li-jen , a surfer , and Chan Chi-hung , an avid sailor , were strolling on a deserted beach decrying the unpleasant weather conditions which were too windy for surfing , and too wavy for sailing . Suddenly , from the distance they spied an apparition-like scene - - a smooth riding craft skimming across the rolling breakers .  
In earlier days , the majority of schools and athletic centers in the ROC surfaced their tracks and baseball diamonds with either crushed brick or cinder . In fair weather the air was filled with dust and grit and when it rained the surfaces were pocked with puddles , causing numerous headaches and much inconvenience for their users .  
Rainy , humid weather is required for frogs to lay their eggs . Because winter is southern Taiwan 's dry season , the Taipei tree frog is found only in mountainous areas under 1,000 meters in altitude north of Nantou County . Their mating season is from October to April .  
Springtime in the south of China has but a few days of warm sunlight and gentle breezes ; soon the weather turns cloudy or cold , burying that rare and precious fragrance .  
Having passed from a typical transient psychology to hopes of settling down permanently , and now again to thoughts of moving away , Tahitian Chinese will probably waver between the mindsets of a naturalized native and a transient resident for many years to come . Their story over the past hundred years , of crossing the seas to seek a better life , continues to play itself out . Fortunately , the latest generation of Tahitian Chinese are in a much better position than their forebears were to make a rational choice and to weather the storm . (  
Today seven teams with 29 members are active in 12 farming areas . Their agenda includes experimental cultivation of crops such as maize , paddy rice and sorghum ; soil and weather surveys to establish the suitability of crops ; hydrological and topographical surveys to establish data for irrigation and drainage projects ; and social surveys to learn more about the farming population 's willingness to work and their technical level .  
Out here in the mountains the air 's fresh and pleasant all year round , on a clear day you can see Mt . Kuanyin and in rainy weather all the luxuriant vegetation looks just wonderful . " Co-planner with her husband of the " Chinese Style Promotion Centre , " Yang Wen-yuan says they 'd always admired the leisurely lifestyle of the old Chinese literati , so they 're happy to put up with the inconvenience to enjoy a breath of fresh air .  
Before the discovery of the microscope , and before " ecological observation " became popular , when our ancestors saw these insects emerge from soft earth and light up , they imagined that the firefly was a metamorphosis from rotting leaves or decaying bamboo . The saying , " On summer nights , rotting grass turns into fireflies , " was a natural result of observing transformations as the weather changed from season to season .  
It seems that Taichung has now become the " great grey mullet harbor . " This is also related to the fact that the cold fronts have not been able to come further southward . Improvements in fishing gear over the past few years , such as two boats cooperating to create a single large trap , increasing the horsepower of fishing boat motors , and improvements in two-way radios , have enabled the work of catching the fish in winter , unattainable in recent years , to go along swimmingly in the warmer weather .  
During the warm period prior to the ice age , which is to say at the same time that the Han Chinese legend of Hou Yi ( who shot down nine of the ten suns with his bow and arrow ) was said to take place , the Taiya version has it that another sun appeared in the sky . There were two suns , one above and one below , so that the distinction between day and night was lost . The weather became oppressively hot , and illnesses spread rampantly ; all living things faced extinction .  
When the R . O . C . film The Wedding Banquet won top honors at the Berlin Film Festival , another feast for film lovers was opening back home . The films on offer here were black and white : pure and clean , yet warm and sweet . After a spell of cold and wet weather , the sun finally shows his face .  
And on sweltering summer days , people gather here to enjoy the cool shade . True , when that hard and cold cement road was paved just beyond the reach of its roots , it was a little uncomfortable , but for the most part it had nothing much to complain about . Enjoying largely mild weather , it has dug its roots deep and firm .  
For a long time , the WCB has only built wall-type dikes which stand perpendicular to the surface . In the past the main purpose of the sea dikes was to prevent intense waves brought by bad weather from heading inland . Today the coast suffers from the effects of inland gravel extraction and ground water extraction and is continually eroding .  
A heavy load of paper work , mostly administrative in nature , stirred in him strong feelings of nostalgia for the simple life he led as a straight weather forecaster . Hence , when a television station invited him to serve primarily as a weather forecaster , this tallied with his special interests , and after only a moment 's reflection he agreed .  
The section chief of the division for agricultural weather forecasts , Liu Fu-cheng , nicknamed " the old turtle , " has known Jen Li-yu for thirty years as classmate , fellow conscript , and colleague . He laughingly commented on the fact that Jen Li-yu was a mild-mannered civil servant , always meek and always humble . But because the timbre of his voice was clear and resonant , far more so than the average , he gained enormous popularity .  
Apparently the work of weather forecaster was divided into 12 hr . shifts on a rotational basis . And every five persons constituted a section , administered and governed by a head forecaster . After Jen Li-yu was promoted to serve as head forecaster , an unexpected turn of events turned him overnight into a star media performer . At the time , the Chinese Television System had decided to arrange a more factual and scientific weather forecast after the evening news broadcast .  
And very recently , with the arrival of spring , climatic conditions are highly unstable , so it is very difficult to ascertain whether it will rain or not . After his weather forecasts have turned out to be totally incorrect , a patient afflicted with bronchitis could not resist calling up TTV in order to complain . " Jen Li-yu 's ability to forecast the weather is not half as accurate as my own bronchial tubes . "  
He explains that the animal world , because of the proliferation of varieties , must be rigidly economical with resources and efficient in distribution . During cloudy weather , therefore , ever-teeming honey bees can only consume foodstuff stored in the hive ; lacking provisions of pollen , their mood naturally turns less benevolent . " They lose their temper " and attack people . " I can understand their emotional disposition , " he says .  
Lots of people listen to the weather report every day , but you probably did n't know that the Central Weather Bureau operates an astronomical observatory which is not devoted to predicting the weather . It is responsible for calculating the precise timing of the 24 Solar Terms of the Chinese calendar every year . And after examining the data , the Ministry of the Interior includes it in the annual farmer 's almanac , distributed every year to each agricultural worker .  
The original content of the 24 Solar Terms was very simple , but over many years , they slowly developed into focal points for an extremely fertile cultural milieu . They are guides to farming life , reference dates for weather forecasting and holidays for all sorts of ceremonial activities . Almanacs , the weather , agriculture , the general life of the community - - all abide under the shadow of the Solar Terms !  
At this time the autumn farming activities went into a phase of decline , and in the north the weather turned cold . There was always some fear that barbarian tribes might " descend south to graze their horses . " At this time everyone began to brush up on their martial skills , even actively going out to kill the barbarians or steal the fat horses and goats that they raised !  
In terms of meteorological significance , Solar Terms can at most indicate ' the most probable period of sunlight , ' " states Wu Ming-chin . If the weather is favorable , planting according to the Solar Terms will yield the most abundant harvest . Luckily , the Solar Terms are still quite popular among farmers , who are not accustomed to calculating so precisely .  
In northern Taiwan all the old farmers can recite the saying " Before the Awakening of Insects , do n't plant rice seedlings . " This is because the weather around the Awakening of Insects is just beginning to warm up but can still be a little chilly . If the first crop of seedlings is frozen by a late cold spell , then the farmers ' labors will be left unrewarded .  
It has temperate zone grasses , beautiful and imposing Precipices , an elegant volcanic crater lake , and the delightful Tsui Tsui Valley . But after it was placed within the conservation area of the park , the trails became overgrown . With the treacherous weather brought by the northeast winds six months a year added in , many cases of people losing their way are reported .  
When I was very little , I often heard some old folks mention a Place called Kuoyeh , on the east shores of Penghu [ the principal island of the Penghuarchipelago , traditionally referred to in English as the Pescadores ] . At dawnwhen the weather is good , one can stand on the east edge of the village and gazing across the distant waters catch a glimpse of the towering mountains of the main island of Taiwan , rising up to the east .  
But recently , at the request of international organizations , the Directorate General of Telecommunications set up a weather balloon station on the island to monitor the upper atmosphere . To ensure that the data gathered is valid and accurate , the directorate also shipped a generator to the island to supply the equipment with electricity at a stable voltage .  
Normally such a ritual would not be performed during Ghost Month ( the seventh lunar month ) , out of consideration for the " good brothers " ( " homeless " spirits ) who are only allowed out into the world for this one month every year . But Li Jen-chi consulted Alimu and obtained a special dispensation . she has never doubted Alimu 's power . 12 August , Saturday , weather cloudy with scattered showers .  
It 's a long read homeThe weather tended to be hot and dry , and the road went from being asphalt or grass to an uneven stone surface , strewn with pot-holes . As they rushed their journey both day and night , the elephants ' feet quickly blistered and tore , even becoming infected and festering .  
This is the time of year when the weather is affected by cold high-pressure areas from the continent . These create sharp differences in temperature , generating strong upward currents . Also , humidity is low , and there is less concern about rain caused by hot air currents running into cold air at high altitudes .  
On one occasion , a KMT candidate in the southern part of the island held an outdoor rally , but cold weather kept voters at home . Fortunately the 80-plus strong overseas support group showed up , saving the candidate from a rather embarrassing situation .  
This type of technology does n't require the user to have any special input-output devices to block out the real environment . Instead it employs the so-called " blueboard technique " using cameras . It makes a composite of images shot of the user along with computer generated virtual world images so that people can see themselves acting within the setting on the screen . One use for this is already visible in the weather programs of Taiwan 's three main TV stations .  
Satellites , in accordance with their different functions and missions , can be divided into five categories : scientific satellites are used to conduct scientific research in space ; surveillance satellites are used to obtain military intelligence ; resource satellites collect information on global resources ; weather satellites monitor atmospheric conditions and collect information for meteorological prediction ; and finally communication satellites , which are in high demand for their wide range of communication applications .  
As the southern weather turns hot and stuffy , the ducks , missing the spring breezes which they need for their breeding season , grow bored and their hormones subside . At the same time , spring is gradually spreading across the north , melting the Earth 's icy veil . With natural enemies there few in number but food plentiful , one after the other the ducks and geese start to return home .  
After cold fronts pass through , however , bird associations are always telling bird watchers to rush off to the seashore and mouths of rivers . If their luck is good , they may be able to see wild geese blown off course by the rough weather .  
The most novel interpretation of the tales of love between immortals and regular human beings appears in a book published in Taiwan , in which the author argues that the denizens of heaven are sapped of their sex drive by perpetually fair weather , beautiful clothing , delectable food , and centuries of living at a metabolic rate of zero .  
Most of the plants used by Taiwan 's herbalists come from mainland China . This makes both the supply and the quality unstable because the same plant grown in different regions , or under different weather and climatic conditions , will produce different medicinal effects . This makes necessary the use of biotechnology in the artificial cultivatation of Chinese herbal medicines .  
When Sun wore a long jacket while shooting a music video , people could tell how excited she was at wearing a winter coat for the first time . At that moment , Taiwan did n't seem to be that far from Singapore , despite the latter 's endless summer weather . We all could sense a young woman 's joy at being accepted in foreign land that seemed at once familiar and exotic .  
Typhoon Trami , a " mini " typhoon with a radius of just 100 km , closed in on southern Taiwan on July 11 . The storm had been downgraded to a tropical depression by the time it passed over land that evening , but no sooner had the typhoon warning been lifted than the ensuing weather system unleashed a torrential downpour on Kaohsiung , causing the worst flooding in the city 's history .  
In fact , " freak " Typhoon Nari seems very much to fit the trend of climate change . Liao Chung-ming , director of National Taiwan University 's department of atmospheric sciences , says that with global warming , extreme and unusual weather patterns will occur with increasing frequency .  
Although the seminar was held in early November , the weather in Kinmen was still warm and sunny , with a sky so blue you could practically reach up and squeeze the water out of it . Scattered here and there amidst newly constructed five-story apartment blocks were traditional southern Fujian-style homes , with their rounded roof ridges and flying eaves . If it were n't for the camouflaged bunkers scattered all over the island , one might well have forgotten that the area once reeked of gunpowder and was stationed with 100,000 troops .  
When the weather in Taiwan 's low-lands begins to gradually turn cool , in the island 's high mountains the mercury is already plummeting , and all kinds of living things are getting ready for their winter rest . But despite the cold , high up on Mt . Hehuan , Yushan , Mt . Ali and elsewhere one can often see a unique Taiwanese bird species-the collared bush robin-hopping busily along the ground alone in search of food , like a solitary little knight-errant .  
According to the IPCC : " Global warming is not a smooth , gradual shift . It is possible that just as at the end of the last ice age , there may be an unusual and dramatic jump , and a great increase in the frequency of disasters such as storms , tidal surges , torrential rainfall , drought and extensive forest fires , caused by aberrant weather . "  
A study of weather data from the last 100 years that the National Science Council commissioned from a number of local universities revealed that Taiwan 's average temperature has increased by 1-1.4 �X C over the last century . While this increase was greater than the 0.6 �X C increase in average global temperature , it was in line with the increase in the average surface temperature on land . However , Taiwan 's summer temperatures have risen more than its winter temperatures , indicating a trend towards the hot getting hotter .  
Early flowering seasons in Yang - mingshan , mullet failing to swim south after the winter solstice , dengue fever crossing the Tropic of Cancer , unusual butterfly migrations , coral bleaching . . . . Global warming is blamed for rising sea levels , freak weather and frequent floods , but is it also responsible for some of the unusual phenomena in Taiwan 's natural world in recent years ?  
In fact it is not unusual for a change of seasons to occasionally come early or late and upset the sequence of nature , and it is quite common for plants to be fooled by the weather . In ancient times farmers were aware that " if a fruit tree that normally flowers in spring blossoms in autumn , it will not set fruit . "  
During the daytime the sunlight in a cockpit can be blinding , so it must be possible for the monitor to be adjusted to extreme brightness , otherwise the screen will just be a sheet of white . Indeed , whether it is the black of night or the middle of a lightning storm , all kinds of weather conditions and topography are variables in the use of instruments in flight , and must be carefully considered .  
In winter , the northeast monsoon makes for cold and wet weather with frequent fog and gusting rains on the northern side of the pass , while the southern side stays clear and dry . The very distinct climates make for radically different kinds of vegetation on the two sides of the pass .  
He once broke out with dermatitis while working on the eve of Chinese New Year . His entire body turned red and swelled , itching set in , and he had to soak all evening in a tub despite the cold winter weather . While everyone else was enjoying the most festive night of the year , Lai suffered through the bleakest New Year 's Eve of his life .  
As the old Chinese saying goes , " weather has unexpected twists ; fortunes can turn in a day . " Just one example : A man living in Taipei City 's Anping Borough who supported his family by cleaning building exteriors lost his footing in January and fell to his death , leaving behind a disabled wife and three young children . There was n't even enough money for the funeral , and the fatherless family suddenly found itself in the direst of straits .  
But in less than half an hour , the calm weather changed drastically . A violent wind blew in laden with snow . The Russian pilot , experienced in polar transportation and supply , decided to withdraw immediately . On hearing the shouts of the other crewmembers the groups that were dispersed around the pole taking photos raced toward the helicopter .  
He does n't rest easy until his ink has finished drying . In Taiwan , the best time of year for making ink runs from the eighth month of the lunar calendar through the second month of the following year , when the weather is relatively cool and there is little rain . The best ink is made in the winter because the ink blocks shrink in the cold , dry quickly , and keep their shape .  
It was only then that I learned hot showers are regarded as an extravagance . On the very highest point of the north peak , the weather station is almost entirely dependent on rain and snowfall for its water . When the Japanese first built the station in 1943 they constructed a water storage tank in the basement , designed to hold ten tons of water . Unfortunately , the tank is now old and cracked , and leaks so badly it can only hold two or three tons at a time .  
Before climbing Yushan I had been told there were several professional photographers staying at the weather station . One of them , Li Tai-chun , discussed his photographic experience with me . In 1990 CWB chief Tsai Ching-yen visited Yushan , where he saw a particularly stunning sunset over a sea of clouds . This made him consider the possibility of producing an Yushan calendar filled with such breathtaking vistas , and Yushan Weather Station was put in charge of the project .  
The data collected by low-elevation weather stations lacks detailed information on high altitude cloud cover and air current changes , among other things . Although it is now possible to use satellite technology , high-altitude weather balloons and other advanced technology to measure the temperature , air pressure and humidity at high altitudes , the collection of data on such things as visibility , cloud type and cloud height depends on visual observation and can not be achieved by automated instruments .  
Apart from its high altitude , the Yushan Weather Station is also located on the Tropic of Cancer . This is a special location combining high altitude with low longitude , precisely where the Pacific and continental air masses interact . That means meteorological data observed here has an important reference value for local weather forecasts .  
Whenever heavy weather approaches , Taiwan 's beautiful landscape is increasingly marred by fear . The typhoon also flooded the city of Sanchung , Taipei County for the first time in over 30 years , after contractors cut corners in the construction of a subway line . The government now faces a compensation bill of NT $ 2 billion . The incident holds lessons for us all .  
They attributed the crisis , one of the most severe agricultural disasters in southern Africa over the past 10 years , to " the area 's weakened farm production and supply after two years of production decline caused by bad weather coupled with economic crisis and the suspension of agricultural activities in some areas . "  
He explained that the meeting of transient cold weather and warm and damp air mass , which is comparatively active this winter , has brought about the two snowfalls , which are bound to bring down the temperature in the Beijing area  
MACAO , December 13 ( Xinhua ) It is expected to be cloudy and cool with intermittent sunshine on Dec 20 , the day when Macao returns to China after being ruled by the Portuguese for more than 150 years , according to a weather forecast released by the local meteorological station today  
Development is not sustainable if 17 hurricanes are to trample through our region each year ; yet climate experts have given us notice that the phenomenon known as global warming will generate a greater number of extreme weather events , more ferocious and monstrous in each succeeding year . 
Since 1959 , the scope and importance of space applications have expanded from a narrow field of science and technology to a wide range of applications that are essential to operational communications , weather forecasting , resource management , prevention and mitigation of disaster , environmental monitoring and other social and economic activities in virtually every country .  
In recognition of the vital role of national meteorological services in providing warnings of severe weather events to the community , WMO 's Public Weather Services Programme includes specific projects directed at strengthening the capacities of national meteorological services and in raising the awareness and level of public understanding about the services provided .  
El Ni �� is a warm inshore current annually flowing south along the coast of Ecuador around the end of December and extending about every 7 to 10 years down the coast of Peru ; it can bring devastating weather to several global regions , including heavy rains and flooding as well as colder than normal winters across the United States , and severe droughts and dust storms in Australia .  
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) reported that the 1995 agricultural season has been significantly more successful than had been anticipated , in part because of both favourable weather conditions and the timely provision of agricultural support by the international donor community .  
Data acquired by meteorological satellites are used in global atmospheric and ocean models for numerical weather prediction and environmental quality assessment , as well as climate monitoring and medium-range , long-range , seasonal and multi-seasonal climate prediction .  
There were currently four types of lidar systems under development : ( a ) the back scatter lidar , with a wide range of possible applications in meteorology and climatology ; ( b ) the differential absorption lidar ( DIAL ) , which could provide precise measurements of atmospheric humidity , temperature and pressure ; ( c ) the Doppler lidar , with the capability of improved weather forecasting and applications in global atmospheric studies ; and ( d ) the ranging and altimeter lidar , which could provide very accurate measurements of Earth 's surface features .  
As we have indicated , three of them are out of service for lack of essential spare parts , which are supposed to be exempt from the provisions of resolution 748 ( 1992 ) for humanitarian reasons , and because of their advanced age and constant need of maintenance . inclement weather .  
Barring adverse weather conditions , the progress made in enhancing political and social stability in some countries and the benefits accruing from the impact of domestic economic-policy reforms , coupled with favourable developments in the international economic environment , lead to estimates of regional growth in output of 2.9 per cent in 1996 , as against 2.3 per cent in 1995 .  
In this regard , operative paragraph 4 of today 's draft resolution ( S / 1996 / 1002 ) is essential because close cooperation between the Government of Haiti and international financial institutions is expected to permit the mobilization of additional financial support to assist the economic , social and institutional development which is so needed for Haiti to weather the winds of instability .  
The Global Conference on Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , held at Bridgetown , Barbados , in 1994 , noted that small island developing States are prone to extremely damaging natural disasters , primarily in the form of severe weather , volcanic eruptions and earth-quakes ( A / CONF . 167 / 9 ) .  
The resulting improved and sustained macroeconomic stability in several least developed countries and the good weather conditions and strength in the international demand for the exports of African least developed countries are the main reasons for the third year of relatively strong growth and rising per capita output in the least developed countries .  
A wide range of applications were planned through those services , including distance learning , corporate training , collaborative work-groups , telecommuting , telemedicine , wireless backbone interconnection ( that is , wireless Local Area Network-Wide Area Network ) , video distribution , DTH video and satellite newsgathering , as well as the distribution of software , music , scientific data and global financial and weather information .  
That would lead to improved aviation and marine and maritime safety and efficiency , agricultural productivity , forest and range management , weather forecasting for the public , environmental quality and understanding of the climatology and climate variability .  
This reflects growth impulses from recovery from recession in developed countries ( even if sometimes halting ) , greater capacity to act on growth impulses in some transition economies and , for the developing countries , incentives from higher international commodity prices in recent years , as well as the strong growth of international trade and burgeoning international capital flows in the middle 1990s , not to mention better weather in Africa in 1996 .  Barring unforseen shocks , 116 countries are forecast to achieve this minimal benchmark of rising per capita output in 1997 .  
The rural population , especially in and around the areas of the two principal front lines , has experienced numerous and severe hardships as a result of the fighting which were often compounded by inclement weather .  
Variances may occur to the actual physical distribution as a result of changes in cropping patterns , varying food demands , weather restrictions , location of weed , insect and disease infestations , future machinery malfunctions that were not foreseen , the number of contracts approved and / or blocked , plus seasonal machinery activities ( e.g . the majority of harvesters move to the south for the early harvest and migrate north as the crops ripen and become ready for harvest ) .  
The Forum recognized and endorsed the deep concerns regarding the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on rising sea levels and changing weather patterns on all Forum members , especially low-lying island nations , as recorded in the Statement on Climate Change and Sea Level Rise issued by the seventh Economic Summit of Smaller Island States Leaders held in Rarotonga on 12 and 13 September 1997 .  
Weather forecasts based on numerical weather prediction utilize , among other things , operational satellite measurements of both surface and upper air winds and atmospheric temperature fields ;  
The effects of natural disasters and bad weather on agricultural production notwithstanding , hunger and the lack of sustainable agricultural development were not solely the result of chance but rather of human choices and poor decisions .  
Still other cooperative mechanisms , such as the WMO World Weather Watch programme , support the coordination of global scientific activity for prompt and accurate weather information and other services for public , private and commercial use .  
Concerned that global warming may be contributing to the worsening of weather , and concluding that further scientific investigation of the impacts of climate change and its relationship to extremes of weather is critical ,  
The El Nino phenomenon has a recurring character , often with severe impacts on regional weather patterns , which in their turn can result in large material , economic , human and environmental losses .  
Satellites are today an essential tool for weather forecasting , direct television broadcasting , telecommunications , geographical positioning , air , sea and land traffic control , environmental protection and many other operations that are increasing in number and producing a broad economic and social impact .  
A combination of good weather , which led to significant improvements in agricultural output , and an improved policy environment as evidenced , inter alia , by low fiscal deficits and inflation has been responsible for increased economic growth in a number of countries .  
Took note of the information provided by the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) on how to sign / ratify the Tampere Convention which provides a legal framework for the use of telecommunications in international humanitarian assistance ; ( i ) Noted that the considerable recent advances in seasonal weather and climate predictions , including of such phenomena as El Nio , enable improved preparedness of vulnerable communities against natural disasters .  
Developing countries need to be encouraged to utilize space in support of their national developmental activities and to address the basic requirements of their people : education , pollution monitoring , health , telecommunications , environmental management , weather and climate applications , utilization of natural resources , food security , urban and rural infrastructure , land-use management and many other local-level resource problems ;  
Wide-ranging applications being planned include distance learning , corporate training , collaborative work groups , telecommuting , telemedicine , electronic commerce , direct-to-home video and satellite news-gathering , as well as the distribution of music , software , scientific data and global financial and weather information .  
While its close-knit families and strong agricultural base had enabled Thailand to weather the 1997 financial crisis , the existing social safety nets had been severely tested and the crisis had served as a reminder that social development could not be treated as secondary to economic development .  
At the international level , small island developing States have made strenuous efforts to persuade the international community to take earnest and effective measures to arrest global warming and the consequent rise in sea level , and changes in climatic and weather patterns .  
However , while economic growth has remained positive on average , the rate of growth has not been sustainable because it was based on external factors such as good weather and favourable commodity prices .  
Considering ways in which early warning systems for extreme weather events might be strengthened or established in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to help address the climatechange related requirements of particularly vulnerable countries ;  
We are exposed to sudden external shocks , such as regional conflicts , increases in international oil prices , declines in copper prices , harsh weather patterns and financial crises .  
Strengthening existing [ and , where needed , establishing ] early warning systems for extreme weather events in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to assist developing country Parties , in particular those most vulnerable to climate change ;  
Warnings of bad weather and natural disasters to remote areas and ships : satellite telecommunications offer increased reliability compared to the standard terrestrial maritime communications facilities that were used in the past ;  
In addition , a large number of public information systems such as local news and weather , entertainment , tourism , maps and sports are developed based on local content and will stimulate the development of the domestic information services industry and raise the living standard of the local people .  
Under the direct supervision of the Chief , GIS Cell ( GISC ) , the incumbent would be responsible for the overall operating , developing and implementing of the GIS-related matters in terms of logistics in peacekeeping operations ; provide geographic / terrain analysis using GIS technology , produce terrain studies and predict the effects of weather , terrain and logistics situations in peacekeeping operations , compile textual , graphic products from text , electronic format of geographic data ( vector , raster , satellite images ) and other sources of data .  
Impacts of global warming include an accelerated rise in sea levels , increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events , changes in patterns and levels of precipitation , the drying of arid and semi-arid areas from decreased precipitation , and the spread of vector borne diseases .  
The countrys size and economic dimensions , with a variety of climate characteristics , large areas with agricultural activity , some highly concentrated areas of population and industrial production , and the largest area of tropical forest in the world , make evident the importance of weather and climate forecasting for Brazil .  
Strengthening existing and , where needed , establishing early warning systems for extreme weather events in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to assist developing country Parties , in particular those most vulnerable to climate change ;
