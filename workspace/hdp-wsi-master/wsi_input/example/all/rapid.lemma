"  
To be sure , there is not a single naturalist writer who has not expressed great anguish at the rapid destruction of Taiwan 's environment . In fact , the entire field of naturalist literature has carried the responsibility of raising the environmental consciousness of Taiwan 's residents , and has therefore never been pure literary description .  
In fact , the real cause of power rationing and blackouts can be seen from even a superficial glance : Because of rapid economic growth with a corresponding increase in national wealth , commercial and industrial demand for electricity has risen while consumer electric products have become common .

In response to the global trend of rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide , the government is encouraging large-scale reforestation . But rapid planting of single-species forests in previously cleared areas implies that in the future , each such area will contain only one producer species , thus limiting biodiversity and creating incomplete and fragmentary food chains .  
Judging from the ROC national defense report , in which strategic thinking is guided by " no seeking of war but no fear of war , " it would have been be essential to respond flexibly ( i.e . at a parallel level ) to Communist China .

Especially , it has persisted in using the development method to resolve problems amid advancement , timely adjusted macro-level policies to accommodate changes in the situation , and focused on successfully pursuing important matters with bearings on the overall situation of national economic and social development , thereby maintaining the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy , advancing social progress , and accumulating a lot of valuable experience .  
The above-mentioned " Opinion " points out : Over the past five decades following the founding of New China , especially since the start of reform and opening-up , the social welfare work in this country has made considerable progress and played a positive role in building the socialist material and spiritual civilizations .  As far as our old-age population is concerned , however , we have a large base figure , and the number of old people is still increasing at a rapid pace .  
Over the past 20 years since the founding of the Shenzhen SEZ , we have all along adhered to the principle that " development is the last word , " always kept in mind Deng Xiaoping 's thinking that " poverty is not socialism , development at an overly slow speed is not socialism either ; the superiority of socialism should ultimately be embodied in the better development of productive forces " and , closely centering on the economic construction , achieved the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
The conveyance of policy must be rapid , prompt , and accurate ; market interest rates and flexible foreign exchange rate mechanisms must be closely coordinated ; and opportunities for speculative profit-taking in capital and foreign exchange must be prevented through a sound monetary and foreign currency market .  
China 's economy has maintained a favorable momentum of sustained , rapid and sound development , ranking the seventh in the world in terms of economic aggregates .  Its overall national strength has increased markedly and the texture of life of its people improved notably .  
He expressed hope that the two provinces could seize the present opportunity featured by the decision of the central authorities to implement a develop-the-west strategy and to accelerate the development of the country 's central and western regions ; work hard to transform their advantages in resources and in their geographic locations as a link between the country 's eastern and western regions into economic advantages in real terms ; and bring about a sustained , rapid , and healthy growth to each 's economy .  
An authoritative person analyzed the situation when he was interviewed by reporters and noted that the driving forces included mainly the following : The showing of the effectiveness of the policy of macro-control , the increase of demand for export as a result of the recovery of the global economy , the significant improvement of quality in industrial production , the new motive force as a result of the rapid development of new and high-tech industries , and the " popular feeling " that expect good economic growth .  
In the course of this reform , the position and role of commercial banks in the economic operation have been substantially elevated .  Meanwhile , the adequacy and accumulation of capital funds in the commercial banks seem to lag behind the rapid growth of their operational scale , so that the situation that the capital adequacy ratio is on the low side and fails to reach the appropriate level has emerged .  
Externally oriented economic development steered by " special economic zone " economics has played an important supporting role in the rapid rise of the east , and people have now reached a fairly high level of consensus on this point .  
With the driving force of the overseas Chinese , this city achieved uncommon , vigorous , and rapid growth .  In ten years the total value of industrial and agricultural output grew 90-fold , and their overall economic strength jumped from being near the last in the province to one of the top three .  
In the economic field , we are faced with two major topics that should be solved properly .  One is to establish a relatively perfect socialist market economic structure and the other is to maintain the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
Last year , in light of their combat tasks , they again explored such new topics as single-soldier air defense missiles fighting against armed helicopters and tackled bottlenecks in this regard together with an antiaircraft artillery unit .  In light of such characteristics of an armed helicopter as being capable of hovering for a shorter period of time , launching a rapid attack , and so on , they also studied and developed new tactics like continuous shelling , striking specified points , surrounding and annihilating , and so on .  
In today 's world , where economic globalization is making rapid development , scientific and technological progress is changing everyday , and countries are intensifying their competition to raise comprehensive national strength , it is particularly important to stir up and encourage the national innovative spirit .  
Foreign army materials show that the Russian Army recently formulated a basic concept for developing a command system at the current stage .  An important aspect was cutting back and readjusting fixed command facilities and building a field campaign command center equipped with various functions and capable of rapid response .  
It must be noted that with the end of the economy of shortage , low-standard surpluses are reflected in most fields of merchandise , that our economic structure does not meet the needs of the new macroeconomic situation , and that if the economic structure is not promptly readjusted and optimized , it will be difficult to maintain sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development .  
In the past two decades since the beginning of reform and opening up , our country 's overall national power has significantly strengthened , people 's living standard has been constantly improved and our international position had been greatly raised .  The most fundamental reason is due to the rapid and healthy economic and social development .  
Although it is still difficult to set a standard for quantification of economic globalization , viewed from the angle of nature , at least the following three characteristics are important .  The global distribution of key economic elements has become very convenient and rapid ;  
However , in order to bring about a rapid economic growth of the national economy , the developing countries have generally selected the developed areas to implement a special opening up policy to promote further economic development of the developed areas by means of preferential policies and have regarded these areas as growth centers for promoting the overall development of the national economy .  
The ultimate effect of the modern economic protection , that is regarded as a system , hinges on the questions whether the overall function of the system can be brought into full play and whether the system can provide various major economic targets with enough survival capacity , appropriate production capacity , and rapid after-war recovery capacity under the condition of high-tech wars .  Hence , the protection of economic targets has already developed from the protection of individual factories to the overall protection of urban and industrial sectors .  
The more distinct and stronger the main theme is , the more unified our thinking will be , the more closely our forces will be rallied , the more united our people will become , the more stable our society will be , the more smoothly our reforms will advance , and the greater guarantee we will provide for the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of our economy .  
Firepower warfare has lasted a long period in the history of modern wars .  As people have entered into the period of high technologies , brand new contents and characteristics have been added to firepower warfare .  The long-range , accurate , highly efficient , and rapid reaction natures of firepower call for profound changes in the military 's principles and types and methods of fighting , and also set new tests and demands on a country 's war preparations and building of armed forces .  
Qingdao has stepped up its efforts to reform its cadres system , and worked hard to build contingents of highly competent cadres who keep pace with the new situation and the new tasks .  It has organizationally ensured the city 's rapid development , and promoted its economic construction and the development of various undertakings in the city .  This is aimed at achieving the goal of turning Qingdao into a modern international city specialized in port trading , modern industry , developed agriculture , tourism , and scientific research in oceanography .  
The general drilling site commander , with a sun-tanned face , declared : This combat drill indicates that , as a number of effective methods of scientific and technological troops training have been converted into combat strength , our army has made substantial progress in rapid barrier-breaking landing , operations to hit strongly built enemy targets , operations to counter precision strikes , camouflage of important military facilities , electronic countermeasure , and computer network protection .  
Since the 1960s and 1970s , many countries and regions of Asia have taken a practical approach , implementing development strategies of catching up and surpassing , rising quickly from the post-war ruins , achieving sustained and rapid economic growth , greatly improving the standard of living of the people , and writing a new chapter in the promotion of world economic development .  
The countries of Asia should seize the opportunity , aggressively adjusting their development strategies and accelerating the industrialization , modernization , and market-orientation process .  In particular , they should increase their investments in education and science and technology , vigorously developing and training talented individuals , emphasizing the development of new and advanced technology industries , accelerating industrial upgrades , promoting the sustained and rapid development of the Asian economy in the new century and gradually enabling the people everywhere to affluent lives .  
among the objective environment and major theories and problems of implementation which affect people 's ideological activities , one is the actual situation where the lightning increase in the total quantity of human knowledge and the rapid breakthroughs in modern technology of the " knowledge economy " which has the entire world as its scope have already shown themselves .  
On this foundation , the Guangzhou military area artillery group continues to deepen the trial .  They expanded the " rapid reaction " system to a digital system that is command motor agile , correspondent network convenient , message current , reconnoiter measure diversity , which brings about the entirely digital automation from reconnoiter goal , message handle and assistant determination to the whole process of shooting .  
Yang Guihua , a chief petty officer for torpedoes and mines , after making a repeated analysis on the design of the torpedo loading equipment , successfully improved the " rapid torpedo loading method " , shortening the torpedo loading time by 50 minutes and winning precious time for the submarine to produce rapid reaction .  He was highly praised by the Navy 's top brass .  
The Torpedo Examination and Repair Station successfully developed a " intelligent rapid charging technology " which cuts down submarine 's battery charging time by one half and has won the Navy 's scientific and technological progress award .  
Fighting with firepower has lasted a long period in the history of modern wars .  When people have entered into the period of high technologies , brand new contents and characteristics have added to fighting with firepower .  The long-range , accurate , highly efficient and rapid reaction natures of firepower call for profound changes in the military 's principle , types and methods of fighting , and also set new tests and demands on a country 's war preparations and building of armed forces .  
Just as some economists have analyzed , through the practice of proactive financial policies , China has withstood the impacts of the Asian financial crisis , achieved the sustained and relatively rapid national economic growth , created favorable conditions for promoting reform , exploiting the existing production capability , mitigating the contradiction with regard to employment , and maintaining social stability , and concentrated its energies on constructing a number of infrastructure facilities and accomplishing some major projects which were intended , but were unable , to be carried out for years .  
Third , complexity and uncertainty is constantly growing in the international security environment .  Along with economic globalization , the current rapid development of modern information technology , and the deepening of the new military revolution , both conventional and unconventional security problems have come to the front at the same time ; and the security environment of many countries , especially developing countries , has become more severe and more vulnerable .  
The rapid and drastic development of infrastructure and basic industries have basically resolved the bottlenecked restrictions for the economic and social developments and further strengthened the momentum for long-term development in the future .  
The achievements of the " Ninth 5-Year Plan " have been attained on the basis of the rapid developments of reform and opening up , which are not easily won .  They can fully demonstrate the super leading part of the Party 's third generation collective leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core in mastering the overall macroscopic situation , handling various complicated situations , and leading the people of the whole country to advance in a pioneering spirit .  
Various logistical supports have also been strengthened .  At present , our reserve forces ' rapid mobilization capability and fighting ability have been greatly improved .  Reserve forces have become a strong contingent of the armed forces of our country .  
The agricultural and rural economic structural adjustment has a good beginning , quality agricultural products have made rapid development , and the major crop production has been further centralized in the advantageous producing areas .  
A number of large and medium cities seized the opportunity of the rapid development of capital construction , quickly building new large and medium leading projects to make products for both peacetime and wartime use , and building underground bomb shelters integrated with civilian buildings , for a simultaneous growth of war readiness , social , and economic efficiency .  
Ma : Since reform and opening up , while civil air defense work has achieved marked results , as our socialist market economy has intensified , reformed , and developed , civil air defense has grown increasingly unsuited to the needs of the " market " and the " battlefield " , and remains unsuited to the needs of future wars in areas such as rapid response , project construction quality , and recycling and re-supply capacity .  
With the rapid development in the equipment and technical level of the Chinese armored unit , the new generation of the officers and men of the " heroic " tank unit are aiming for the frontier of the world 's high technology .  They , guided by actual combat requirements and relying on existing equipment potentials , have successfully revamped the Chinese army 's first digital tank .  
As long as we seek unity of thinking , have a firm grasp of the principal line of strategic economic structural adjustment , persist in doing a good job of economic structural adjustment in the course of development , and maintain the rapid development while making economic structural adjustment , we will certainly usher in a still more glorious and splendid future .  
Under the " Ninth Five-year Plan " in particular , despite the complicated domestic and international situations , China 's national economy still sustained rapid and healthy development ; the GDP grew at an average rate of 8 percent a year , and it is estimated that the year 2000 ' s GDP will top more than 8.7-trillion yuan , or more than $ 1-trillion at today 's exchange rate .  
B : The new challenges and new opportunities require us to have the correct , proper new ideas that go with the flow but also are realistic and practical for us .  Our economic construction should never again embark on a developmental path of extensive expansion .  We should no longer pursue rapid growth only in terms of the total economic volume .  
To ensure sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development in Tibet , the party Central Committee has adopted eight major preferential policies for the region , including fiscal , financial , investment , foreign trade , as well as agricultural , animal-husbandry , and rural policies .

Since 1996 when the five-year northern border defense construction program was officially kicked off , leading organs concerned at all levels have laid emphasis on improving the border defense infrastructure , enhancing the use of high technologies in carrying out defense duties , strengthening the construction of basic command and communications networks , and boosting the rapid reaction capability to deal with emergency situations along the border .  For this , they have acquired funds from various sources and made an overall plan to work in a scientific way .  
At present , our military units have composite decontamination equipment , multifunctional and rapid decontamination equipment , and one-man decontamination equipment , thus forming a complete equipment system .  Such a system , which is comprehensive in function and in technical means , can do a good job in decontaminating the pollution caused by nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons .  Our military units can enter an area contaminated by nuclear and chemical pollution to carry out decontamination work .  
Over the past year since Macao 's return , as neighboring economies have begun to recover , especially the motherland economy in the hinterland has seen sustained and rapid growth , the SAR Government has focused on economic recovery and development in managing government affairs and has devoted efforts to improving both an investment environment and a business environment and to improving social order as well and this has enhanced investors ' confidence step by step .  
Looking into the future , we can vaguely see a great blueprint of even greater grandeur : The Chinese Navy will be able to achieve a qualitative leap in its early warning , mobile , anti-submarine , air defense , electronic warfare , rapid response and other capabilities , and will be able to achieve a new improvement in its comprehensive combat capability under modern conditions .  
The rapid development of modern aircraft-borne weapons systems ; the surface-to-air missile units which are capable of reaching high-precision hit rates , fast operational response , wide shooting ranges and multiple targets ; and the anti-aircraft artillery units have formed into an air defense system of crossing firepower at high , medium-high , and low altitudes .  
From an overall perspective , China faces a good domestic and international environment for the development of foreign economic relations and trade next year ; global trade is expected to maintain a certain level of growth , and China 's domestic economy will continue to maintain fairly rapid growth .  
After the establishment of socialism in China , its age-old image of poverty and weakness underwent a rapid change ; regardless of repeated frustrations and complications , China 's economic growth rate was among the highest in the world , its gross national product jumped forward to rank seventh in the world .  
Facing the challenges of the global military revolution and the rapid development of science and technology , only by incessant knowledge refreshment and quality enhancements can officers meet the requirements of winning future high-technology wars .  
In recent years , China has faced complex domestic and international economic conditions .  In spite of this , China 's economy has continued the trend of sustained , rapid , and healthy growth .  
China sustained , rapid , healthy development during the period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan must first be attributed to the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the center .  Their outstanding leadership skill in economic control and in flexible economic adjustment brought about the success , as did the incisive reforms by the macroeconomic adjustment departments .  The increased pace of the change of functions provided the beneficial conditions .  
Showing the entire process of the operation of Air Force radar units , including rapid deployment , line erection , combat warning , rush repairs , and troop withdrawal , this war game , which was close to actual combat , served to display the high mobility of our radar units in the face of the " soft " and " hard " antipersonnel forces of the " enemy " under actual-combat conditions , as well as their capabilities to accurately and rapidly discover and handle enemy movements .  
At the same time , with rapid scientific and technological development , the growing dominance of the knowledge economy and network economy in social and economic development , and continual acceleration of economic globalization , the contests of scientific and technological , economic , and comprehensive national capabilities are becoming increasingly fierce .  
NPC deputy Zhan Zhongfu cited an example : Take " representing China 's advanced social productive forces " ; how could we speed up development during the Ninth FYP , when we faced the main trend of economic globalization , the rapid development of the revolution in science and technology , and fierce international competition ?

A certain unit in the navy has actively explored adapting to the new path of future warfare , characterized by rapid and cross-territory emergency support logistics , realizing the two great leaps of changing from the one type of solitary missile support unit of the past to multiple series and multiple types of missile support , and from transferring missiles from reserves for support into direct provision of real-fire missile support to operational troops .  This has enabled the troops ' missile support capability to manifest historic changes .  
Seize the opportunity created by global restructuring , speed up structural readjustment , effect the two fundamental changes , and maintain the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  Such is the new thinking on economic development during the Tenth Five-Year Plan . It is the concrete expression of our intent to make development the keynote as well as a prominent feature of the Tenth Five-Year Plan .  
Xiong Mingfeng ( research fellow of Strategy department of Military Science College ) : Suppose the interception process starts with the launch of missiles by the enemy ; sensors in space first discover and report that a threatening launch has occurred , and then the national defense support satellites and space-based infrared system issue a warning of potential danger from this missile launch , and guide the radar to activate the " search grid " ; when enemy missiles are discovered , the combat control center commences rapid assessment of the interception plan .  
At this time , we must do an outstanding job on the following key links : first , we must entirely eliminate market barriers to realize self-motivated commodity trading and free commodity circulation and to ensure timely and rapid transportation of domestic agricultural products to the international market .  
The insufficient development of the tertiary industry is a principal problem existing in China 's industrial structure .

Over the past few years , in particular , under the conditions of a large base figure of population , limited per capita resources , and relatively backward economic and scientific and technological levels , our rapid economic development has brought enormous pressures to the originally weak ecological environment , so that the situation in environment is even grimmer .  
Even though in the case of a joint combat battlefield centering around ground forces the traditional one-dimensional support model for covering the entire in-depth battlefield may still ensure combat needs , with the unprecedented rapid development of multidimensional space in the joint combat battlefields of the future , only through the comprehensive utilization of a variety of support methods in multidimensional space will it be possible to ensure the demand of combat operations for logistical support .  
At the same time , in order to cope with sudden situations , organize mobile support forces which have advanced support methods and implement pre-support for the various support zones , using an organic combination of basic support forces and mobile support forces to seek stable , rapid , and effective technical support .
