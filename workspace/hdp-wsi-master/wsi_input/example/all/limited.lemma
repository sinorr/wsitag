These procedures mainly involve issues with regard to national security , public safety , macro manipulation , environmental protection , development and use of limited natural resources , public resource deployment , public health and interests and safety of lives and property , for which administrative licenses can be granted in line with the Administrative Licensing Law of the People 's Republic of China .  
Tieying Li pointed out that China would actively promote the strategic restructuring of state-owned enterprises using the principle of " grasping the large ones and letting the little ones go " as a major premise .  When rebuilding state-owned enterprises into limited companies and stock companies with multiple principle investments and reasonable stock rights structure , and when using capital as the link for structuring parent-subsidiary corporate systems to smooth out reasonable internal group relations , we need to prevent administrative " mandatory matching " and " arbitrarily creating piles " .  
By further increasing cooperation with overseas , and actively introducing foreign capital , technology and management experience , it accelerated the development and utilization of China 's limited oil and natural gas resources in order to make it meet the developing needs of China 's national economy .  
The National Foreign Exchange Management Bureau clearly stipulated in the new method that , domestic institutions borrowing international commercial loans externally are only limited to : China-capital financial institutions approved by the Foreign Exchange Management Bureau to operate foreign exchange loan business ; juridical people of non-financial corporations approved by the State Department 's Authorization Department .  
After three years of experimentation , issuance methods and features of transferable bonds are accepted domestically , henceforth loan bodies will make choices in areas such as transferable bonds , bonds and bank loans , etc . according to personal characteristics and market demand , optimizing financing structure ; systematically developing issuance of project financing bonds , ABS , etc . , with no recourse or limited recourse , thereby reducing the pressure of financial institutions in foreign lending , promoting project management to become international , to become scientic , and to become transparent .  
However , China is still much engaged in her own domestic development , and has limited national strength .  For this reason we are selecting those key areas or key links that have favorable prospects , where the degree of industrial linkage will be significant , and which can drive the entire mechanism for critical breakthroughs , and through these we will vigorously strive to realize a leap in high-tech development .  
The main bodies of investment should be as diversified as possible , enterprises of the competitive industries should be gradually restructured to become companies with limited liability or companies limited by shares , which are held by multiple shareholders , large-sized enterprise groups should be reformed according to the structure of parent companies and subsidiaries and , where conditions permit , enterprises can be listed in overseas stock markets .  
As far as military strategy was concerned , the United States had adopted a new set of operational methods for high-technology limited warfare following the end of the cold war , but NATO 's operational methods and command systems had not departed completely from the operational approach designed for the prospect of fighting big battles with the Soviet Union . Therefore , there was a lack of coordination between them in the operations .  
Meanwhile , we should also see that the satisfactory economic efficiency attained by state enterprises last year was closely linked with the policy support of the state , besides the hard efforts made by the enterprises .  This year , however , the space for increasing profits through the policy factor is limited , and the task of realizing the three-year target for reform and the difficulty relief of state enterprises has therefore proved extremely arduous .  
In the beginning of the transitional leap , since our experience was limited , and our funding was insufficient , we were in this kind of " point by point developmental mode " and special project construction had was logically based , but by now we should have already arrived at " unification " - - systems integration - - time .  We must conclude the separate explorations of the initial period and enter an integration phase as soon as possible .  
In order to overcome several limitations of their combat vehicles , including a long and wide body , a limited field of vision , and so on , the regiment organized its vehicle crew to drive the " Dongfeng " Type-145 truck for a week first in order to find out and feel all sorts of functions and parameters of their extra-long and extra-wide heavy-duty vehicles and this laid a psychological and technological basis for them to drive or operate their light armored vehicles .  
Given the characteristics of modern wars , particularly the several limited wars over the past several years , warring parties without exception directed their primary attacks and their surgical strike targets at the enemies ' command centers .  Once the command center is destroyed or sustains heavy damage , defeat is only a matter of time .  
Because of limited resources for scientific research , relatively obsolete equipment , and shortage of capable innovators , we must uphold the policy of carrying out innovations selectively , stress the principal needs , and accurately select the areas where we will make the breakthroughs so that we can use the limited resources on innovative research projects .  With respect to innovative scientific research , we should realize that , while we are falling behind developed countries , we should have confidence in our own strength , which is more important .  
The $ 60-billion limited " Star War " missile defense , in US official language , is to counter the threat from so-called " rogue states " ( recently the United States has changed their names to " concerned countries " ) because those countries possess or are developing guided missile system and are threatening or will threaten the security of the United States and its allies within five years .  
China 's funds for national defense construction are all used for protecting state security and territorial integrity .  China keeps the army in condition but will not engage in unjust military ventures .  The limited military expenditures are used to raise the living standard of officers and soldiers and improve weapons and equipment .  
To meet with the " limited " strategic missile defense task requirements , the US Defense Department 's Ballistic Missile Defense Bureau has made , in line with the mass production principle , unified arrangements for the research projects of the TMD and NMD systems under the BMD plan .  The ultimate purpose is to enable these defense systems to coordinate with each other in combined operations , to jointly deal with a series of threats , and to provide a " nearly seamless defense network for the United States and for its allies " .  
A limited war is to strictly select military and non-military targets and employ the most accurate and " humane " attack .  The tactics itself shows the political nature and purpose of war , but more and more economic targets of the other side with war potential will be included in targets for attack by firepower .  
Even when China is developed and powerful in the future , China 's military capability will always be defensive in nature and be limited to satisfying the minimum security requirement of being able to defend the country 's sovereignty , territorial integrity , and legitimate interests .  
Such infiltration is not limited to the ideological and cultural fields , but has also be extended to the economic , political , military , scientific , and technological fields .  In their exchanges with us , they also brought ideological things along with them .  
Now that China has constantly enhanced her national strength in an all-round way , generally speaking , the Sino-US relations are expected to move forward in spite of frequent friction , and out of considerations for its own strategic interests , the United States is also expected to carry on its arms sales to Taiwan within limited space only . 
China 's satellite project was developed under conditions where China 's basic industries were relatively weak , where the science and technology level was rather backward , and where the state finances were limited .  Through a long period of arduous struggle , by the end of the year 2000 , China altogether launched 48 different types of artificial satellites .  
Focusing on the objective conditions of limited national investment , and a fairly small number of satellites to design and manufacture , we must correctly select development paths where the technological leaps are the greatest , strengthening the advance research of key technologies , and constantly realizing fairly large technological advances , raising by the greatest margin the level of satellite engineering .  
The Clinton administration proposed a limited defense system which was confined to a land-based deployment .  According to the plan , a system composed of 100 interceptors would be built inside the country which was capable of dealing with about 20-30 attacking ballistic missiles .  There was no plan to build up a system of a larger scale .  
Cai added : Over the past few years , neo-interventionism centered on such theories as " human rights overriding sovereignty , " " sovereignty being limited , " and others have caused a great clamor , and certain countries have adopted a double standard on the issue of human rights and have interfered in other countries ' internal affairs on the pretext of humanitarianism , and this has posed a new threat to the world peace and security .  
In reality , logistics service forces are not merely limited to " hard " services , such as material supplies , public health services , repairs , transportation , and engineering , but they should also provide information and other " soft " services .  In this way , they are able to properly bring their joint logistics capabilities into full play at opportune moments and in proper places .  
The Japanese Government has ignored repeated solemn representations of the Chinese Government and calls for justice from within Japan and decided on the evening of 20 April to issue a Japanese visa to Lee Teng-hui , on the excuse of so-called " humanitarian grounds " and " non-involvement in political activities and being limited to medical purposes , " thereby giving the green light for Lee Teng-hui to visit Japan .  
Disregarding the several solemn representations of the Chinese Government and the strong objections voiced by the Japanese people of all walks of life , the Japanese Government had finally decided , on the evening of 20 April , to issue a visa to Lee Teng-hui for his visit to Japan . This visa was granted under the pretext of so-called " humanitarianism " and under the condition that the visit is limited to only medical treatment , without engaging in any political activity . 
According to the experienced Indian military analyst ( Kapil Kaq ) , " this joint military exercise is multilevel and is also the first time that India has shown that it has already made preparations in pragmatic fashion for fighting a limited conventional war ; India 's conventional military forces remain in a high state of combat readiness and will sternly retaliate on a large scale against an enemy . "  
Over the past few years , in particular , under the conditions of a large base figure of population , limited per capita resources , and relatively backward economic and scientific and technological levels , our rapid economic development has brought enormous pressures to the originally weak ecological environment , so that the situation in environment is even grimmer .  
Article 2 : These guiding opinions are applicable to those joint stock limited companies that were formed in accordance with the " Company Law " and are planning to make an initial public offering of shares ( hereinafter referred to as " companies planning to issue shares to be listed on the stock market " ) within the People 's Republic of China .  
Article 17 : Other enterprises that are looking to incorporate companies planning to issue shares to be listed on the stock market shall form joint stock limited companies in compliance with the relevant provisions in the " Company Law " and in accordance with the requirements for standardized restructuring and complete reorganization , or they shall incorporate as joint stock limited companies by undergoing a complete transformation .  
P'an Chia-yu , instructor of Taiwan 's " Armed Forces University " , pointed out : If the PLA adopts the sudden attack strategy against Taiwan , the United States can respond only with its current cambat capability .  Without long-ranch fighters and forward bases , the United States has very limited capability to counter the PLA 's attack on Taiwan . In a modern war that emphasizes quick decision , US rescue to Taiwan would be too slow to meet the urgent need when the PLA launches an attack on Taiwan .  
US domestic and foreign policies will definitely have a tremendous effect on the world because of the United States ' superpower status in the world .  In particular , the readjustment of US military strategy will not be limited to US security only .  We can see that the political scheme and economic needs from that readjustment will have a major impact on the international political structure and strategic environment of the entire 21st century .  
Any limited liability company in which the state owns shares ( including companies listed overseas ) making initial public offers or issuing additional shares must offer 10 percent state shares based on the total amount of capital raised .  
The fact that radar antenna occupies huge space , radar includes many parts , and radar equipment has limited functions will bring problems to the task of mobilization and transfer .  In order to overcome the problems , the unit has organized a small group for technological innovation , and fully applied more than 20 innovation achievements to this model of radar .  As a result , the unit has resolved such problems as below-standard transmitting power of the radar launcher and weak signals received by the receiver .  
Official responsible for legislative affairs : Revision has been made in the following aspects : 1 .  To strictly guard against and severely crack down on illegal and criminal activities of printing pirated registered trademarks and forging and altering various kinds of papers , strict measures for the management of printing registered trademarks have been clearly stipulated and rules for the management of printing special papers , such as academic degree certificates , records of formal schooling and other scholastic documents , have been stipulated .  The scope of printing business of individuals has also been limited .  
As for the " financial or debt " question , it is a concept based on years of the accumulative total and theoretical reckoning .  The debts that can really be directly incorporated into the finance or be shared by the fiscal finance are very limited .  
Wen Jiabao said : The key to successfully develop the country 's vast western region lies in the adjustment of industrial structure .  For this purpose , we should strengthen the role of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy .  Particularly , we should not overlook the current conditions of a large population and limited farmland as well as an increasing population and decreasing farmland .

Gao cited the need for active research into the " qualified foreign institutional investor system " of certain countries and areas .  Combining such a system with the actual situation in China , the limited , gradual entry of foreign investors into China 's securities markets will be allowed , as will the use of foreign capital to purchase stock ownership in some enterprises in competitive industries .  This will gradually open China 's capital markets completely to foreign investors .  
In doing the anti-drought work , we must make overall plans , take all factors into consideration , bring about temporary as well as permanent solutions to the problem , and give comprehensive treatment by combining engineering measures with biological measures and management measures , combining capital construction of water conservancy works with construction of ecological environment , and combining rational development with strict protection and scientific utilization in a bid to properly manage , protect , and utilize the limited water resources .  
The government 's investment in the development of science and technology is limited by its financial resources , and it can not attend to each and every aspect of the development of science and technology but should be responsible mainly for organizing , administering , and funding basic research and make necessary coordination and providing necessary funds for projects to tackle key difficult problems in advanced technology ; as for the general development and application of science and technology , they should be left to enterprises .  
With regard to the attempt of the United States to deploy its advanced TMD [ theatre missile defense ] in northeast Asia in the course of developing its NMD , Sha Zukang pointed out that this has constituted a direct threat to the effectiveness of China 's existing limited nuclear force .  
We must obtain maximum results from our limited resources , form a complete set of effective mechanisms for competition , appraisal , and supervision , optimize the distribution of the science , technology and productive forces of the whole society , promote the ties , integration and cooperation between the military and civilian scientific research structures , and enable the achievements in technological innovation to be turned faster and better into productive forces for national defense and economic development .  
In the face of this gratifying situation , the official responsible for the State Metallurgy Industrial Bureau reminded that the current economic recovery and favorable turn in efficiency is initial , restorative , and limited .  The supply-demand relationship of the rolled steel market is still fragile and there could still be a lack of demand in the market .  
Wang Ke pointed out : Working hard and perseveringly , and building the army through industry and thrift are Chairman Jiang 's persistent requirements of our army 's logistics construction .  We must unswervingly grasp management and unremittingly turn to management for efficiency and maintenance and supplies .  We must willingly serve the overall situation of national economic construction , pursue careful calculation and strict budgeting in all aspects in a highly responsible manner , manage and use the limited funds with good results , and live an austere life well .  
The CMC stressed the need to finish all the tasks of reducing the size of the armed forces by half a million in the last year of the three-year deadline .  Moreover , the armed forces should concentrate their limited financial resources on striving to effect , in the shortest possible time , a complete change from a manpower-intensive and numerically large type to a technology-intensive and quality-based efficient one to ensure that they can cope with a hi-tech local war that may break out at any time .  
Modern war is a huge war of attrition , and Taiwan 's limited arms will be used up very rapidly , whereas the mainland has tremendous potential for fighting a war of attrition , and this determines that Taiwan will be unable to wage protracted war with the mainland ; and given the consumption of large numbers of arms and men , Taiwan will not be able to sustain the fight for long and its armed forces will collapse .  
In addition , since Taiwan lacks sufficient offensive weapons , and sufficient ground-to-ground missiles ( they only have the " Ching Feng " ground-to-ground missile developed by Taiwan itself , which is limited in numbers and range ) , they can not pose a strategic threat to the mainland , and are thus in a passive situation , and this has also weakened Taiwan 's defensive capability ; thus , after war breaks out in the Taiwan strait , the mainland will have sufficient offensive capability to break through the Taiwan defensive system .  
The " US National Interests Committee " which is composed of some strategic analysts also regards preventing those major global systems , including trade , financial markets , energy , and environmental realms , from disastrous collapse as a matter affecting the vital interests of the United States ( from the above-mentioned book about the US National Interests Committee , page 4 ) They believe that to ensure this kind of global interests , " the US resources are limited . "  
Designer Wang Huaiyi said that the research and development of a infrared remote sensor for space use is limited by the levels of a nation 's industrial , electronics , machining and other basic technologies .  If any one of these is unable to meet the demands of the project , the entire system will be impacted .  
The 21st century is a century in which the cause of space will attain flourishing development .  Under the state 's overall planning and unified leadership , China will select limited objectives , effect breakthroughs at key points , actuate sustained development , and make still greater efforts to explore the peaceful uses of outer space for mankind .  
As for the reason that the sources of news reports reprinted by non-news units are limited to those published by news units at and above the provincial level , the primary consideration is that these news units are the principal news-publishing units in this country , and their news reports are authoritative , accurate , and timely .  
He said : Compared with the mature markets , China 's securities markets still need to be further strengthened in terms of legislation , supervision , standardization , and so on .  There still exist such problems as insufficient extent of market standardization , lack of personnel and means for monitoring and controlling the conduct of market manipulation and the fraud of investors , limited extent of market internationalization , unitary market level and variety , and imperfect structure , among other things .  
These countries include Russia , mainland China , and some European allied countries .  Because the NMD system runs counter to the ABM Treaty signed between the US and Russia , Moscow has been strongly opposing it .  European allied countries also are worried that this will again trigger an arms race .  So , they also disagreed with this system .  Mainland China , in particular , also held that the limited number of NMD anti-missile interceptors of the US is aimed at intercepting the extremely small number of intercontinental ballistic missiles of the Liberation Army .  
High-level KMT officials were aware but fairly unconcerned about the likelihood of Liu Tai-ying and others deciding not to renew their party membership .  An unnamed high-level party official believes the popular will represented by Liu and others is limited .  
To obtain windfall profits , some criminal elements build connections with leading cadres in various ways and corrupt them by bribing them with a large amount of money or through providing them with sexual services .  Over-concentration of power in some cadres , a lack of transparency in the exercise of power as well as a lack of an effective oversight and check system against abuse of powers give rise to corruption like the exchange of power for money .  In addition , because of the state 's limited financial power , public servants ' pay is low .  
Li Chieh also indicated that , considering the operational management problems on the elongated Taiwan Strait , the numerous missiles deployed on shores , and the limited operational space in the Strait , if the Navy can carry out mobile ocean-going missions from a greater distance , the Navy 's operations would not be confined in the Taiwan Strait and could hinder Communist China 's military deployments and prevent it from mobilizing its full force into operations in the Taiwan Strait .  
Chang Lin-cheng said : Though this shows that the Taiwan side has unilaterally legalized the existing small-amount trade between the two shores , which had been previously banned by its law , and has lifted to a limited extent its ban on the Kinmen and Matsu residents visiting the mainland , since it has refused to make a positive response to one China , the introduction of the " mini three links " may on the contrary create more obstacles and will thus have only a limited impact on any substantial improvement in relations between the two shores .  
Since Clinton , who had come from " a remote and backward place , " had limited knowledge and experience , and his aides and staff also lacked experience , he repeatedly made mistakes after he assumed office .  In less than two years , he lost nearly all his political capital .  In the mid-term election , the Republicans controlled both the Senate and the House of Representatives overnight , thus rewriting US history .  
The article , entitled " Uphold the One China Principle , Promote Direct Cross-strait ' Three links , ' " says that the so-called " mini three links " refer to links between Jinmen and Mazu and the Fujian coastal region .  On 13 September 2000 , through an assessment report on the so-called " mini three links , " the Taiwan authorities planned to adopt a gradual and partial method in opening limited Jinmen-Xiamen and Mazu-Fuzhou freight and passenger links , and applied the principle of " first freight , then passengers ;  
In addition , the government has imposed mandatory reductions on some industries with excess production capacity ( such as the textiles , iron and steel , and coal-mining industries ) and limited their output .  Enterprises that used backward technology or caused heavy pollution were ordered to close .  In response to market competition , moreover , some enterprises have closed their doors , gone out of business , suspended operations , or scaled back production .  
Because China 's relevant legal code is still not quite sound and comprehensive , its market mechanism not quite mature , and its capital market not fully open , some 70 percent of direct foreign investment in China are through joint venture and cooperation , with only a portion invested in wholly-owned companies .  Foreign investment through takeover and merger is still limited .  This will limit the massive flow of foreign capital .  
As a matter of fact , this time it was even more unjustified for Yoshiro Mori to use the same excuse as Putin did , because what the boat capsize incident involved are not limited simply to technical problems such as searching for the survivors , but also political and diplomatic issues of crucial importance to Japan such as relations between Japan and the United States . As the Prime Minister , how could he use the excuse " not right to intervene " ?  
In the face of WTO challenges , such as increased imports and foreign advanced marketing methods , Wang Jinshan said , supply and marketing cooperatives departments and affiliated organizations nationwide should make use of their limited time to further intensify reform , quicken the pace of development , and meet challenges with a positive posture .  
For other international human rights treaties it has joined , the United States always made reservation , statements , and understanding to ensure that their implementation would be strictly limited within the scope of the US Constitution and other laws , and could only be applied to the federal level and could not be applied to various states .  As a result , the international covenants are a sheer sheet of meaningless paper in the United States .  
However , in general , the current level and size of bilateral economic and trade cooperation is still quite limited , and a great potential has yet to be tapped .  The leaders of the five countries affirmed the steady development of bilateral trade with China , but also expressed concern over the existing problems .  For example , the volume of trade is not large enough ;  
In his speech , Deputy Wang Ke said : In doing the PLA 's logistic work , we must take the initiative to serve the needs of overall national economic construction .  At all times , we must maintain our fine traditions of hard struggle and building the army through diligence and thrift and must make a real effort to successfully manage and make good use of our limited money .  
" With the US equity market at an unprecedented high level , with limited scope for further cuts in US interest rates , with the Japanese economy still struggling for a revival and moderating economic growth in Europe , and with volatile currencies and greatly reduced market liquidity , it is inevitable that the investment performance of the Exchange Fund in 1999 will be affected .  
The spokesman appealed to the SSA staff to follow the civil service team to uphold their duties and responsibilities under limited resources in the benefit of the general public , especially the social security recipients were mostly the elderly , the disabled and those in need of urgent financial assistance .  
The limited effect of the controlled explosion during the disposal demonstrated that there was no explosives left from the previous blasting at that location .  Therefore the question as to who should be responsible for leaving behind any explosive does not arise in this case .  
In addition , doctors in public hospitals may , at the request of the patients , prescribe items which have limited available scientific evidence to show their cost-effectiveness , offer minimal additional medical benefit to patients over available alternatives , or may not be considered as essential for the patients ' medical treatment .  
All limited companies incorporated in Hong Kong , including listed companies , are required under the Companies Ordinance to send financial documents that are to be laid before the company at a general meeting to their shareholders , debenture holders and other entitled persons ( " shareholders and relevant persons " ) not less than 21 days before the date of the meeting .  
The Government had identified three possible options to tackle the problem of soccer betting .  These included : ( i ) updating the Gambling Ordinance to tackle cross-border gambling activities ; ( ii ) stepping up enforcement actions against illegal soccer gambling ; and ( iii ) providing limited regulated outlets for soccer betting .  
As I have emphasized , public housing rental levels reflect the level of subsides for public housing provided by the general public .  How to balance the different interests and how best to utilize limited social resources call for collective wisdom .  I welcome the concern expressed by Members and the public on housing policy matters .  I sincerely hope that Members will come forward with constructive views to help the Government formulate and implement housing policies that meet the needs of our citizens .  
Published by Canada 's Fraser Institute in conjunction with the US-based Cato Institute , and a network of independent institutions in 54 other nations , the Economic Freedom of the World : 2002 Annual Report ranked 123 nations on economic freedom which include such core elements as personal choice , voluntary exchange , freedom to compete and protection of persons and property , all of which requires the rule of law , property rights , limited government intervention , freedom to trade , and sound money .  
" Project beneficiaries include those who are homeless , people displaced and living in interim housing estates , youth with limited life skills or work options , single parents , new arrivals , the unskilled and unemployed , people with disabilities and elders who have retired early or in need of community-care . "  
The Government is committed to ensure that the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance ( CSSA ) Scheme is effective and sustainable in the long run and that limited public resources are used in the most optimal manner to meet the rising caseload , the Secretary for Health , Welfare and Food , Dr Yeoh Eng-kiong said .  
In conclusion , despite the financial stringency faced by the Government and the Housing Authority , I am confident that we can make use of our limited resources to implement the three main pillars of our housing policy , namely , helping low-income families gain access to affordable housing , minimising intervention in the market and maintaining a fair and stable operating environment for the healthy development of the private property market .  
Initial enquiries revealed that after the close down and self winding-up of a limited company running a restaurant in Kam Tin , the ex-manager , a 25-year-old man , was believed to have conspired with ex-employees and some other persons to make fraudulent claims to the Labour Department by providing false information pertinent to an overstated amount of salaries earned by the employees .  
The public consultation exercise is to seek public views on : ( a ) the introduction of a scoring system for assessing , in a more objective and systematic manner , the relative ecological importance of sites with the objective of reaching a consensus within the community on the priority sites for enhanced conservation ; and ( b ) practicable ways to better conserve ecologically important sites that are under private ownership within limited resources .  
First , both of them challenge one 's ability to execute complex ideas within limited space .  The ingenious enthusiasts of miniature landscapes set out to capture and reverberate the eternal rhythm of the universe in small pots or trays , while stamp designers strive to contain rich history and culture knowledge in the tiny space the stamp allowed .  
The public consultation exercise is to seek public views on the introduction of a scoring system for assessing , in a more objective and systematic manner , the relative ecological importance of sites with the objective of reaching a consensus within the community on the priority sites for enhanced conservation ; and practicable ways to better conserve ecologically important sites that are under private ownership within limited resources .  
In the past , surface communications between northern and eastern Taiwan were more or less limited to the Suao-Hualien Highway , a one-way road traversing rugged mountains which is both dangerous and easily disrupted by landslides during typhoons or other periods of heavy rain .  
Because crabs need constant supervision , their culture is not an easy task . The supply of snails for their diet is also limited . But as standards of living have risen , and seafood restaurants have become more popular , crab farmers are assured of a handsome profit .  
Educational opportunities are extremely limited , with room in colleges for only 3% of the youth . Strict social controls make it difficult for peasants to escape their traditional agricultural roles ; such opportunities are rarer now than they were before 1949 . Indeed , the mainland China of today has become quite conservative : those in positions of authority are mostly from poor agricultural backgrounds with little formal education .  
The reason for this is that no organization - - not even the art galleries , with their more limited scope - - had ever been capable of bringing together artists and answering their need for a congenial place in which to show their works . Furthermore , the genesis for the idea of this museum lay in that there had not been any attempt at a complete , systematic collecting of post-Ching dynasty Chinese art in modern Chinese history .  
The limited number of winners and the extreme conditions required to earn this distinctiondiligent adherence to duty and training , coupled with the crucial element of cooperation among the soldiershave served to raise the standard of a fighting spirit , help establish a military " model unit " , and an efficacy of military strength .  
You ca n't help but become hungry , yet the exquisite dessert is almost too lovely to eat . As you come to your senses you realize that you are not standing in a French patisserie , but rather a bakery in the heart of Taipei , about to enjoy one of Taiwan 's most recent popular desserts - - the fruit tart . Fruit tarts and other French pastries first appeared in Taiwan over 20 years ago , but were limited to the restaurants in international hotels .  
This added to the fact that Soochow is blessed with an abundance of water , fertile soil and a favorable climate , helped to produce some of the most breathtaking scenery in China . The intellectual pool that was present in Soochow combined with the natural conditions to mold the limited space into a realm of boundless beauty .  
Q : Now that the R . O . C has severed diplomatic relations with Nicaragua , it is rumored that Uruguay may establish ties with the Mainland . In the face of international political realities , it is very difficult for the R . O . C to appeal to " morality " and limited agricultural and economic aid as a basis for diplomacy . How should we deal with this situation ?  
Tomatoes , both a vegetable and a fruit , command a good price in the market . Chinese cabbage and mungbean sprouts , made with green lentils , are mainstays of Chinese cuisine , while sweet potatoes , high in nutrition and needing small inputs of manpower to grow , can be a main or side dish , or an animal feed . Biologists selected the all-important soybean in part because they wished to lower its high cost and make it more suitable to Taiwan , with its limited arable land .  
But after 30 years as an ambassador I 've come to one conclusion about international relations : exhortations to another country about shared feelings , morality , and fighting the common enemy , while not completely useless , are certainly limited in effect ; what 's needed is a relationship of shared interests built on a realistic basis .  
The aborigines ' food is mostly boiled or roasted and rather bland - - spices are limited to salt , hot pepper , ginger , and honey .  
During the Japanese occupation , the Japanese army surveyed the island 's mountain roads , but many of them were already long overgrown with brambles and wild grass . In addition , the paths used by the aboriginals on their hunts were not suitable for climbers , especially with the primitive equipment available to them at the time . As a result , climbing was a matter of going step by step through dense forests , and up unknown ridges , so most climbers limited themselves to familiar mountains like Yushan and Hsuehshan .  
Take water sleeves for example ; the extent of expression that can be conveyed by an actor 's hand movement is limited . After adding the sleeves , not only is the meaning of the opera deepened , but also it can make the graceful and tender figure more noticeable and give the viewer a strong and sharp sensation . If a sense of despair is to be expressed , then both sleeves are lifted high into the air at the same time .  
The former was limited to a few enthusiasts for the transcendent and sublime ; the latter appealed through claims of instant success , guaranteed universal cures and enhanced sexual performance , but its vulgar " packaging " ensured that its influence was only restricted to a narrow field .  
Thereafter , enticed by financial inducements or simply duped into going , millions of coolies accepted a modest payment and contracted to work for a limited period in tin mines or in the rubber , tea and sugar plantations of Southeast Asia . Others set off further afield to dig for guano in Peru , build railways in America , work in the gold mines of Australia and South Africa , or work behind the lines on the Great War battlefields of Europe .  
Despite the low completion rate for advance sales of new housing , the fact that the land was often bought at a time when prices were booming , together with high advertising costs , have meant that construction companies have only limited capacity to absorb the development costs themselves . From the consumer 's point of view , buying in advance and paying as the building nears completion offers an excellent way for salary earners to pay by instalment . Thus prices have only fallen by a meager 10-20% .  
We never thought we would buy a house in Hsichih , " says Hsiung Shu-hua , a public relations employee at Philips . She grew up in Hsichih but the place always seemed a bit of a backwater , awkward to get to and limited by its traditional rural economy , so when she got married three years ago she and her husband moved out to rented accommodation in Neihu .  
This deeply depressed me , and I decided to give up athletics , " Tsai explains . After seeing an international meet , he began to think that his body was unexceptional and his skills inferior . By further taking into account the limited athletic resources in the R . O . C . , he decided that in the next few years he had no way of achieving success .  
" We have to fight as few battles that we 're not sure of winning as possible to avoid wasting limited resources on meaningless frays , " says Minister of Foreign Affairs Fredrick Chien , who states that our current foreign policy is oriented mainly toward regional , economic and functional areas .  
Some child abuse is brought on by bad behavior , which is reinforced by improper methods of child-rearing , creating a vicious cycle , " Ho Su-chiu says . The responsibilities of foster parents in a case like that is n't limited to caring for the child 's daily needs . They also have to correct the child deviant behavior , so they need to employ extra skill and energy .  
Insufficient financial and human resources are the reason why handicapped athletics has never been popularized in this country , " says Ho Mao-sung . The CPAA was established seven years ago , but it only has made annual expenditures of NT $ 100,000 ( NT $ 200,000 this year ) , and the amount its volunteer director , secretary-general , and assistant secretary-general are able to accomplish is limited .  
Apart from the ups and downs of the political economic situation , Schmidt especially stressed the pessimistic outlook for the environment , raising the problem of population growth and limited resources adding to the worsening of the greenhouse effect and leading to unlimited tides of human migration . "  
Take Taipei as an example : Heavy traffic flows along the main roads and spreads out into narrow lanes which are full of parked cars and motorcycles ; real plans to give pedestrians more space are limited with expanded tiny sidewalks becoming spaces for illegal parking and crudely designed underpasses turning into dark , no-go areas .  
The promotion and advertising of formula in less developed nations has created the mistaken belief that formula is superior to mother 's milk . Yet because of limited wealth , local women thin the formula out , so that children do not get enough nutrition . Also , there is no safe , clean water , and purification and disinfecting are inadequate , so the infant mortality rate is extremely high .  
" It has passed from the youthful stage of development into the mature period , and now artificial factors are pushing it towards premature old age , " says Lin Yung-teh , explaining that even in the early period after Cheng Cheng-kung arrived in Taiwan , the clearing of land for farming , the quarrying and mining and the steps taken to control the wild rivers quickly began to affect the supply of silt downstream ; however , the potential for creating environmental disasters was very limited compared with today 's development .  
Such is the case with Chinpao Shan 's Tsao Ji-chang , who makes his complex very clear . " Most mainlanders have a wily nature : great at talking , loving to argue but not liking hard work ; they are very suitable for thinking up ideas and moving their mouths , but their sincerity is limited . They often put profit before right , and let the boss lose out . "  
Generally speaking , only to research each other is not enough . Of course , the reasons involved are very complicated . Speaking from my own limited knowledge of Western and Eastern culture , if there were one ideal state of affairs in this world , it would be a result of incorporating Western and Eastern cultural consciousness , extracting the essential kernels of each and doing away with the chaff . Perhaps that should be the objective of all mankind .  
He is worried that with the limited economic power of the Ami residents of the Shankuang Estate , as more and more high-rise blocks are built and large numbers of Han Chinese move in , the Ami will gradually lose the advantage they have enjoyed of forming the vast majority of the local population ; furthermore , each unit on the estate measures only around 65 square meters , so that as second generation residents marry , lack of space will force them to move off the estate , creating a threat to cultural maintenance .  
Swatting a fly with a hammerThe ingredients for Chinese medicine are taken from the natural world , and are limited by such factors as geographical spread . Unlike the supply of Western medicine , which is determined by factory production , the supply for Chinese medicine is not stable . Supply problems for ingredients used in Chinese medicine are nothing new , but over several thousand years , numerous plants have been found to have similar effects to those in short store .  
Lu Kuang-yang says that although musk deer , certain tortoises and horned toads are protected animals , if there is clear documentation about the sources of domestically sold medicinal ingredients and a ban on the use of threatened species , then associations of doctors and pharmacists can control themselves . With the Board of Foreign Trade handling all imports , medicinal ingredients can be stamped to show that they are legal and thus prevent smuggling . With " complete rules of the game , " he would then not object to unthreatened animals being used in limited quantities .  
Thailand 's Prince Bhisatej once publicly explained at an international agricultural conference that the agricultural assistance from every country was limited to either financial aid or the appointment of chosen specialists to draft a research report . Only the Republic of China 's specialists came in person to northern Thailand to help the Thais grow vegetables and fruit . This proved to be of enormous benefit to the daily lives of the local inhabitants of this district .  
If the subject is limited to manufacturing technology , then Taiwan companies have no huge advantage . Fortunately technology is just one element in commercial competition . Mainland manufacturers still offer too few styles , and use outdated materials . They are not like Taiwan firms , which can afford to bring in superior , more durable materials from abroad .  
Tachen Island is located off the coast of Zhejiang Province . It is a poor and obscure little place whose cuisine is largely limited to seafood . Thus , for example , their " ginger tea noodles " is made with dried fish , shrimp shells , and other seafood fried up with ginger and sesame oil added to the noodles . It 's a special dish that Tachen people give to postpartum mothers to help them regain their strength .  
Professor B . J . Habibie , Indonesia 's State Minister for Research and Technology , has said publicly : " At some stage Singapore , with its limited natural and human resources but rapid economic growth , is certain to reach a critical pressure , just like a balloon ; and Batam , 20km south of Singapore , is ready to catch the balloon which will be squeezed out of Singapore 's balloon . "  
Liu Kuang-ming says that although the problem is complex , it is not inevitable that the day will come when fishermen are banned from having even a single shark in their nets . Instead , it would be better if , after surveys , endangered sharks ' breeding grounds can be protected , the amount of shark to be caught each year can be limited , or a set of practical measures can be devised as early as possible for the use of sharks .  
The Dutch and the Cheng family simply held a series of strong points , while the authority of the Ching was limited to the western plain and a small part of the east coast . The mountain areas , inhabited by indigenous peoples , were not under central government control .  
In the past , the SEF distinguished between negotiations at the levels of chairman , secretary-general , and vice-secretary-general , and the SEF official of a given level would only negotiate with a mainland counterpart at the same level . Now , in order to increase flexibility , there will not be hard and fast distinctions between the levels . Moreover , in the past there were only negotiations on limited issue areas . Now there will also be sub-units discussing economic and cultural affairs . "  
National Yang Ming University professor of public health Lan Chung-fu , who was the first to put forward a plan for health care network development , indicates that medical resources are precious and limited , and the main spirit of a health care network plan is : to reasonably distribute medical resources , to avoid inadequate supplies and to curb waste .  
Under the Japanese occupation , Taiwanese had limited access to higher education . Lien Wen-pin , now a famous doctor at National Taiwan University Hospital , went to the temple to ask about his academic future shortly before he finished high school . The poem he drew read " You climbed the high mountain to study the immortals / But then came the imperial edict / When the white sun shines forever in a blue sky / If you so desire your fame will spread across the four seas . "  
In fact , outside the charmed circle of leading business families are large numbers of ethnic Chinese whose forebears came as laborers , and who still live at a low economic level with limited educational opportunities , just like the rest of the population . For many young women from this background , marriage is a means of escape from a life of poverty .  
The hospital was on the ground floor , with the family 's living quarters above . On the landing , Peng 's mother would put pails of disinfectant and water , with which the children would have to wash themselves before being allowed upstairs . At a time of limited understanding of sanitary principles , when many Taiwanese children were malnourished , how Peng 's childhood differed from the vast majority of Taiwanese !  
The government units charged with protecting species are weak , their funding limited , and their enforcement abilities lacking , and so the lists must put priority on those species facing pressures from hunting and international illegal trade in their parts : " They have the practical need of resolving pressing problems in society first . "  
Because of administrative financial difficulties , their environmental conservation budget is limited . Many wildlife conservation activities are even limited to private lands . This has led to a reaction , in which many voices have arisen claiming that more human energy and material should be focused on protecting entire ecosystems and habitats .  
Are n't the ' gifted scholars and fine ladies ' of the book simply versions of today 's young ' dudes and babes ? ' " The Chinese notion of predestiny in human relations originated because there was only limited opportunity for meeting partners in olden times , but waiting for a predestined match these days-waiting passively for someone to catch you-is unhealthy and ' fatalistic ! '  
The idea of " mindset " should not be limited to " positive thinking , " as emphasized by Haruyama . It also should include imagination , which can far transcend the practical realities of society . Thought patterns characterized by imagination are unrestrained by ordinary standards , and do not bow down to " reality . " This is a way of thinking that emphasizes the future and creativity .  
However , a permanent solution to the problem was still required after the crisis abated . Thus , Taiwan , which because of its limited land area and dense population has developed unique intensive rice-farming techniques , stepped forward to play a major role in bringing about a kind of " green revolution . "  
According to ROC law , when a ship takes a foreign registry , when its catch is sent back to Taiwan , it is treated as imported , and customs taxes must be paid . This is a heavy burden . Moreover , to prevent the industry growing excessively and exhausting resources , the government gives only a limited number of licenses . Ships may be scrapped and replaced , but no new ones may be added .  
Li Chin-kuo , a graduate of the Institute of Zoology at National Taiwan University , has always been concerned about wildlife . After the FS Studio class , he used the limited amount of money that he had been able to save during his compulsory military service to buy a digital video camera and a second-hand car , and headed off to fishing villages in search of material .  
Of Taiwan 's offshore islands , because Kinmen and Matsu are in a high state of military readiness , it would be costly to attack them . Thus , the PRC could choose to assault those islands in the South China Sea which are currently occupied by ROC forces . Another possible form of small-scale military conflict would be the use of surface-to-surface guided missiles . Since the political effectiveness of such missiles against offshore islands would be limited , these would more likely be targeted against political or economic centers in Taiwan itself .  
Current pharmacological treatments of heart failure are effective , but limited . For example , digitalis increases vitality and athletic endurance , but the dosage must be very finely calculated or poisoning may result . Moreover , the drug 's effect on the mortality rate is still unclear . Diuretics quickly eliminate breathing difficulties and swelling caused by the retention of water , but do not keep the patient in stable condition over long periods .  
Chou , whose primary area of research is clinical statistics , states that most of this research is limited to extractions and animal research in the Chinese medical laboratory , or consists of individual case reports . It focuses on the search for individual problems and is not widely applicable general research . " Only a very few projects can really be said to have been designed as clinical trials . And even in these cases , the design is still rough .  
At present , the mainland 's economic development is limited by serious corruption , and by the growing disparity between the standards of living of rural and urban areas , and of the coast and the interior . If these problems can not be resolved , and with the pressure from the USA on the whole of Southeast Asia , the financial crisis will continue to worsen .  
" The tendency in the past was to stress the power of the central government . This limited the power and capabilities of local government , " says Woody Cheng , chief of the history teaching section at Feng Chia University . In Cheng 's opinion , the " patriarchal " political structure had the effect of turning government bodies below the provincial-government level into powerless " daughters-in-law ; " dependent upon the " patriarch 's " mood for their own allocations of money and power .  
In recent years , with advocacy by women 's groups and changing social and economic relations , the social participation and status of Taiwan women has begun to change . The legislature has passed a number of measures to make men and women more equal . However , Tang Wen-hui , an assistant professor in the graduate institute of political economy at National Chengkung University , believes that the public role of women in Taiwan is still limited by traditional family values , and that there has not been as much change as many might think .  
Another factor was that in the wake of Pearl Harbor , there were only limited numbers of fit , potential conscripts left in Japan , and with the expansion of the Japanese lines from the Pacific to Southeast Asia , the tough , hardworking aboriginal youths , with their knack for fighting in forested mountain terrain , naturally became a priority consideration .  
On the question of KPS setting up its own channel , Father Raymond Parent notes that when he was a member of the Government Information Office 's nine-member research team on cable television , he felt that the remit set by the GIO was too narrow , and the pace of legal reform too slow . With the chaotic situation of the time , when all cable channels were illegal , it would have been very difficult for KPS , with its limited financial resources , to enter this market .  
Twenty-eight-year-old Li Ching-yu went to senior high school and university in Canada , and graduated in economics . After he took over his father 's business four years ago , he introduced modern management methods . He not only redecorated and enlarged the premises , set up a limited company and instituted a profit sharing and stock ownership scheme for employees , but recently also embarked on an expansion plan calling for opening new branches , like a home-grown McDonald 's .  
This approach of marrying outside capital and technology with the rich local marine resources is one of the more feasible models by which the Taiwanese fishing industry , faced with limited opportunities at home , can develop overseas operations . The RMI , which has just established diplomatic relations with the ROC , is an ideal place for such investment .  
Because past surveys of Taiwan faults were mostly limited to examinations of surface geology , with no money to obtain more precise results by digging or drilling under the surface , major mistakes were common . Particularly in metropolitan areas where high real estate prices mean that all the land is covered by buildings , ruptures are impossible to see .  
In recent times , due to the limited productive value of its mainly agricultural economy , the township had become rather run-down and had been losing population to other areas . Nonetheless , it still had many distinctive historic features such as Chichi Railway Station and Minghsin Academy , along with traditional rural scenes such as tobacco fields , banana groves , fruit orchards and tree-lined roads . These assets had long ago given Lin the idea of using them as tourist resources to breathe new life into Chichi .  
On September 25 , the Executive Yuan met in extraordinary session to invoke emergency powers , define the boundaries of the disaster area and , for a limited period , suspend various laws and regulations that limit the central government 's discretionary authority over public expenditures , land appropriation , government procurement , and the use of material and equipment belonging to government agencies . The aim was to cut through red tape which could potentially obstruct disaster relief and reconstruction work .  
The programming for these time slots was low-budget , and the subject matter limited to ordinary life in Taiwan 's unsophisticated rural past , mostly tragic tales of mistreated daughters-in-law and the like , or family comedies . Thus , for a long time , Taiwanese drama gave people the impression of being lowbrow .  
In fact , Taiwan 's main parties-the KMT and the DPP as the two major parties , with the New Party as a noteworthy but limited third force-all understand the implications of James Soong 's powerful candidacy very clearly . They know that this election is not only a struggle for political office , but even more is a critical moment that may decide whether their respective parties develop , split up , or disappear .  
Given that education was run by and for government bureaucrats , those who studied did so only in order to further their ambitions and become officials . They cared little for knowledge or morality , or for the intrinsic value of learning . Philosophers realized that education and teaching materials lacked vitality and in fact limited people 's development in various ways . In order to escape the rigid and lifeless official education system , private education began to flourish .  
With the exception of the Yehliu facility , whose main selling point is cetacean ( whale and dolphin ) shows , most of the older aquariums , in comparison with the new ones , had few regular visitors and only limited fish-husbandry technology . Consequently most relied on short-term exhibits , such as special exhibits of precious marine life held at the lunar new year .  
When the Dutch took over Tainan , they encouraged the cultivation and export of cane sugar , a crop that grew exceptionally well on the Chianan Plain stretching out from Tainan in almost every direction . On the strength of this economic base , Tainan naturally became the political center of Taiwan . Although southern Taiwan is dominated today by Kaohsiung , back then the latter was just one of Tainan 's satellite ports , with development limited by heavy silting and shallow berths .  
This naturally makes local governments very reliant upon , and vulnerable to control by , the central government . Although the actual amount of the tax redistribution is limited , local governments have to shoulder most of the burden of maintaining infrastructure , social services , education , cultural activities , and more . Local finances are very strained as a result .  
The construction budget for the new terminal at CKS Airport , which opened in July , included a public art allocation of NT $ 100 million . Deciding how to handle this huge sum proved a difficult task for the project 's executive committee . Many people questioned whether public art has to be limited to the installation of permanent " works of art . "  
In Taiwan , there is no integration among the academic disciplines of zoology , botany , marine life , climate , soil conservation , and the like . Environmental protection agencies are weak , and research funding is limited . Thus there is little concrete knowledge about the numbers of various species and whether these numbers are rising or falling , not to mention any understanding of what concrete steps can be taken to solve specific problems .  
For most of history , the limited powers of our unaided senses left humans blissfully unaware of the micro-organisms all around us . But the development of optical instruments gradually lifted the veil from that hidden world , so that human ideas about life had to be constantly revised .  
In taxonomic terms , life on Earth was no longer limited to the animal and plant kingdoms , but new kingdoms-fungi , bacteria , and protoctista ( protozoa , algae etc . ) - had to be recognized , to bring the total number to five . Each of the kingdoms of micro-organisms is just as gigantic , rich and complex as the plant and animal kingdoms .  
Late 1996 saw the launching of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ( SOHO ) satellite , which was built in a collaborative project between the European Space Agency and NASA . SOHO 's missions include studying the sun 's internal structure and outer atmosphere , and the solar wind . But satellite observations are immensely costly , and satellites have a limited service life and a high risk of failure .  
Before the advent of acoustic imaging , the degree of understanding of the sun 's internal structure that could be gained from its surface oscillations was very limited . For instance , scientists were already aware that the cycle of sunspot activity is related to the way the north and south magnetic poles of the sun are reversed every 11 years . But where was the sun 's magnetic field located ?  
Take Citicorp , for example . Although it has a good image , offers comprehensive financial services , and is creative with its management methods , it has been frustrated to find that its business has remained limited to foreign firms and members of the economic elite . It has continued to be unsuccessful in entering the mass market .  
COA chairman Chen Hsi-huang , who earned his degree in agricultural economics at National Taiwan University ( NTU ) notes that Taiwan 's agricultural policies used to stress increased production-producing as much as possible on the limited land available . Consequently , Taiwan-produced canned champignon mushrooms and asparagus commanded 65% of the international market . Coupled with the export of massive amounts of sugar , rice , and bananas , this stimulated the formation of capitalistic agriculture which , in turn , helped prepare the way for the subsequent take off of industry .  
Because the basic aptitude test is only one hurdle , rather than ( as with the previous exams ) a one-shot effort to survey everything the student learned in three years of junior high school or high school , it can place more emphasis on the overall capabilities of the child . Thus , the scope is much broader-no longer limited to school textbooks-while the questions can be framed in a much more lively and flexible way .  
Chu reasoned that the initial translation was too dry to be successful . Moreover , the first translator 's understanding of the fantasy genre was too limited to fully evoke the fantastic macrocosm that Tolkien depicted in his work . Chu promised that this time around he would provide a much more vivid translation .  
Efforts to cut back on plastic waste shifted into a higher gear on January 1 with a measure restricting the use of plastic bags and plastic ( including expanded polystyrene , i.e . " styrofoam " ) disposable eating utensils . This marks the second phase of implementation of a policy that was first introduced on a more limited scale last July , when the government clamped down on the use of such items by government agencies , membership supermarkets for military personnel , and public and private schools .  
They include the medical teams of the International Cooperation and Development Fund , young men doing " overseas duty " as a substitute for military service , religious organizations , and individual doctors . They are performing a wide range of medical assistance activities not just limited to simple humanitarian aid , including donation of medical supplies , technical exchange in the field of public health , education and training , promotion of preventive medicine against epidemic illnesses , and " matchmaking " between people with certain medical needs and those who can provide what is needed .  
Thanks to the experience accumulated by the ICDF and other aid groups , NGOs providing medical aid need no longer be limited to satisfying the ambition of some romantically minded individuals to do good deeds . For example , the cleft lip and cleft palate surgery program of the Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation ( NCF ) in Vietnam , Cambodia , the Philippines , and elsewhere includes free consultations , technical instruction , equipment donation , post-surgery speech therapy , and so on , so that medical resources are applied in a systematic manner .  
" Currently , only 35 people a year are allowed to perform foreign medical service in lieu of military service , " Kay notes . " This is too small a number , and those performing this service should n't be limited to males of enlistment age . " Having grown up amid affluence , young Taiwanese often have a utilitarian bias . By performing overseas service , they can learn that " those who give always get more in return . "  
Each occasion of volunteer clinical services sponsored by Tzu Chi starts with sowing seeds at the local level . Assistance is not limited to medical care , moreover , but uses an integrated-team model that allows Tzu Chi operations to set down local roots , so that people can become independent and help themselves .  
When art therapy , which uses mental symbols and intuition , is applied to mental illness , sexual abuse , child abuse cases , or to children whose verbal understanding is limited , it is able to gradually lower the patient 's defense mechanisms , build a better relationship between patient and therapist and unearth the old stories that lie buried in the deepest recesses of the subconscious .  
In reality , neglected sites need not be publicly owned spaces , and they need not be limited to separate and distinct buildings . Idle spaces can be found everywhere . Their scope includes a single empty building , a sidewalk , a row of houses , or an abandoned or wild piece of land . " So long as spaces are n't managed well and do n't function well , then public and private spaces can both be included , " says Lin Po-nian , publisher of Space Magazine .  
The dominant influence of NTU-known as Taida to Taiwanese-in political circles can be seen in the fact that the " Taida Gang " accounts for more than 40 legislators , including members of both the governing and opposition parties . And the glory of Taida has not been limited to politics . As Taiwan has made the transition from agricultural to industrial to high-tech society , many NTU alums have from scratch developed chip processing , IC design , and the largest notebook computer factory in the world , similarly producing a brilliant record .  
Fortunately , after a decade of fighting the good fight , the kinds of books for women now available in mainstream bookstores are no longer limited to childcare and cooking . Moreover , now that there are so many venues for artistic and intellectual events , Fembooks is no longer indispensable for the spread of the ideas and creative work that it has long promoted . It seems that the bookshop 's mission , particular to its specific time and place in the history of feminism in Taiwan , has been accomplished .  
I 've noticed a trend : in recent years , a large number of works that have entered the market have been from the mainland-both original Chinese and translated works-and this has become one of the causes of the current rapid expansion of the Taiwanese book market . Moreover , these books are n't limited to the old academic and translated works , they 've now grown to include popular literature .  
He gives half the income from the restaurant to charity , and once a month he hosts a free dinner for a guest list that includes volunteer teachers and lonely elderly people with no families . He also works to promote environmental , conservation , and animal-rights values in the PRC , so that the vegetarian outlook on life can set down deeper roots , and not just be limited to eating habits or health .  
A year earlier , during the celebration of their anniversary in 1999 , they sold models of Taiwan 's earliest locomotive , the Tengyun , " Cloud Rider , " with the words " Remembering our Trains " carved on them . These models were a 1000-unit limited edition , with each selling for NT $ 35,000 ; no-one expected they would sell out in the space of a day-even the TRA were blown away .  
Can you remember road workers applying a mixture of asphalt and gravel on dirt roads ? How they would spread it lightly and evenly , laying down a black carpet ? Although asphalt smells unpleasant , we love the smooth surface of asphalt roads and the comfortable rides they provide . Indeed for most of us , our impressions about asphalt are pretty much limited to roads .  
The mountain Karen still make a living through such traditional methods as swidden farming , fishing , hunting and gathering , working hard to eke out an existence each and every day . However , as their numbers have increased , the limited availability of agricultural land and the impact of modernization and natural disasters have meant that they now lack adequate resources to meet their daily subsistence needs , and have been reduced to penury and perpetual shortage .  
Wu Huang , deputy secretary-general of the Energy Commission of the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( MOEA ) , explains further : " Precisely because the range of renewable energies is so diverse , each country has to direct its limited resources toward the development of selected areas in which it has an advantage . Thus Germany is developing wind power and Japan hydroelectric power . In Taiwan we hope to achieve a balanced development of hydro , wind , geothermal , biomass and photovoltaic energy sources . "  
Furthermore , modern people may lack ecological and environmental knowledge . Or they may know that natural resources are limited and that biodiversity is important , but be unable to refuse materialistic temptations , lack the time to recycle , and be powerless to refuse their children 's requests for the fashionable pet of the moment . More knowledge does not necessarily help in easing environmental deterioration .  
Hu herself admits to having a very active disposition , and she ca n't stand being idle . Her free time at home was limited , and during the downtime after the housework was finished she was always a bit edgy and thinking about how she could further her learning , so she took on the volunteer work at the library . Later she joined up with a study group run by the Mandarin Daily News , and finally , ten years ago , she moved on to the volunteer service at NTUH .  
While education reform is something that countries all over the world are engaged in , Prudence Chu-ing Chou , professor at National Chengchi 's University College of Education , finds it " unprecedented " that Taiwan , with its limited resources as well as inadequate accompanying measures , is pushing ahead with such sweeping education reforms in such a short amount of time .  
Dr . Hani introduced that the Afghan interim government submitted the government budget of the 2002 fiscal year of a total sum of 0.46-billion USD in the meeting of the Executive Team of Aids to Afghanistan held in April . Because the financial income of the interim government was very limited , there was a gap of 0.4-billion US dollars in the budget that needed to be filled up by international aids .  
In remote , rural areas , the programme was usually limited to the basic essential information , such as the meaning of the " red " and the " blue " ballots , and practice voting .  
Past mediation efforts have been shown to be insufficient because they were limited by a mandate lacking firmness , but also rendered more difficult by the diverse political interests of individual external forces .  
With its limited financial and human resources , it is trying to control the problem at the national level , and to contribute at a regional and international level in an integrated and comprehensive manner .  
They recalled the two mutually supporting forms of action by CSCE : those joint political decisions taken in accordance with consensus rules and direct action through agreed mechanisms activated by a limited number of participating States .  
Such strategies are however dangerous and difficult to reverse : surplus fishing vessels , once established in a fishery , may be difficult to displace , with limited alternative incomeearning opportunities , and a loss in economic yield will certainly occur .  
Deeply preoccupied by the increasingly heavy burden being imposed , particularly upon developing countries with limited resources of their own and upon the international community as a whole , by these sudden mass exoduses and displacements of population ,  
Inequitable distribution of resources , irrational duplication and overlapping of functions , limited authority at the local level , and uncoordinated efforts between public , private , voluntary and nongovernmental organizations still dominate the urban scene .  
In an environment of slow growth , lack of public and private resources , limited external assistance and constraints of technical , managerial and organizational capacity , the challenges in basic infrastructure are formidable .  
The number of deaths caused by contagious and all chronic noncontagious ( cardiovascular , respiratory ) as well as cancerous diseases has increased as a result of very limited possibilities for early detection and adequate treatment .  
The proposed initiative was designed to offer ways for the reasonable expression of plausible aspirations of that nature through free options ranging from limited and basic selfadministration to virtual internal selfgovernment .  
Account should be taken of such problems as extreme poverty , limited resources , dependence on primary commodities , proportional public debt , lack of basic infrastructures and insufficient administrative capacity .  
The number of deaths caused by contagious and all chronic noncontagious ( cardiovascular , respiratory ) , as well as cancerous diseases , has increased as a result of very limited possibilities for early detection and adequate treatment .  
But as ethnic conflicts spread and political solutions become more elusive , there is a risk that humanitarian operations could become prolonged , draining limited resources and causing untold suffering .  
Since before the 1980s , Central America had begun to suffer the effects of a deep political , economic and social crisis that came about precisely because national societies had developed within a system of limited democracy in particular , because social programmes were not formulated or executed , a doctrine of national security was promoted , political arenas were closed and civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights were violated in one way or another . 
First , France has not announced its intention to continue its nuclear testing indefinitely ; on the contrary , we have stated our decision to complete it by engaging in a final series limited to a few tests , which will be concluded before 31 May 1996 .  
They now face the challenging tasks of reviving and modernizing national institutions , designing and developing both the human and the physical infrastructures , and rebuilding the economy by revitalizing agriculture , industry and trade and social services all with extremely limited resources and formidable impediments . 
Poverty has various manifestations ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increased morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion ; it is also characterized by a lack of participation in decision-making and in civil and socio-cultural life . 
However , in order to use the limited resources in an optimal manner to meet these different needs a single comprehensive framework of training materials should be developed through modules that would be applicable to countries depending on their status and capability in national accounts .  
The months immediately preceding December last year marked such a deterioration in the political and security situation in Liberia that the number of military observers of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia ( UNOMIL ) had to be drastically reduced , the humanitarian situation worsened , and the area controlled by the Military Observer Group of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOMOG ) effectively became limited to no more than 15 per cent of the country . 
A main conclusion of this study is that eastern Kenya 's limited resource base and rapid rate of population growth require comprehensive rural and regional development planning .  
Our Government is more than determined to take the reins of its destiny and lead its people to the brightest , most peaceful and prosperous future that its current limited economic , infrastructural and organizational capacities can provide .  
The representative informed the members of the Committee that the Government of the Russian Federation , having realized that the monetarist underpinning of the first wave of economic reform provided only a limited set of social protection measures , had emphasized the provision of a proper level of social protection as the main requirement for the continuation of economic reform .  
Although there were guard posts at all gates and entry into the compound was limited to those who either held a regular pass or were given temporary passes , bogus passes , which were indistinguishable from the genuine ones , could easily be bought at the Bakara market of the city .  
Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure sustainable livelihoods ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increased morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .  
They typically possess limited institutional and human resource capacity to assess the implications for sustainable agricultural and rural development of ongoing developmental plans .  
At the same time , many non-governmental organizations note and are concerned that factors such as distance , limited human and financial resources , and unequal access to information are tending to distinguish between those non-governmental organizations that are closely following international processes and those , particularly in the developing world , that are not .  
Call upon multilateral organizations and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to cooperate with Governments in developing a coordinating mechanism to ensure the effective implementation of existing conventions and agreements on biological diversity and the rational use of limited resources ;  
The economic and social assistance rendered by the specialized agencies and international institutions of the United Nations system should be increased and redesigned to create special programmes of assistance to those Territories , bearing in mind their specific characteristics , such as their small areas and populations , their remoteness , their limited resources and internal markets , their dependence on imports , and their vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards .  
The considerably longer labour hours of women and limited access to paid labour because of the lack of financial resources complicates the potential expansion of agricultural production even where women have traditional , and often seasonal , rights to husband 's labour for such tasks as helping to clear their individual plots .  
The support extended by the General Assembly , in terms of both its endorsement of the strategy and the provision of additional limited budgetary resources to develop a planning and policy coordination capacity within the Office of Human Resources Management represents a modest step forward towards addressing the legitimate concerns expressed by the Inspectors .  
Furthermore , some of the ILO programmes , such as Occupational Safety and Health and certain of the industry committees , have observed that , since they cover technical fields which continue to have limited numbers of women professionals , especially in the developing world , the participants selected at the national level for their meetings often continue to be male , despite requests made to the national authorities to include women .  
It is generally recognized that the capacity of agriculture to absorb the growing labour force on a long-term basis is limited in most of the developing countries with a high incidence of rural poverty by the sheer unavailability of additional arable land . 
In fact such local-level agencies have emerged as a new locus of economic and social growth , providing innovative institutional arrangements through which family planning , health , education and income-generating activities can be integrated at the local level , ensuring environmentally sensitive sustainable development on a limited scale .  
Analysis of the major factors behind the observed behaviour of commodity prices reveals that conventional factors , such as the prevailing macroeconomic conditions in industrialized countries , are estimated to have contributed in only a limited way to the recent weakness in real commodity prices and that the expansion in the supply of commodities played a fundamental role .  
The granting of assistance is limited to the following conditions : ( a ) it should be selective and restricted to those parts of the economy where severe difficulties would otherwise occur ; ( b ) it should be limited to well-defined transitional periods laid down in advance and adapted to the specific socio-economic problems associated with the implementation of a country 's environmental programme ; and ( c ) it should not create significant distortions in international trade and investment .  
Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .  
In addition , based on the experience gained since the deployment of MINURSO , and given the conditions prevalent in Western Sahara , it is considered that an engineering unit of approximately 100 ( all ranks ) would also be required to perform , inter alia , the following tasks : limited mine clearing ; basic infrastructure repair ; and the construction and operation of water points in certain specific areas essential to MINURSO operations .  
Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure sustainable livelihoods ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increased morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .  
In this connection , the team wishes to point out that because of the existence of well-equipped regional and international organizations engaged in promoting the process of economic reform in the economies in transition , it would be advisable for ECE to confine the provision of technical cooperation activities to limited priorities which complement its regular programme of work .  
There seems to be an emerging consensus on two points : ( a ) United Nations involvement in peace-keeping should be scaled back and authorized limited operations should be conducted with greater cost effectiveness ; and ( b ) there should be increasing emphasis on preventive strategies and programmes that address the economic , social and other root causes of conflicts .  
It was emphasized that the proposed court should be established as a body whose jurisdiction would complement that of national courts and existing procedures for international judicial cooperation in criminal matters and that its jurisdiction should be limited to the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole .  
Governments designed and directed credit programmes , controlled interest rates , limited the access of its citizens to foreign currencies , restricted the access of foreigners and maintained fixed exchange rates .  
Among the problems the subprogramme will address are those related to improving international purchasing and supply management methods and practices , inappropriate procurement procedures and organizational structures , insufficient external and internal information for import planning and supply management , lack of skilled personnel and limited availability of import support services .  
The exercise analysed the current state of human development in the countries and identified broad development strategies that take into account the specific socio-economic characteristics , fragile ecosystems and limited natural resource base of these island economies .  
The Pacific island countries and the donor community are now faced with the challenge of translating these strategies into concrete action at the country level , with a need to generate broad-based economic growth while making judicious , sustainable use of the limited natural resource base and ensuring a balance of the fragile ecosystems .  
In an era of financial stringency , the limited resources available to assist developing countries must be directed prudently towards those investments with the highest payoff ; experience in country after country demonstrates that water and sanitation improvements are vital to economic progress and , more broadly , provide the very foundations for sustainable human development .  
On a more positive note , some have launched innovative schemes for reducing the use of foreign exchange in regional transactions , for example the introduction by the PTA of a traveller 's cheque , while among other developing countries a limited number of multilateral trade financing and export-credit guarantee facilities have been established , and in others financial resources are being increasingly mobilized through the establishment of regional capital markets .  
Among the multilateral organizations , the World Bank , which had previously paid limited attention to regional integration , has in the recent past been adopting an unambiguous supportive role , as manifested in several of its activities in Africa in particular , and the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) has made support for regional economic cooperation a central feature of its programming cycles .  
At the South-South level , cooperation could cover a broad area , or it could be limited to more extensive use of the technical cooperation among developing countries modality through which developing countries or regions with greater experience and knowledge in foreign direct investment matters could assist other developing countries in a variety of ways , including the provision of training . 
UNFPA will , therefore , develop a strategy for future allocations of its limited resources to help build capacities in developing countries to implement the Programme of Action , based on different levels of financial needs for multilateral assistance and the level of achievement with regard to quantitative goals of the Conference .  
National participating organizations would be expected to constitute teams of qualified volunteers ( perhaps focusing on a limited number of areas of coverage identified by each organization ) , assure their specialized training and facilitate the rapid deployment and integration of such teams , including the building of linkages with local non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations in the receiving countries .  
The Acting Director emphasized that that situation limited the Institute 's capacity to provide the corresponding General Assembly committees with substantive contributions and research findings in critical areas of economic and social development processes , such as : water , environment and sustainable development , waste management , renewable sources of energy , human settlements , poverty alleviation , desertification , international migration , and violence against women migrant workers .  
Constraints on the development of the public utilities included the lack of a development plan and institutional structures , limited administrative and managerial skills of personnel , dependence , to a large extent , on the Israeli systems , the inadequate technical condition of the Palestinian systems and limited financial resources .  
This principle , first expressed in German law and in international law , is accepted as a general principle in all legal systems regarding public administration , but it is usually reflected in specific principles of more or less limited scope ;  
It can be easier for the Governments of States that share the same cultural values and are confronted with similar economic and development problems to accept at that level the generalization of a number of fundamental principles regarding public administration and , eventually , judicial review on limited matters or cases by an international court established by a treaty .  
At the social level , conditions of life are very difficult , characterized by poor nutrition as a result of low purchasing power , poor health , with widespread diseases such as tuberculosis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , inadequate educational facilities and limited qualified manpower .  
The impact of written material was reduced as a result of low literacy rates throughout the country ; local radio and television facilities were old , in bad repair and had limited range .  
After four years of the utmost patience and restraint , the Republic of Croatia accurately concluded that the least costly solution for both Croatia and the international community to end Croatia 's agony and the international community 's humanitarian concerns in Bosnia and Herzegovina would require a limited but credible use of force that would end the siege of Bihac and restore order in adjacent occupied territories of Croatia .  
In the Agreement , the Government has committed itself to the effective protection of indigenous rights by promoting the creation of legal offices for the defence of those rights and the establishment of " popular law offices " to provide free legal assistance to persons of limited economic means in municipalities in which indigenous communities are prevalent .  
The work before the Panel is characterized by two main considerations : first , the broad scope and complexity of issues that need to be dealt with in a very limited time-frame ; second , the fact that in planning its work the Panel needs to consider the anticipated outputs of a large number of ongoing processes and initiatives in order to develop a cohesive and comprehensive perspective and to formulate options for future action .  
This composite picture of economic hardship compounded by environmental devastation , and of social strife compounded by economic hardship , has drawn only limited sympathy from the international community .  
At the same time , there is a growing realization that technological cooperation among developing countries can not be limited to meetings at the governmental or departmental level and that more effort should be made to involve individual firms , including SMEs . Firms cooperate when they perceive a business opportunity and possibilities for technological empowerment .  41 / Several forms of such inter-firm regional cooperation have been emerging in different countries .  
Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .  
Reproductive health eludes many of the world 's people because of such factors as : inadequate levels of knowledge about human sexuality and inappropriate or poor-quality reproductive health information and services ; the prevalence of high-risk sexual behaviour ; discriminatory social practices ; negative attitudes towards women and girls ; and the limited power many women and girls have over their sexual and reproductive lives .  
The Government of Cuba has made considerable efforts to mitigate the traumatic effects of the criminal blockade on the Cuban nation and has tried to ensure , with the limited resources available to the country , that food and medicines are equally distributed among the people and that the levels of medical care , education , security and social welfare are maintained .  
The Croatian Army , which is operating in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the express request of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina , and consistent with international law and within the framework of the bilateral agreement signed between the two respective Governments , will end its limited military activities in the area in the shortest time possible .  
Pilot projects take into account the specific characteristics of small island developing States in relation to waste generation and disposal , fragile ecosystems , limited resource base , geographical isolation and scarce human resources .  
He pointed to the successful collaboration of JUNIC in the field of major United Nations conferences and to the benefits of strong inter-agency cooperation ; he expressed his belief that increased effectiveness would result from a further streamlining of the JUNIC agenda and encouraged its members to use the annual meetings for focusing on a limited number of important information policy issues .

NULLAlthough special programmes and specialized financial institutions are important , their limited coverage means that a sustained impact on the problem of underfunding of micro-enterprises and SMEs calls for more active involvement of commercial banks , which tend to exclude this portion of the population because of the conviction that it is too costly to service .  
Whereas the focus has been on the provision of humanitarian assistance to those people , the countries receiving the refugees , despite their limited resources , have made substantial contributions by accepting the refugees and assisting in catering to their essential needs , while experiencing rising social tension and suffering nearly irreparable environmental degradation , notably in the United Republic of Tanzania and Zaire . 
In particular , the main purposes of the Decade were lost among initiatives of limited scope or proposals to establish direct communication links between the United Nations system and indigenous communities , without due regard to the legitimate role of national Governments as the appropriate channel for international cooperation .  
NULLThe primary stage of financial intermediation is dominated by a combination of a large informal sector where transactions between lenders and borrowers are direct and personal , a currency-creating authority ( a central bank or a currency board ) , and a limited number of deposit-receiving and credit institutions like the commercial banks .  
This stage of financial intermediation requires the satisfaction of only a few simple preconditions : the existence of a rudimentary regulatory and supervisory framework over the takers of deposits , and a minimum of institutional and technical capacity to carry out the currency-issuing and credit-extending functions , and to collect and interpret limited monetary information .  
Factors such as deprivation of education , limited meaningful human contact and easy access to sophisticated weapons , coupled with the experience of the cruelties of war , destroy the value system of many young people , resulting in a failure to discourage them from participating in violent activities .  
NULL FRITSCHE ( Liechtenstein ) said that her country , through its proposal concerning self-determination , sought to provide a means , short of full independence , whereby the reasonable aspirations of distinct communities within States could find expression through different types of self-administration , ranging , according to the circumstances , from limited self-administration to something approaching internal self-government . 
Given current financial constraints and the fact that a limited number of persons had access to the seminars organized under the Programme , audiovisual tapes on various subjects of international law were a convenient tool to place at the disposal of educational institutions of States , especially developing States .  
His delegation agreed that the crimes covered by the statute should be limited to war crimes , acts of genocide , violations of the laws and customs applicable in armed conflict , and crimes against humanity , all of which were forbidden under customary international law , and that treaty-based crimes such as those linked to drug trafficking and terrorism should be deleted .  
These obstacles must be analysed in the context of international political and economic relations characterized by the globalization of the economy and in a specific historical context marked by the end of the cold war and East-West confrontation , the emergence of regional economic groupings and the concentration of economic , financial and technological power in the hands of a limited number of countries .  
At a time when tremendous efforts were being made at the regional and subregional levels to overcome the problems with which the continent was faced , the role of the United Nations should be enhanced , particularly in the fields of social and economic development , rather than limited to humanitarian assistance .  
a result of the constitutional changes in the Sudan , which had granted total autonomy to the existing 26 federal states , the status of the refugees could be affected if the international community did not adopt urgent measures to provide more support to the States in which the majority of the refugees were concentrated , especially since in many cases they had overloaded the country 's already limited economic capacity .  
with interest that the Government of Nigeria , on 1 October 1995 , affirmed the principle of multi-party democracy , announcing its intent to accept the principle of power-sharing , lift the ban on political activity and the press , devolve power to local levels of government and subordinate the military to civilian authority , but disappointed that only limited action in this regard has followed ,

Though a service designed for a different society and limited to the specific areas assigned by the colonial administration , Malta 's public service gave its contribution to the development of the new State by providing continuity in certain vital domestic sectors and in the setting up of new services , including that of foreign affairs .  
Particularly relevant were the country 's limited economic capacities and its dependence on farm production , which had only very recently begun to be modernized ; high rates of poverty and marginalization among the population ; the institutional and cultural consequences of the prolonged dictatorship ; and the existence of a very traditional and hierarchical society .  
If in the resolution of crisis and conflicts the participation of the majority of countries is somewhat limited or even indirect , through an intermediary mechanism , in the resolution of the global issues for development the United Nations has been able to mobilize the direct participation of all countries , big and small , rich and poor , developed and developing , because these are not just to whom it may concern issues .  
While we are aware that the matter of economic and individual personal development is first and foremost a national responsibility , we are deeply conscious that our limited domestic resources constitute a severe constraint upon us in our quest to fulfil this obligation .  
We are convinced that through prudent management of our very limited resources , a willingness on the part of our people to work hard and , on our part , clear political leadership and virtuously inspired guidance all enhanced by the support of friendly Governments and donor agencies we shall , in due course , place our country on a sound path towards genuine growth .  
The Commonwealth of Dominica has taken steps , commensurate with its limited resources , to deal with the problem at the national level , and it is a party to cooperative regional arrangements aimed at impeding the trans-shipment of illicit drugs through the Caribbean region .  
The major issues on which the attention of the Organization is focused today , whether we are talking about the principal themes of the Agenda for Peace , the democratization of United Nations structures and their functioning or improving the Organization 's effectiveness , represent a movement , at present relatively limited , in which the Court should legitimately be concerned and , we think , involved .  
Indeed , 72 per cent of single heads of households , most of them female , live below the official poverty line , which simply implies a lack of access or limited access to basic social services , including food , sanitation , shelter , basic education and primary health care . 
As many United Nations agencies had stated , the impact of the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq was not limited to the frightening number of deaths which it had caused among children , women and the elderly , since in fact an entire generation of Iraqis had been sacrificed as a result of the difficulties they had encountered in terms of education and health and other social spheres .  
The limited coverage of health facilities , particularly in rural areas , poor referral or inadequate service delivery systems and the lack of human resources play further major roles in terms of limited access to reproductive health services and the quality of care provided in those facilities .  
The symposium identified the main reasons for the lack of a systematic strategy for the provision of comprehensive health care in refugee situations : the low priority accorded to it by organizations specialized in emergency response ; insufficient field staff with appropriate training ; limited funding and resource allocation ; insufficient coordination among national authorities , non-governmental organizations and United Nations organizations and agencies in the country of asylum ; and consideration of family planning as a sensitive issue in post-conflict situations without seeking the views and support of refugee women .  
The vast majority of the people in developing countries live in rural areas , with daily nutritional intake below basic requirements , high infant mortality rates , shorter life expectancy than that in industrialized countries and limited or no access to safe water and sanitation . 
It must never be forgotten that behind the statistics , concepts and operational schemes were individuals caught in tragic situations whose only hope was a universal respect for the notion of human dignity , even if that was limited to the minimum for life , namely safety , food , shelter , water , medicine and basic education .  
Particularly relevant were : the country 's limited economic capacities , depending on farm production which had only very recently begun to be modernized ; high rates of poverty and marginalization among the population ; the institutional and cultural consequences of the prolonged dictatorship ; and the existence of a very traditional and hierarchical society .  
Stressing the importance of chapter VI of annex II to the report of the Beijing Conference , he said that it was essential that adequate financial resources should be made available at the international level , particularly for small island developing States which had only limited economic capacities , for the implementation of the Platform for Action . 
Particularly relevant were the country 's limited economic capacities and its dependence on farm production , which had only very recently begun to be modernized ; high rates of poverty and marginalization among the population ; the institutional and cultural consequences of the prolonged dictatorship ; and the existence of a very traditional and hierarchical society .  
Currently , the health of women in Rwanda was extremely vulnerable due to lack of medical infrastructure , supplies and personnel , limited financial resources , lack of access to health care , malnutrition , unsafe drinking-water , and the spread of HIV / AIDS . Women were more susceptible to diseases than men because they were overworked , had unplanned pregnancies , were malnourished during pregnancy and suffered complications from childbirth . 
The Conference noted that the participation of scientists , researchers and educators from developing countries in international projects , as well as in international scientific information exchange , was extremely limited not only due to insufficient resources ( both financial and human ) , but also because of inadequate access to scientific and technical information .  
A limited number of industrialized countries can both meet their domestic needs for scientific and technical information and be active partners in international efforts .  
The principles considered were not limited to traditional relations of public international law but were in fact also relevant to private international law ( conflict of laws with regard to transnational relations between individuals and various kinds of organizations , whether incorporated or not ) and international administrative law ( with regard to relations between individuals or organizations and public authorities ) .  
Noting that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community to the implementation of the priority programmes in fulfilment of the Peace Agreement , including the strengthening of democratic institutions , the national reconstruction plan and the economic and social development plan , the implementation of certain programmes and projects basic to the process has continued to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability and the reduction of financial resources in support of the consolidation of peace ,  
Noting with interest that the Government of Nigeria , on 1 October 1995 , affirmed the principle of multi-party democracy , announcing its intent to accept the principle of power-sharing , lift the ban on political activity and the press , devolve power to local levels of government and subordinate the military to civilian authority , but disappointed that only limited action in this regard has followed ,  
13 Insufficient human and financial resources and limited administrative capacities and logistical infrastructure contributed to the low absorptive capacity characteristic of several States of the region , and to a level of activities lower than that envisaged by UNDCP .  
Article 44 of the amended Constitution stipulated that in using frequency bands for radio services , member administrations should bear in mind that radio frequencies and the geostationary-satellite orbit were limited natural resources which must be used rationally , efficiently and economically , so that countries or groups of countries could have equitable access to both , taking account of the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
43 His delegation considered that any draft text prepared by the Subcommittee on the utilization of the geostationary orbit should mention chapter VII , article 44 , No . 196 , paragraph 2 , of the Constitution of ITU , which indicated that the geostationary-satellite orbit was a limited natural resource and must be used rationally , efficiently and economically , and that countries or groups of countries must have equitable access to it , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
For geographical reasons Ecuador had demonstrated great interest in the geostationary orbit , which was a limited natural resource with special characteristics , and for which there should be a sui generis legal regime regulating access to and utilization of the orbit and guaranteeing equitable access to it , with account being taken of the relative disadvantages of the developing countries .  
Along those lines , it was suggested that the requirement should be limited to sensitive areas of public service or to cases where an abuse of power might be suspected and that the last sentence should be revised to read : " All information provided shall be treated as confidential but may be disclosed at a country 's discretion within the framework of special procedures . "  
To meet growing information needs in a changing political environment with limited resources , the implementation of the programme requires the closest cooperation with substantive departments , other offices of the Secretariat and the specialized agencies , programmes and funds of the United Nations system for the development of coordinated mechanisms to feed and link database and other records .  
Giving a high priority to eradicating the most extreme forms of poverty by trying to reach the poorest of the poor raises not only practical questions of how it can be done in practice with limited resources , material and administrative but also difficult questions of social justice . 
The regional integration process reveals the simultaneous rise of unidimensional or limited integration agreements , the aim of which is to free markets for goods , services and factors of production ( with the exception of the work force ) , and multidimensional or broad integration agreements , which have already reached the stage of customs unions and which aim at common markets and economic unions and at coordinated , harmonized and even joint policies .  
The low national saving levels characteristic of the region 's economies , and the limited volume of investment resulting from such savings , will only allow them to grow at moderate rates ; therefore , unless savings and capital formation increase significantly , an accelerated economic growth rate can not be achieved .  
The Acting Director noted that this limited the Institute 's ability to provide the other main committees of the General Assembly with substantive contributions and conclusions derived from its research in crucial areas of economic and social development , such as water , environment and sustainable development , waste management , renewable sources of energy , human settlements , alleviation of poverty , desertification , international migration , and violence against women migrant workers .  
The volume and quality of the work the Institute has been able to perform is noteworthy , taking into consideration the reduced number of professional staff available , the numerous vacancies at the management level , and the limited financial resources at its disposal .  
In paragraph 3 of its resolution 900 ( 1994 ) of 4 March 1994 , the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to appoint , for a limited period , a senior civilian official who would draw up an overall assessment and plan of action for the restoration of essential public services in the various opstinas of Sarajevo , other than the city of Pale , and who would assist the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , in close coordination with all relevant local authorities , in the implementation of the plan .  
The growth of lending was now inhibited by a limited profitability of investment ; the reluctance of banks to take long-term commitments because of risks imposed by uncertainty over future political and economic conditions ; the inability to obtain clear titles to real estate needed for collateral ; and lack of use of chattel mortgages by banks in financing vehicles and equipment .  
This degree of importance becomes even more obvious as one realizes that water is a natural resource which is scarce and limited and whose quality has repercussions in the ecosystems of which it is the core , thus capable of harming the living conditions of both present and future generations .  
The traditional approach to funding ECE / FAO work on temperate and boreal forest resource assessment has been a cooperative approach in which member countries and certain organizations have provided major contributions , mostly in kind , and a very small secretariat team has played a coordinating and assembling role with a limited amount of analytical and validation work ; this is a natural and justified approach in a region where most counties have rather well-developed forest inventory capacity .  
While they have evolved a holistic , traditional scientific knowledge of their land , natural resources and environment , their ability to practise sustainable development of their lands has been limited by economic , social and historical factors .  
The pool of non-retirees , particularly for specific language combinations and / or functions , is limited for two reasons : first , the Organization must ensure that the freelancers it recruits meet the same high standards required of established language staff ; and , second , the United Nations must compete on the freelance market with other organizations both within and outside the common system who in some cases can be more stable or financially advantageous sources of employment .  
As indicated in the March report , further vacancies are expected to be realized through full use of attrition in 1996-1997 ; strict enforcement of retirement age ; freeze in recruitment , subject to limited exceptions ; introduction of a programme for lateral redeployment of staff ; and , should these measures prove insufficient , the involuntary separation of staff .  
Although a return to acute humanitarian crisis has been averted , political instability and the ensuing insecurity have prevented the country as a whole from moving into a straightforward reconstruction mode and , under current conditions , possibilities for medium - or long-term economic and social development are limited .  
The need for close coordination and collaboration among humanitarian partners in Somalia has intensified over the past year in view of continued insecurity and instability , the absence of effective national counterparts , limited donor resources and the precarious humanitarian situation .  
The limited information obtained from national sources shows that a number of small island developing States have begun to implement parts of the Programme of Action that have especially high priority at the national level , including institution-building , particularly the strengthening of legislative frameworks ; waste management ; coastal area management ; and to a lesser extent , the preservation of biodiversity .  
The competent authorities shall secure , on fair conditions and upon the request of the Registrar or on his behalf , the public services needed by the Tribunal such as , but not limited to , postal , telephone and telegraphic services , electricity , water , gas , sewage , collection of waste , fire protection , local transportation and cleaning of public streets .  
In general , the urban renewal strategy has developed from solid and concentrated work in limited areas to more widespread work in which publicly subsidized urban renewal is used as a catalyst and locomotive and in which the affected owners and tenants are given a major say in the result .  
I would request you to intervene with Kuwait in order to bring an end to such hostile acts , which are in contravention of the Charter of the United Nations and international law , constitute unjustified provocation and have damaged the lights affixed by Iraq to the buoys in the Khawr al-Khafqa canal leading to the oil terminals .  There are a limited number of these lights , and because of the sanctions regime they can not be replaced if lost .  
The problems associated with formidable structural adjustment difficulties and economic reforms , declining flow of already low level of development resources , extremely low export capacity , compounded by limited market access , crushing debt burden , low level of human development , environmental degradation etc . , continue to impede seriously the development efforts of the least developed countries .  
The information received recently by the Special Rapporteur hardly suggests any improvement in the treatment of detainees in prisons and detention centres , which he described in earlier reports .  11 / Those reports give an account of the overcrowding , terrible sanitary conditions , inadequate and substandard food , limited medical care , beatings , restrictions on family visits , the problems of having common criminals share living quarters with political prisoners , and the jailing of many political prisoners far from their home towns , which makes contact with their families extremely difficult .  
Although it had been said that global economic growth was the result of the globalization of the economy , the international community should be fully aware that that process was limited largely to interaction among the private sectors of those countries , and that their sole objective was to make profits .  
While the authorities have made efforts to ensure that cases of illegally occupied houses are solved , and many of the cases have been dealt with fairly and justly , there still remains a significant amount of unresolved cases where the local authorities have been unable to prevent de facto ethnic discrimination , owing to intimidation , limited capacity of the judiciary , pressure exercised on judges , and in some cases because decisions of eviction have not been enforced by the local police .  
In response it was observed that , while the spirit of article 12 required expeditious consideration by the court of the enacting State of the application for recognition of the foreign proceedings , the question raised was not suitable for being addressed within the limited scope of the Model Provisions and should be left for the laws of the enacting State .  
However , it was pointed out that the scope of the draft Model Provisions was limited to matters of judicial relief and cooperation and that the issues to which article 14 pertained could not be adequately dealt with in the Model Provisions , without addressing a number of other substantive issues which were not covered in the current text ( such as set-offs and actions to reverse or render unenforceable legal acts detrimental to all creditors , see above para .  134 ) .  
The limited mass , volume , stability and optics of microsatellites could not compete with traditional large-scale missions such as the Land Remote Sensing Satellite ( LANDSAT ) , Satellite pour l'observation de la Terre ( SPOT ) and the European remote sensing satellite ( ERS ) ; however , for medium resolution and meteorological-scale imaging , the KITSAT and POSAT satellites had demonstrated a comparable facility but at a tiny fraction of the cost .  
Subject to those qualifications , his delegation supported the gist of the draft articles , in particular the dual criteria of " systematic " and " large - scale " for the crimes covered by articles 18 and 20 , the two separate jurisdictional regimes established in article 8 , and an exclusive regime for the crime of aggression ( article 16 ) subject to a limited exception of the national jurisdiction of a State committing aggression against its nationals .  
LDCs also suffer from an extremely limited internal savings capacity and underdeveloped financial markets , geographical disadvantages ( as in the case of many land-locked and small island LDCs ) , inadequate infrastructure , poor communications and low education levels which are reflected , inter alia , in weak managerial and administrative capacity and in a severe shortage of skilled and trained manpower .  
It is a matter first and foremost of the lives and well-being of millions of innocent people who depend on this carrier to avert the dangers of deadly and lethal diseases in a country that is classified as among the least developed countries whose limited possibilities and scarce resources , as mentioned , are well known to you .  Accept , Sir , the assurances of my highest consideration .  
Given the importance of this anticipated report , the current budget proposals are limited to provision for real resources for 1997 kept at the 1996 level , augmented by unavoidable items arising from exigencies of the ongoing work of the Tribunal .

The Commission 's new approach to the problem of deciding before which organ and on what legal basis a State could be accused of an international crime seemed reasonable , but the trouble with the choice of the Security Council and the General Assembly as the organs responsible for characterization of an international crime was that , as in the past , they might take a complaisant attitude towards extremely serious wrongful acts , and moreover their competence was limited by the Charter . 
Concerned about the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine-detection and mine-clearance equipment as well as the lack of global coordination in research and development to improve the relevant technology , and conscious of the need to promote progress in this field and to foster international technical cooperation to this end ,  
In addition , the Secretary-General considers that , in developing criteria for accelerated promotion called for in recommendation 1 ( h ) and paragraph 78 of the JIU report , demonstrated mobility should be among the main criteria , bearing in mind , of course , those categories or occupational groups of staff which are not expected to be mobile ( e.g . staff in the General Service and related categories ) , or for whom mobility opportunities are limited .

Direct negotiations are sometimes allowed under exceptional circumstances , such as when for special reasons competitive methods would not lead to satisfactory results , or in the case of projects with an anticipated initial investment value not exceeding a certain amount or of a limited duration .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; these countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
In the context of the discussion of article 14 , a proposal was made to include a new paragraph in article 14 providing that recognition of a foreign proceeding should be granted only to such limited effects as were consistent with the purposes of ensuring coordination of proceedings under the provisions ( yet to be formulated ) on coordination between a pending main proceeding in the enacting State and a subsequent application for recognition of a foreign main or non-main proceeding .  
It was pointed out that in some jurisdictions the relief that could be granted by the court before the opening of insolvency proceedings or before recognition of a foreign proceeding was limited to relief measures of an individual nature provided under national rules on civil procedure ( i.e . measures covering specific assets identified by a creditor ) and did not extend to special relief measures available under special rules concerning collective insolvency proceedings .  
It was proposed that , within the context of article 15 ( 1 ) , the powers of the foreign representative or other person designated by the court should be limited to measures destined to preserve three categories of assets : perishable assets , assets susceptible of devaluation and assets otherwise in jeopardy , such as where there was an imminent danger of their being concealed or dissipated .

While the Tribunal conducts an exhumation at an alleged grave site only to obtain evidence in support of indictments , which might often be limited to a certain number of mortal remains , the expert aims at the total exhumation of a given site for the sole and purely humanitarian purpose of identifying as many missing persons as possible .  
Weak technological infrastructures , a severe shortage of qualified human resources and limited financial means explain in part the persistent nature of the problem confronting many developing countries .  
However , the recognition by Governments and non-governmental organizations of the impact of ageing on development appears to be limited by such areas of inquiries as the potential costs of an ageing population , as measured by future costs of caring for frail older persons , future costs of pensions and the changing age structure of the workforce .  
Small island developing States possess unique characteristics , including fragile ecosystems , small land area and limited natural resources , which make them significantly more vulnerable to environmental degradation and human health problems resulting from inadequate management of wastes .  
Particular problems persisted for Turkey 's rural women in eastern and southeastern Anatolia , who continued to live in traditional social frameworks and were affected by an ongoing armed conflict and whose access to opportunities and services remained severely limited .

Concerned about the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine-detection and mine-clearance equipment as well as the lack of global coordination in research and development to improve the relevant technology , and conscious of the need to promote progress in this field and to foster international technical cooperation to this end ,  
A view was expressed that , as an alternative to the enumeration of the grounds on which recognition might be refused , the Model Provisions could contain a definition of the effects limited to coordination and cooperation , to be granted to the recognized foreign proceeding when a local proceeding is already pending in the enacting State .  
Noting also that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
Intergovernmental dialogue on sustainable development could usefully be reorganized to consider a limited number of strategic priority issues , so as to develop a more focused approach to relevant activities in the United Nations system both at the international and at the regional and country levels .  
The view was expressed that in view of the special characteristics of the geostationary orbit , there was a need to establish a sui generis legal regime for regulating access to and use of that orbit , which was a limited natural resource , and that such a regime should guarantee actual and future equitable access to the geostationary orbit for all States , taking into particular account the needs of developing countries , including the equatorial countries , because of their special geographical characteristics .  
The limited human , technical and material national resources have been concentrated on sweeping areas where mines and remnants of war are known to be present , and where their location has been established by citizens ' reports on the accidents they have caused or by companies carrying out development projects .

The most valuable lesson that can be drawn from the practice of the international monitoring bodies and from the Special Rapporteur 's own experience is the certainty that , to the extent that the norms and principles governing the state of emergency are respected , its impact on the functioning of the institutions , the validity of the rule of law and the enjoyment of human rights will necessarily be limited and compatible with a democratic system of government .  
In order to avoid military courts , in those countries where they have not yet been abolished , helping to perpetuate impunity by virtue of a lack of independence resulting from the chain of command to which all or some of their members are subject , their jurisdiction must be limited solely to specifically military offences committed by military personnel , excluding human rights violations constituting serious crimes under international law , which come under the jurisdiction of the ordinary domestic courts or , where necessary , an international court .  
While contemporary terrorism does seem a particularly novel and dangerous threat , for it possesses attributes which set it apart from its historical forebears and make it more effective as a result of the confluence of new political circumstances and modern technological advances , it still remains an imitative mode of behaviour with a limited tactical repertoire 9 / and deplorable , as ever , effects on human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
Recognizing the widespread nature of the practice of forced evictions and that when forced evictions are carried out they can occur in a variety of contexts including but not limited to conflicts over land rights , development and infrastructure projects , such as the construction of dams or other large _ scale energy projects , land acquisition measures associated with urban renewal , housing renovation , city beautification programmes , the clearing of land for agricultural purposes or macro-urban projects , unbridled speculation in land , and the holding of major international events such as the Olympic Games ,

Many Governments have emphasized the paramount importance of regional meetings of subsidiary bodies of the Commission , which coordinate the efforts of developing countries in drug law enforcement and provide the only means of establishing and strengthening the mutual trust and confidence that are essential , in view of the limited resources of the countries concerned , to effective cooperation in and coordination of drug law enforcement operations at the regional level . 
With reference to the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction , the countries of the Pacific region had expressed growing concern over the increased intensity and frequency of storms and typhoons in the region , with an impact that would continue to stretch their limited resources .

While these developments are not in themselves sufficient to dispel our anxieties about the safety of our planet from the threat of weapons of mass destruction , we should seize the moment and take concrete steps to consolidate the limited gains that have been realized , and move to resolve the outstanding disagreements which have stalled initiatives to find lasting solutions to fundamental disarmament issues .  
The main constraints to increasing agricultural production and raising productivity included the low priority accorded to the sector , poor physical infrastructure , limited utilization of advanced technologies , inadequate access to credit and appropriate technologies for small-scale farmers and the weak linkages between research institutions and farmers .

First , humanitarian law had a more limited objective than did human rights law , since it was applicable solely in situations of armed conflict and , without seeking to improve society , sought to protect the life , dignity and physical integrity of the individual against violence and arbitrary behaviour .  
As was indicated at that time , budget implementation during the current biennium would be notably more challenging than in previous bienniums owing to the dynamic efforts required to manage the sharply reduced level of resources within a short budget cycle and within a budgetary structure with limited flexibility or requiring longer lead times to address the necessary savings other than through significant reductions in staff costs .  
Recognizing also that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community , the implementation of priority political , economic , social and environmental programmes and projects in the process of consolidating peace continues to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability of financial resources , delays in the disbursement of internal and external funds , lack of continuity , deficiencies in the implementation of other initiatives having an impact on the implementation of a number of projects and by the special characteristics of a complex process ,

The fact that we have managed to defend the most important social benefits in decades , in such difficult and unusual conditions , strengthens the thesis that in a framework of social justice and an equitable distribution of wealth , certain basic goals of social development can be reached in situations where economic growth is limited , even negative .  
Developed countries should continue to reorient their ODA in favour of the least developed countries , whose trade and investment opportunities are otherwise limited , and in favour of those new social-sector targets agreed upon by the OECD Development Assistance Committee ( DAC ) at its ministerial meeting in May 1996.1 Furthermore , given the rapid emergence of advanced developing countries in Asia and Latin America as new donors , South / South cooperation could be encouraged with financial assistance from developed countries .

Particular problems persisted for Turkey 's rural women in eastern and southeastern Anatolia , who continued to live in traditional social frameworks and were affected by an ongoing armed conflict and whose access to opportunities and services remained severely limited .  
The participants agreed that , taken overall , these conferences and the Convention provided a basis on which to build not only the right of women to health but also the enjoyment of good health as a human right and that they exposed the extent of the poverty and economic dependence of women , the limited power exercised by many women over their sexual and reproductive life and their lack of influence over decisions , all of which social factors have a negative effect on their health .

With regard to the external debt , the initiatives taken by the Bretton Woods institutions and creditor countries to alleviate the debt burden of the poorest and most heavily indebted countries and to find solutions to multilateral debt were insufficient and of limited scope , and the situation of middle-income countries which met their obligations promptly and in full was likewise unresolved ; hence a comprehensive and radical solution to the debt problem must be found .  
In view of the limited budgetary resources allocated to development , some sectors had shown a marked interest in broadening the purview of the financial institutions and intergovernmental organizations with respect to development issues , which would , in the long run , have the effect of reducing still further the participation of developing countries in the international decision-making process , contrary to the principles of the Charter and to the global dimension which should characterize the solution of the world 's problems .

For example , financial contributions to relevant multilateral institutions and programmes were often not reported , many national communications provided limited detail on bilateral programmes related to the implementation of the Convention , and there was little discussion of transfer of technology through the private sector . 
Other key problems for many SMEs are caused by inadequate management skills , especially those required to compete in the present-day globalized economy , lack of client orientation , limited access to relevant information , not being linked to commercial or productive networks and lack of knowledge and resources for incorporating innovation or quality improvement into production processes .  
Beyond the human cost , debt had created serious obstacles to economic growth by absorbing up to one fifth of export earnings , exhausting their limited stocks of foreign exchange and undermining their ability to engage in international trade on more equitable terms .  
He had stressed that , despite their small size and limited resources , the Territories were entitled to exercise their rights to self-determination and independence , and he had reiterated the Special Committee 's conviction that accelerated economic and social development would contribute to the swift implementation of the General Assembly resolution in those Territories .  
Given a wide variety of types of sanctions , all cases were divided into three categories : ( a ) limited , that is , minor financial , export , cultural or travel sanctions ; ( b ) moderate , that is , broader trade or financial sanctions ; and ( c ) extensive , that is , comprehensive trade and financial sanctions .  
Activities include : preparing working documents and a draft report of the Board on the implementation of article 12 of the 1988 Convention ; providing Governments with relevant information to determine the legitimacy of shipments of precursor chemicals and to advise them regarding decisions on specific suspicious shipments ; preparing critical review documents and other relevant materials for the Board and its advisory expert group and for establishing a limited international special surveillance list ; and providing substantive advice on activities related to precursor control .  
Striking a balance between the static and dynamic components of competition is particularly difficult for developing countries in todays globalizing world , where the gaps - whether measured in terms of income , productivity performance or technological capacities - are greater than ever , and where small market size , limited availability of entrepreneurs and of production inputs , outmoded technology , inefficient distribution and communications systems or poor information flows combine to create barriers to market entry .  
This remains crucial for the economic development of small economies whose vulnerabilities are intensified by our limited access to markets , narrow resource base , small size , inadequate levels of human resource development and proneness to natural disasters .  
The overall technological capabilities required to develop in the ultraviolet domain an orbital telescope 2 metres in size , with image quality in the range of 0.5 arcsec , could be envisioned as a project of limited costs ;  
There is , however , a continuing need for strong action in this area since small island developing States remain constrained by limited financial , human and technical resources .  
There is , however , a continuing need for strong action in this area because small island developing States remain constrained by limited financial , human and technical resources .  
Generally speaking , reform agents ' participation in limited linguistic and educational psychology research will be planned and organized as an integral part of their professional training .  
But it is self-evident that our national and international commitment , as well as limited human financial and material resources , mandates bilateral and regional cooperation in battling the better-equipped narco-traffickers .  
Its membership would be limited if it sought to overreach established customary international law or set aside national judicial principles .  
Since FDI is mainly a real investment in firms , its mobility is limited by such factors as physical assets , networks of suppliers , the local infrastructure , human capital and the institutional environment ; FDI stocks are generally not footloose .  
Ad hoc requests by international agencies lead to ad hoc data collection , crowding out limited financial and human resources , and thus interfering with regular national statistical programmes ;  
The view was also expressed that international human rights instruments limited the scope of national jurisdiction by guaranteeing uniform standards of protection , whereas diplomatic protection functioned exclusively in relations between States and after domestic remedies had been exhausted .  
Most developing countries encounter enormous difficulties in providing timely responses to the demands and to implement the substantive objectives of most instruments and conventions and in putting into practice their compliance requirements , due to their limited institutional and financial capacity , lack of manpower and managerial skills and inadequate or non-enforced national legislative frameworks to support these instruments .  
They are constituted by a limited number of plant species which live under special conditions of shallow brackish water , needing regular inflow of freshwater ; they capture the sandy and loamy products resulting from the erosion of neighbouring land . 
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territorys deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
The Committee is particularly concerned with the high and increasing incidence of drug and substance abuse among youth ; the lack of legal provisions in relation to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances ; and the limited social and medical programmes and services available in this regard .  
While welcoming the State party 's innovative measures , both legal and educational , to eradicate the practice of female genital mutilation and other harmful traditional practices affecting the health of girls , the Committee expresses its concern at the limited impact of these measures .  
The Committee is particularly concerned at the high and increasing incidence of drug and substance abuse among youth ; the lack of legal provisions in relation to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances ; and the limited social and medical programmes and services available in this regard .  
Mass poverty resulted from factors such as a shortage of productive resources , limited access to basic services and poor output and lack of diversification in the agricultural sector .  Those factors eroded the economic and social fabric of populations and drastically reduced the options of poor sectors .  
With regard to the volatility of financial flows , he said that while the amount of those flows to the developing countries had increased from $ 100-billion in 1990 to over $ 250-billion in 1996 , they were composed almost entirely of private capital and were concentrated in a limited number of developing countries .  
It was said that members could be elected or appointed for a limited period of time on a rotating basis , and they could serve either in an official or in a personal capacity , in particular indigenous representatives stated that the status of the representatives should be equal . 
It takes place primarily between developed countries in the application of bilateral enforcement agreements , mutual legal assistance treates ( limited to criminal action aginst cartels ) , free trade , customs union or common market agreements , and the relevant OECD instruments . 
Given the limited staffing capacity of the Service , its operations are more reactive than proactive : a greater focus on Headquarters strategic planning and staff resource management would lead to improved service delivery and increased effectiveness in meeting operational and administrative needs in the field .  
The question should be asked whether it is fair to collect the debt owed by the countries where these people live , which in many cases accounts for more than half of their limited revenues , while in the United States alone , $ 8 billion are spent on cosmetics , in the rich countries , $ 17-billion are spent on pet food and , worldwide , $ 400-billion are spent on narcotic drugs . 
The Constitution of FRY establishes that employed persons are entitled to limited working hours , daily and weekly rest , paid annual vacation and absence in accordance with the law , i.e . the collective agreement .  
Strongly condemns physical , sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family , which encompasses , but is not limited to , battering , sexual abuse of female children in the household , dowry-related violence , marital rape , female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women , non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation ;  
Syria supported the recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions ( A / 51 / 813 ) with regard to the need for transparency in the budget for such positions , the need to retain the traditional manner of filling approved positions , and the use of gratis personnel only in the limited and exceptional circumstances outlined in the report .  
Strongly condemns physical , sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family , which encompasses , but is not limited to , battering , sexual abuse of female children in the household , dowry-related violence , marital rape , female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women , non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation ;  
Women with mental disabilities are particularly vulnerable , while there is limited understanding , in general , of the broad range of risks to mental health to which women are disproportionately susceptible as a result of gender discrimination , violence , poverty , armed conflict , dislocation and other forms of social deprivation . 
Moreover , although related costs for international salaries and common staff costs were calculated on the basis of 50 per cent of staff on appointments of limited duration , mission appointees ranged from 75 to 80 per cent of the total , contributing to additional savings under civilian personnel costs . 
At their tenth meeting , in September 1998 , the persons chairing the human rights treaty bodies reiterated their view that it was desirable to strive for focused periodic reports that would examine a limited range of issues that might be identified by the relevant treaty body in advance of the preparation of the report .  
Seen in relation to the total annual appropriations for ESA programmes and other national programmes , the financial leeway for full implementation of a revised space policywith respect to previous commitments to such programmesis relatively limited , at least in the short term .  
It indicated that in current circumstances Iraq would be unable to export oil and petroleum products in sufficient quantities to realize the total sum established for phase IV under resolution 1154 ( 1998 ) because of the limited productive capacity of the oil sector and the sharp fall there had been in oil prices in world markets . 
Any of the present rules may be suspended by a decision of the Congress , provided that twenty-four hours notice of the proposal for the suspension has been given , which may be waived if no representative objects ; subsidiary organs may by unanimous consent waive rules pertaining to them .  Any suspension shall be limited to a specific and stated purpose and to the period required to achieve it .  
Small island developing States are threatened to a similar degree , but due to their physical isolation and limited economic base are often dependent on a single industry , such as tourism .  
There are various reasons for this : the lagged growth cycle in many emerging market economies ; the former high levels of interest rates in some of these countries , especially in real terms ; the greater , though still limited , degree of independence gained for monetary policy in the many countries that have embraced floating exchange-rate regimes ; and the improved international and domestic financial conditions in many countries . 
The process that took the indigenous peoples lands from them left behind very limited and debilitating alternatives for survival : vassalage ( or servitude in its diverse forms ) , segregation in reduced areas reserved for them , or assimilation into the non-indigenous sector of the new socio _ political entity created without indigenous input .  
Since this was likely to prove particularly difficult at the international level and be of limited relevance to international commercial transactions , the additional benefit to be expected from using an enhanced electronic signature as opposed to a mere electronic signature might need to be clarified .  
The limited precious time of the special session should hardly be lavished on unnecessary and avoidable controversies surrounding highly contested new ideas and concepts .  The question of population is not a numbers game .  
In a globalizing world , island nations such as ours , with limited natural resources and human capital , urgently need the support and assistance of the international community in overcoming our inherent vulnerabilities and realizing the hopes and aspirations of our peoples for achieving lasting and meaningful development .  
Given the limited nature of UNHCRs involvement in Colombia , it is recognized that UNHCRs support will only be effective if linked to broader efforts to uphold international humanitarian law and to strengthen respect for human rights , within the context of a common approach with other United Nations partners .  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
The overall strategy is based on using limited UNDP core resources to launch capacity-building programmes that are subsequently sustained through bilateral donor support , and ensuring the sustainability of capacity-building programmes by matching UNDP technical and managerial expertise with the accountability and viability of local implementation partners .  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
The economic , social and cultural rights , on the other hand , required to be protected through positive action over time , which would consume resources , and since resources were always limited , the realization of these rights would naturally be constrained .  
The debt overhang , inadequate external finance - exemplified by the decline in ODA - limited market access for exports , severe supply-side constraints , deterioration in human welfare and the increasing number of humanitarian and natural disasters have adversely impacted on the economic performance of LDCs . 
The Committee is particularly concerned at the high and increasing incidence of drug and substance abuse among the youth ; the lack of legal provisions in relation to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances ; and the limited psycho _ social and medical programmes and services available in this regard .  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
The Committee noted that requests for revised estimates should normally be limited to provisions required to accommodate unforeseen and extraordinary circumstances , and that there was a need for greater predictability in the level of advisory and custodial fees .  
These limited opportunities had largely been due to the fact that a significant portion of market access opportunities had been allocated to pre-selected countries , which were historical exporter countries ( according to the current access opportunity provision ) and / or countries that received preferential treatment under regional or bilateral trade preferences ; and the TRQ system had not been administered transparently and had been inefficient in achieving the full utilization of TRQs . 
Although this represents a slight increase over the previous year , FDI continues to be hampered by some characteristics shared by most of the LDCs , such as adverse climatic conditions , small domestic markets , export vulnerability , limited transport and communications infrastructure , insufficient domestic investment and lack of a skilled labour force , as well as lack of information on profitable business opportunities ( box 2 ) .  
There is also concern that the recent emphasis in financial and economic policies has not always been development-oriented , that the dominance of a limited set of macroeconomic targets and parameters over the social , political , cultural and environmental domains has gone too far , and that social and economic policies and objectives must be fully integrated .  
The scope of the Conference should therefore not be limited to criminal breaches of existing arms legislation and export / import controls but consideration should be given to all relevant factors leading to the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of small arms and light weapons in the context of the illicit arms trade , including those referred to in the report of the Panel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms .  
The five basic commonly cited obstacles the global economic situation ; limited financial resources ; the lack of trained personnel ; insufficient inter-institutional coordination ; and the paucity of basic data and comparative research may be described as follows :  
It emphasized that , without a sustained and decisive reduction in their external debt and debt service obligations , the growth prospects of the least developed countries and their ability to attract foreign direct investment would remain limited .  
Although the review made many positive comments about the quality of evaluation work at the central level , particularly its low cost and high output relative to its limited staff , the review was nonetheless critical of UNHCRs commitment to the function .  
For both privatization and project finance , the most attractive areas are those for which : ( a ) access can be limited ( as in airports , tunnels , bridges and major highways ) ; ( b ) the projected volume of traffic is high ( container ports , freight rail , primary roads ) ; ( c ) the generation of cash is expected to be reliable , and ( d ) foreign exchange earnings are possible . 30 Attractive assets are ones in which there is a scope for monopolistic power . 
Advancing international understanding through programmes which call for broad application of the universal language of arts and humanities , the social behavioural , and physical sciences , and related disciplines , including but not limited to comparative studies and consultations on related public policy issues ;  
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) and geographical constraints , such as being landlocked and lacking good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .  
Africas heavy dependence on primary commodity exports ( accounting for about 80 per cent of total export earnings ) is evidence of the low level of human resource development and limited technological capability to take advantage of emerging trade and investment opportunities .  
Non-physical barriers , notably inefficient and limited choice of transport organizations , poor utilization of assets , government controls and cumbersome transit procedures , contributed to high unit costs of transport and insurance and long transit times .  He noted that the specific needs and problems of landlocked developing countries varied from one region to another .  
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) , and geographical constraints and lack of good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .  
The only solution to this dilemma , therefore , is to further develop the existing United Nations system in such a way that in the future it is able to intervene in good time in cases of very grave human rights violations , but not until all means of settling conflicts peacefully have been exhausted and this is a crucial point within a strictly limited legal and controlled framework .  
However , some preliminary results seem to show that aid alone can play only a limited role with respect to the three categories of possible effects of sanctions on third States , i.e . economic , trade and financial effects ; social and humanitarian effects ; and secondary effects as indicated in the report of the ad hoc expert group meeting . 
Even though the primary responsibility of maintaining security and the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and areas always lies with the host State , the international community is duty bound to assist governments in this task and , above all , to bear the bulk of the costs to African States whose financial and logistic capacities are limited .  
Questions have arisen as to whether such exclusive arrangements with limited membership have been truly effective in achieving their stated purpose of strengthening the international non-proliferation regime , especially with regard to scientific and technological applications connected with advanced weapons as well as weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery .  
Contrary to the limited internal resources available in the past for pre-reproduction work and heavy-duty binding , a large reproduction capacity has long been available to meet the demand for regular documents prepared for intergovernmental bodies i.e . , technically simple materials that must be produced within strict and short deadlines and in print runs of a few thousand copies .  
Accordingly , it is recommended that proposal C-3 be pursued in order to ensure a realistic and cost-effective use of limited resources , achieve a balanced linguistic diversity on the United Nations Web site and establish a sound foundation for its future expansion .  47 .  The attention of the Committee is also drawn to the report of ACABQ on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001 ( see A / 54 / 7 , para .  
Urgent measures were required , therefore , to remedy that situation through , inter alia , the provision of the technical , human and financial resources commensurate with the tasks and responsibilities of the Office of the Special Coordinator , which , even with extremely limited human and financial resources , had accomplished many commendable tasks . 
There was a need to ensure that there was strong and broadly shared government ownership of the programme , that the consultative nature built into the design of the preparatory process was protected , and that the burden on Governments , in terms of both limited resources and limited time , was minimized .  
Noting that the territorial Government continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
Furthermore , bearing in mind both the emphasis placed in Council resolution 1996 / 31 on encouraging geographical diversity among NGOs and the large number of organizations with limited access to technology , the Section has devoted considerable effort to the production of informative written material and training workshops .  
It had enacted a law on the sustainable use of Fijis limited renewable and non-renewable land and sea resources and readjusted its sectoral policies with a view to ensuring sustained natural resource utilization ; the development of human-resource-based industries ; the improvement of social services in the fields of health , education and housing ; poverty alleviation ; rural and urban development ; and disaster management .  
Funds means assets of every kind , whether tangible or intangible , movable or immovable , however acquired , and legal documents or instruments in any form , including electronic or digital , evidencing title to , or interest in , such assets , including , but not limited to , bank credits , travellers cheques , bank cheques , money orders , shares , securities , bonds , drafts , letters of credit .  
The vast , cheap labour pools of developing countries were being exploited , commodity prices were being manipulated in order to ensure a continued supply of cheap raw materials and the markets of developing countries were being pried open in the name of trade liberalization while the developed countries limited access to their own markets through various stratagems .  
The developing countries , for their part , were dependent on limited overseas markets and exports and were at the mercy of the international financial institutions ; they suffered the negative consequences of globalization but had virtually no role in defining the rules of the game , and their repeated calls for democratic governance of the global economy had fallen on deaf ears .  
Mr . Leiro ( Norway ) said that the assumption that globalization benefited everyone had yet to be proven ; the gap between rich and poor was growing both within and between nations and many poor countries attracted minimal foreign investment , lacked a dynamic private sector and were often deprived of the benefits of increased export earnings by heavy debt burdens and limited market access . 
For many commodities exported by developing countries , there has also been substantial substitution by synthetic materials over the past two decades , while a shift away from traditional &amp; lt ; heavy = industries , such as iron and steel , has also limited the rate of expansion in demand for natural raw materials .  
The current initiative , however , had alleviated only a small part of the debt of a limited number of countries and she therefore welcomed the progress achieved at the recent annual meeting of the World Bank and IMF to achieve dramatic cuts in the debt burden of the heavily indebted developing countries , linking those cuts to poverty reduction strategies . 
Considering that the Caribbean Sea area includes a large number of States , countries and territories , most of which are developing countries and small island developing States which are ecologically fragile and economically vulnerable and also affected by , inter alia , their limited capacity , narrow resource base , need for financial resources , social problems , high levels of poverty and the challenges and opportunities of globalization ,  
Considering that the Caribbean Sea area includes a large number of States , countries and territories , most of which are developing countries and small island developing States which are ecologically fragile and economically vulnerable and also affected by , inter alia , their limited capacity , narrow resource base , need for financial resources , social problems , high levels of poverty and the challenges and opportunities of globalization ,  
Public official shall be understood by reference to the definition of public official in the domestic law of the State in which the person in question performs that function and as applied in its criminal law and shall include , but not be limited to , any judicial official , juror or lay judge , police official , border control or customs official , investigator , prosecutor or other official with law enforcement responsibilities in the State concerned .  
Funds means assets of every kind , whether tangible or intangible , movable or immovable , however acquired , and legal documents or instruments in any form , including electronic or digital , evidencing title to , or interest in , such assets , including , but not limited to , bank credits , travellers cheques , bank cheques , money orders , shares , securities , bonds , drafts , letters of credit .  
Concerned about the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine-detection and mine-clearance equipment as well as the need for effective global coordination in research and development to improve the relevant technology , and conscious of the need to promote further and more rapid progress in this field and to foster international technical cooperation to this end ,  
For instance , there may be concomitantly higher levels of street and ( low visibility ) intra-familial violence , large proportions of the population that are severely disadvantaged and young ( that is , in the age groups perpetrating and suffering crime ) , rapid migration into urban areas , lack of trust in law enforcement , inefficient justice systems , corruption , limited good governance and severe competition for scarce resources .  
The Nordic countries and Poland , in their responses , agreed that there was a need to address any lack of protection of persons in situations of internal violence , which fell outside the scope of common article 3 of the four Geneva Conventions and of Additional Protocol II thereto , and when effective implementation of human rights might be limited by derogations in exceptional circumstances .  
According to Turkey , the content of fundamental standards of humanity should be limited to international human rights law and not include international humanitarian law , as they concerned situations of internal violence which did not reach the threshold of an armed conflict .  
It was interesting to note that it had been suggested that when other authorities could commit the State unilaterally at the international level , that capacity should be limited to circumstances in which the persons concerned were given an official mandate to conduct foreign policy in their field of competence and where their counterparts , to whom the unilateral declaration was addressed , were fully cognizant of that fact .  
Noting further that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territorys deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
To this end , we envisage measures to benefit all sectors of the older population , taking care to ensure that needs are met for those living in the countryside and in outlying urban areas , older women , disabled older persons and all groups of older persons who because of their race , culture , religion , economic situation or political ideas might have limited access to all kinds of services and comprehensive care .  
For the developing and least developed countries , the continuous fall of official development assistance , piling up of external debt , decline in their ability to get access to the global market for their limited exports , plus new conditionalities on export opportunities have aggravated their multifaceted constraints .  
As regards the issue of humanitarian intervention and limited sovereignty , we associate ourselves with the majority of Member States , especially States of the South , that referred to the contravention by such ideas of international law , the Charter and the principal guidelines in contemporary law such as sovereignty , political independence and territorial integrity , as well as non-interference in the internal affairs of others .  
Regardless of its considerable benefits , nuclear energy is still problematic in one particular aspect : spent fuel and nuclear waste , its interim storage and final repository , especially in small States with limited industrial and scientific capabilities .  
In any case , we do not believe that the deployment of a limited national missile defence system would change the basic strategic calculus underlying the ABM Treaty or be incompatible with its central purpose , which is to maintain strategic stability and enable further reductions in strategic offensive arms .  
As a result of such an agreement , the use of the natural resources of celestial bodies and outer space , which might relieve some of the immense pressures now facing mankind due to the limited resources of the Earth , could take place in a predominantly peaceful environment , in an orderly fashion , in accordance with international law , on the basis of international cooperation and mutual understanding and in accordance with previously agreed procedures . 
The significant internal and outward migration for economic reasons of young men particularly to the United States and young women particularly to Europe , especially Spain in recent times ; high rates of maternal mortality ; and the undoubtedly limited sexual and reproductive rights and the rights of women call for specific measures .  
The impact of this policy would have been all the greater on reproductive health and family-planning questions if the adequate financial means had been available to complement the limited capacities of my country , which has been shaken by an unprecedented financial crisis and the political transition difficulties of establishing stable democratic institutions .  
The United Nations Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , held in Barbados in 1994 , was aware of the enormous challenges facing these States when it adopted the Programme of Action , now considered the starting point for the sustainable development of small island developing States , whose ability to protect themselves against natural disasters is indeed limited .  
The need for universal commitment to such preventive measures has become more pressing due to the isolation and oceanic location of some small island developing States and their total dependence on a marine and limited terrestrial base , which render them highly vulnerable to contamination from such waste .  
The Working Group noted with concern violations of the civil and economic rights of migrant women workers , including foreign contract workers , who were subjected to ill-treatment , limited personal freedom and inadequate or no payment for their work , without the possibility of recourse to the legal system of the receiving country for justice .  
Developing the capacity to export is particularly crucial in light of the fast expansion of international trade and the limited size of the domestic market of many developing countries .  
Moreover , in the light of the federal structure of Canada and the extensive provincial jurisdiction , the absence of any expert particularly representing the largest provinces , other than Quebec , significantly limited the potential depth of the dialogue on key issues .  
Given this connectivity and owing to limited resources of national and other statistical offices for maintaining , updating and revising their standard classifications , agreement must be reached on the timing of further revisions of such linked international standards as the ones mentioned above so that all may change together in a more harmonious and minimally disruptive fashion .  
Furthermore , it has been alleged that trials being conducted for genocidal crimes in which the death penalty is the primary punishment continue to deny the accused rights ensured and protected by international law.This includes , but is not limited to , the right to legal representation , the right to appeal , and other safeguards such as the presumption of innocence and an independent judicial tribunal . 
It was difficult to believe that while Governments and international organizations were spending vast sums of money on bilateral and international law reform programmes , the training and legislative technical assistance programme of the United Nations body dealing specifically with international trade law was being funded from limited extrabudgetary resources in the form of special contributions by a very few Governments .  
While obviously limited in payload mass , volume and power , but with very real and attractive advantages in terms of cost and response time , microsatellites complemented traditional large satellites by providing an alternative gap-filler for affordable quick-response or exploratory missions with both civil and military objectives .  
The human rights situation left much to be desired in Belarus , especially with respect to freedom of expression : freedom of the press was limited , peaceful demonstrators and journalists had been arrested and beaten , and new media legislation violated international standards .  
Indeed , accelerated economic growth is also of paramount importance if Africa is to reverse its increasing marginalization as reflected by quantitative indicators , particularly its small share of world trade , the limited inflows of foreign direct investment , its heavy debt burden , the relatively low utilization of communication technology , the falling standard of education , the deteriorating health services and the declining food self-sufficiency ratio .  
The Bah International Community , with over five-million members from all strata of society organized as approximately 17 , 000 local communities and 175 national and regional communities , is committed to peace and engaged in a wide range of activities.These activities include but are not limited to fostering grass-roots participation in sustainable development initiatives , advancing the status of women , eliminating racism , and promoting and protecting human rights . 
ICAM is often seen as an environmental rather than a sustainable development programme ; thus , it has often received limited funding from national budgets ; further , many small island developing States do not have the environmental tools ( for example , indicators for integrating environmental considerations with economic development ) for decision-making , which would allow Governments to estimate the true cost of environmental degradation ;  
Building adequate manpower with the requisite level of skill for effective integrated island management ; small island developing States should assess their training needs and develop a training programme , involving the private sector , non-governmental organizations and Governments ; training should not be limited to technical experts ; it should include local communities , for example , fishermen , tourist hotel operators , managers of industries located in coastal regions and farmers ;  
The unique social , economic and environmental characteristics of small island developing States , such as high population density , relative isolation , limited availability of land space , and paucity of human and financial resources , limit the range of possible options for the sound management of waste .  
In several small island developing States that have established or upgraded institutions charged with resource conservation and environmental protection , inadequate national budgets have seriously limited the scope of their operations ; even in situations where local expertise exists for dealing with environmental protection and resource management problems , shortages of funds hinder adequate action .  
Even where humanitarian objectives were not part of their primary mandates , peacekeeping operations have proved valuable , often vital , in supporting and protecting needy populations , humanitarian workers and supplies in environments where there was limited consent from the warring parties or when the security situation is simply beyond their control .  
On the draft resolution on an international agreement to ban anti-personnel landmines , contained in document A C . 1-51 L . 46 , during the current session of the First Committee , and over the last few years , views have been expressed by many , including those who have actively supported a ban on anti-personnel landmines , regarding the need for continuing the use of such weapons on a limited or restricted basis .  
The fragile ecosystems of small island States and their generally more limited scope for pursuing alternative development strategies make concerns for the environmental impact of tourism very acute , particularly because the sector , which is almost totally dependent on the natural environment , is viewed by many small island developing States as a fast route to social and economic development .  
Egypt regrets that all the efforts made to expand the scope of the United Nations Register have not yet yielded the required results since the Register remains limited to the annual notification of transfers of seven categories of conventional arms and continues to disregard other sophisticated and lethal types of conventional arms as well as weapons of mass destruction and advanced technologies with military applications .  
But the socio-political burdens , the persistence of an apartheid culture which can not be transformed quickly , limited financial resources and still inadequate human resources constitute a considerable hindrance , not to mention the need to take account of the time factor , with South Africans impatient to taste the fruits of freedom even though the quiet revolution under way dates back only to 1994 . 
Participation in international and regional arrangements allows them to pursue mutually complementary objectives in a holistic manner and to benefit from the synergy generated , but it also burdens them with a multitude of obligations which further stretch their limited resources , both human and financial .  
In view of their narrow natural resource base , their proneness to disruption by natural disasters , their small range of primary product exports and their limited local capital for productive investment , small island developing States need to join forces for their development , so that communication and exchange of information becomes vital .  
ICSUs formal participation in the meetings and other activities of the Council is necessarily limited by its financial resources and the availability of suitable representatives , but the individual involvement of members of the scientific community globally and their expert contribution to the many issues addressed by the Council and its subsidiary bodies is substantial .  
Having recognized that limited access to credit by SMEs is a major constraint on production and growth , many Governments directed public funds to SMEs through specialized financial institutions , such as agricultural and industrial development banks .  
Despite the considerable impact of unilateral acts of States on the development of customary international law , State practice was not uniform , and it provided only a limited number of cases in which a unilateral act had been recognized as binding .  
An eventual convention on fissile material should be a concrete step forward in the nuclear disarmament process and should not be limited to being just another instrument of selective nonproliferation .

Some delegations reiterated the view that the geostationary orbit was a limited natural resource with sui generis characteristics that risked saturation , and that its utilization should be based on the principle of rational and equitable access for all countries , taking into account the special needs of developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
The Committee learned that greater utilization of the two conference centres continued to be constrained by uncertainty about the appropriate use of the facilities , particularly as venues for private sector and commercial events ; limited opportunities for rerouting meetings from the calendar of conferences ; inadequate staffing structures for management of the centres ; lack of funds for marketing and promotional activities ; and regional instability .

However , given the deep concern of the developing countries with regard to their limited capacity to participate in the global economy and consequent marginalization , one of the major challenges in the coming years would be how to ensure that the benefits of the global economy were shared by all .  
The reasons were weak economic governance , lack of response to stabilization measures , weak institutional and physical infrastructure , small domestic markets and limited access to regional and global markets , and also the absence of a critical mass of small - and medium-sized enterprises .  
That was creating a vicious circle in which the right to freedom of expression had only limited relevance for those who were hungry and , likewise , the right of freedom of association for those who were homeless or the most generous provisions of human rights treaties for those who were illiterate or were struggling to meet their basic needs .  
It was worrying that the international financial community had so far not attached much importance to the development crisis in Africa since its impact at the global level was considered to be limited .  
The sporadic manifestations of racist violence which he had just described , although somewhat limited , warranted reaction on the part of the international community since they constituted a strong signal given by racist organizations which thereby wished to proclaim their implacable refusal to accept others .  
We emphasize the importance of more stable and predictable financing for social and economic development and stress the important role that official development assistance can still play , in this respect , for the majority of developing countries , particularly least developed countries and other countries with limited potential for domestic savings or export earnings .  
The Committee is concerned , further , at the low standard of the living conditions in some alternative care institutions , the inadequate monitoring of placements and the limited number of qualified personnel in this field .  
The Committee notes with concern the poor health situation of children in the State party and in particular the limited access to basic health care for children ( especially in rural and mountainous areas ) , high maternal , child and infant mortality rates , low and decreasing immunization levels , high rates of malnutrition , poor sanitation and limited access to safe drinking water , especially in rural communities .

With regard to the use of non-controlled substitute chemicals in the illicit manufacture of drugs , the substances and guidelines included in the limited international special surveillance list established by the Board were a useful tool for Governments , promoting awareness and cooperation with the chemical industry to prevent diversion of those substances .  
However , the fact that only nine responses indicated that their authors used the instrument developed by the Centre renders those responses of limited value for analytical , comparative or statistical purposes , or for the purpose of establishing a consolidated database for coordination of and information on international technical cooperation projects in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice .  
The overall experience reported above by HEUNI and the very limited number of responses received by the Centre for International Crime Prevention to the questionnaire on international technical cooperation in crime prevention and criminal justice suggest that the establishment of a centralized database is of very limited value and utility , in particular when one considers the overall quality and content of the responses .  
Few recipient countries have established effective focal coordination points for technical cooperation and the few that have done so have only been partially successful in moderating the competing interests of various ministries , departments and non-governmental agencies , many of which often compete for the same resources from the same limited pool of international technical assistance donors and providers .

As in the case of mercenary activities , and bearing in mind the close relationship between mercenarism and terrorism , Cuba has participated actively in the activities and efforts of the United Nations to combat international terrorism and , although it acknowledges that the outcome of such efforts has sometimes been localized or of limited scope , it has supported them in the firm conviction that in this field the contribution of the United Nations and of the international community as a whole is an urgent matter of priority . 
Faced with the increasingly opaque web of local and global politics , economic interests and criminal activity that characterizes many of todays conflicts , we must make the best use of organizations limited resources by engaging all relevant actors in our work to improve the protection of civilians .  
However , the actual benefits may be quite limited as the delivery of the main components of debt relief packages , including debt stock reduction from the Paris Club , remains conditional on the finalization and successful implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers ( PRSPs ) , which set out the countrys macroeconomic and structural reform policies , as well as concrete poverty-reduction goals .  
It was acknowledged that the large investment requirements of least developed countries and the very limited scope , in the foreseeable future , to meet the multiple development finance requirements with domestic resources , implied a need for new and additional resources and efforts to increase ODA to least developed countries supportive of national programmes of action , including poverty eradication strategies .  
In fact , over the past decade the Conference on Disarmament has focused on the expansion of its membership on a more or less regular basis , thus trying to find a mutually acceptable solution to the legal as well as moral dilemma , created by the existing tension between the limited membership of the Conference on the one hand and the universal scope of its task on the other , to quote Ambassador Hofer of Switzerland , who served as Special Coordinator in 1998 and with whom I had the pleasure to begin my consultations .

Health facilities are unable to control or treat diseases such as typhoid , malaria , tuberculosis , dysentery , brucellosis , viral hepatitis , sexually transmitted diseases and HIV / AIDS . Access to other basic social services , such as water , sanitation and education , has been limited by the absence of essential supplies and proper maintenance . 
The reported drop in mortality rates during the past year is not completely reliable owing to incomplete medical registration processes , limited by high administrative fees and the unsatisfactory introduction throughout the country of the recommendations of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) for the registration of live births .  
In the developing countries generally , limited infrastructure , inadequate regulatory systems , access costs and lack of human resources were serious handicaps to connectivity and the use of information and communication technologies , which were , moreover , not geared to their languages or their social and cultural contexts . 
This strategy is designed to be consistent with existing treaties , protocols and resolutions relevant to mine action , including , but not limited to , the anti-personnel mine ban treaty , the Convention on certain conventional weapons and its Protocols , the 1949 Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols of 1977 , the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the standard rules for the disabled . 6 The strategy is intended to assist Member States to fulfil their international obligations and to support the universalization of relevant international instruments .

The decentralization that is occurring in many tropical countries can bring benefits to many poor rural people in heavily forested areas , including greater access to forest resources , but weak local technical capacity , limited national support and organizational problems among small-scale loggers undermine prospects for sustainable forest management .  
These procedures mainly involve issues with regard to national security , public safety , macro manipulation , environmental protection , development and use of limited natural resources , public resource deployment , public health and interests and safety of lives and property , for which administrative licenses can be granted in line with the Administrative Licensing Law of the People 's Republic of China .  
Tieying Li pointed out that China would actively promote the strategic restructuring of state-owned enterprises using the principle of " grasping the large ones and letting the little ones go " as a major premise .  When rebuilding state-owned enterprises into limited companies and stock companies with multiple principle investments and reasonable stock rights structure , and when using capital as the link for structuring parent-subsidiary corporate systems to smooth out reasonable internal group relations , we need to prevent administrative " mandatory matching " and " arbitrarily creating piles " .  
By further increasing cooperation with overseas , and actively introducing foreign capital , technology and management experience , it accelerated the development and utilization of China 's limited oil and natural gas resources in order to make it meet the developing needs of China 's national economy .  
The National Foreign Exchange Management Bureau clearly stipulated in the new method that , domestic institutions borrowing international commercial loans externally are only limited to : China-capital financial institutions approved by the Foreign Exchange Management Bureau to operate foreign exchange loan business ; juridical people of non-financial corporations approved by the State Department 's Authorization Department .  
After three years of experimentation , issuance methods and features of transferable bonds are accepted domestically , henceforth loan bodies will make choices in areas such as transferable bonds , bonds and bank loans , etc . according to personal characteristics and market demand , optimizing financing structure ; systematically developing issuance of project financing bonds , ABS , etc . , with no recourse or limited recourse , thereby reducing the pressure of financial institutions in foreign lending , promoting project management to become international , to become scientic , and to become transparent .  
However , China is still much engaged in her own domestic development , and has limited national strength .  For this reason we are selecting those key areas or key links that have favorable prospects , where the degree of industrial linkage will be significant , and which can drive the entire mechanism for critical breakthroughs , and through these we will vigorously strive to realize a leap in high-tech development .  
The main bodies of investment should be as diversified as possible , enterprises of the competitive industries should be gradually restructured to become companies with limited liability or companies limited by shares , which are held by multiple shareholders , large-sized enterprise groups should be reformed according to the structure of parent companies and subsidiaries and , where conditions permit , enterprises can be listed in overseas stock markets .  
As far as military strategy was concerned , the United States had adopted a new set of operational methods for high-technology limited warfare following the end of the cold war , but NATO 's operational methods and command systems had not departed completely from the operational approach designed for the prospect of fighting big battles with the Soviet Union . Therefore , there was a lack of coordination between them in the operations .  
Meanwhile , we should also see that the satisfactory economic efficiency attained by state enterprises last year was closely linked with the policy support of the state , besides the hard efforts made by the enterprises .  This year , however , the space for increasing profits through the policy factor is limited , and the task of realizing the three-year target for reform and the difficulty relief of state enterprises has therefore proved extremely arduous .  
In the beginning of the transitional leap , since our experience was limited , and our funding was insufficient , we were in this kind of " point by point developmental mode " and special project construction had was logically based , but by now we should have already arrived at " unification " - - systems integration - - time .  We must conclude the separate explorations of the initial period and enter an integration phase as soon as possible .  
In order to overcome several limitations of their combat vehicles , including a long and wide body , a limited field of vision , and so on , the regiment organized its vehicle crew to drive the " Dongfeng " Type-145 truck for a week first in order to find out and feel all sorts of functions and parameters of their extra-long and extra-wide heavy-duty vehicles and this laid a psychological and technological basis for them to drive or operate their light armored vehicles .  
Given the characteristics of modern wars , particularly the several limited wars over the past several years , warring parties without exception directed their primary attacks and their surgical strike targets at the enemies ' command centers .  Once the command center is destroyed or sustains heavy damage , defeat is only a matter of time .  
Because of limited resources for scientific research , relatively obsolete equipment , and shortage of capable innovators , we must uphold the policy of carrying out innovations selectively , stress the principal needs , and accurately select the areas where we will make the breakthroughs so that we can use the limited resources on innovative research projects .  With respect to innovative scientific research , we should realize that , while we are falling behind developed countries , we should have confidence in our own strength , which is more important .  
The $ 60-billion limited " Star War " missile defense , in US official language , is to counter the threat from so-called " rogue states " ( recently the United States has changed their names to " concerned countries " ) because those countries possess or are developing guided missile system and are threatening or will threaten the security of the United States and its allies within five years .  
China 's funds for national defense construction are all used for protecting state security and territorial integrity .  China keeps the army in condition but will not engage in unjust military ventures .  The limited military expenditures are used to raise the living standard of officers and soldiers and improve weapons and equipment .  
To meet with the " limited " strategic missile defense task requirements , the US Defense Department 's Ballistic Missile Defense Bureau has made , in line with the mass production principle , unified arrangements for the research projects of the TMD and NMD systems under the BMD plan .  The ultimate purpose is to enable these defense systems to coordinate with each other in combined operations , to jointly deal with a series of threats , and to provide a " nearly seamless defense network for the United States and for its allies " .  
A limited war is to strictly select military and non-military targets and employ the most accurate and " humane " attack .  The tactics itself shows the political nature and purpose of war , but more and more economic targets of the other side with war potential will be included in targets for attack by firepower .  
Even when China is developed and powerful in the future , China 's military capability will always be defensive in nature and be limited to satisfying the minimum security requirement of being able to defend the country 's sovereignty , territorial integrity , and legitimate interests .  
Such infiltration is not limited to the ideological and cultural fields , but has also be extended to the economic , political , military , scientific , and technological fields .  In their exchanges with us , they also brought ideological things along with them .  
Now that China has constantly enhanced her national strength in an all-round way , generally speaking , the Sino-US relations are expected to move forward in spite of frequent friction , and out of considerations for its own strategic interests , the United States is also expected to carry on its arms sales to Taiwan within limited space only . 
China 's satellite project was developed under conditions where China 's basic industries were relatively weak , where the science and technology level was rather backward , and where the state finances were limited .  Through a long period of arduous struggle , by the end of the year 2000 , China altogether launched 48 different types of artificial satellites .  
Focusing on the objective conditions of limited national investment , and a fairly small number of satellites to design and manufacture , we must correctly select development paths where the technological leaps are the greatest , strengthening the advance research of key technologies , and constantly realizing fairly large technological advances , raising by the greatest margin the level of satellite engineering .  
The Clinton administration proposed a limited defense system which was confined to a land-based deployment .  According to the plan , a system composed of 100 interceptors would be built inside the country which was capable of dealing with about 20-30 attacking ballistic missiles .  There was no plan to build up a system of a larger scale .  
Cai added : Over the past few years , neo-interventionism centered on such theories as " human rights overriding sovereignty , " " sovereignty being limited , " and others have caused a great clamor , and certain countries have adopted a double standard on the issue of human rights and have interfered in other countries ' internal affairs on the pretext of humanitarianism , and this has posed a new threat to the world peace and security .  
In reality , logistics service forces are not merely limited to " hard " services , such as material supplies , public health services , repairs , transportation , and engineering , but they should also provide information and other " soft " services .  In this way , they are able to properly bring their joint logistics capabilities into full play at opportune moments and in proper places .  
The Japanese Government has ignored repeated solemn representations of the Chinese Government and calls for justice from within Japan and decided on the evening of 20 April to issue a Japanese visa to Lee Teng-hui , on the excuse of so-called " humanitarian grounds " and " non-involvement in political activities and being limited to medical purposes , " thereby giving the green light for Lee Teng-hui to visit Japan .  
Disregarding the several solemn representations of the Chinese Government and the strong objections voiced by the Japanese people of all walks of life , the Japanese Government had finally decided , on the evening of 20 April , to issue a visa to Lee Teng-hui for his visit to Japan . This visa was granted under the pretext of so-called " humanitarianism " and under the condition that the visit is limited to only medical treatment , without engaging in any political activity . 
According to the experienced Indian military analyst ( Kapil Kaq ) , " this joint military exercise is multilevel and is also the first time that India has shown that it has already made preparations in pragmatic fashion for fighting a limited conventional war ; India 's conventional military forces remain in a high state of combat readiness and will sternly retaliate on a large scale against an enemy . "  
Over the past few years , in particular , under the conditions of a large base figure of population , limited per capita resources , and relatively backward economic and scientific and technological levels , our rapid economic development has brought enormous pressures to the originally weak ecological environment , so that the situation in environment is even grimmer .  
Article 2 : These guiding opinions are applicable to those joint stock limited companies that were formed in accordance with the " Company Law " and are planning to make an initial public offering of shares ( hereinafter referred to as " companies planning to issue shares to be listed on the stock market " ) within the People 's Republic of China .  
Article 17 : Other enterprises that are looking to incorporate companies planning to issue shares to be listed on the stock market shall form joint stock limited companies in compliance with the relevant provisions in the " Company Law " and in accordance with the requirements for standardized restructuring and complete reorganization , or they shall incorporate as joint stock limited companies by undergoing a complete transformation .  
P'an Chia-yu , instructor of Taiwan 's " Armed Forces University " , pointed out : If the PLA adopts the sudden attack strategy against Taiwan , the United States can respond only with its current cambat capability .  Without long-ranch fighters and forward bases , the United States has very limited capability to counter the PLA 's attack on Taiwan . In a modern war that emphasizes quick decision , US rescue to Taiwan would be too slow to meet the urgent need when the PLA launches an attack on Taiwan .  
US domestic and foreign policies will definitely have a tremendous effect on the world because of the United States ' superpower status in the world .  In particular , the readjustment of US military strategy will not be limited to US security only .  We can see that the political scheme and economic needs from that readjustment will have a major impact on the international political structure and strategic environment of the entire 21st century .  
Any limited liability company in which the state owns shares ( including companies listed overseas ) making initial public offers or issuing additional shares must offer 10 percent state shares based on the total amount of capital raised .  
The fact that radar antenna occupies huge space , radar includes many parts , and radar equipment has limited functions will bring problems to the task of mobilization and transfer .  In order to overcome the problems , the unit has organized a small group for technological innovation , and fully applied more than 20 innovation achievements to this model of radar .  As a result , the unit has resolved such problems as below-standard transmitting power of the radar launcher and weak signals received by the receiver .

As for the " financial or debt " question , it is a concept based on years of the accumulative total and theoretical reckoning .  The debts that can really be directly incorporated into the finance or be shared by the fiscal finance are very limited .  
Wen Jiabao said : The key to successfully develop the country 's vast western region lies in the adjustment of industrial structure .  For this purpose , we should strengthen the role of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy .

Gao cited the need for active research into the " qualified foreign institutional investor system " of certain countries and areas .  Combining such a system with the actual situation in China , the limited , gradual entry of foreign investors into China 's securities markets will be allowed , as will the use of foreign capital to purchase stock ownership in some enterprises in competitive industries .  This will gradually open China 's capital markets completely to foreign investors .  
In doing the anti-drought work , we must make overall plans , take all factors into consideration , bring about temporary as well as permanent solutions to the problem , and give comprehensive treatment by combining engineering measures with biological measures and management measures , combining capital construction of water conservancy works with construction of ecological environment , and combining rational development with strict protection and scientific utilization in a bid to properly manage , protect , and utilize the limited water resources .  
The government 's investment in the development of science and technology is limited by its financial resources , and it can not attend to each and every aspect of the development of science and technology but should be responsible mainly for organizing , administering , and funding basic research and make necessary coordination and providing necessary funds for projects to tackle key difficult problems in advanced technology ; as for the general development and application of science and technology , they should be left to enterprises .  
With regard to the attempt of the United States to deploy its advanced TMD [ theatre missile defense ] in northeast Asia in the course of developing its NMD , Sha Zukang pointed out that this has constituted a direct threat to the effectiveness of China 's existing limited nuclear force .  
We must obtain maximum results from our limited resources , form a complete set of effective mechanisms for competition , appraisal , and supervision , optimize the distribution of the science , technology and productive forces of the whole society , promote the ties , integration and cooperation between the military and civilian scientific research structures , and enable the achievements in technological innovation to be turned faster and better into productive forces for national defense and economic development .  
In the face of this gratifying situation , the official responsible for the State Metallurgy Industrial Bureau reminded that the current economic recovery and favorable turn in efficiency is initial , restorative , and limited .  The supply-demand relationship of the rolled steel market is still fragile and there could still be a lack of demand in the market .  
Wang Ke pointed out : Working hard and perseveringly , and building the army through industry and thrift are Chairman Jiang 's persistent requirements of our army 's logistics construction .  We must unswervingly grasp management and unremittingly turn to management for efficiency and maintenance and supplies .  We must willingly serve the overall situation of national economic construction , pursue careful calculation and strict budgeting in all aspects in a highly responsible manner , manage and use the limited funds with good results , and live an austere life well .  
The CMC stressed the need to finish all the tasks of reducing the size of the armed forces by half a million in the last year of the three-year deadline .  Moreover , the armed forces should concentrate their limited financial resources on striving to effect , in the shortest possible time , a complete change from a manpower-intensive and numerically large type to a technology-intensive and quality-based efficient one to ensure that they can cope with a hi-tech local war that may break out at any time .  
Modern war is a huge war of attrition , and Taiwan 's limited arms will be used up very rapidly , whereas the mainland has tremendous potential for fighting a war of attrition , and this determines that Taiwan will be unable to wage protracted war with the mainland ; and given the consumption of large numbers of arms and men , Taiwan will not be able to sustain the fight for long and its armed forces will collapse .  
In addition , since Taiwan lacks sufficient offensive weapons , and sufficient ground-to-ground missiles ( they only have the " Ching Feng " ground-to-ground missile developed by Taiwan itself , which is limited in numbers and range ) , they can not pose a strategic threat to the mainland , and are thus in a passive situation , and this has also weakened Taiwan 's defensive capability ; thus , after war breaks out in the Taiwan strait , the mainland will have sufficient offensive capability to break through the Taiwan defensive system .  
The " US National Interests Committee " which is composed of some strategic analysts also regards preventing those major global systems , including trade , financial markets , energy , and environmental realms , from disastrous collapse as a matter affecting the vital interests of the United States ( from the above-mentioned book about the US National Interests Committee , page 4 ) They believe that to ensure this kind of global interests , " the US resources are limited . "  
Designer Wang Huaiyi said that the research and development of a infrared remote sensor for space use is limited by the levels of a nation 's industrial , electronics , machining and other basic technologies .  If any one of these is unable to meet the demands of the project , the entire system will be impacted .  
The 21st century is a century in which the cause of space will attain flourishing development .  Under the state 's overall planning and unified leadership , China will select limited objectives , effect breakthroughs at key points , actuate sustained development , and make still greater efforts to explore the peaceful uses of outer space for mankind .  
As for the reason that the sources of news reports reprinted by non-news units are limited to those published by news units at and above the provincial level , the primary consideration is that these news units are the principal news-publishing units in this country , and their news reports are authoritative , accurate , and timely .  
He said : Compared with the mature markets , China 's securities markets still need to be further strengthened in terms of legislation , supervision , standardization , and so on .  There still exist such problems as insufficient extent of market standardization , lack of personnel and means for monitoring and controlling the conduct of market manipulation and the fraud of investors , limited extent of market internationalization , unitary market level and variety , and imperfect structure , among other things .  
These countries include Russia , mainland China , and some European allied countries .  Because the NMD system runs counter to the ABM Treaty signed between the US and Russia , Moscow has been strongly opposing it .  European allied countries also are worried that this will again trigger an arms race .  So , they also disagreed with this system .  Mainland China , in particular , also held that the limited number of NMD anti-missile interceptors of the US is aimed at intercepting the extremely small number of intercontinental ballistic missiles of the Liberation Army .  
High-level KMT officials were aware but fairly unconcerned about the likelihood of Liu Tai-ying and others deciding not to renew their party membership .  An unnamed high-level party official believes the popular will represented by Liu and others is limited .  
To obtain windfall profits , some criminal elements build connections with leading cadres in various ways and corrupt them by bribing them with a large amount of money or through providing them with sexual services .  Over-concentration of power in some cadres , a lack of transparency in the exercise of power as well as a lack of an effective oversight and check system against abuse of powers give rise to corruption like the exchange of power for money .  In addition , because of the state 's limited financial power , public servants ' pay is low .  
Li Chieh also indicated that , considering the operational management problems on the elongated Taiwan Strait , the numerous missiles deployed on shores , and the limited operational space in the Strait , if the Navy can carry out mobile ocean-going missions from a greater distance , the Navy 's operations would not be confined in the Taiwan Strait and could hinder Communist China 's military deployments and prevent it from mobilizing its full force into operations in the Taiwan Strait .  
Chang Lin-cheng said : Though this shows that the Taiwan side has unilaterally legalized the existing small-amount trade between the two shores , which had been previously banned by its law , and has lifted to a limited extent its ban on the Kinmen and Matsu residents visiting the mainland , since it has refused to make a positive response to one China , the introduction of the " mini three links " may on the contrary create more obstacles and will thus have only a limited impact on any substantial improvement in relations between the two shores .  
Since Clinton , who had come from " a remote and backward place , " had limited knowledge and experience , and his aides and staff also lacked experience , he repeatedly made mistakes after he assumed office .  In less than two years , he lost nearly all his political capital .  In the mid-term election , the Republicans controlled both the Senate and the House of Representatives overnight , thus rewriting US history .  
The article , entitled " Uphold the One China Principle , Promote Direct Cross-strait ' Three links , ' " says that the so-called " mini three links " refer to links between Jinmen and Mazu and the Fujian coastal region .  On 13 September 2000 , through an assessment report on the so-called " mini three links , " the Taiwan authorities planned to adopt a gradual and partial method in opening limited Jinmen-Xiamen and Mazu-Fuzhou freight and passenger links , and applied the principle of " first freight , then passengers ;  
In addition , the government has imposed mandatory reductions on some industries with excess production capacity ( such as the textiles , iron and steel , and coal-mining industries ) and limited their output .  Enterprises that used backward technology or caused heavy pollution were ordered to close .  In response to market competition , moreover , some enterprises have closed their doors , gone out of business , suspended operations , or scaled back production .  
Because China 's relevant legal code is still not quite sound and comprehensive , its market mechanism not quite mature , and its capital market not fully open , some 70 percent of direct foreign investment in China are through joint venture and cooperation , with only a portion invested in wholly-owned companies .  Foreign investment through takeover and merger is still limited .  This will limit the massive flow of foreign capital .  
As a matter of fact , this time it was even more unjustified for Yoshiro Mori to use the same excuse as Putin did , because what the boat capsize incident involved are not limited simply to technical problems such as searching for the survivors , but also political and diplomatic issues of crucial importance to Japan such as relations between Japan and the United States . As the Prime Minister , how could he use the excuse " not right to intervene " ?  
In the face of WTO challenges , such as increased imports and foreign advanced marketing methods , Wang Jinshan said , supply and marketing cooperatives departments and affiliated organizations nationwide should make use of their limited time to further intensify reform , quicken the pace of development , and meet challenges with a positive posture .  
For other international human rights treaties it has joined , the United States always made reservation , statements , and understanding to ensure that their implementation would be strictly limited within the scope of the US Constitution and other laws , and could only be applied to the federal level and could not be applied to various states .  As a result , the international covenants are a sheer sheet of meaningless paper in the United States .  
However , in general , the current level and size of bilateral economic and trade cooperation is still quite limited , and a great potential has yet to be tapped .  The leaders of the five countries affirmed the steady development of bilateral trade with China , but also expressed concern over the existing problems .  For example , the volume of trade is not large enough ;  
In his speech , Deputy Wang Ke said : In doing the PLA 's logistic work , we must take the initiative to serve the needs of overall national economic construction .  At all times , we must maintain our fine traditions of hard struggle and building the army through diligence and thrift and must make a real effort to successfully manage and make good use of our limited money .  
" With the US equity market at an unprecedented high level , with limited scope for further cuts in US interest rates , with the Japanese economy still struggling for a revival and moderating economic growth in Europe , and with volatile currencies and greatly reduced market liquidity , it is inevitable that the investment performance of the Exchange Fund in 1999 will be affected .  
The spokesman appealed to the SSA staff to follow the civil service team to uphold their duties and responsibilities under limited resources in the benefit of the general public , especially the social security recipients were mostly the elderly , the disabled and those in need of urgent financial assistance .  
The limited effect of the controlled explosion during the disposal demonstrated that there was no explosives left from the previous blasting at that location .  Therefore the question as to who should be responsible for leaving behind any explosive does not arise in this case .  
In addition , doctors in public hospitals may , at the request of the patients , prescribe items which have limited available scientific evidence to show their cost-effectiveness , offer minimal additional medical benefit to patients over available alternatives , or may not be considered as essential for the patients ' medical treatment .  
All limited companies incorporated in Hong Kong , including listed companies , are required under the Companies Ordinance to send financial documents that are to be laid before the company at a general meeting to their shareholders , debenture holders and other entitled persons ( " shareholders and relevant persons " ) not less than 21 days before the date of the meeting .  
The Government had identified three possible options to tackle the problem of soccer betting .  These included : ( i ) updating the Gambling Ordinance to tackle cross-border gambling activities ; ( ii ) stepping up enforcement actions against illegal soccer gambling ; and ( iii ) providing limited regulated outlets for soccer betting .  
As I have emphasized , public housing rental levels reflect the level of subsides for public housing provided by the general public .  How to balance the different interests and how best to utilize limited social resources call for collective wisdom .  I welcome the concern expressed by Members and the public on housing policy matters .  I sincerely hope that Members will come forward with constructive views to help the Government formulate and implement housing policies that meet the needs of our citizens .  
Published by Canada 's Fraser Institute in conjunction with the US-based Cato Institute , and a network of independent institutions in 54 other nations , the Economic Freedom of the World : 2002 Annual Report ranked 123 nations on economic freedom which include such core elements as personal choice , voluntary exchange , freedom to compete and protection of persons and property , all of which requires the rule of law , property rights , limited government intervention , freedom to trade , and sound money .  
" Project beneficiaries include those who are homeless , people displaced and living in interim housing estates , youth with limited life skills or work options , single parents , new arrivals , the unskilled and unemployed , people with disabilities and elders who have retired early or in need of community-care . "  
The Government is committed to ensure that the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance ( CSSA ) Scheme is effective and sustainable in the long run and that limited public resources are used in the most optimal manner to meet the rising caseload , the Secretary for Health , Welfare and Food , Dr Yeoh Eng-kiong said .  
In conclusion , despite the financial stringency faced by the Government and the Housing Authority , I am confident that we can make use of our limited resources to implement the three main pillars of our housing policy , namely , helping low-income families gain access to affordable housing , minimising intervention in the market and maintaining a fair and stable operating environment for the healthy development of the private property market .  
Initial enquiries revealed that after the close down and self winding-up of a limited company running a restaurant in Kam Tin , the ex-manager , a 25-year-old man , was believed to have conspired with ex-employees and some other persons to make fraudulent claims to the Labour Department by providing false information pertinent to an overstated amount of salaries earned by the employees .  
The public consultation exercise is to seek public views on : ( a ) the introduction of a scoring system for assessing , in a more objective and systematic manner , the relative ecological importance of sites with the objective of reaching a consensus within the community on the priority sites for enhanced conservation ; and ( b ) practicable ways to better conserve ecologically important sites that are under private ownership within limited resources .  
First , both of them challenge one 's ability to execute complex ideas within limited space .  The ingenious enthusiasts of miniature landscapes set out to capture and reverberate the eternal rhythm of the universe in small pots or trays , while stamp designers strive to contain rich history and culture knowledge in the tiny space the stamp allowed .  
The public consultation exercise is to seek public views on the introduction of a scoring system for assessing , in a more objective and systematic manner , the relative ecological importance of sites with the objective of reaching a consensus within the community on the priority sites for enhanced conservation ; and practicable ways to better conserve ecologically important sites that are under private ownership within limited resources .  
In the past , surface communications between northern and eastern Taiwan were more or less limited to the Suao-Hualien Highway , a one-way road traversing rugged mountains which is both dangerous and easily disrupted by landslides during typhoons or other periods of heavy rain .  
Because crabs need constant supervision , their culture is not an easy task . The supply of snails for their diet is also limited . But as standards of living have risen , and seafood restaurants have become more popular , crab farmers are assured of a handsome profit .  
Educational opportunities are extremely limited , with room in colleges for only 3% of the youth . Strict social controls make it difficult for peasants to escape their traditional agricultural roles ; such opportunities are rarer now than they were before 1949 . Indeed , the mainland China of today has become quite conservative : those in positions of authority are mostly from poor agricultural backgrounds with little formal education .  
The reason for this is that no organization - - not even the art galleries , with their more limited scope - - had ever been capable of bringing together artists and answering their need for a congenial place in which to show their works . Furthermore , the genesis for the idea of this museum lay in that there had not been any attempt at a complete , systematic collecting of post-Ching dynasty Chinese art in modern Chinese history .  
The limited number of winners and the extreme conditions required to earn this distinctiondiligent adherence to duty and training , coupled with the crucial element of cooperation among the soldiershave served to raise the standard of a fighting spirit , help establish a military " model unit " , and an efficacy of military strength .  
You ca n't help but become hungry , yet the exquisite dessert is almost too lovely to eat . As you come to your senses you realize that you are not standing in a French patisserie , but rather a bakery in the heart of Taipei , about to enjoy one of Taiwan 's most recent popular desserts - - the fruit tart . Fruit tarts and other French pastries first appeared in Taiwan over 20 years ago , but were limited to the restaurants in international hotels .  
This added to the fact that Soochow is blessed with an abundance of water , fertile soil and a favorable climate , helped to produce some of the most breathtaking scenery in China . The intellectual pool that was present in Soochow combined with the natural conditions to mold the limited space into a realm of boundless beauty .  
Q : Now that the R . O . C has severed diplomatic relations with Nicaragua , it is rumored that Uruguay may establish ties with the Mainland . In the face of international political realities , it is very difficult for the R . O . C to appeal to " morality " and limited agricultural and economic aid as a basis for diplomacy . How should we deal with this situation ?  
Tomatoes , both a vegetable and a fruit , command a good price in the market . Chinese cabbage and mungbean sprouts , made with green lentils , are mainstays of Chinese cuisine , while sweet potatoes , high in nutrition and needing small inputs of manpower to grow , can be a main or side dish , or an animal feed . Biologists selected the all-important soybean in part because they wished to lower its high cost and make it more suitable to Taiwan , with its limited arable land .  
But after 30 years as an ambassador I 've come to one conclusion about international relations : exhortations to another country about shared feelings , morality , and fighting the common enemy , while not completely useless , are certainly limited in effect ; what 's needed is a relationship of shared interests built on a realistic basis .  
The aborigines ' food is mostly boiled or roasted and rather bland - - spices are limited to salt , hot pepper , ginger , and honey .  
During the Japanese occupation , the Japanese army surveyed the island 's mountain roads , but many of them were already long overgrown with brambles and wild grass . In addition , the paths used by the aboriginals on their hunts were not suitable for climbers , especially with the primitive equipment available to them at the time . As a result , climbing was a matter of going step by step through dense forests , and up unknown ridges , so most climbers limited themselves to familiar mountains like Yushan and Hsuehshan .  
Take water sleeves for example ; the extent of expression that can be conveyed by an actor 's hand movement is limited . After adding the sleeves , not only is the meaning of the opera deepened , but also it can make the graceful and tender figure more noticeable and give the viewer a strong and sharp sensation . If a sense of despair is to be expressed , then both sleeves are lifted high into the air at the same time .  
The former was limited to a few enthusiasts for the transcendent and sublime ; the latter appealed through claims of instant success , guaranteed universal cures and enhanced sexual performance , but its vulgar " packaging " ensured that its influence was only restricted to a narrow field .  
Thereafter , enticed by financial inducements or simply duped into going , millions of coolies accepted a modest payment and contracted to work for a limited period in tin mines or in the rubber , tea and sugar plantations of Southeast Asia . Others set off further afield to dig for guano in Peru , build railways in America , work in the gold mines of Australia and South Africa , or work behind the lines on the Great War battlefields of Europe .  
Despite the low completion rate for advance sales of new housing , the fact that the land was often bought at a time when prices were booming , together with high advertising costs , have meant that construction companies have only limited capacity to absorb the development costs themselves . From the consumer 's point of view , buying in advance and paying as the building nears completion offers an excellent way for salary earners to pay by instalment . Thus prices have only fallen by a meager 10-20% .  
We never thought we would buy a house in Hsichih , " says Hsiung Shu-hua , a public relations employee at Philips . She grew up in Hsichih but the place always seemed a bit of a backwater , awkward to get to and limited by its traditional rural economy , so when she got married three years ago she and her husband moved out to rented accommodation in Neihu .  
This deeply depressed me , and I decided to give up athletics , " Tsai explains . After seeing an international meet , he began to think that his body was unexceptional and his skills inferior . By further taking into account the limited athletic resources in the R . O . C . , he decided that in the next few years he had no way of achieving success .  
" We have to fight as few battles that we 're not sure of winning as possible to avoid wasting limited resources on meaningless frays , " says Minister of Foreign Affairs Fredrick Chien , who states that our current foreign policy is oriented mainly toward regional , economic and functional areas .  
Some child abuse is brought on by bad behavior , which is reinforced by improper methods of child-rearing , creating a vicious cycle , " Ho Su-chiu says . The responsibilities of foster parents in a case like that is n't limited to caring for the child 's daily needs . They also have to correct the child deviant behavior , so they need to employ extra skill and energy .  
Insufficient financial and human resources are the reason why handicapped athletics has never been popularized in this country , " says Ho Mao-sung . The CPAA was established seven years ago , but it only has made annual expenditures of NT $ 100,000 ( NT $ 200,000 this year ) , and the amount its volunteer director , secretary-general , and assistant secretary-general are able to accomplish is limited .  
Apart from the ups and downs of the political economic situation , Schmidt especially stressed the pessimistic outlook for the environment , raising the problem of population growth and limited resources adding to the worsening of the greenhouse effect and leading to unlimited tides of human migration . "  
Take Taipei as an example : Heavy traffic flows along the main roads and spreads out into narrow lanes which are full of parked cars and motorcycles ; real plans to give pedestrians more space are limited with expanded tiny sidewalks becoming spaces for illegal parking and crudely designed underpasses turning into dark , no-go areas .  
The promotion and advertising of formula in less developed nations has created the mistaken belief that formula is superior to mother 's milk . Yet because of limited wealth , local women thin the formula out , so that children do not get enough nutrition . Also , there is no safe , clean water , and purification and disinfecting are inadequate , so the infant mortality rate is extremely high .  
" It has passed from the youthful stage of development into the mature period , and now artificial factors are pushing it towards premature old age , " says Lin Yung-teh , explaining that even in the early period after Cheng Cheng-kung arrived in Taiwan , the clearing of land for farming , the quarrying and mining and the steps taken to control the wild rivers quickly began to affect the supply of silt downstream ; however , the potential for creating environmental disasters was very limited compared with today 's development .  
Such is the case with Chinpao Shan 's Tsao Ji-chang , who makes his complex very clear . " Most mainlanders have a wily nature : great at talking , loving to argue but not liking hard work ; they are very suitable for thinking up ideas and moving their mouths , but their sincerity is limited . They often put profit before right , and let the boss lose out . "  
Generally speaking , only to research each other is not enough . Of course , the reasons involved are very complicated . Speaking from my own limited knowledge of Western and Eastern culture , if there were one ideal state of affairs in this world , it would be a result of incorporating Western and Eastern cultural consciousness , extracting the essential kernels of each and doing away with the chaff . Perhaps that should be the objective of all mankind .  
He is worried that with the limited economic power of the Ami residents of the Shankuang Estate , as more and more high-rise blocks are built and large numbers of Han Chinese move in , the Ami will gradually lose the advantage they have enjoyed of forming the vast majority of the local population ; furthermore , each unit on the estate measures only around 65 square meters , so that as second generation residents marry , lack of space will force them to move off the estate , creating a threat to cultural maintenance .  
Swatting a fly with a hammerThe ingredients for Chinese medicine are taken from the natural world , and are limited by such factors as geographical spread . Unlike the supply of Western medicine , which is determined by factory production , the supply for Chinese medicine is not stable . Supply problems for ingredients used in Chinese medicine are nothing new , but over several thousand years , numerous plants have been found to have similar effects to those in short store .  
Lu Kuang-yang says that although musk deer , certain tortoises and horned toads are protected animals , if there is clear documentation about the sources of domestically sold medicinal ingredients and a ban on the use of threatened species , then associations of doctors and pharmacists can control themselves . With the Board of Foreign Trade handling all imports , medicinal ingredients can be stamped to show that they are legal and thus prevent smuggling . With " complete rules of the game , " he would then not object to unthreatened animals being used in limited quantities .  
Thailand 's Prince Bhisatej once publicly explained at an international agricultural conference that the agricultural assistance from every country was limited to either financial aid or the appointment of chosen specialists to draft a research report . Only the Republic of China 's specialists came in person to northern Thailand to help the Thais grow vegetables and fruit . This proved to be of enormous benefit to the daily lives of the local inhabitants of this district .  
If the subject is limited to manufacturing technology , then Taiwan companies have no huge advantage . Fortunately technology is just one element in commercial competition . Mainland manufacturers still offer too few styles , and use outdated materials . They are not like Taiwan firms , which can afford to bring in superior , more durable materials from abroad .  
Tachen Island is located off the coast of Zhejiang Province . It is a poor and obscure little place whose cuisine is largely limited to seafood . Thus , for example , their " ginger tea noodles " is made with dried fish , shrimp shells , and other seafood fried up with ginger and sesame oil added to the noodles . It 's a special dish that Tachen people give to postpartum mothers to help them regain their strength .  
Professor B . J . Habibie , Indonesia 's State Minister for Research and Technology , has said publicly : " At some stage Singapore , with its limited natural and human resources but rapid economic growth , is certain to reach a critical pressure , just like a balloon ; and Batam , 20km south of Singapore , is ready to catch the balloon which will be squeezed out of Singapore 's balloon . "  
Liu Kuang-ming says that although the problem is complex , it is not inevitable that the day will come when fishermen are banned from having even a single shark in their nets . Instead , it would be better if , after surveys , endangered sharks ' breeding grounds can be protected , the amount of shark to be caught each year can be limited , or a set of practical measures can be devised as early as possible for the use of sharks .  
The Dutch and the Cheng family simply held a series of strong points , while the authority of the Ching was limited to the western plain and a small part of the east coast . The mountain areas , inhabited by indigenous peoples , were not under central government control .  
In the past , the SEF distinguished between negotiations at the levels of chairman , secretary-general , and vice-secretary-general , and the SEF official of a given level would only negotiate with a mainland counterpart at the same level . Now , in order to increase flexibility , there will not be hard and fast distinctions between the levels . Moreover , in the past there were only negotiations on limited issue areas . Now there will also be sub-units discussing economic and cultural affairs . "  
National Yang Ming University professor of public health Lan Chung-fu , who was the first to put forward a plan for health care network development , indicates that medical resources are precious and limited , and the main spirit of a health care network plan is : to reasonably distribute medical resources , to avoid inadequate supplies and to curb waste .  
Under the Japanese occupation , Taiwanese had limited access to higher education . Lien Wen-pin , now a famous doctor at National Taiwan University Hospital , went to the temple to ask about his academic future shortly before he finished high school . The poem he drew read " You climbed the high mountain to study the immortals / But then came the imperial edict / When the white sun shines forever in a blue sky / If you so desire your fame will spread across the four seas . "  
In fact , outside the charmed circle of leading business families are large numbers of ethnic Chinese whose forebears came as laborers , and who still live at a low economic level with limited educational opportunities , just like the rest of the population . For many young women from this background , marriage is a means of escape from a life of poverty .  
The hospital was on the ground floor , with the family 's living quarters above . On the landing , Peng 's mother would put pails of disinfectant and water , with which the children would have to wash themselves before being allowed upstairs . At a time of limited understanding of sanitary principles , when many Taiwanese children were malnourished , how Peng 's childhood differed from the vast majority of Taiwanese !  
The government units charged with protecting species are weak , their funding limited , and their enforcement abilities lacking , and so the lists must put priority on those species facing pressures from hunting and international illegal trade in their parts : " They have the practical need of resolving pressing problems in society first . "  
Because of administrative financial difficulties , their environmental conservation budget is limited . Many wildlife conservation activities are even limited to private lands . This has led to a reaction , in which many voices have arisen claiming that more human energy and material should be focused on protecting entire ecosystems and habitats .  
Are n't the ' gifted scholars and fine ladies ' of the book simply versions of today 's young ' dudes and babes ? ' " The Chinese notion of predestiny in human relations originated because there was only limited opportunity for meeting partners in olden times , but waiting for a predestined match these days-waiting passively for someone to catch you-is unhealthy and ' fatalistic ! '  
The idea of " mindset " should not be limited to " positive thinking , " as emphasized by Haruyama . It also should include imagination , which can far transcend the practical realities of society . Thought patterns characterized by imagination are unrestrained by ordinary standards , and do not bow down to " reality . " This is a way of thinking that emphasizes the future and creativity .  
However , a permanent solution to the problem was still required after the crisis abated . Thus , Taiwan , which because of its limited land area and dense population has developed unique intensive rice-farming techniques , stepped forward to play a major role in bringing about a kind of " green revolution . "  
According to ROC law , when a ship takes a foreign registry , when its catch is sent back to Taiwan , it is treated as imported , and customs taxes must be paid . This is a heavy burden . Moreover , to prevent the industry growing excessively and exhausting resources , the government gives only a limited number of licenses . Ships may be scrapped and replaced , but no new ones may be added .  
Li Chin-kuo , a graduate of the Institute of Zoology at National Taiwan University , has always been concerned about wildlife . After the FS Studio class , he used the limited amount of money that he had been able to save during his compulsory military service to buy a digital video camera and a second-hand car , and headed off to fishing villages in search of material .  
Of Taiwan 's offshore islands , because Kinmen and Matsu are in a high state of military readiness , it would be costly to attack them . Thus , the PRC could choose to assault those islands in the South China Sea which are currently occupied by ROC forces . Another possible form of small-scale military conflict would be the use of surface-to-surface guided missiles . Since the political effectiveness of such missiles against offshore islands would be limited , these would more likely be targeted against political or economic centers in Taiwan itself .  
Current pharmacological treatments of heart failure are effective , but limited . For example , digitalis increases vitality and athletic endurance , but the dosage must be very finely calculated or poisoning may result . Moreover , the drug 's effect on the mortality rate is still unclear . Diuretics quickly eliminate breathing difficulties and swelling caused by the retention of water , but do not keep the patient in stable condition over long periods .  
Chou , whose primary area of research is clinical statistics , states that most of this research is limited to extractions and animal research in the Chinese medical laboratory , or consists of individual case reports . It focuses on the search for individual problems and is not widely applicable general research . " Only a very few projects can really be said to have been designed as clinical trials . And even in these cases , the design is still rough .  
At present , the mainland 's economic development is limited by serious corruption , and by the growing disparity between the standards of living of rural and urban areas , and of the coast and the interior . If these problems can not be resolved , and with the pressure from the USA on the whole of Southeast Asia , the financial crisis will continue to worsen .  
" The tendency in the past was to stress the power of the central government . This limited the power and capabilities of local government , " says Woody Cheng , chief of the history teaching section at Feng Chia University . In Cheng 's opinion , the " patriarchal " political structure had the effect of turning government bodies below the provincial-government level into powerless " daughters-in-law ; " dependent upon the " patriarch 's " mood for their own allocations of money and power .  
In recent years , with advocacy by women 's groups and changing social and economic relations , the social participation and status of Taiwan women has begun to change . The legislature has passed a number of measures to make men and women more equal . However , Tang Wen-hui , an assistant professor in the graduate institute of political economy at National Chengkung University , believes that the public role of women in Taiwan is still limited by traditional family values , and that there has not been as much change as many might think .  
Another factor was that in the wake of Pearl Harbor , there were only limited numbers of fit , potential conscripts left in Japan , and with the expansion of the Japanese lines from the Pacific to Southeast Asia , the tough , hardworking aboriginal youths , with their knack for fighting in forested mountain terrain , naturally became a priority consideration .  
On the question of KPS setting up its own channel , Father Raymond Parent notes that when he was a member of the Government Information Office 's nine-member research team on cable television , he felt that the remit set by the GIO was too narrow , and the pace of legal reform too slow . With the chaotic situation of the time , when all cable channels were illegal , it would have been very difficult for KPS , with its limited financial resources , to enter this market .  
Twenty-eight-year-old Li Ching-yu went to senior high school and university in Canada , and graduated in economics . After he took over his father 's business four years ago , he introduced modern management methods . He not only redecorated and enlarged the premises , set up a limited company and instituted a profit sharing and stock ownership scheme for employees , but recently also embarked on an expansion plan calling for opening new branches , like a home-grown McDonald 's .  
This approach of marrying outside capital and technology with the rich local marine resources is one of the more feasible models by which the Taiwanese fishing industry , faced with limited opportunities at home , can develop overseas operations . The RMI , which has just established diplomatic relations with the ROC , is an ideal place for such investment .  
Because past surveys of Taiwan faults were mostly limited to examinations of surface geology , with no money to obtain more precise results by digging or drilling under the surface , major mistakes were common . Particularly in metropolitan areas where high real estate prices mean that all the land is covered by buildings , ruptures are impossible to see .  
In recent times , due to the limited productive value of its mainly agricultural economy , the township had become rather run-down and had been losing population to other areas . Nonetheless , it still had many distinctive historic features such as Chichi Railway Station and Minghsin Academy , along with traditional rural scenes such as tobacco fields , banana groves , fruit orchards and tree-lined roads . These assets had long ago given Lin the idea of using them as tourist resources to breathe new life into Chichi .  
On September 25 , the Executive Yuan met in extraordinary session to invoke emergency powers , define the boundaries of the disaster area and , for a limited period , suspend various laws and regulations that limit the central government 's discretionary authority over public expenditures , land appropriation , government procurement , and the use of material and equipment belonging to government agencies . The aim was to cut through red tape which could potentially obstruct disaster relief and reconstruction work .  
The programming for these time slots was low-budget , and the subject matter limited to ordinary life in Taiwan 's unsophisticated rural past , mostly tragic tales of mistreated daughters-in-law and the like , or family comedies . Thus , for a long time , Taiwanese drama gave people the impression of being lowbrow .  
In fact , Taiwan 's main parties-the KMT and the DPP as the two major parties , with the New Party as a noteworthy but limited third force-all understand the implications of James Soong 's powerful candidacy very clearly . They know that this election is not only a struggle for political office , but even more is a critical moment that may decide whether their respective parties develop , split up , or disappear .  
Given that education was run by and for government bureaucrats , those who studied did so only in order to further their ambitions and become officials . They cared little for knowledge or morality , or for the intrinsic value of learning . Philosophers realized that education and teaching materials lacked vitality and in fact limited people 's development in various ways . In order to escape the rigid and lifeless official education system , private education began to flourish .  
With the exception of the Yehliu facility , whose main selling point is cetacean ( whale and dolphin ) shows , most of the older aquariums , in comparison with the new ones , had few regular visitors and only limited fish-husbandry technology . Consequently most relied on short-term exhibits , such as special exhibits of precious marine life held at the lunar new year .  
When the Dutch took over Tainan , they encouraged the cultivation and export of cane sugar , a crop that grew exceptionally well on the Chianan Plain stretching out from Tainan in almost every direction . On the strength of this economic base , Tainan naturally became the political center of Taiwan . Although southern Taiwan is dominated today by Kaohsiung , back then the latter was just one of Tainan 's satellite ports , with development limited by heavy silting and shallow berths .  
This naturally makes local governments very reliant upon , and vulnerable to control by , the central government . Although the actual amount of the tax redistribution is limited , local governments have to shoulder most of the burden of maintaining infrastructure , social services , education , cultural activities , and more . Local finances are very strained as a result .  
The construction budget for the new terminal at CKS Airport , which opened in July , included a public art allocation of NT $ 100 million . Deciding how to handle this huge sum proved a difficult task for the project 's executive committee . Many people questioned whether public art has to be limited to the installation of permanent " works of art . "  
In Taiwan , there is no integration among the academic disciplines of zoology , botany , marine life , climate , soil conservation , and the like . Environmental protection agencies are weak , and research funding is limited . Thus there is little concrete knowledge about the numbers of various species and whether these numbers are rising or falling , not to mention any understanding of what concrete steps can be taken to solve specific problems .  
For most of history , the limited powers of our unaided senses left humans blissfully unaware of the micro-organisms all around us . But the development of optical instruments gradually lifted the veil from that hidden world , so that human ideas about life had to be constantly revised .  
In taxonomic terms , life on Earth was no longer limited to the animal and plant kingdoms , but new kingdoms-fungi , bacteria , and protoctista ( protozoa , algae etc . ) - had to be recognized , to bring the total number to five . Each of the kingdoms of micro-organisms is just as gigantic , rich and complex as the plant and animal kingdoms .  
Late 1996 saw the launching of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ( SOHO ) satellite , which was built in a collaborative project between the European Space Agency and NASA . SOHO 's missions include studying the sun 's internal structure and outer atmosphere , and the solar wind . But satellite observations are immensely costly , and satellites have a limited service life and a high risk of failure .  
Before the advent of acoustic imaging , the degree of understanding of the sun 's internal structure that could be gained from its surface oscillations was very limited . For instance , scientists were already aware that the cycle of sunspot activity is related to the way the north and south magnetic poles of the sun are reversed every 11 years . But where was the sun 's magnetic field located ?  
Take Citicorp , for example . Although it has a good image , offers comprehensive financial services , and is creative with its management methods , it has been frustrated to find that its business has remained limited to foreign firms and members of the economic elite . It has continued to be unsuccessful in entering the mass market .  
COA chairman Chen Hsi-huang , who earned his degree in agricultural economics at National Taiwan University ( NTU ) notes that Taiwan 's agricultural policies used to stress increased production-producing as much as possible on the limited land available . Consequently , Taiwan-produced canned champignon mushrooms and asparagus commanded 65% of the international market . Coupled with the export of massive amounts of sugar , rice , and bananas , this stimulated the formation of capitalistic agriculture which , in turn , helped prepare the way for the subsequent take off of industry .  
Because the basic aptitude test is only one hurdle , rather than ( as with the previous exams ) a one-shot effort to survey everything the student learned in three years of junior high school or high school , it can place more emphasis on the overall capabilities of the child . Thus , the scope is much broader-no longer limited to school textbooks-while the questions can be framed in a much more lively and flexible way .  
Chu reasoned that the initial translation was too dry to be successful . Moreover , the first translator 's understanding of the fantasy genre was too limited to fully evoke the fantastic macrocosm that Tolkien depicted in his work . Chu promised that this time around he would provide a much more vivid translation .  
Efforts to cut back on plastic waste shifted into a higher gear on January 1 with a measure restricting the use of plastic bags and plastic ( including expanded polystyrene , i.e . " styrofoam " ) disposable eating utensils . This marks the second phase of implementation of a policy that was first introduced on a more limited scale last July , when the government clamped down on the use of such items by government agencies , membership supermarkets for military personnel , and public and private schools .  
They include the medical teams of the International Cooperation and Development Fund , young men doing " overseas duty " as a substitute for military service , religious organizations , and individual doctors . They are performing a wide range of medical assistance activities not just limited to simple humanitarian aid , including donation of medical supplies , technical exchange in the field of public health , education and training , promotion of preventive medicine against epidemic illnesses , and " matchmaking " between people with certain medical needs and those who can provide what is needed .  
Thanks to the experience accumulated by the ICDF and other aid groups , NGOs providing medical aid need no longer be limited to satisfying the ambition of some romantically minded individuals to do good deeds . For example , the cleft lip and cleft palate surgery program of the Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation ( NCF ) in Vietnam , Cambodia , the Philippines , and elsewhere includes free consultations , technical instruction , equipment donation , post-surgery speech therapy , and so on , so that medical resources are applied in a systematic manner .  
" Currently , only 35 people a year are allowed to perform foreign medical service in lieu of military service , " Kay notes . " This is too small a number , and those performing this service should n't be limited to males of enlistment age . " Having grown up amid affluence , young Taiwanese often have a utilitarian bias . By performing overseas service , they can learn that " those who give always get more in return . "  
Each occasion of volunteer clinical services sponsored by Tzu Chi starts with sowing seeds at the local level . Assistance is not limited to medical care , moreover , but uses an integrated-team model that allows Tzu Chi operations to set down local roots , so that people can become independent and help themselves .  
When art therapy , which uses mental symbols and intuition , is applied to mental illness , sexual abuse , child abuse cases , or to children whose verbal understanding is limited , it is able to gradually lower the patient 's defense mechanisms , build a better relationship between patient and therapist and unearth the old stories that lie buried in the deepest recesses of the subconscious .  
In reality , neglected sites need not be publicly owned spaces , and they need not be limited to separate and distinct buildings . Idle spaces can be found everywhere . Their scope includes a single empty building , a sidewalk , a row of houses , or an abandoned or wild piece of land . " So long as spaces are n't managed well and do n't function well , then public and private spaces can both be included , " says Lin Po-nian , publisher of Space Magazine .  
The dominant influence of NTU-known as Taida to Taiwanese-in political circles can be seen in the fact that the " Taida Gang " accounts for more than 40 legislators , including members of both the governing and opposition parties . And the glory of Taida has not been limited to politics . As Taiwan has made the transition from agricultural to industrial to high-tech society , many NTU alums have from scratch developed chip processing , IC design , and the largest notebook computer factory in the world , similarly producing a brilliant record .  
Fortunately , after a decade of fighting the good fight , the kinds of books for women now available in mainstream bookstores are no longer limited to childcare and cooking . Moreover , now that there are so many venues for artistic and intellectual events , Fembooks is no longer indispensable for the spread of the ideas and creative work that it has long promoted . It seems that the bookshop 's mission , particular to its specific time and place in the history of feminism in Taiwan , has been accomplished .  
I 've noticed a trend : in recent years , a large number of works that have entered the market have been from the mainland-both original Chinese and translated works-and this has become one of the causes of the current rapid expansion of the Taiwanese book market . Moreover , these books are n't limited to the old academic and translated works , they 've now grown to include popular literature .  
He gives half the income from the restaurant to charity , and once a month he hosts a free dinner for a guest list that includes volunteer teachers and lonely elderly people with no families . He also works to promote environmental , conservation , and animal-rights values in the PRC , so that the vegetarian outlook on life can set down deeper roots , and not just be limited to eating habits or health .  
A year earlier , during the celebration of their anniversary in 1999 , they sold models of Taiwan 's earliest locomotive , the Tengyun , " Cloud Rider , " with the words " Remembering our Trains " carved on them . These models were a 1000-unit limited edition , with each selling for NT $ 35,000 ; no-one expected they would sell out in the space of a day-even the TRA were blown away .  
Can you remember road workers applying a mixture of asphalt and gravel on dirt roads ? How they would spread it lightly and evenly , laying down a black carpet ? Although asphalt smells unpleasant , we love the smooth surface of asphalt roads and the comfortable rides they provide . Indeed for most of us , our impressions about asphalt are pretty much limited to roads .  
The mountain Karen still make a living through such traditional methods as swidden farming , fishing , hunting and gathering , working hard to eke out an existence each and every day . However , as their numbers have increased , the limited availability of agricultural land and the impact of modernization and natural disasters have meant that they now lack adequate resources to meet their daily subsistence needs , and have been reduced to penury and perpetual shortage .  
Wu Huang , deputy secretary-general of the Energy Commission of the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( MOEA ) , explains further : " Precisely because the range of renewable energies is so diverse , each country has to direct its limited resources toward the development of selected areas in which it has an advantage . Thus Germany is developing wind power and Japan hydroelectric power . In Taiwan we hope to achieve a balanced development of hydro , wind , geothermal , biomass and photovoltaic energy sources . "  
Furthermore , modern people may lack ecological and environmental knowledge . Or they may know that natural resources are limited and that biodiversity is important , but be unable to refuse materialistic temptations , lack the time to recycle , and be powerless to refuse their children 's requests for the fashionable pet of the moment . More knowledge does not necessarily help in easing environmental deterioration .  
Hu herself admits to having a very active disposition , and she ca n't stand being idle . Her free time at home was limited , and during the downtime after the housework was finished she was always a bit edgy and thinking about how she could further her learning , so she took on the volunteer work at the library . Later she joined up with a study group run by the Mandarin Daily News , and finally , ten years ago , she moved on to the volunteer service at NTUH .  
While education reform is something that countries all over the world are engaged in , Prudence Chu-ing Chou , professor at National Chengchi 's University College of Education , finds it " unprecedented " that Taiwan , with its limited resources as well as inadequate accompanying measures , is pushing ahead with such sweeping education reforms in such a short amount of time .  
Dr . Hani introduced that the Afghan interim government submitted the government budget of the 2002 fiscal year of a total sum of 0.46-billion USD in the meeting of the Executive Team of Aids to Afghanistan held in April . Because the financial income of the interim government was very limited , there was a gap of 0.4-billion US dollars in the budget that needed to be filled up by international aids .  
In remote , rural areas , the programme was usually limited to the basic essential information , such as the meaning of the " red " and the " blue " ballots , and practice voting .  
Past mediation efforts have been shown to be insufficient because they were limited by a mandate lacking firmness , but also rendered more difficult by the diverse political interests of individual external forces .  
With its limited financial and human resources , it is trying to control the problem at the national level , and to contribute at a regional and international level in an integrated and comprehensive manner .  
They recalled the two mutually supporting forms of action by CSCE : those joint political decisions taken in accordance with consensus rules and direct action through agreed mechanisms activated by a limited number of participating States .  
Such strategies are however dangerous and difficult to reverse : surplus fishing vessels , once established in a fishery , may be difficult to displace , with limited alternative incomeearning opportunities , and a loss in economic yield will certainly occur .  
Deeply preoccupied by the increasingly heavy burden being imposed , particularly upon developing countries with limited resources of their own and upon the international community as a whole , by these sudden mass exoduses and displacements of population ,  
Inequitable distribution of resources , irrational duplication and overlapping of functions , limited authority at the local level , and uncoordinated efforts between public , private , voluntary and nongovernmental organizations still dominate the urban scene .  
In an environment of slow growth , lack of public and private resources , limited external assistance and constraints of technical , managerial and organizational capacity , the challenges in basic infrastructure are formidable .  
The number of deaths caused by contagious and all chronic noncontagious ( cardiovascular , respiratory ) as well as cancerous diseases has increased as a result of very limited possibilities for early detection and adequate treatment .  
The proposed initiative was designed to offer ways for the reasonable expression of plausible aspirations of that nature through free options ranging from limited and basic selfadministration to virtual internal selfgovernment .  
Account should be taken of such problems as extreme poverty , limited resources , dependence on primary commodities , proportional public debt , lack of basic infrastructures and insufficient administrative capacity .  
The number of deaths caused by contagious and all chronic noncontagious ( cardiovascular , respiratory ) , as well as cancerous diseases , has increased as a result of very limited possibilities for early detection and adequate treatment .  
But as ethnic conflicts spread and political solutions become more elusive , there is a risk that humanitarian operations could become prolonged , draining limited resources and causing untold suffering .  
Since before the 1980s , Central America had begun to suffer the effects of a deep political , economic and social crisis that came about precisely because national societies had developed within a system of limited democracy in particular , because social programmes were not formulated or executed , a doctrine of national security was promoted , political arenas were closed and civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights were violated in one way or another . 
First , France has not announced its intention to continue its nuclear testing indefinitely ; on the contrary , we have stated our decision to complete it by engaging in a final series limited to a few tests , which will be concluded before 31 May 1996 .  
They now face the challenging tasks of reviving and modernizing national institutions , designing and developing both the human and the physical infrastructures , and rebuilding the economy by revitalizing agriculture , industry and trade and social services all with extremely limited resources and formidable impediments . 
Poverty has various manifestations ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increased morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion ; it is also characterized by a lack of participation in decision-making and in civil and socio-cultural life . 
However , in order to use the limited resources in an optimal manner to meet these different needs a single comprehensive framework of training materials should be developed through modules that would be applicable to countries depending on their status and capability in national accounts .  
The months immediately preceding December last year marked such a deterioration in the political and security situation in Liberia that the number of military observers of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia ( UNOMIL ) had to be drastically reduced , the humanitarian situation worsened , and the area controlled by the Military Observer Group of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOMOG ) effectively became limited to no more than 15 per cent of the country . 
A main conclusion of this study is that eastern Kenya 's limited resource base and rapid rate of population growth require comprehensive rural and regional development planning .  
Our Government is more than determined to take the reins of its destiny and lead its people to the brightest , most peaceful and prosperous future that its current limited economic , infrastructural and organizational capacities can provide .  
The representative informed the members of the Committee that the Government of the Russian Federation , having realized that the monetarist underpinning of the first wave of economic reform provided only a limited set of social protection measures , had emphasized the provision of a proper level of social protection as the main requirement for the continuation of economic reform .  
Although there were guard posts at all gates and entry into the compound was limited to those who either held a regular pass or were given temporary passes , bogus passes , which were indistinguishable from the genuine ones , could easily be bought at the Bakara market of the city .  
Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure sustainable livelihoods ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increased morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .  
They typically possess limited institutional and human resource capacity to assess the implications for sustainable agricultural and rural development of ongoing developmental plans .  
At the same time , many non-governmental organizations note and are concerned that factors such as distance , limited human and financial resources , and unequal access to information are tending to distinguish between those non-governmental organizations that are closely following international processes and those , particularly in the developing world , that are not .  
Call upon multilateral organizations and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to cooperate with Governments in developing a coordinating mechanism to ensure the effective implementation of existing conventions and agreements on biological diversity and the rational use of limited resources ;  
The economic and social assistance rendered by the specialized agencies and international institutions of the United Nations system should be increased and redesigned to create special programmes of assistance to those Territories , bearing in mind their specific characteristics , such as their small areas and populations , their remoteness , their limited resources and internal markets , their dependence on imports , and their vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards .  
The considerably longer labour hours of women and limited access to paid labour because of the lack of financial resources complicates the potential expansion of agricultural production even where women have traditional , and often seasonal , rights to husband 's labour for such tasks as helping to clear their individual plots .  
The support extended by the General Assembly , in terms of both its endorsement of the strategy and the provision of additional limited budgetary resources to develop a planning and policy coordination capacity within the Office of Human Resources Management represents a modest step forward towards addressing the legitimate concerns expressed by the Inspectors .  
Furthermore , some of the ILO programmes , such as Occupational Safety and Health and certain of the industry committees , have observed that , since they cover technical fields which continue to have limited numbers of women professionals , especially in the developing world , the participants selected at the national level for their meetings often continue to be male , despite requests made to the national authorities to include women .  
It is generally recognized that the capacity of agriculture to absorb the growing labour force on a long-term basis is limited in most of the developing countries with a high incidence of rural poverty by the sheer unavailability of additional arable land . 
In fact such local-level agencies have emerged as a new locus of economic and social growth , providing innovative institutional arrangements through which family planning , health , education and income-generating activities can be integrated at the local level , ensuring environmentally sensitive sustainable development on a limited scale .  
Analysis of the major factors behind the observed behaviour of commodity prices reveals that conventional factors , such as the prevailing macroeconomic conditions in industrialized countries , are estimated to have contributed in only a limited way to the recent weakness in real commodity prices and that the expansion in the supply of commodities played a fundamental role .  
The granting of assistance is limited to the following conditions : ( a ) it should be selective and restricted to those parts of the economy where severe difficulties would otherwise occur ; ( b ) it should be limited to well-defined transitional periods laid down in advance and adapted to the specific socio-economic problems associated with the implementation of a country 's environmental programme ; and ( c ) it should not create significant distortions in international trade and investment .  
Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .  
In addition , based on the experience gained since the deployment of MINURSO , and given the conditions prevalent in Western Sahara , it is considered that an engineering unit of approximately 100 ( all ranks ) would also be required to perform , inter alia , the following tasks : limited mine clearing ; basic infrastructure repair ; and the construction and operation of water points in certain specific areas essential to MINURSO operations .  
Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure sustainable livelihoods ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increased morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .  
In this connection , the team wishes to point out that because of the existence of well-equipped regional and international organizations engaged in promoting the process of economic reform in the economies in transition , it would be advisable for ECE to confine the provision of technical cooperation activities to limited priorities which complement its regular programme of work .  
There seems to be an emerging consensus on two points : ( a ) United Nations involvement in peace-keeping should be scaled back and authorized limited operations should be conducted with greater cost effectiveness ; and ( b ) there should be increasing emphasis on preventive strategies and programmes that address the economic , social and other root causes of conflicts .  
It was emphasized that the proposed court should be established as a body whose jurisdiction would complement that of national courts and existing procedures for international judicial cooperation in criminal matters and that its jurisdiction should be limited to the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole .  
Governments designed and directed credit programmes , controlled interest rates , limited the access of its citizens to foreign currencies , restricted the access of foreigners and maintained fixed exchange rates .  
Among the problems the subprogramme will address are those related to improving international purchasing and supply management methods and practices , inappropriate procurement procedures and organizational structures , insufficient external and internal information for import planning and supply management , lack of skilled personnel and limited availability of import support services .  
The exercise analysed the current state of human development in the countries and identified broad development strategies that take into account the specific socio-economic characteristics , fragile ecosystems and limited natural resource base of these island economies .  
The Pacific island countries and the donor community are now faced with the challenge of translating these strategies into concrete action at the country level , with a need to generate broad-based economic growth while making judicious , sustainable use of the limited natural resource base and ensuring a balance of the fragile ecosystems .  
In an era of financial stringency , the limited resources available to assist developing countries must be directed prudently towards those investments with the highest payoff ; experience in country after country demonstrates that water and sanitation improvements are vital to economic progress and , more broadly , provide the very foundations for sustainable human development .  
On a more positive note , some have launched innovative schemes for reducing the use of foreign exchange in regional transactions , for example the introduction by the PTA of a traveller 's cheque , while among other developing countries a limited number of multilateral trade financing and export-credit guarantee facilities have been established , and in others financial resources are being increasingly mobilized through the establishment of regional capital markets .  
Among the multilateral organizations , the World Bank , which had previously paid limited attention to regional integration , has in the recent past been adopting an unambiguous supportive role , as manifested in several of its activities in Africa in particular , and the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) has made support for regional economic cooperation a central feature of its programming cycles .  
At the South-South level , cooperation could cover a broad area , or it could be limited to more extensive use of the technical cooperation among developing countries modality through which developing countries or regions with greater experience and knowledge in foreign direct investment matters could assist other developing countries in a variety of ways , including the provision of training . 
UNFPA will , therefore , develop a strategy for future allocations of its limited resources to help build capacities in developing countries to implement the Programme of Action , based on different levels of financial needs for multilateral assistance and the level of achievement with regard to quantitative goals of the Conference .  
National participating organizations would be expected to constitute teams of qualified volunteers ( perhaps focusing on a limited number of areas of coverage identified by each organization ) , assure their specialized training and facilitate the rapid deployment and integration of such teams , including the building of linkages with local non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations in the receiving countries .  
The Acting Director emphasized that that situation limited the Institute 's capacity to provide the corresponding General Assembly committees with substantive contributions and research findings in critical areas of economic and social development processes , such as : water , environment and sustainable development , waste management , renewable sources of energy , human settlements , poverty alleviation , desertification , international migration , and violence against women migrant workers .  
Constraints on the development of the public utilities included the lack of a development plan and institutional structures , limited administrative and managerial skills of personnel , dependence , to a large extent , on the Israeli systems , the inadequate technical condition of the Palestinian systems and limited financial resources .  
This principle , first expressed in German law and in international law , is accepted as a general principle in all legal systems regarding public administration , but it is usually reflected in specific principles of more or less limited scope ;  
It can be easier for the Governments of States that share the same cultural values and are confronted with similar economic and development problems to accept at that level the generalization of a number of fundamental principles regarding public administration and , eventually , judicial review on limited matters or cases by an international court established by a treaty .  
At the social level , conditions of life are very difficult , characterized by poor nutrition as a result of low purchasing power , poor health , with widespread diseases such as tuberculosis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , inadequate educational facilities and limited qualified manpower .  
The impact of written material was reduced as a result of low literacy rates throughout the country ; local radio and television facilities were old , in bad repair and had limited range .  
After four years of the utmost patience and restraint , the Republic of Croatia accurately concluded that the least costly solution for both Croatia and the international community to end Croatia 's agony and the international community 's humanitarian concerns in Bosnia and Herzegovina would require a limited but credible use of force that would end the siege of Bihac and restore order in adjacent occupied territories of Croatia .  
In the Agreement , the Government has committed itself to the effective protection of indigenous rights by promoting the creation of legal offices for the defence of those rights and the establishment of " popular law offices " to provide free legal assistance to persons of limited economic means in municipalities in which indigenous communities are prevalent .  
The work before the Panel is characterized by two main considerations : first , the broad scope and complexity of issues that need to be dealt with in a very limited time-frame ; second , the fact that in planning its work the Panel needs to consider the anticipated outputs of a large number of ongoing processes and initiatives in order to develop a cohesive and comprehensive perspective and to formulate options for future action .  
This composite picture of economic hardship compounded by environmental devastation , and of social strife compounded by economic hardship , has drawn only limited sympathy from the international community .  
At the same time , there is a growing realization that technological cooperation among developing countries can not be limited to meetings at the governmental or departmental level and that more effort should be made to involve individual firms , including SMEs . Firms cooperate when they perceive a business opportunity and possibilities for technological empowerment .  41 / Several forms of such inter-firm regional cooperation have been emerging in different countries .  
Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .  
Reproductive health eludes many of the world 's people because of such factors as : inadequate levels of knowledge about human sexuality and inappropriate or poor-quality reproductive health information and services ; the prevalence of high-risk sexual behaviour ; discriminatory social practices ; negative attitudes towards women and girls ; and the limited power many women and girls have over their sexual and reproductive lives .  
The Government of Cuba has made considerable efforts to mitigate the traumatic effects of the criminal blockade on the Cuban nation and has tried to ensure , with the limited resources available to the country , that food and medicines are equally distributed among the people and that the levels of medical care , education , security and social welfare are maintained .  
The Croatian Army , which is operating in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the express request of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina , and consistent with international law and within the framework of the bilateral agreement signed between the two respective Governments , will end its limited military activities in the area in the shortest time possible .  
Pilot projects take into account the specific characteristics of small island developing States in relation to waste generation and disposal , fragile ecosystems , limited resource base , geographical isolation and scarce human resources .  
He pointed to the successful collaboration of JUNIC in the field of major United Nations conferences and to the benefits of strong inter-agency cooperation ; he expressed his belief that increased effectiveness would result from a further streamlining of the JUNIC agenda and encouraged its members to use the annual meetings for focusing on a limited number of important information policy issues .

NULLAlthough special programmes and specialized financial institutions are important , their limited coverage means that a sustained impact on the problem of underfunding of micro-enterprises and SMEs calls for more active involvement of commercial banks , which tend to exclude this portion of the population because of the conviction that it is too costly to service .  
Whereas the focus has been on the provision of humanitarian assistance to those people , the countries receiving the refugees , despite their limited resources , have made substantial contributions by accepting the refugees and assisting in catering to their essential needs , while experiencing rising social tension and suffering nearly irreparable environmental degradation , notably in the United Republic of Tanzania and Zaire . 
In particular , the main purposes of the Decade were lost among initiatives of limited scope or proposals to establish direct communication links between the United Nations system and indigenous communities , without due regard to the legitimate role of national Governments as the appropriate channel for international cooperation .  
NULLThe primary stage of financial intermediation is dominated by a combination of a large informal sector where transactions between lenders and borrowers are direct and personal , a currency-creating authority ( a central bank or a currency board ) , and a limited number of deposit-receiving and credit institutions like the commercial banks .  
This stage of financial intermediation requires the satisfaction of only a few simple preconditions : the existence of a rudimentary regulatory and supervisory framework over the takers of deposits , and a minimum of institutional and technical capacity to carry out the currency-issuing and credit-extending functions , and to collect and interpret limited monetary information .  
Factors such as deprivation of education , limited meaningful human contact and easy access to sophisticated weapons , coupled with the experience of the cruelties of war , destroy the value system of many young people , resulting in a failure to discourage them from participating in violent activities .  
NULL FRITSCHE ( Liechtenstein ) said that her country , through its proposal concerning self-determination , sought to provide a means , short of full independence , whereby the reasonable aspirations of distinct communities within States could find expression through different types of self-administration , ranging , according to the circumstances , from limited self-administration to something approaching internal self-government . 
Given current financial constraints and the fact that a limited number of persons had access to the seminars organized under the Programme , audiovisual tapes on various subjects of international law were a convenient tool to place at the disposal of educational institutions of States , especially developing States .  
His delegation agreed that the crimes covered by the statute should be limited to war crimes , acts of genocide , violations of the laws and customs applicable in armed conflict , and crimes against humanity , all of which were forbidden under customary international law , and that treaty-based crimes such as those linked to drug trafficking and terrorism should be deleted .  
These obstacles must be analysed in the context of international political and economic relations characterized by the globalization of the economy and in a specific historical context marked by the end of the cold war and East-West confrontation , the emergence of regional economic groupings and the concentration of economic , financial and technological power in the hands of a limited number of countries .  
At a time when tremendous efforts were being made at the regional and subregional levels to overcome the problems with which the continent was faced , the role of the United Nations should be enhanced , particularly in the fields of social and economic development , rather than limited to humanitarian assistance .  
a result of the constitutional changes in the Sudan , which had granted total autonomy to the existing 26 federal states , the status of the refugees could be affected if the international community did not adopt urgent measures to provide more support to the States in which the majority of the refugees were concentrated , especially since in many cases they had overloaded the country 's already limited economic capacity .  
with interest that the Government of Nigeria , on 1 October 1995 , affirmed the principle of multi-party democracy , announcing its intent to accept the principle of power-sharing , lift the ban on political activity and the press , devolve power to local levels of government and subordinate the military to civilian authority , but disappointed that only limited action in this regard has followed ,

Though a service designed for a different society and limited to the specific areas assigned by the colonial administration , Malta 's public service gave its contribution to the development of the new State by providing continuity in certain vital domestic sectors and in the setting up of new services , including that of foreign affairs .  
Particularly relevant were the country 's limited economic capacities and its dependence on farm production , which had only very recently begun to be modernized ; high rates of poverty and marginalization among the population ; the institutional and cultural consequences of the prolonged dictatorship ; and the existence of a very traditional and hierarchical society .  
If in the resolution of crisis and conflicts the participation of the majority of countries is somewhat limited or even indirect , through an intermediary mechanism , in the resolution of the global issues for development the United Nations has been able to mobilize the direct participation of all countries , big and small , rich and poor , developed and developing , because these are not just to whom it may concern issues .  
While we are aware that the matter of economic and individual personal development is first and foremost a national responsibility , we are deeply conscious that our limited domestic resources constitute a severe constraint upon us in our quest to fulfil this obligation .  
We are convinced that through prudent management of our very limited resources , a willingness on the part of our people to work hard and , on our part , clear political leadership and virtuously inspired guidance all enhanced by the support of friendly Governments and donor agencies we shall , in due course , place our country on a sound path towards genuine growth .  
The Commonwealth of Dominica has taken steps , commensurate with its limited resources , to deal with the problem at the national level , and it is a party to cooperative regional arrangements aimed at impeding the trans-shipment of illicit drugs through the Caribbean region .  
The major issues on which the attention of the Organization is focused today , whether we are talking about the principal themes of the Agenda for Peace , the democratization of United Nations structures and their functioning or improving the Organization 's effectiveness , represent a movement , at present relatively limited , in which the Court should legitimately be concerned and , we think , involved .  
Indeed , 72 per cent of single heads of households , most of them female , live below the official poverty line , which simply implies a lack of access or limited access to basic social services , including food , sanitation , shelter , basic education and primary health care . 
As many United Nations agencies had stated , the impact of the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq was not limited to the frightening number of deaths which it had caused among children , women and the elderly , since in fact an entire generation of Iraqis had been sacrificed as a result of the difficulties they had encountered in terms of education and health and other social spheres .  
The limited coverage of health facilities , particularly in rural areas , poor referral or inadequate service delivery systems and the lack of human resources play further major roles in terms of limited access to reproductive health services and the quality of care provided in those facilities .  
The symposium identified the main reasons for the lack of a systematic strategy for the provision of comprehensive health care in refugee situations : the low priority accorded to it by organizations specialized in emergency response ; insufficient field staff with appropriate training ; limited funding and resource allocation ; insufficient coordination among national authorities , non-governmental organizations and United Nations organizations and agencies in the country of asylum ; and consideration of family planning as a sensitive issue in post-conflict situations without seeking the views and support of refugee women .  
The vast majority of the people in developing countries live in rural areas , with daily nutritional intake below basic requirements , high infant mortality rates , shorter life expectancy than that in industrialized countries and limited or no access to safe water and sanitation . 
It must never be forgotten that behind the statistics , concepts and operational schemes were individuals caught in tragic situations whose only hope was a universal respect for the notion of human dignity , even if that was limited to the minimum for life , namely safety , food , shelter , water , medicine and basic education .  
Particularly relevant were : the country 's limited economic capacities , depending on farm production which had only very recently begun to be modernized ; high rates of poverty and marginalization among the population ; the institutional and cultural consequences of the prolonged dictatorship ; and the existence of a very traditional and hierarchical society .  
Stressing the importance of chapter VI of annex II to the report of the Beijing Conference , he said that it was essential that adequate financial resources should be made available at the international level , particularly for small island developing States which had only limited economic capacities , for the implementation of the Platform for Action . 
Particularly relevant were the country 's limited economic capacities and its dependence on farm production , which had only very recently begun to be modernized ; high rates of poverty and marginalization among the population ; the institutional and cultural consequences of the prolonged dictatorship ; and the existence of a very traditional and hierarchical society .  
Currently , the health of women in Rwanda was extremely vulnerable due to lack of medical infrastructure , supplies and personnel , limited financial resources , lack of access to health care , malnutrition , unsafe drinking-water , and the spread of HIV / AIDS . Women were more susceptible to diseases than men because they were overworked , had unplanned pregnancies , were malnourished during pregnancy and suffered complications from childbirth . 
The Conference noted that the participation of scientists , researchers and educators from developing countries in international projects , as well as in international scientific information exchange , was extremely limited not only due to insufficient resources ( both financial and human ) , but also because of inadequate access to scientific and technical information .  
A limited number of industrialized countries can both meet their domestic needs for scientific and technical information and be active partners in international efforts .  
The principles considered were not limited to traditional relations of public international law but were in fact also relevant to private international law ( conflict of laws with regard to transnational relations between individuals and various kinds of organizations , whether incorporated or not ) and international administrative law ( with regard to relations between individuals or organizations and public authorities ) .  
Noting that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community to the implementation of the priority programmes in fulfilment of the Peace Agreement , including the strengthening of democratic institutions , the national reconstruction plan and the economic and social development plan , the implementation of certain programmes and projects basic to the process has continued to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability and the reduction of financial resources in support of the consolidation of peace ,  
Noting with interest that the Government of Nigeria , on 1 October 1995 , affirmed the principle of multi-party democracy , announcing its intent to accept the principle of power-sharing , lift the ban on political activity and the press , devolve power to local levels of government and subordinate the military to civilian authority , but disappointed that only limited action in this regard has followed ,  
13 Insufficient human and financial resources and limited administrative capacities and logistical infrastructure contributed to the low absorptive capacity characteristic of several States of the region , and to a level of activities lower than that envisaged by UNDCP .  
Article 44 of the amended Constitution stipulated that in using frequency bands for radio services , member administrations should bear in mind that radio frequencies and the geostationary-satellite orbit were limited natural resources which must be used rationally , efficiently and economically , so that countries or groups of countries could have equitable access to both , taking account of the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
43 His delegation considered that any draft text prepared by the Subcommittee on the utilization of the geostationary orbit should mention chapter VII , article 44 , No . 196 , paragraph 2 , of the Constitution of ITU , which indicated that the geostationary-satellite orbit was a limited natural resource and must be used rationally , efficiently and economically , and that countries or groups of countries must have equitable access to it , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
For geographical reasons Ecuador had demonstrated great interest in the geostationary orbit , which was a limited natural resource with special characteristics , and for which there should be a sui generis legal regime regulating access to and utilization of the orbit and guaranteeing equitable access to it , with account being taken of the relative disadvantages of the developing countries .  
Along those lines , it was suggested that the requirement should be limited to sensitive areas of public service or to cases where an abuse of power might be suspected and that the last sentence should be revised to read : " All information provided shall be treated as confidential but may be disclosed at a country 's discretion within the framework of special procedures . "  
To meet growing information needs in a changing political environment with limited resources , the implementation of the programme requires the closest cooperation with substantive departments , other offices of the Secretariat and the specialized agencies , programmes and funds of the United Nations system for the development of coordinated mechanisms to feed and link database and other records .  
Giving a high priority to eradicating the most extreme forms of poverty by trying to reach the poorest of the poor raises not only practical questions of how it can be done in practice with limited resources , material and administrative but also difficult questions of social justice . 
The regional integration process reveals the simultaneous rise of unidimensional or limited integration agreements , the aim of which is to free markets for goods , services and factors of production ( with the exception of the work force ) , and multidimensional or broad integration agreements , which have already reached the stage of customs unions and which aim at common markets and economic unions and at coordinated , harmonized and even joint policies .  
The low national saving levels characteristic of the region 's economies , and the limited volume of investment resulting from such savings , will only allow them to grow at moderate rates ; therefore , unless savings and capital formation increase significantly , an accelerated economic growth rate can not be achieved .  
The Acting Director noted that this limited the Institute 's ability to provide the other main committees of the General Assembly with substantive contributions and conclusions derived from its research in crucial areas of economic and social development , such as water , environment and sustainable development , waste management , renewable sources of energy , human settlements , alleviation of poverty , desertification , international migration , and violence against women migrant workers .  
The volume and quality of the work the Institute has been able to perform is noteworthy , taking into consideration the reduced number of professional staff available , the numerous vacancies at the management level , and the limited financial resources at its disposal .  
In paragraph 3 of its resolution 900 ( 1994 ) of 4 March 1994 , the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to appoint , for a limited period , a senior civilian official who would draw up an overall assessment and plan of action for the restoration of essential public services in the various opstinas of Sarajevo , other than the city of Pale , and who would assist the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , in close coordination with all relevant local authorities , in the implementation of the plan .  
The growth of lending was now inhibited by a limited profitability of investment ; the reluctance of banks to take long-term commitments because of risks imposed by uncertainty over future political and economic conditions ; the inability to obtain clear titles to real estate needed for collateral ; and lack of use of chattel mortgages by banks in financing vehicles and equipment .  
This degree of importance becomes even more obvious as one realizes that water is a natural resource which is scarce and limited and whose quality has repercussions in the ecosystems of which it is the core , thus capable of harming the living conditions of both present and future generations .  
The traditional approach to funding ECE / FAO work on temperate and boreal forest resource assessment has been a cooperative approach in which member countries and certain organizations have provided major contributions , mostly in kind , and a very small secretariat team has played a coordinating and assembling role with a limited amount of analytical and validation work ; this is a natural and justified approach in a region where most counties have rather well-developed forest inventory capacity .  
While they have evolved a holistic , traditional scientific knowledge of their land , natural resources and environment , their ability to practise sustainable development of their lands has been limited by economic , social and historical factors .  
The pool of non-retirees , particularly for specific language combinations and / or functions , is limited for two reasons : first , the Organization must ensure that the freelancers it recruits meet the same high standards required of established language staff ; and , second , the United Nations must compete on the freelance market with other organizations both within and outside the common system who in some cases can be more stable or financially advantageous sources of employment .  
As indicated in the March report , further vacancies are expected to be realized through full use of attrition in 1996-1997 ; strict enforcement of retirement age ; freeze in recruitment , subject to limited exceptions ; introduction of a programme for lateral redeployment of staff ; and , should these measures prove insufficient , the involuntary separation of staff .  
Although a return to acute humanitarian crisis has been averted , political instability and the ensuing insecurity have prevented the country as a whole from moving into a straightforward reconstruction mode and , under current conditions , possibilities for medium - or long-term economic and social development are limited .  
The need for close coordination and collaboration among humanitarian partners in Somalia has intensified over the past year in view of continued insecurity and instability , the absence of effective national counterparts , limited donor resources and the precarious humanitarian situation .  
The limited information obtained from national sources shows that a number of small island developing States have begun to implement parts of the Programme of Action that have especially high priority at the national level , including institution-building , particularly the strengthening of legislative frameworks ; waste management ; coastal area management ; and to a lesser extent , the preservation of biodiversity .  
The competent authorities shall secure , on fair conditions and upon the request of the Registrar or on his behalf , the public services needed by the Tribunal such as , but not limited to , postal , telephone and telegraphic services , electricity , water , gas , sewage , collection of waste , fire protection , local transportation and cleaning of public streets .  
In general , the urban renewal strategy has developed from solid and concentrated work in limited areas to more widespread work in which publicly subsidized urban renewal is used as a catalyst and locomotive and in which the affected owners and tenants are given a major say in the result .  
I would request you to intervene with Kuwait in order to bring an end to such hostile acts , which are in contravention of the Charter of the United Nations and international law , constitute unjustified provocation and have damaged the lights affixed by Iraq to the buoys in the Khawr al-Khafqa canal leading to the oil terminals .  There are a limited number of these lights , and because of the sanctions regime they can not be replaced if lost .  
The problems associated with formidable structural adjustment difficulties and economic reforms , declining flow of already low level of development resources , extremely low export capacity , compounded by limited market access , crushing debt burden , low level of human development , environmental degradation etc . , continue to impede seriously the development efforts of the least developed countries .  
The information received recently by the Special Rapporteur hardly suggests any improvement in the treatment of detainees in prisons and detention centres , which he described in earlier reports .  11 / Those reports give an account of the overcrowding , terrible sanitary conditions , inadequate and substandard food , limited medical care , beatings , restrictions on family visits , the problems of having common criminals share living quarters with political prisoners , and the jailing of many political prisoners far from their home towns , which makes contact with their families extremely difficult .  
Although it had been said that global economic growth was the result of the globalization of the economy , the international community should be fully aware that that process was limited largely to interaction among the private sectors of those countries , and that their sole objective was to make profits .  
While the authorities have made efforts to ensure that cases of illegally occupied houses are solved , and many of the cases have been dealt with fairly and justly , there still remains a significant amount of unresolved cases where the local authorities have been unable to prevent de facto ethnic discrimination , owing to intimidation , limited capacity of the judiciary , pressure exercised on judges , and in some cases because decisions of eviction have not been enforced by the local police .  
In response it was observed that , while the spirit of article 12 required expeditious consideration by the court of the enacting State of the application for recognition of the foreign proceedings , the question raised was not suitable for being addressed within the limited scope of the Model Provisions and should be left for the laws of the enacting State .  
However , it was pointed out that the scope of the draft Model Provisions was limited to matters of judicial relief and cooperation and that the issues to which article 14 pertained could not be adequately dealt with in the Model Provisions , without addressing a number of other substantive issues which were not covered in the current text ( such as set-offs and actions to reverse or render unenforceable legal acts detrimental to all creditors , see above para .  134 ) .  
The limited mass , volume , stability and optics of microsatellites could not compete with traditional large-scale missions such as the Land Remote Sensing Satellite ( LANDSAT ) , Satellite pour l'observation de la Terre ( SPOT ) and the European remote sensing satellite ( ERS ) ; however , for medium resolution and meteorological-scale imaging , the KITSAT and POSAT satellites had demonstrated a comparable facility but at a tiny fraction of the cost .  
Subject to those qualifications , his delegation supported the gist of the draft articles , in particular the dual criteria of " systematic " and " large - scale " for the crimes covered by articles 18 and 20 , the two separate jurisdictional regimes established in article 8 , and an exclusive regime for the crime of aggression ( article 16 ) subject to a limited exception of the national jurisdiction of a State committing aggression against its nationals .  
LDCs also suffer from an extremely limited internal savings capacity and underdeveloped financial markets , geographical disadvantages ( as in the case of many land-locked and small island LDCs ) , inadequate infrastructure , poor communications and low education levels which are reflected , inter alia , in weak managerial and administrative capacity and in a severe shortage of skilled and trained manpower .  
It is a matter first and foremost of the lives and well-being of millions of innocent people who depend on this carrier to avert the dangers of deadly and lethal diseases in a country that is classified as among the least developed countries whose limited possibilities and scarce resources , as mentioned , are well known to you .  Accept , Sir , the assurances of my highest consideration .  
Given the importance of this anticipated report , the current budget proposals are limited to provision for real resources for 1997 kept at the 1996 level , augmented by unavoidable items arising from exigencies of the ongoing work of the Tribunal .  
Given the importance of this anticipated report , the current budget proposals are limited to provision for real resources for 1997 kept at 1996 level , augmented by unavoidable items arising from exigencies of the ongoing work of the Tribunal .  
The Committee approved , on the basis of suggestions from the States concerned , a strictly limited number of road and rail border crossing points , which henceforth represented the exclusive transit points for passage of freight and rolling stock into and out of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( press releases SC / 5615 and SC / 5646 ) , monitored by national authorities in cooperation with the SAMs .  
The Committee advised applicant States wishing to undertake energy-related exports to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for humanitarian purposes , that it was not in a position to approve the supply of energy-related products to the country for general distribution ; however , without prejudice to its final decision , the Committee expressed readiness to consider requests for authorization of shipments of strictly limited quantities of fuel targeting specific end-users among the most vulnerable groups of civilian population and for purely humanitarian purposes .  
Planning to meet requirements and the design and erection of decent and socially acceptable lodgings represents an extremely complex and expensive task inasmuch as , to cope with the problem of refugees arriving in unpredictable numbers , with major peaks , account has to be taken of economic possibilities and of the limited land areas and premises available , while also avoiding conflicts with the population and among the refugees themselves and taking into consideration local political interests .  
The principles elaborated in the above-mentioned administrative instruction on non-reimbursable loans for technical cooperation projects ( ST / AI / 231 / Rev . 1 ) , particularly in terms of an agreement or understanding between the United Nations and the donor and the issuance of a special service agreement with the individual , have been applied only in a limited number of cases .  
The question is limited to a small number of individual and isolated cases in which the offenders are held accountable and punished , in case the investigation and the judicial verdict prove it , in the light of the State 's desire to ensure the enforcement of the law while showing no indulgence towards offenders of the crime of torture , as reflected in the detailed replies of the Egyptian authorities to the Committee .  
The limited organizational capacity of many local transport providers - particularly undersized freight forwarders , who with proper assistance might develop into efficient multimodal transport operators - is leaving many countries too dependent on foreign transport providers . 
" Noting also that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
The Commission 's new approach to the problem of deciding before which organ and on what legal basis a State could be accused of an international crime seemed reasonable , but the trouble with the choice of the Security Council and the General Assembly as the organs responsible for characterization of an international crime was that , as in the past , they might take a complaisant attitude towards extremely serious wrongful acts , and moreover their competence was limited by the Charter . 
Concerned about the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine-detection and mine-clearance equipment as well as the lack of global coordination in research and development to improve the relevant technology , and conscious of the need to promote progress in this field and to foster international technical cooperation to this end ,  
In addition , the Secretary-General considers that , in developing criteria for accelerated promotion called for in recommendation 1 ( h ) and paragraph 78 of the JIU report , demonstrated mobility should be among the main criteria , bearing in mind , of course , those categories or occupational groups of staff which are not expected to be mobile ( e.g . staff in the General Service and related categories ) , or for whom mobility opportunities are limited .  
Additional work and project changes were requested by ECA , which included but were not limited to electrical , mechanical and special systems requirements , namely , uninterrupted power supply , building automated control and anti-intrusion security ;  
Finally , a rising incidence of occasional or " weekend prostitution " by young housewives or students wanting to improve their standard of living by prostituting themselves on weekends or for a limited period of time , as a direct result of the economic crisis and unemployment , is becoming apparent .  
The Commission had rightly understood that its mandate was not limited to the mere compilation of existing law and had therefore undertaken an ongoing process of innovation , renewal and modernization of prevailing norms within the framework of the progressive development of international law .  
Invites the executive heads of the organizations of the common system to develop and submit proposals , as a matter of priority , to their relevant intergovernmental bodies on the possibility of introducing performance awards or bonuses to a limited number of staff in recognition of their outstanding performance and specific achievements in a given year , and to coordinate , to the extent possible , these proposals with those developed by the Secretary-General ;

Direct negotiations are sometimes allowed under exceptional circumstances , such as when for special reasons competitive methods would not lead to satisfactory results , or in the case of projects with an anticipated initial investment value not exceeding a certain amount or of a limited duration .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; these countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
In the context of the discussion of article 14 , a proposal was made to include a new paragraph in article 14 providing that recognition of a foreign proceeding should be granted only to such limited effects as were consistent with the purposes of ensuring coordination of proceedings under the provisions ( yet to be formulated ) on coordination between a pending main proceeding in the enacting State and a subsequent application for recognition of a foreign main or non-main proceeding .  
It was pointed out that in some jurisdictions the relief that could be granted by the court before the opening of insolvency proceedings or before recognition of a foreign proceeding was limited to relief measures of an individual nature provided under national rules on civil procedure ( i.e . measures covering specific assets identified by a creditor ) and did not extend to special relief measures available under special rules concerning collective insolvency proceedings .  
It was proposed that , within the context of article 15 ( 1 ) , the powers of the foreign representative or other person designated by the court should be limited to measures destined to preserve three categories of assets : perishable assets , assets susceptible of devaluation and assets otherwise in jeopardy , such as where there was an imminent danger of their being concealed or dissipated .  
In order to achieve those benefits , it was justified to impose on the insolvent debtor the possibly harsher consequences of insolvency proceedings in the country where it maintained a limited business presence , even if the country where the centre of the debtors main interests was situated posed less stringent conditions for the opening of insolvency proceedings .  
Barbados shares the anxiety of small developing States , which are highly vulnerable to marginalization in this fiercely competitive environment given our sparse natural and human-resource base and limited administrative and technical capacity .  
Countries with limited mineral resources , like Armenia , will continue to view the International Atomic Energy Agency as the central medium for the safeguarded transfer of nuclear technology , operational expertise , and technical assistance to countries which explicitly adhere to international non-proliferation objectives and comply with the existing regulations .  
Since countries each have different relative strengths and all have limited financial means , considerable benefit can be realized from sharing international efforts to develop resource and environmental accounting concepts and methods .  
While the Tribunal conducts an exhumation at an alleged grave site only to obtain evidence in support of indictments , which might often be limited to a certain number of mortal remains , the expert aims at the total exhumation of a given site for the sole and purely humanitarian purpose of identifying as many missing persons as possible .  
Weak technological infrastructures , a severe shortage of qualified human resources and limited financial means explain in part the persistent nature of the problem confronting many developing countries .  
However , the recognition by Governments and non-governmental organizations of the impact of ageing on development appears to be limited by such areas of inquiries as the potential costs of an ageing population , as measured by future costs of caring for frail older persons , future costs of pensions and the changing age structure of the workforce .  
Small island developing States possess unique characteristics , including fragile ecosystems , small land area and limited natural resources , which make them significantly more vulnerable to environmental degradation and human health problems resulting from inadequate management of wastes .  
Particular problems persisted for Turkey 's rural women in eastern and southeastern Anatolia , who continued to live in traditional social frameworks and were affected by an ongoing armed conflict and whose access to opportunities and services remained severely limited .  
Principal bottlenecks in making productive use of this progress involve harmonized access and adequate , explicit quality control of available information , and limited access in developing countries , in particular the least developed countries .  
Concerned about the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine-detection and mine-clearance equipment as well as the lack of global coordination in research and development to improve the relevant technology , and conscious of the need to promote progress in this field and to foster international technical cooperation to this end ,  
A view was expressed that , as an alternative to the enumeration of the grounds on which recognition might be refused , the Model Provisions could contain a definition of the effects limited to coordination and cooperation , to be granted to the recognized foreign proceeding when a local proceeding is already pending in the enacting State .  
Noting also that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
Intergovernmental dialogue on sustainable development could usefully be reorganized to consider a limited number of strategic priority issues , so as to develop a more focused approach to relevant activities in the United Nations system both at the international and at the regional and country levels .  
The view was expressed that in view of the special characteristics of the geostationary orbit , there was a need to establish a sui generis legal regime for regulating access to and use of that orbit , which was a limited natural resource , and that such a regime should guarantee actual and future equitable access to the geostationary orbit for all States , taking into particular account the needs of developing countries , including the equatorial countries , because of their special geographical characteristics .  
The limited human , technical and material national resources have been concentrated on sweeping areas where mines and remnants of war are known to be present , and where their location has been established by citizens ' reports on the accidents they have caused or by companies carrying out development projects .  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
Serve as a mobilizer of ideas and a catalyst for action to identify and promote new policy options at the national , subregional and regional levels for the removal of constraints on the economic and social development efforts of these countries , with emphasis on the adoption of measures for increased mobilization of domestic and foreign resources , trade and private sector development , public sector reform , and provision of economic advice , on request , to Governments with limited internal capacity .  
When the Human Rights Committee considered France 's report in 1983 , an extremely instructive debate took place on the validity of the reservations made by France to article 4 ( 1 ) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . 35 The expert from the German Democratic Republic asserted that France had confirmed that reservations to article 4 were permissible , in response to which the representative of France said that the reservations were limited to paragraph 1 of that article . 
The most valuable lesson that can be drawn from the practice of the international monitoring bodies and from the Special Rapporteur 's own experience is the certainty that , to the extent that the norms and principles governing the state of emergency are respected , its impact on the functioning of the institutions , the validity of the rule of law and the enjoyment of human rights will necessarily be limited and compatible with a democratic system of government .  
In order to avoid military courts , in those countries where they have not yet been abolished , helping to perpetuate impunity by virtue of a lack of independence resulting from the chain of command to which all or some of their members are subject , their jurisdiction must be limited solely to specifically military offences committed by military personnel , excluding human rights violations constituting serious crimes under international law , which come under the jurisdiction of the ordinary domestic courts or , where necessary , an international court .  
While contemporary terrorism does seem a particularly novel and dangerous threat , for it possesses attributes which set it apart from its historical forebears and make it more effective as a result of the confluence of new political circumstances and modern technological advances , it still remains an imitative mode of behaviour with a limited tactical repertoire 9 / and deplorable , as ever , effects on human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
Recognizing the widespread nature of the practice of forced evictions and that when forced evictions are carried out they can occur in a variety of contexts including but not limited to conflicts over land rights , development and infrastructure projects , such as the construction of dams or other large _ scale energy projects , land acquisition measures associated with urban renewal , housing renovation , city beautification programmes , the clearing of land for agricultural purposes or macro-urban projects , unbridled speculation in land , and the holding of major international events such as the Olympic Games ,  
Thus the topic will be limited only to codification of secondary rules on the subject : while addressing the requirement of a violation of an international obligation of the State as a prerequisite , it will not address the specific content of those international legal obligations , whether under customary or treaty law .  
He confirmed that the UNCTAD initiative on trade was not limited to the new round of negotiations in services but that the Secretary-General of UNCTAD , in close cooperation with the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa , had planned joint activities for the preparation of the second WTO Ministerial Conference to be held in 1998 , including on issues related to trade and investment policy , trade and competition policy , transparency in government procurement and cooperation in organizing an Africa-wide conference preparatory to the Ministerial Conference .  
The main lesson that we should draw from the limited success of past efforts in this regard is that the legal , political and practical complexity of the issues involved makes it impossible to apply ready-made , generalized solutions .

There is also concern that the recent emphasis in financial and economic policies has not always been development-oriented , that the dominance of a limited set of macroeconomic targets and parameters over the social , political , cultural and environmental domains has gone too far , and that social and economic policies and objectives must be fully integrated .  
The scope of the Conference should therefore not be limited to criminal breaches of existing arms legislation and export / import controls but consideration should be given to all relevant factors leading to the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of small arms and light weapons in the context of the illicit arms trade , including those referred to in the report of the Panel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms .  
The five basic commonly cited obstacles the global economic situation ; limited financial resources ; the lack of trained personnel ; insufficient inter-institutional coordination ; and the paucity of basic data and comparative research may be described as follows :  
It emphasized that , without a sustained and decisive reduction in their external debt and debt service obligations , the growth prospects of the least developed countries and their ability to attract foreign direct investment would remain limited .  
Although the review made many positive comments about the quality of evaluation work at the central level , particularly its low cost and high output relative to its limited staff , the review was nonetheless critical of UNHCRs commitment to the function .  
For both privatization and project finance , the most attractive areas are those for which : ( a ) access can be limited ( as in airports , tunnels , bridges and major highways ) ; ( b ) the projected volume of traffic is high ( container ports , freight rail , primary roads ) ; ( c ) the generation of cash is expected to be reliable , and ( d ) foreign exchange earnings are possible . 30 Attractive assets are ones in which there is a scope for monopolistic power . 
Advancing international understanding through programmes which call for broad application of the universal language of arts and humanities , the social behavioural , and physical sciences , and related disciplines , including but not limited to comparative studies and consultations on related public policy issues ;  
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) and geographical constraints , such as being landlocked and lacking good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .  
Africas heavy dependence on primary commodity exports ( accounting for about 80 per cent of total export earnings ) is evidence of the low level of human resource development and limited technological capability to take advantage of emerging trade and investment opportunities .  
Non-physical barriers , notably inefficient and limited choice of transport organizations , poor utilization of assets , government controls and cumbersome transit procedures , contributed to high unit costs of transport and insurance and long transit times .  He noted that the specific needs and problems of landlocked developing countries varied from one region to another .  
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) , and geographical constraints and lack of good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .  
The only solution to this dilemma , therefore , is to further develop the existing United Nations system in such a way that in the future it is able to intervene in good time in cases of very grave human rights violations , but not until all means of settling conflicts peacefully have been exhausted and this is a crucial point within a strictly limited legal and controlled framework .  
However , some preliminary results seem to show that aid alone can play only a limited role with respect to the three categories of possible effects of sanctions on third States , i.e . economic , trade and financial effects ; social and humanitarian effects ; and secondary effects as indicated in the report of the ad hoc expert group meeting . 
Even though the primary responsibility of maintaining security and the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and areas always lies with the host State , the international community is duty bound to assist governments in this task and , above all , to bear the bulk of the costs to African States whose financial and logistic capacities are limited .  
Questions have arisen as to whether such exclusive arrangements with limited membership have been truly effective in achieving their stated purpose of strengthening the international non-proliferation regime , especially with regard to scientific and technological applications connected with advanced weapons as well as weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery .  
Contrary to the limited internal resources available in the past for pre-reproduction work and heavy-duty binding , a large reproduction capacity has long been available to meet the demand for regular documents prepared for intergovernmental bodies i.e . , technically simple materials that must be produced within strict and short deadlines and in print runs of a few thousand copies .  
Accordingly , it is recommended that proposal C-3 be pursued in order to ensure a realistic and cost-effective use of limited resources , achieve a balanced linguistic diversity on the United Nations Web site and establish a sound foundation for its future expansion .  47 .  The attention of the Committee is also drawn to the report of ACABQ on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001 ( see A / 54 / 7 , para .  
Urgent measures were required , therefore , to remedy that situation through , inter alia , the provision of the technical , human and financial resources commensurate with the tasks and responsibilities of the Office of the Special Coordinator , which , even with extremely limited human and financial resources , had accomplished many commendable tasks . 
There was a need to ensure that there was strong and broadly shared government ownership of the programme , that the consultative nature built into the design of the preparatory process was protected , and that the burden on Governments , in terms of both limited resources and limited time , was minimized .  
Noting that the territorial Government continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
Furthermore , bearing in mind both the emphasis placed in Council resolution 1996 / 31 on encouraging geographical diversity among NGOs and the large number of organizations with limited access to technology , the Section has devoted considerable effort to the production of informative written material and training workshops .  
It had enacted a law on the sustainable use of Fijis limited renewable and non-renewable land and sea resources and readjusted its sectoral policies with a view to ensuring sustained natural resource utilization ; the development of human-resource-based industries ; the improvement of social services in the fields of health , education and housing ; poverty alleviation ; rural and urban development ; and disaster management .  
Funds means assets of every kind , whether tangible or intangible , movable or immovable , however acquired , and legal documents or instruments in any form , including electronic or digital , evidencing title to , or interest in , such assets , including , but not limited to , bank credits , travellers cheques , bank cheques , money orders , shares , securities , bonds , drafts , letters of credit .  
The vast , cheap labour pools of developing countries were being exploited , commodity prices were being manipulated in order to ensure a continued supply of cheap raw materials and the markets of developing countries were being pried open in the name of trade liberalization while the developed countries limited access to their own markets through various stratagems .  
The developing countries , for their part , were dependent on limited overseas markets and exports and were at the mercy of the international financial institutions ; they suffered the negative consequences of globalization but had virtually no role in defining the rules of the game , and their repeated calls for democratic governance of the global economy had fallen on deaf ears .  
Mr . Leiro ( Norway ) said that the assumption that globalization benefited everyone had yet to be proven ; the gap between rich and poor was growing both within and between nations and many poor countries attracted minimal foreign investment , lacked a dynamic private sector and were often deprived of the benefits of increased export earnings by heavy debt burdens and limited market access . 
For many commodities exported by developing countries , there has also been substantial substitution by synthetic materials over the past two decades , while a shift away from traditional &amp; lt ; heavy = industries , such as iron and steel , has also limited the rate of expansion in demand for natural raw materials .  
The current initiative , however , had alleviated only a small part of the debt of a limited number of countries and she therefore welcomed the progress achieved at the recent annual meeting of the World Bank and IMF to achieve dramatic cuts in the debt burden of the heavily indebted developing countries , linking those cuts to poverty reduction strategies . 
Considering that the Caribbean Sea area includes a large number of States , countries and territories , most of which are developing countries and small island developing States which are ecologically fragile and economically vulnerable and also affected by , inter alia , their limited capacity , narrow resource base , need for financial resources , social problems , high levels of poverty and the challenges and opportunities of globalization ,  
Considering that the Caribbean Sea area includes a large number of States , countries and territories , most of which are developing countries and small island developing States which are ecologically fragile and economically vulnerable and also affected by , inter alia , their limited capacity , narrow resource base , need for financial resources , social problems , high levels of poverty and the challenges and opportunities of globalization ,  
Public official shall be understood by reference to the definition of public official in the domestic law of the State in which the person in question performs that function and as applied in its criminal law and shall include , but not be limited to , any judicial official , juror or lay judge , police official , border control or customs official , investigator , prosecutor or other official with law enforcement responsibilities in the State concerned .  
Funds means assets of every kind , whether tangible or intangible , movable or immovable , however acquired , and legal documents or instruments in any form , including electronic or digital , evidencing title to , or interest in , such assets , including , but not limited to , bank credits , travellers cheques , bank cheques , money orders , shares , securities , bonds , drafts , letters of credit .  
Concerned about the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine-detection and mine-clearance equipment as well as the need for effective global coordination in research and development to improve the relevant technology , and conscious of the need to promote further and more rapid progress in this field and to foster international technical cooperation to this end ,  
For instance , there may be concomitantly higher levels of street and ( low visibility ) intra-familial violence , large proportions of the population that are severely disadvantaged and young ( that is , in the age groups perpetrating and suffering crime ) , rapid migration into urban areas , lack of trust in law enforcement , inefficient justice systems , corruption , limited good governance and severe competition for scarce resources .  
The Nordic countries and Poland , in their responses , agreed that there was a need to address any lack of protection of persons in situations of internal violence , which fell outside the scope of common article 3 of the four Geneva Conventions and of Additional Protocol II thereto , and when effective implementation of human rights might be limited by derogations in exceptional circumstances .  
According to Turkey , the content of fundamental standards of humanity should be limited to international human rights law and not include international humanitarian law , as they concerned situations of internal violence which did not reach the threshold of an armed conflict .  
It was interesting to note that it had been suggested that when other authorities could commit the State unilaterally at the international level , that capacity should be limited to circumstances in which the persons concerned were given an official mandate to conduct foreign policy in their field of competence and where their counterparts , to whom the unilateral declaration was addressed , were fully cognizant of that fact .  
Noting further that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territorys deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
To this end , we envisage measures to benefit all sectors of the older population , taking care to ensure that needs are met for those living in the countryside and in outlying urban areas , older women , disabled older persons and all groups of older persons who because of their race , culture , religion , economic situation or political ideas might have limited access to all kinds of services and comprehensive care .  
For the developing and least developed countries , the continuous fall of official development assistance , piling up of external debt , decline in their ability to get access to the global market for their limited exports , plus new conditionalities on export opportunities have aggravated their multifaceted constraints .  
As regards the issue of humanitarian intervention and limited sovereignty , we associate ourselves with the majority of Member States , especially States of the South , that referred to the contravention by such ideas of international law , the Charter and the principal guidelines in contemporary law such as sovereignty , political independence and territorial integrity , as well as non-interference in the internal affairs of others .  
Regardless of its considerable benefits , nuclear energy is still problematic in one particular aspect : spent fuel and nuclear waste , its interim storage and final repository , especially in small States with limited industrial and scientific capabilities .  
In any case , we do not believe that the deployment of a limited national missile defence system would change the basic strategic calculus underlying the ABM Treaty or be incompatible with its central purpose , which is to maintain strategic stability and enable further reductions in strategic offensive arms .  
As a result of such an agreement , the use of the natural resources of celestial bodies and outer space , which might relieve some of the immense pressures now facing mankind due to the limited resources of the Earth , could take place in a predominantly peaceful environment , in an orderly fashion , in accordance with international law , on the basis of international cooperation and mutual understanding and in accordance with previously agreed procedures . 
The significant internal and outward migration for economic reasons of young men particularly to the United States and young women particularly to Europe , especially Spain in recent times ; high rates of maternal mortality ; and the undoubtedly limited sexual and reproductive rights and the rights of women call for specific measures .  
The impact of this policy would have been all the greater on reproductive health and family-planning questions if the adequate financial means had been available to complement the limited capacities of my country , which has been shaken by an unprecedented financial crisis and the political transition difficulties of establishing stable democratic institutions .  
The United Nations Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , held in Barbados in 1994 , was aware of the enormous challenges facing these States when it adopted the Programme of Action , now considered the starting point for the sustainable development of small island developing States , whose ability to protect themselves against natural disasters is indeed limited .  
The need for universal commitment to such preventive measures has become more pressing due to the isolation and oceanic location of some small island developing States and their total dependence on a marine and limited terrestrial base , which render them highly vulnerable to contamination from such waste .  
The Working Group noted with concern violations of the civil and economic rights of migrant women workers , including foreign contract workers , who were subjected to ill-treatment , limited personal freedom and inadequate or no payment for their work , without the possibility of recourse to the legal system of the receiving country for justice .  
Developing the capacity to export is particularly crucial in light of the fast expansion of international trade and the limited size of the domestic market of many developing countries .  
Moreover , in the light of the federal structure of Canada and the extensive provincial jurisdiction , the absence of any expert particularly representing the largest provinces , other than Quebec , significantly limited the potential depth of the dialogue on key issues .  
Given this connectivity and owing to limited resources of national and other statistical offices for maintaining , updating and revising their standard classifications , agreement must be reached on the timing of further revisions of such linked international standards as the ones mentioned above so that all may change together in a more harmonious and minimally disruptive fashion .  
Furthermore , it has been alleged that trials being conducted for genocidal crimes in which the death penalty is the primary punishment continue to deny the accused rights ensured and protected by international law.This includes , but is not limited to , the right to legal representation , the right to appeal , and other safeguards such as the presumption of innocence and an independent judicial tribunal . 
It was difficult to believe that while Governments and international organizations were spending vast sums of money on bilateral and international law reform programmes , the training and legislative technical assistance programme of the United Nations body dealing specifically with international trade law was being funded from limited extrabudgetary resources in the form of special contributions by a very few Governments .  
While obviously limited in payload mass , volume and power , but with very real and attractive advantages in terms of cost and response time , microsatellites complemented traditional large satellites by providing an alternative gap-filler for affordable quick-response or exploratory missions with both civil and military objectives .  
The human rights situation left much to be desired in Belarus , especially with respect to freedom of expression : freedom of the press was limited , peaceful demonstrators and journalists had been arrested and beaten , and new media legislation violated international standards .  
Indeed , accelerated economic growth is also of paramount importance if Africa is to reverse its increasing marginalization as reflected by quantitative indicators , particularly its small share of world trade , the limited inflows of foreign direct investment , its heavy debt burden , the relatively low utilization of communication technology , the falling standard of education , the deteriorating health services and the declining food self-sufficiency ratio .  
The Bah International Community , with over five-million members from all strata of society organized as approximately 17 , 000 local communities and 175 national and regional communities , is committed to peace and engaged in a wide range of activities.These activities include but are not limited to fostering grass-roots participation in sustainable development initiatives , advancing the status of women , eliminating racism , and promoting and protecting human rights . 
ICAM is often seen as an environmental rather than a sustainable development programme ; thus , it has often received limited funding from national budgets ; further , many small island developing States do not have the environmental tools ( for example , indicators for integrating environmental considerations with economic development ) for decision-making , which would allow Governments to estimate the true cost of environmental degradation ;  
Building adequate manpower with the requisite level of skill for effective integrated island management ; small island developing States should assess their training needs and develop a training programme , involving the private sector , non-governmental organizations and Governments ; training should not be limited to technical experts ; it should include local communities , for example , fishermen , tourist hotel operators , managers of industries located in coastal regions and farmers ;  
The unique social , economic and environmental characteristics of small island developing States , such as high population density , relative isolation , limited availability of land space , and paucity of human and financial resources , limit the range of possible options for the sound management of waste .  
In several small island developing States that have established or upgraded institutions charged with resource conservation and environmental protection , inadequate national budgets have seriously limited the scope of their operations ; even in situations where local expertise exists for dealing with environmental protection and resource management problems , shortages of funds hinder adequate action .  
Even where humanitarian objectives were not part of their primary mandates , peacekeeping operations have proved valuable , often vital , in supporting and protecting needy populations , humanitarian workers and supplies in environments where there was limited consent from the warring parties or when the security situation is simply beyond their control .  
On the draft resolution on an international agreement to ban anti-personnel landmines , contained in document A C . 1-51 L . 46 , during the current session of the First Committee , and over the last few years , views have been expressed by many , including those who have actively supported a ban on anti-personnel landmines , regarding the need for continuing the use of such weapons on a limited or restricted basis .  
The fragile ecosystems of small island States and their generally more limited scope for pursuing alternative development strategies make concerns for the environmental impact of tourism very acute , particularly because the sector , which is almost totally dependent on the natural environment , is viewed by many small island developing States as a fast route to social and economic development .  
Egypt regrets that all the efforts made to expand the scope of the United Nations Register have not yet yielded the required results since the Register remains limited to the annual notification of transfers of seven categories of conventional arms and continues to disregard other sophisticated and lethal types of conventional arms as well as weapons of mass destruction and advanced technologies with military applications .  
But the socio-political burdens , the persistence of an apartheid culture which can not be transformed quickly , limited financial resources and still inadequate human resources constitute a considerable hindrance , not to mention the need to take account of the time factor , with South Africans impatient to taste the fruits of freedom even though the quiet revolution under way dates back only to 1994 . 
Participation in international and regional arrangements allows them to pursue mutually complementary objectives in a holistic manner and to benefit from the synergy generated , but it also burdens them with a multitude of obligations which further stretch their limited resources , both human and financial .  
In view of their narrow natural resource base , their proneness to disruption by natural disasters , their small range of primary product exports and their limited local capital for productive investment , small island developing States need to join forces for their development , so that communication and exchange of information becomes vital .  
ICSUs formal participation in the meetings and other activities of the Council is necessarily limited by its financial resources and the availability of suitable representatives , but the individual involvement of members of the scientific community globally and their expert contribution to the many issues addressed by the Council and its subsidiary bodies is substantial .  
Having recognized that limited access to credit by SMEs is a major constraint on production and growth , many Governments directed public funds to SMEs through specialized financial institutions , such as agricultural and industrial development banks .  
Despite the considerable impact of unilateral acts of States on the development of customary international law , State practice was not uniform , and it provided only a limited number of cases in which a unilateral act had been recognized as binding .  
An eventual convention on fissile material should be a concrete step forward in the nuclear disarmament process and should not be limited to being just another instrument of selective nonproliferation .  
During the initial phase , given the limited resources available , a range of measures is planned to halt the decline in the standard of living and the level of social protection of the population .  
In such areas waste is visible , and downstream effects include contamination of limited groundwater lenses in highly populated and industrial areas and unhealthy inshore waters .  
The ability of the Tribunal to recruit additional translators is limited by the scarcity of professional translators who are not only versed in legal vocabulary , but also familiar with the terminology of , inter alia , ballistic , forensic and military reports .  
As a postconflict country , Liberia is still a fragile political setting , with limited internal resources , growing poverty , and dwindling external assistance , which constitute important factors militating against smooth transition .  
In the light of low and unstable export earnings , limited access to private financial flows , small domestic savings and the serious debt problems experienced by these countries , ODA remains a critical source of their development finance .  
Although responses differed widely , countries which were already faced with pressing issues due to poverty and limited access to modern technology would undergo additional pressures on social and economic systems as their populations aged .  
Under international law capital punishment shall not be applied to juvenile offenders , expectant or recent mothers , and those suffering from mental handicap or extremely limited mental capacity .  
Given the limited size of the domestic market and the unstable conditions of the international market , the major difficulty faced by Viet Nams agricultural sector is to find markets for its increased production .  
A major reason for the limited growth of agricultural trade has been protection : bound tariffs on agricultural products are , on average , at the same level as bound tariffs on industrial products 50 years ago .  
But over and above traditional legal aid , which is generally limited to criminal matters , the expert emphasized the need to help rural people to use common law as an instrument to improve their rights situation .  
Three sets of factors can be proffered : the low savings base ( subsistence income levels ) ; weak institutional base for intermediation ( thin , fragile , fragmented financial system with limited financial instruments ) ; and decapitalization . 
It was worrying that the international financial community had so far not attached much importance to the development crisis in Africa since its impact at the global level was considered to be limited .  
The Committee is further concerned at the limited access of children with disabilities to formal or vocational educational opportunities and at the proportionally low number of girls attending primary or secondary school .  
There is very limited scope , in the foreseeable future , to meet these multiple development finance requirements with domestic resources because of sluggish growth or economic stagnation , widespread poverty and a weak domestic corporate sector .  
Even for the larger developing countries , ODA continues to have major qualitative significance ; due to their low economic development and limited domestic resources , ODA is still irreplaceable for them .  
The internal barriers to SME adoption of ecommerce include limited understanding of the complexity of electronic operations , inadequate skills and high initial investment required to develop a viable ecommerce strategy .  
Some delegations reiterated the view that the geostationary orbit was a limited natural resource with sui generis characteristics that risked saturation , and that its utilization should be based on the principle of rational and equitable access for all countries , taking into account the special needs of developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
The Committee learned that greater utilization of the two conference centres continued to be constrained by uncertainty about the appropriate use of the facilities , particularly as venues for private sector and commercial events ; limited opportunities for rerouting meetings from the calendar of conferences ; inadequate staffing structures for management of the centres ; lack of funds for marketing and promotional activities ; and regional instability .  
A report on the Plan of Action had analysed results in 12 areas , including obstacles faced and lessons learned , among them the unwillingness of certain parents to permit their daughters to have vocational or technical training ; the policy of privatizing of health services , which prevents early detection of disease ; the lack of proper records on violence against women ; strong patriarchal attitudes in society ; and the limited access to financial resources that impedes women from running for elected office .  
However , given the deep concern of the developing countries with regard to their limited capacity to participate in the global economy and consequent marginalization , one of the major challenges in the coming years would be how to ensure that the benefits of the global economy were shared by all .  
The reasons were weak economic governance , lack of response to stabilization measures , weak institutional and physical infrastructure , small domestic markets and limited access to regional and global markets , and also the absence of a critical mass of small - and medium-sized enterprises .  
That was creating a vicious circle in which the right to freedom of expression had only limited relevance for those who were hungry and , likewise , the right of freedom of association for those who were homeless or the most generous provisions of human rights treaties for those who were illiterate or were struggling to meet their basic needs .  
It was worrying that the international financial community had so far not attached much importance to the development crisis in Africa since its impact at the global level was considered to be limited .  
The sporadic manifestations of racist violence which he had just described , although somewhat limited , warranted reaction on the part of the international community since they constituted a strong signal given by racist organizations which thereby wished to proclaim their implacable refusal to accept others .  
We emphasize the importance of more stable and predictable financing for social and economic development and stress the important role that official development assistance can still play , in this respect , for the majority of developing countries , particularly least developed countries and other countries with limited potential for domestic savings or export earnings .  
The Committee is concerned , further , at the low standard of the living conditions in some alternative care institutions , the inadequate monitoring of placements and the limited number of qualified personnel in this field .  
The Committee notes with concern the poor health situation of children in the State party and in particular the limited access to basic health care for children ( especially in rural and mountainous areas ) , high maternal , child and infant mortality rates , low and decreasing immunization levels , high rates of malnutrition , poor sanitation and limited access to safe drinking water , especially in rural communities .  
The Committee welcomes the State partys efforts in the field of education , in particular the inclusion of human rights teaching , including childrens rights , in the school curricula , but it remains concerned about the high drop-out and repetition rates in primary and secondary schools , disparities between urban and rural areas in terms of access to education and to quality education , the insufficient number of well-trained teaching staff and childrens limited access to materials and text books .  
With regard to the use of non-controlled substitute chemicals in the illicit manufacture of drugs , the substances and guidelines included in the limited international special surveillance list established by the Board were a useful tool for Governments , promoting awareness and cooperation with the chemical industry to prevent diversion of those substances .  
However , the fact that only nine responses indicated that their authors used the instrument developed by the Centre renders those responses of limited value for analytical , comparative or statistical purposes , or for the purpose of establishing a consolidated database for coordination of and information on international technical cooperation projects in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice .  
The overall experience reported above by HEUNI and the very limited number of responses received by the Centre for International Crime Prevention to the questionnaire on international technical cooperation in crime prevention and criminal justice suggest that the establishment of a centralized database is of very limited value and utility , in particular when one considers the overall quality and content of the responses .  
Few recipient countries have established effective focal coordination points for technical cooperation and the few that have done so have only been partially successful in moderating the competing interests of various ministries , departments and non-governmental agencies , many of which often compete for the same resources from the same limited pool of international technical assistance donors and providers .  
Urges Governments and regional organizations to make use of the limited international special surveillance list of substances established by the Board , adapted or supplemented , where appropriate , by lists of chemicals subject to voluntary monitoring , to reflect national and regional situations and changing trends in the illicit manufacture of drugs ;  
In 1997 , the General Assembly recommended that the Commissions approved programme of work on sustainable development indicators result in a practicable and agreed set of indicators , suited to country-specific conditions , including a limited number of aggregated indicators .  
The role of the Saudi Government in this matter is limited to providing a safe haven and economic , educational , social and religious services and health care on a fraternal and humanitarian basis .  
However , there is very limited scope , in the foreseeable future , to meet the multiple development finance requirements of LDCs with domestic resources because of sluggish growth or economic stagnation , widespread poverty and a weak domestic corporate sector .  
Recognition of the particular problems faced by small island developing States relating to their remoteness from major markets , modest natural resource and export bases , narrow skills bases , heavy reliance on costly imports , limited access to private capital , and vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental degradation .  
To include all IPF / IFF proposals for action in the plan of action is perhaps neither feasible nor practical considering the short initial time-horizon of UNFF , as well as the limited financial , human , scientific and technical resources available for implementation .  
Strongly condemns physical , sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family , which encompasses , but is not limited to , battering , sexual abuse of female children in the household , dowry-related violence , marital rape , female infanticide , female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women , non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation ;  
Taking into account that the re-establishment of traditional sectors of the economy , such as manufacturing and tourism , requires considerable investments and given Montserrats limited financial resources , inadequate infrastructure facilities , including transportation arrangements , and reduced population size , the Government has proposed to examine the possibility of a greater involvement in service-oriented businesses based on information technology , financial services and telecommunications .  
As reported in document DP / 2001 / CRP . 5 , one of the strategies to achieve a higher level of audit coverage has been to encourage government counterparts to use local private audit firms where there is insufficient or limited capacity in the office of the national Auditor General to meet the audit deadline .  
How to continue to benefit from the technical and logistical advantages of ad hoc groupings and limited representation forums , while ensuring that decisions with global repercussions are taken in forums that are more inclusive and that have clearly defined and broad-based intergovernmental mandates , such as the International Monetary and Financial Committee , the Development Committee and the General Assembly and Economic and Social Council ?  What would be the most appropriate form for an enhanced institutional relationship between WTO and the United Nations ?  
The Working Group noted that the United Nations Sales Convention applied only to contracts for the international sale of goods , a term that had traditionally been understood to apply basically to movable tangible goods , thus excluding intangible assets , such as patent rights , trademarks , copyrights , a quota of a limited liability company , as well as know-how .  
ACCs contribution to policy coherence and overall progress should not be limited to the elaboration of common , comprehensive approaches to development and the development of a common framework for country level action , but should extend to the identification of global public goods and of the balances and synergies that need to be created among them to strengthen international governance , further policy coherence and advance the goals set at the Summit .  
The Committee requests that periodic reports are limited to significant new legislative , judicial , administrative and policy developments , subject matters raised in the Committees previous concluding observations and issues raised in the list of issues .  
Participants considered that the limited space available for indigenous peoples in the media should be used to inform the general public and indigenous communities about what was happening on an international and national level regarding indigenous issues and to create understanding and awareness of indigenous cultures among the general public .  
These countries are characterized by their exposure to a series of vulnerabilities and constraints such as limited human , institutional and productive capacity ; acute susceptibility to external economic shocks , natural and man-made disasters and communicable diseases ; limited access to education , health and other social services and to natural resources ; poor infrastructure ; and lack of access to information and communication technologies .  
However , there is very limited scope , in the foreseeable future , to meet the multiple development finance requirements of LDCs with domestic resources because of sluggish growth or economic stagnation , widespread poverty and a weak domestic corporate sector .  
We have identified considerable obstacles associated with limited economic , technological and institutional capacities at all levels of government , particularly in the developing and the least developed countries .  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territorys deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
By 2005 , through a series of incremental steps , reach an overall target of annual expenditure on the epidemic of between US $ 7-billion and US $ 10-billion in low and middle-income countries and those countries experiencing or at risk of experiencing rapid expansion for prevention , care , treatment , support and mitigation of the impact of HIV / AIDS , and take measures to ensure that needed resources are made available , particularly from donor countries and also from national budgets , bearing in mind that resources of the most affected countries are seriously limited ;  
The Group was convinced that , in the current situation of limited financial resources , UNIDO should continue to enhance its potential for technical cooperation in environment-related activities by strengthening existing working relationships with other international organizations such as GEF and the Montreal Protocol .  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territorys deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
As in the case of mercenary activities , and bearing in mind the close relationship between mercenarism and terrorism , Cuba has participated actively in the activities and efforts of the United Nations to combat international terrorism and , although it acknowledges that the outcome of such efforts has sometimes been localized or of limited scope , it has supported them in the firm conviction that in this field the contribution of the United Nations and of the international community as a whole is an urgent matter of priority . 
Faced with the increasingly opaque web of local and global politics , economic interests and criminal activity that characterizes many of todays conflicts , we must make the best use of organizations limited resources by engaging all relevant actors in our work to improve the protection of civilians .
