It was reported that the plug fitted to the power cord has a remote chance that the front cover might come loose from the 3-pin base when being removed from a mains socket .  This could expose the live contacts giving rise to risk of an electric shock .  
Mr Li said the eATS with its new features - - ambient noise responsive output , directional output , and tactile signal - - would not only make road crossings safer for the visually impaired but also reduce noise disturbance to a minimum .  The sound level of the new eATS was decided after consultations with the visually impaired and people who live near signalized crossings .  
Now , it is a green island , covered with trees , with highways leading to every corner . Water and electric power are supplied to every one . People live and work in peace and prosperity , so close to communist held territory . Numerous lakes and hills , as well as pavilions , such as Chu-kuang Tower , Tai Hu and Mount Tawu , enhance the beautiful scenery .  
His will is inscribed on the base of the statue , and six big characters Lun Li ( ethics ) , Ming Chu ( democracy ) , and Ko Hsueh ( science ) are inscribed on the marble wall behind the statue . The late President 's famous sayings : " To live is to seek a better life for all mankind ; the meaning of life lies in the creation of a life beyond life " is engraved on the two sides of the main hall .  
Though progress has been made in heavy industry , and nuclear weapons have been produced , India 's grassroots social construction work lags far behind . Most of the people are poverty-stricken , and disparity in the distribution of wealth between rich and poor is tremendous . When floods and droughts occur , many die of hunger . " What uses are such highly educated people to their country if they live in exile ? "  
Tainan can not compare with Taipei as a political and economic center , and has little chance to catch up with Kaohsiung 's industrial development . But Mayor Su intends to restore Tainan 's faded glory . " We hope to create a city that is both comfortable to live in and enjoyable to visit , " he says .  
In the reeducation camp , Tang was chained hand and foot and forced to do heavy and demeaning work such as carting stones and spreading manure . Most of Tang 's colleagues , undernourished , overworked and lacking his physical stamina and determination , eventually succumbed . Tang 's will to live and to drive out China 's enemies gave him the strength he needed .  
Not every student can be lucky enough to live near hot mineral springs , of course , but every area offers opportunities to give students well rounded , mental and physical education . Hopefully this small school in Taipei 's surrounding mountains , with just over 100 students , can become a model for every school , large or small , in the country .  
These will be surrounded by an agricultural zone which in turn is surrounded by a protected area where development is prohibited . Upon completion it is projected that the new city will have a population of 450,000 . It will be a total living environment where people can work , live and relax .  
According to a Ching dynasty gazetteer , " Taiwan is surrounded on four sides by sea ; tall mountains extend from the north to the south . To the west our people live mixed with the indigenous people ; to the east live only the indigenous people . "

The snake population is high in gem mining zones , partly because the residents try to co-exist with them , but mainly because snakes like to live where jade deposits are plentiful . An experienced miner explained that snakes prefer jade-laden stone habitats because the temperature remains cool in summer yet has residual warmth during cold spells .  
Through the robust and healthy development of the public broadcasting system ( PBS ) , live programs can immediately be telecast or diffused by satellite via the medium of PBS . Ordinary antenna-type TV systems will include PBS channels , which will provide the public with a high standard of programming in the arts , sports , and culture .  
Preventive planning and control of hazardous wastes will be instituted and an environmental quality monitoring network set up in order to provide accurate warning and instant response . The Taiwan area will then live up to its reputation of being a beautiful island with blue skies and green meadows , verdant mountains and clear waters . .  
In the process of economic development , the government should actively invest more in social welfare , and should , based on the particular circumstances of our country , learn from the experiences of more advanced countries and design a concrete program for the welfare of all the people , so that our citizens can live and work in safety and harmony , and the aged , weak , and handicapped can receive the care they need .  
Because the old Chinatowns , crowded and filthy , with their restaurants and souvenir shops , are located in the heart of city , Peter Kwong calls Chinese Americans living there " downtown Chinese " in distinction to " uptown Chinese , " who are professionals , drive nice cars and live in the suburbs .  
Such words ring only partially true , especially bearing in mind how often the ancients went astray in their observation of nature , as seen in their quaint notion that consuming cinnabar refined from metal and stone could make you live as eternally as those . Resting on the basis of Five Elements theories , no wonder the Eight Cyclical Characters divination method offers skeptics a field day .  
" I was unhappy working in Taipei and felt the farther from the crowds I lived the better for me ; it was the only way to find harmony and emotional balance , " he says . The simpler way of life in the countryside helps filter out distractions and clarifies your thoughts . His rooms and garden are furnished with antique tables , chairs , vases and knickknacks picked up outside . " City life is too materialistic , and often makes us forget how to live alongside nature . "  
The activities of his life after that time have been rather like a search to prove the truth of this ideal . Of course the idea of a global family is a beautiful one , but Needham 's mission to prove the scientific merits of Chinese culture could not live comfortably with the arrogant idea of Western superiority that had come down from the seventeenth century . When the first volume of Science and Civilisation in China was published in 1954 , Needham 's humanistic aspirations were still confronted by two established bodies of opinion .  
In Mogi , just an hour 's drive from Sao Paolo , he met an old friend of his - - Tsai Chang-luan , an expert in herbal medicine - - and several fellow Szechwanese who owned farms there . The country 's abundant resources , its pleasant climate and the goodness of its people all spoke in its favor , and when he found some land that reminded him of the Chengtu plain in Szechwan , he decided at once that he wanted to live there .  
The department found in 1990 that the rate of women aged 15 to 49 who lived with their parents or their husband 's parents within five years of being married increased 4.5 percent over 1988 . And the younger the woman and the lower her level of education ( meaning women with more financial difficulties ) , the more likely she was to live with one set of parents .  
I 'm sure the reason many overseas students go bad or give up on themselves is that they 're afraid of being unable to live up to their parents ' expectations , combined with the stress of living overseas and the pressure of getting ahead academically .  
To encourage people to participate and understand that bats are nothing to be afraid of , they set up bat-appreciation spots . These are places where people can go near the mouth of a cave in the evening and see one of nature 's most spectacular and lively sights - - bats leaving the roost . The societies also teach people how to build bat feeders to attract suburban bats and allow them to happily live in a human environment .  
Feeling illegal : There are more mainland spouses here illegally who have n't been exposed by the media . Some of them may have married because they longed for Taiwan 's political and economic stability or wanted to live here and could n't find a job back home or even because they fell into clutches of the white slave trade .  
Perhaps adult fireflies , who use their light to match up with their spouse , have grown dazzled and dazed by the streets lined with lights . With potential mates lost in the glare , they live celibate lives .  
This group of new directors , called the fifth generation , includes such figures as Chen Kai-ge and Tian Zhuang-zhuang . They share some things in common . Because of the cultural revolution , they all lost the chance to study . Among those 20 million intellectual youths dispersed to the remote regions to live with the peasants , they know about these places ' odd customs .  
Today , agricultural villages are in a period of transition . The elderly are not accustomed to living with their children in the crowded cities , and they 're unwilling to live in old folk 's homes . If old trees and the environments around them can be preserved , the villages can remain semi-agricultural , the elderly will have places to go , and their spiritual needs will be taken care of , too .  
Lin Shan-le , who came to Taiwan to live with relatives , and Li Lan , a student at Hsinpu Junior College , praise " 800O miles " for its deep and fertile subject matter and for daring to tackle sensitive issues . That lover of dramas Ma Yu , on the other hand , believes that " 8000 Miles " goes too far in directly judging mainland trends and cross-strait relations . Sometimes , she says , it has a sneering or glibly debasing tone that makes it more difficult for her to accept .  
It 's the place which bore and suckled us . . . we are bound to her not only by understanding , but also by life and emotion . . . no matter how her lofty mountains and sparkling waters may be despoiled , her deep human intimacy diluted , as long as we live on this island of Taiwan , she will always be home to our spirits , " Su Wen-kui , editor of the periodical Hu Wei Chieh wrote in an article .  
The last generation faced problems getting by day to day , therefore they only ask that life be stable and they are satisfied . In this generation , we are into social competition and improving the quality of life , so our expectations of life are very different , " says Yeh Chu-lan . Her father wanted her to go back to their hometown after she graduated from college to teach and live a quiet life . But for her a challenging , stimulating , diverse life was much more attractive .  
His eldest daughter Chung Yu-ching retorts that there is less and less field work to be done , and at home appliances have taken over many tasks formerly done by hand , so it 's impossible to insist that modern women live like those in the past . In Taiwan , young people share a common backdrop to their upbringings , a common language , and a great deal of information . The impact of traditional family education is waning , and can not overcome social values , schooling , and peer interactions .  
Land is state property , and most people live in homes owned by their work units , so that these can not serve as collateral for " start-up capital . " Another reason why private enterprise is having a hard time burgeoning is because " government policy is tilted in favor of foreign and Taiwan investors . " It is still up in the air whether or not the mainland can duplicate Taiwan 's development experience .  
In the coastal regions of every Asian country along the western Pacific ocean live large numbers of marine turtles , but many of the islands where they are distributed lack reliable monitoring and protection . Sea turtles have even gotten innocently embroiled in local wars or been negatively affected by the capers of private individuals . For this reason international conservation groups intend to devote the year 1995 to the West Pacific Marine turtle , hoping to encourage research and protection of marine turtles in this region .  
Q : After you came back , you devoted yourself to encouraging talented people from Taiwan who now live overseas to return home , and you established the Foundation for Development of Outstanding Fellows . A while back we went to the mainland to conduct interviews and discovered that you are the chairman of the Tan Kah Kee International Institute , which was established in honor of the famous Southeast Asian Chinese who founded Xiamen University .  
When the movie Eat , Drink , Man , Woman by ROC director Ang Lee had its international release recently , audiences in Europe and America were astonished by what they saw . In the picture , Lang Hsiung is a renowned master chef whose feats include killing a live fish with a jab from his chopsticks and inflating a Peking Duck with his mouth . For audiences in Taiwan , impressed with his skill , the only doubt was whether or not it will lead to us being described abroad as " cruel . "  
On the next outdoor shoot he was confronted with another group of indigenous people who were facing an even more pessimistic , miserable fate than the city 's construction site aborigines . They live in illegal buildings which are soon to be torn down . This time , he put aside his natural feelings of sympathy for his compatriots , and conducted his story carefully with a cool heart . Although still in a terrible mood , he shed no more tears .  
The places to which they have scattered are unusual , as well . Some live high up at the Sun Yat-sen Hall atop Yangming Mountain , and some live down low near Keelung Harbor . Some can be found in tightly guarded army ammunition factories , and in nuclear power plants . Several generations of students and teachers meet to have fun together , and everybody feels as close as one big family .  
Fan applies the differences in the value systems of men and women that psychologists have uncovered to the news media . She notes that , compared to men , women are less likely to be concerned with winning and losing ; women are more concerned with process . Women also do not like abstract and obscure theories , but prefer to see stories about the human side of things - - about how people live their lives . Women are no less interested in ordinary people and disadvantaged groups than they are in the powerful and successful .  
Twenty years ago , our not-so-affluent society expressed its sympathy with actions , and enabled the two-year-old Siamese twins to live on through highly sophisticated surgery , growing up to be the two bright youths of today . Can the society that prides itself on economic accomplishments exert its collective power to help them over their many future hurdles ?  
In fact , outside the charmed circle of leading business families are large numbers of ethnic Chinese whose forebears came as laborers , and who still live at a low economic level with limited educational opportunities , just like the rest of the population . For many young women from this background , marriage is a means of escape from a life of poverty .  
On an ordinary day , however , the couple live very much at peace . They pass their time wandering about the compound , sleeping , bathing , and enjoying breakfast and dinner , which they receive at set times every day . The memories of war have already faded in the distance .  
" In the past , society was very closed , and it was hard to get information , so people really respected their professors , " says Lin Chin-chuan . Now we live amidst an information explosion , with rapid development of all forms of media . Teachers are no longer the only source of knowledge . Naturally the paternalistic , god-like authority they enjoyed in the past has declined , and it has become necessary for them relate to students on a more personal level .  
Chen 's effort to lose weight only succeeded because she was properly motivated . She broke through psychological barriers , and she developed an understanding of the idea that " I want to live well for myself , and make myself into a more disciplined individual . " By the end she had even gained control over her past bad habit of " eating snack food and smoking whenever I felt sad . "  
Fifty years of a common destiny forged in fortune and misfortune have united us all into a closely bound and interdependent community . The first-ever popular presidential election has reconfirmed our collective consciousness that we in Taiwan have to work together as one . How to make this land of ours more beautiful and how to make its inhabitants feel safer and live a happier and more harmonious life is the common responsibility of our 21.3 million people !  
Fiddler crabs of the species Uca borealis have an unusual choice of habitat : they live on muddy sandflats . Though their huge claws are beautifully colored and impressively shaped , they are not very mobile , so it seems they are there just for show - - to scare others off - - and not do any harm .  
It 's not that I 'm hard to scare ( God has given me an adrenal gland , which is His way of telling me to be scared ) . It 's just that I react slowly to authority , and although I am afraid , neither being assassinated , nor being arrested , nor being jumped in a dark alley is a threat to me anymore , because how many more years do I have to live anyway ?  
Tall and handsome , young and enchanting , they nevertheless frequently go through an entire year without seeing the light of day . They sleep during the day and go out at night . They live only indoors , underneath light-bulbs , and for this reason , when one pays close attention to them , their faces always seem a little pale , their voices are scratchy , and faint bags can be seen under their eyes . . . .  
It is an historical asset that is part of the collective memories of the people who live in Taiwan , and also provides living instruction about the history of railroads here , and could also be a concrete way for the government to show their concern for Taiwan 's native culture . " It has more meaning from the perspective of cultural preservation and education . "  
According to the field interviews of cultural writer Ma Teng-yueh , who has traveled extensively writing down the experiences of tattooed tribal elders , the Saisiyat live quite close to the Atayal , and the reason they started tattooing their faces is " the inevitable result of protecting themselves against a stronger enemy . " Therefore , in actuality , among all the indigenous peoples , only Atayal have the inherent custom of facial tattooing . That is why the Qing Dynasty documents usually referred to Atayal as " qingmian fan " ( " tattoo-faced barbarians " ) .  
Along with the evolution of time , the untoward condition of indigenous society has made many of these " facial tattoo treasures " lose the shelter of their younger relatives , due to alcoholism and other problems . Among the medical records of the tattooed old folks of Tai-an Rural Township , quite a few have an impoverished family and live long-term in unhygienic environments . A couple even live alone . Although most of them are taken care of by their relatives , chronic diseases of old age constitute a heavy burden on their children .  
Sogyal Rinpoche is the spiritual heir of an ancient lineage of teachers reaching back several centuries . But he has lived for many years amidst modern society , which is rich in material assets , but whose people are confused and perplexed . In his eyes , most people misuse life and misunderstand death : " Death in fact is a great opportunity . Only when we understand death can we know how to live . "  
It was n't that I had no interest in reading it , but rather was unable to get away from the constant stream of daily activities that keep me busy . Then , however , when I finally struggled through to the second chapter , I read about the idea of " active laziness . " Rinpoche says : " Our lives seem to live us , to possess their own bizarre momentum , to carry us away ; in the end we feel we have no choice or control over them . "  
He observes that according to statistics , nearly 13% of people in the US have some sort of mental disorder . This clearly illustrates the famous words of Jesus Christ : " Man does not live by bread alone . " The ancient religious practices of meditation and contemplating the impermanence of life can positively help modern people , who are undergoing immense changes in social relations and also witnessing rapid transformations both at work and their private lives .  
" They are an important reminder to Taiwan 's society to open its eyes and see the poor and the weak among us , " says Li Chia-tung , Dean of Providence University and a one-time volunteer in a Calcutta hospice . He feels that people , especially people who live in self-proclaimed wealthy and civilized countries , love beauty and do their best to avoid seeing ugly and painful things . This even includes many who work in the field of religion .  
Twenty years ago , people watched Taiwan 's Little League teams fighting for glory abroad on late night TV . A few days ago , people stayed up all night watching a live marathon program , directed by and starring a major criminal . Then came the elections for county and city executives . After the excitement generated by political " stars , " the victory of the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) has rewritten the political map of Taiwan .  
Activities on the tour included both highly refined traditional live budaixi and contemporary TV budaixi . HEPP wisely invited ethnologists-who have wide connections in the field of traditional culture-to organize the event . As a result , virtually all the major puppet theater families from all over Taiwan were brought together . In the world of budaixi , where each " school " carefully distinguishes itself from its competitors , this was truly unprecedented .  
Juju Wang , an associate professor of sociology and anthropology at Tsing Hua University , notes that all of the central government agencies are located up north in Taipei . The city has two-thirds of the island 's universities , over 90 percent of the corporate headquarters , and over 90 percent of its media . The magnetic draw of Taipei has made it an over-loaded city with a deteriorating environment - " a poor place to live amid great wealth . "  
In contrast with today , when wild ducks live on river beds choked with stinking organic chemicals and strewn with styrofoam and other plastics , in written records from the past the ducks suck up red algae , delve beneath green lotus leaves , wash themselves with dew and live among clouds and mists .  
The world has indeed progressed . The hasty passing of half a century has seen an improvement in material conditions , people live longer and have more to eat . Yet the most contagious disease of the late twentieth century has become " hard work . "  
The winning songs included last year 's best sellers like " Sister " by A-Mei , " Faye Wong " by Faye Wong and Wu Bai 's " Summer Night Wind " live album . What was exciting to people in the music business was that the diverse music of new alternative artists like Chang Chen-yueh , Faith Yang , Luan Tan , The King of Kinmen and Lee Ping-hui , and David Tao was also recognized , which illustrated the vitality of the pop music scene in Taiwan .  
Of course , the quality of nursing homes is very uneven , which accounts for much of seniors ' unwillingness to live in them . Yet at a basic level seniors still hold traditional notions about children caring for their parents in old age , and feel that they will lose face and a sense of security if they are apart from their children . Children , meanwhile , bear similar psychological and social pressures . Indeed who , if sufficiently able , would choose to " drop " the care of one 's parents onto institutions ?  
Life in a foreign land requires major adjustment . As Taiwanese senior citizens immigrate to the US to live with relatives during their twilight years , this process is filled with tears and struggle , but also brings to light their considerable resourcefulness .  
" The majority of Taiwanese senior citizens in the US come here to live with their grown children , who mostly have master 's or PhD degrees , and are ' suburban Chinese . ' Because the homes of their children are spread out in middle - and high-class residential areas , unlike members of self-contained urban Chinatowns , elderly Taiwanese suffer great inconvenience if they are unable to communicate in English , " says Peter C . Lee , associate vice-president of the Office of Faculty Affairs at San Jose State University in California .  
As the structure of families and communities changes , the old intimate relations where one would raise the young and care for the old amid the sounds of cocks crowing and dogs barking have been replaced by cold impersonal relations in the urban sea of concrete buildings . As a result , many women have been confined to live lonely lives in their communities .  
But sadly life is an inescapable obligation , and King Mu had not finished his duties here below . As he left , the Queen Mother 's parting words to him were : " Though the peaks stand as high as the clouds , you crossed mountains and rivers to come from the distant east ; may you live to be a hundred , and may we meet again . "  
By the same reasoning , qi which condenses with sufficient harmony may be unchanging and maintain its form eternally . Humans live between heaven and earth , and can participate in the processes by which heaven and earth are nourished and life created and changed . The Yi Jing ( Book of Changes ) lays great stress on the continuous burgeoning of life within the vast universe . Thus we can see that there is a historical background to the continuous emergence of ideas concerning elixirs of immortality and fairylands peopled by immortals .  
The fairy realms portrayed in literature have many established features . A common plot element is that if a visitor to fairyland stays there , he can live there as an immortal forever . But usually the hero is stricken with homesickness and leaves ; once back among the distracting , vulgar pleasures of the mortal world , he never finds his way into fairyland again .  
Zhuangzi ( Chuang-tzu ) states that if one 's view of the world is clouded by preconceptions and expectations , then it is impossible to live beyond the physical limitations faced by ordinary human beings , for one is not living in harmony with the " Dao " of the universe .  
From Laozi it borrows the concepts of non-action , clear understanding , and acting in harmony with nature . From Zhuangzi come the concepts of total freedom and life-for-the-fun-of-it . Combining these concepts , religious Daoism holds that in order to become an immortal , one must be free of joy and anger , eliminate desire , live in quietude and non-action , maintain primitive simplicity , and act in harmony with the natural laws of the universe .  
People have long been aware of the educational and recreational functions of museums . But now the global trend is toward moving the focus of museums away from the elite to the general public , and relating them more closely to the lives of the people who live nearby . From elite to mass  
If the star is successful , the program pays for the person 's desired prize ; otherwise , the person 's hope is left unrealized . The format of this segment resembles the old show Loving Heart , which encouraged people to help some unfortunate . But the new program has an even more direct emotional appeal insofar as it cuts in live shots of the reactions of the hosts and audience members , sometimes zooming in on the superstar celebrities as they weep .  
Although investigation of the relationship between climate and infectious diseases is still at a preliminary stage , excessive human development of jungles and rainforests has increased people 's chances of coming into contact with the microorganisms which live there , and with their natural hosts .  
Chen Hao-yung of the NIPM says that once a virus develops into an urban virus it becomes very hard to eradicate . Viruses are very simple in structure , and as long as they have live cells to act as their hosts they can continue to reproduce . Hence cities , which have dense human populations and also harbor large numbers of rodents and other pests , are perfect breeding grounds for viruses .  
In fact , some experts feel that since most enterovirus cases in Taiwan are in rural areas , it is still the result of poor hygiene . Nonetheless , it is also true that children today live too cleanly : they lack natural sources of infection in their environment , so that when they do meet with a virus they are quite unable to fend it off .  
If you can get them breathing and their hearts beating again , you 've always got a shot at saving them . " But the use of CPR , which was originally intended for saving lives in medical emergencies , has been commandeered by the extend-life-at-all-costs philosophy of the modern medical era . Whether or not their illnesses are curable , if patients can be made to live another day , another hour , or even another minute , all efforts are made to save them .  
These included " fish souls , " made from the lips cut from live sturgeon ; " Xi Shi 's bosom , " made with white fat from pufferfish bellies and named after a famous beauty ; and the " gold soup and jade slices " served by Mrs . Song outside Qiantang Gate , which comprised a thick wild rice stem soup and sliced raw common carp and crucian carp .  
Taiwan 's estuarine shellfish live on plankton and organic matter , and heavy metals accumulate in their bodies ; the fleshy parts such as the foot and adductor muscle can still be eaten , but the central viscera are best left alone . " Even the ' best ' seafood today is n't fit to eat , " writes Lin Ming-yu , a reporter with the Min Sheng Pao newspaper , lamenting the difficulty of finding good seafood in Taiwan .  
Many Takasago Volunteers who survived the cataclysm of the war returned to live under a " new dynasty , " the ROC , and found that their formerly Japanese-speaking world had suddenly become a Mandarin one . The language of the broadcast media had changed overnight , along with the dominant ideology . As time went by , their children and grandchildren grew up under the educational system of the nationalist government , completely different from the system during the Japanese era , and the ex-Volunteers became a lonely , lost group .  
At a time when other groups have achieved heightened visibility and have succeeded in winning general acceptance of their need to preserve their rights , the Hakkas are still saddled with the same old stereotypes they 've always had to live with-invisible , docile , conservative , impassive . . . . Hakka activists have to take to the street to get their own people to adopt a bit of a higher profile . A quick glance at the ranks of society 's post-martial law political and business leaders is revealing .  
Viewing this demographic shift within its proper historical context , however , sheds a different light on the issue . Water resources were seldom located in the plains ; rather , they were most accessible along the middle reaches of rivers . This was a key reason why Taiwan 's early Hakkas chose to live in the hills .  
Yu Shui-pei , a researcher at the Academia Sinica 's Institute of Earth Sciences , is intimately acquainted with the wriggling , writhing ways of this island we live on . In 1990 he began installing sensitive instruments around the island to measure their precise positions using a satellite positioning system .  
When Tiway Sayion retired from his position as principal of Hualien 's Tafalong Primary School after a teaching career that spanned 45 years , his first act was to realize a long-cherished dream-he returned to the tribal community where he was born and built a cabin in which to live . Tiway Sayion 's simple 20-ping cabin is laid out with the kitchen and bathroom on the right and the bedroom on the left . The center is his living room , furnished with only a sofa and bookshelves .  
Last year the Buddha 's Light International Association organized New Year 's Eve dinners in the north , center and south of Taiwan , which were attended by more than 5,000 old folk who live alone . This year they are repeating the exercise , and are including a special event in Nantou County to bring some warmth and love to elderly survivors of the 9 / 21 earthquake there .  
Mainland China shares the same language as Taiwan and it offers attractive investment conditions . It would be surprising if it did n't attract Taiwan firms that are eager to set up offshore . Amid the cross-strait political standoff , one can expect that Taiwan firms in Dongguan will continue to live out this exciting tale of gain and loss .  
What about the three main candidates ? Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party , which advocates Taiwan independence , produced a long and detailed white paper on China policy , which offered some changes and reservations to the independence position . But , in an unguarded moment , Chen also declared " Long live Taiwan 's independent sovereignty ! " and this comment has left many people uncertain which is the real Chen .  
Apart from consolidating democratic achievements , promoting government reforms , and raising economic competitiveness , the new government should , as its foremost objective , closely watch public opinion and implement reforms accordingly , so that the people on this land can live with more dignity , greater self-confidence and a better quality of life .  
It seems they have n't realized yet that they may live to be 85 . They have n't made any preparations for living expenses , vacations , or the enormous medical expenses that can be expected over the next 25 years . " She has encouraged her parents to put part of their savings into a mutual fund or the like , but without success . Indeed , the issue has become a sore point between her and her mother .  
He had so little money that while on the road he had to live out of his van and bathe in mountain streams , but his unflagging enthusiasm has now made the indefatigable Lin an expert on Taiwan 's aquatic plants . He has closely examined and measured their roots , stems , leaves , berries , and petals . He knows what kind of conditions are preferred by each species . He knows that the lantern seedbox , tropical sundew , and primrose willow are at their prettiest between six and nine in the morning .  
And now the tragedy at Pachang Creek , when millions of viewers saw four people swept to their deaths on live TV . Once again , the public is left feeling hurt and angry . And the question is raised : Are incompetence and inefficiency endemic within the structure of our bureaucracy ?  
He illustrates his point by mentioning Straight Ahead with a Rifle , in which Dong continually returns to the image of a bombing range , communicating how it feels to live next to such a place . It is a factor always on the minds of local residents . This repeated use of a single image is a very unusual technique , but it does n't bore the viewer ; on the contrary , it leaves one feeling that he has gained new insight into the subject of the documentary .  
This film returns time and again to images of patriotic slogans on local walls , highlighting the helpless feeling of knowing that the island one calls home has been chosen to serve as a battlefield . Homesick 2000 Meters shows how near the cities of Kinmen and Xiamen are across the water , yet how far apart their residents live due to political reality . The empty scenes in this documentary highlight the longing for home of a people cut off from their roots .  
Where I live in northwestern Switzerland , small municipal refuse bags , which hold 17 liters , cost around NT $ 30 each . Even the largest size of bags only hold 110 liters , yet cost NT $ 108 . This is definitely much more expensive than in Taipei City , but I 've never heard anyone complain that the bags are too dear . I think this is because they do a good job of reducing and separating their waste .  
The mainlanders have introduced the cuisines of their home provinces and a longing for the old country . Likewise , the attitudes of civil servants loyal to the KMT have also taken firm root in Taipei . What 's more , a larger proportion of Hakkas live in Taipei than any place ooutside of their traditional bases in the countryside , and the city also has a large community of aborigines . With this population structure , the Taiwanese chauvinism so prevalent in southern Taiwan is rather rare in Taipei .  
For Cegaw , winning an award for something so close to his heart and home is " something I 'll never forget as long as I live . " In fact , though members of the tribe were enthusiastic about participating in the competition , even Cegaw thought that many other sites were better , and that the chances of a prize were remote . Residents were astonished by the news that the site was named as one of the 100 to get through the preliminary round .  
There were more rock concerts played by more local bands and attended by more fans than ever before in Taiwan this summer , and record companies have now had to introduce new categories for their CD output , such as pop bands , underground bands and live concerts . The most popular band at the moment , Mayday , this year sold 200,000 copies of its second album Long Live Love , which is a remarkable amount given the otherwise sluggish market .  
Yeh Wen-chi emphasizes that the natural history of each dragonfly species is unique , and it is hard to generalize . For instance , the protected giant spiketail only breeds once in three years . It does not fit the general pattern of insects which live fleeting lives and may produce several generations a year .  
Most of Taiwan 's venomous snakes live in low-altitude farmland and sparsely populated countryside . But the hundred-pace viper , which was never very numerous , is at home in densely forested areas at low to medium elevations in the mountains of eastern , central and southern Taiwan . It grows to one-and-a-half meters or more-much the same length as the habu and cobra-but being far thicker and meatier it is much valued by gourmands .  
At the age of 50 , some people already have grandchildren at their knee , while others are getting married for the first time . With more and more people remaining single , rising divorce rates , growing numbers of unmarried mothers , increasing occurrence of infertility , and the emergence of large numbers of families where husband and wife live in different cities , or even-as for many expatriate Taiwanese business people-in different countries , many middle-aged people 's carefully laid life plans have suddenly come to nothing .  
Moreover , environmental protection work touches on things like community consciousness , the livelihood of farmers and fishermen , and aboriginal culture . Often the main obstacle to environmental protection work is the attitudes of people who live in the mountains and depend on the resources there . Thus environmental protection is not simply the responsibility of a few social elites , but includes economic , social , transportation , and even diplomatic and political aspects .  
" They live mixed in with greater crested terns , and this makes them really difficult to pick out . But in our film they do show up very clearly , " says Liang Chieh-te , who was commissioned to film greater crested terns by the Lienchiang County Government . The greater crested tern is around 45 centimeters long . Its most distinctive features are that it has a forked tail like a swallow , a crest of black feathers on its head rather like a Mohican haircut , and a yellow beak .  
" It 's been no easy task searching for a suitable place to live , and we eventually had to make the leap all the way from western Taiwan to Hualien here in the eastern part , " says Chang . They lived in Lukang before , but when that place started to become affected by industrial pollution , they moved to Meilun in Hualien , where they rented a house .  
Seshui lies on the southwest side of Provincial Highway 21 , close to Tayen Tunnel , with Puli to the north and the famous scenic spot Sun Moon Lake to the south . The neighborhood has an area of something over 60 hectares , and 230-plus inhabitants , who live by farming . Their main crops are vegetables such as aubergines and beans , and high-value cash crops such as betel nuts , orchids and Assam tea .  
The pair get married , but the Snake King arrives disguised as a local village girl and steals the magic feather . In the end , Wan Shi turns into a huge boulder to pin down the Snake King , while the egret goddess gives up her magic feather to save the island , which has been laid to waste . Thanks to the sacrifices of Wan Shi and the egret goddess , the people are able to live in peace once again .  
In seeking to answer this question , we poured our energies into building our economy , developing the so-called folk literature , and finding strength in the land where we live . In the process , we developed self-confidence . The severing of official diplomatic ties with the US in 1978 left us even further isolated from the international community , but we responded by redoubling our efforts and pulling together . A national consciousness began to take shape .  
Lo Liu-chih points out that the collared bush robins that live on the ground in the forest understory mainly nest on grassy slopes , where as well as being exposed to major airborne predators such as raptors and crows , they are also apt to attract the attention of land animals such as weasels and rock monkeys . " Large creatures like weasels , birds of prey or nutcrackers may be more sensitive to traffic , and more easily frightened by human activity , " says Lo Liu-chih .  
Commenting on this phenomenon , mainland Chinese cultural critic Xie Xizhang notes that the residential patterns of old Bei-jing were disrupted by the Cultural Revolution . High-ranking government officials used to live primarily on the east side , and the area had a very cultured air . Rich merchants congregated on the west side , while the south side was the plebian part of town .  
In addition to books , his store sold music , doubled as an art gallery , and brought in live performances . With unfinished wooden floors , whitewashed walls , and comfortable seats , the store gave customers an ideal place to lounge and look through the books .  
Yet , whether or not the adjustment of the ratios was professional and fair , the government 's entire funding pie had not grown larger , so if more was going to the 23 counties and cities , that meant the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung would have to learn to live with less . Not surprisingly , the new plan met with fierce opposition in both cities .  
Busy as a bee just to make a living , rushing ahead out of fear of falling behind . In the midst of the hustling e-generation , when competition has become the key in which our lives are orchestrated , and pressure has become a constant , how to put one 's heart at ease and live care-free ? Although trendy prescriptions are legion , some have discovered that returning to the ancestral practice of Chinese calligraphy-using a brush-is modern man 's most " soothing " remedy .  
This year , someone who had a lucky year over the previous year offered the temple 230 taels ( 8.6 kilos ) of gold . The temple decided to break up that amount and make a family of one large and three small golden turtles which would be open to qigui for the public . In front of the temple they even built a clever little landscape garden where the four golden turtles can live a leisurely existence .  
According to interpretations of the Avatamsaka Sutra , our universe is formed of pearl-like individual objects strung together in a net , so that it is difficult to separate what is real from what is illusion ; past , present , and future exist side-by-side ; and no individual can exist in isolation . As a result , people should live in the present , embrace goodness and do good deeds , so that the universe will tend toward harmony .  
In two years of volunteer life , I made sure that I lived each day to the fullest , for this was a most precious life experience . By living in such a destitute environment , I was able to get a taste of life 's many possibilities . I experienced every possible form of culture shock . I learned how to lighten up and lead a simple life , how to work diligently , and how to make the best of my situation and peacefully live life one day at a time .  
It is a pity that , although Taiwan has attained democracy , it has yet to rationalize its public sector . Instead it is increasingly a " street vendor " culture , with fractious grassroots movements here and there , or just plain vulgar . This points to the necessity of us following the path of advanced nations and upgrading our domestic services . Taiwan must create a quality environment in which people want to live .  
Hsu Tzu-you , who has helped terminal cancer patients employing Chinese and Western folk medicine , has in recent years been a forceful proponent of preventative medicine . He states that the human body is a thing of marvel and mystery , explaining how the sympathetic nerve and the parasympathetic nerve help each other obtain balance . But now that people live very sedentary lives , they are constantly exercising their brains but little else .  
A third of Taiwan 's native fern species grow in the damp , shady forest , and endemic Taiwanese plants such as the Taiwan pleione orchid live here too . The ancient false cypresses are a paradise for epiphytic plants , with up to 80 species living on a single tree .  
Of course , now that these religious rituals have become tourist attractions , they have lost a lot of their awe-inspiring and intimidating nature . Indeed , with the many performance troupes that now participate , the night inspection has taken on a festive spirit similar to ordinary temple parades . Nonetheless , the ancient rituals and the chilling legends surrounding them still live on in people 's thoughts as they watch .  
Individuals all have their own particular cultural background and value system . For that reason , the idea that prospective mates should come from similar economic and social backgrounds is not medieval . Most books on marriage include detailed " compatibility " checklists covering everything from ethnicity to where the two people live , their economic standing and level of education , how they interact with their own families , their respective personalities , interests and health , and what they hope for out of life .  
The empress , noting Lei 's unusually delicate features , became worried that he might not live to old age , so she took a brush and wrote the Chinese characters for " eighty " ( �� K �� Q ) between his eyebrows to ensure longevity . But as soon as Lei rose to his feet , the two characters on his forehead became transposed to read " eighteen . " And so Lei Haiqing died at the tender age of 18 , still young and handsome .  
With these two types of sustenance , one material and one spiritual , naturally one can live a long time , " says Lu . In fact , as long ago as the Song dynasty , Su Dongpo had identified three major advantages of eating zhou : " It brings peace of mind , which contributes to well-being , it is easy on the stomach , which contributes to physical energy , and it saves money , which contributes to becoming wealthy . "  
Taken together , these two incidents suggested new possibilities about how people can live their lives . Both featured people who are known as " transgenders " - those who do not fit into traditional male-female gender patterns . Uncomfortable with their physical sex as determined by their chromosomes , they feel driven to change their outward appearance into one that their mind can identify with .  
In particular , the 23 November demonstration on the streets of Taipei by 120,000 farmers and fishermen drew the attention of the whole nation . It stole much of the thunder from the first round of live TV debates between the Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral candidates , which had taken place shortly beforehand . The lack of coordination between the presidential office and the cabinet , the voices of dissent against the central government from within the ruling DPP and the continuing political fallout from the cabinet reshuffle will inevitably impact the Taipei and Kaohsiung elections .  
Among the intergenerational developments raising eyebrows and causing debate at the time were the following : sons and daughters-in-law unwilling to live with their parents after marriage ; younger women leaving home to earn a wage and thereby shifting power in the relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law ; children demanding to make their own decisions about work and marriage ; and the government encouraging three generations to live together under the same roof . In short , the screws were loosening on many of the structures that supported traditional notions about filial piety .  
" Parents should set their kids free , and not just so as to lighten the burdens on their kids , " Lu says . " In the past , while putting all their expectations on their kids , parents stifled their own potential for growth . " He discovered that many seniors felt bitter upon entering old age and discovering that they could not live close to their children . It affected their mental outlook for the entire latter period of their lives .  
For example , some community workers in Hsiufeng Village in Luku Rural Township started a business with only NT $ 500,000 in capital to repackage Luku tea leaves in an elegant and appealing way , and by playing on the heartwarming story behind the sale of the tea : paying for the continued operation of a cafeteria for local elderly people who live alone .  
Whenever Huang Shu-hui thinks of the many cold winter evenings her mother spent in the homes of other people , huddled in front of the fire , she is moved to tears . This motivated her to be successful whatever the cost , so that her mother would never again have to live such a hard life .  
Anyone who has traveled to Kyoto is sure to remember the streets and alleyways lined with elegant and well-maintained traditional Japanese-style residences in which people still live . Strolling those streets one feels the spirit of Japanese literature . These spaces are perhaps unsuitable to financial calculations of their worth . But their value in terms of cultural history is something that even greater economic power could not buy .  
Because financial magazines from Taiwan are still a touchy subject in the mainland , as well as concerns about the ability of mainland editors and reporters to live up to the Commonwealth standard , they have started a new magazine . Last year they started publishing Dongfang Qiyejia in Shanghai , sourcing their launch issue 's content from the senior staff of Commonwealth , to make absolutely certain to produce a magazine just as high in quality as its Taiwanese counterpart .  
In a survey of the dreams of youth taken by Sinorama in December among 19 to 30-year-olds , nearly half ( 46.7% ) included " live as I please , free and unrestrained " as one of their life dreams , far beyond the second most popular choice of " a happy family life " ( 29.8% ) and the third of " a stable job " ( 26.6% ) .  
Unexpected was the fact that children very much hoped to live with their elderly parents and conform to the traditional model of filial piety in this regard , while the image they had for themselves in old age was rather untraditional . Future plans for almost half of them tended toward living with their spouses only or living alone ( 43.9% ) , and they also stressed economic independence ( 44.4% ) .  
Taiwan has a long history of live performance , from simple shows held in crude tents , to fancy choreographed acts with crystal stages and catwalks , and everything in between . Audiences have changed their preferences in step with the changing times . Different audiences have had unique preferences and enjoyed special interactions with certain stars .  
Eventually the detention center called for Wang Chang-li 's assistance . Wang 's kindly , smiling face and sympathetic ear washed away their hostility , and after hearing them plead their case , he encouraged them not to give up on life and to carry on appealing their sentences , to fight for their chance to live .  
The biggest drawback of this type of treatment is that it takes two to three years , which is more than most people can put up with . What 's more , desensitization is also a risky procedure , because allergy shots can in some cases have the opposite effect to that intended , and provoke asthma , allergic rhinitis , and even anaphylactic shock . Therefore , unless they suffer from a severe case of allergy , most people opt to wage a protracted war of resistance or even to live in peaceful coexistence with their allergy .  
In 2000 , the Yushan Weather Station expansion project was finally completed , with the original 100-square-meter wooden hut expanded into a 160-square-meter steel frame structure with a sheet-metal roof . At the same time , new equipment , such as a live video feed system , was added . The number of photovoltaic panels and power storage batteries was also increased , as a result of which the power supply was improved .  
We live in an era of aesthetic sensibil-ity . The cultural economy and creative industries hold sway , and aesthetic sensibility has become a key determinant in individual , business , and national achievement .  
In countries where urbanization has taken place at a rapid pace , urban stress affecting human health , particularly that of the urban poor who live in unserviced areas and often make a living from collecting solid wastes , has increased .  
In 1996 , the Habitat II conference on human settlements , the " City Summit " will discuss a programme of action designed to make urban areas , where the majority of the world 's population will live , safe , humane , healthy and affordable .  
Conscious of the fact that the physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development of the child , the future generation , depends on a safe , secure and adequate place to live ,  
The volume of assistance we offered was the highest , in terms of gross national product , because we wanted to live in a world dominated by justice , a world whose hallmark is human compassion , a world in which the privileged will reach out towards the underprivileged without strings attached .  
Because we live in that kind of economy a key part of our action to deal with the problems of development must , accordingly , be multilateral , and the key problem facing us , both multilaterally and in our bilateral , donor roles , is that within the global economy the gap between rich and poor countries , despite all efforts to resist this , has grown .  
It is an encouraging sign that the international community , through the United Nations , the OAU and the Commonwealth , is just as anxious as the National Provisional Ruling Council Government to see an early end to our destructive war so that our peaceful citizens may once again be able to live in an environment free of fear and anxiety and to engage in their ordinary daily pursuits .  
It had a crash programme to build a nuclear weapon in 1990-1991 ; it had weaponized live biological agents , including the deadly botulin and anthrax organisms , weapons never before used in warfare ; it produced a far greater quantity of chemical weapons , in more diverse forms , than it had previously admitted ; and it deliberately kept these documents hidden from the United Nations Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) , even as it was claiming that all information had been handed over .  
It is regrettable that today , as the United Nations celebrates its fiftieth year since the signing of the Organization 's Charter in San Francisco , many people in Africa continue to live under even harsher conditions of poverty , hunger , disease , civil war and natural disaster .  The plight of the African continent remains a major challenge for the emerging world order .  
As the world 's leaders gather here later this month to reaffirm our collective commitment to our founding Charter , let our fiftieth anniversary celebration also signal a new start for our Organization , a new beginning in which we will address the challenges to global security and development with a fresh sense of equal responsibility and duty and with new structures in place to achieve our united goal of improving the world we live in for all our peoples .  
Social disintegration has increased , the vertical development of nuclear weapons has continued and civil wars and regional conflicts have broken out in most regions in a manner that has given the impression that the globe we live on has suddenly exploded .  
Notwithstanding the impressive achievements of the human race we are forced to live at the same time with unspeakable suffering that mocks all material and spiritual progress in which we might feel some pride as we approach the new century .  
Youth represent 18 per cent of the world population , that is , 1.01-billion persons between 15 to 24 years of age ; 84 per cent of these people live in developing countries and represent a challenge within the context of the economic and social crisis that rages in Africa , as well as representing the enormous potential on which the future of our continent is based . 
While on the subject of youth issues , we should refer to the importance of devoting special attention to the neediest categories of society , especially the handicapped and those who live in rural areas in which only basic services are available to the young , as well as the inhabitants of areas with particular difficulties , such as those under occupation and those afflicted by armed conflicts .  
To be young and live at the end of the twentieth century is to witness a process of constant change all over the world and , at the same time , to encounter a cruelly competitive cultural , social , economic and political reality .  
We are sure that these first 50 years are but the first stage in an unprecedented task that presents no other alternative , given that its chief goal that of assuring that we all live together in peace , as well as the comprehensive development of human beings can be attained only through disinterested cooperation among peoples .  
We constantly acknowledge that we now live in an era in which interconnected economic and social issues have assumed larger prominence on the international agenda , in which the call for cooperation across State boundaries to address these urgencies has intensified , and in which , as a result of our global interdependence , the need for vital , responsive and effective international institutions to address new demands is all the more imperative .  
The figures speak for themselves : some 1-billion people live below the subsistence level ; half of the world 's population may not have access to safe drinking water ; three quarters of the developing world do not have adequate sanitary facilities ; while at least 200-million people lack basic shelter .  
Those Governments that are thus accused of failure to live up to international humanitarian standards are subjected to unilateral arms embargoes imposed on them by the arms - exporting countries , whereas the perpetrators of violence who procure their weapons , perhaps from the very same sources , are never held accountable for their illegal and destabilizing activities .  
The conflict broke out because , contrary to the provisions on the consensus of the three constituent peoples of the Constitution of the former Bosnia and Herzegovina , and with the support of foreign entities , attempts were made to impose the concept of unitary constitutional order under which the Serb people would become a national minority and be forced to live under Muslim domination . 
Recognizing that the grave suffering of the great majority of human beings who live in conditions of poverty demands the immediate attention of the international community and the adoption of concrete actions and measures towards the eradication of poverty within the framework of relevant forthcoming United Nations conferences , particularly the World Summit for Social Development , and within the context of the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty ,  
The large and growing number of children who , due to rural exodus , extreme poverty , abandonment , as well as situations of violence within the family , are forced to live and / or work in the streets , are deprived of their fundamental rights and exposed to various forms of exploitation , is a matter of deep concern .  
The concept of sustainable development is based on the conviction that it should be possible to increase the basic standard of living of the world 's growing population without unnecessarily depleting our finite natural resources and further degrading the environment in which we live .  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole of the States in which such persons live ,  
The 1994 ECA " Economic report " confirms the continued deterioration in social and human conditions and the escalating absolute and relative poverty by pointing out that about 220-million Africans - almost half of the population in sub-Saharan Africa - now live in absolute poverty , unable to meet their most basic needs .  
We came to this Summit , rightly called the " People 's Summit " , convinced that the only genuine path towards a new civilization must be one centred on the human person , on the vigour of human dignity and the freedom of the human spirit , and on the inalienable right of the individual to live a full life guaranteed by the existence of universal social justice .  
In the Mission 's view , the laying of mines in places where people work , live or circulate constitutes a violation of this commitment and of the principles of international humanitarian law , since it puts the civilian population at unnecessary risk and there is no proportionality between the intended military objective and the foreseeable harm that may be caused to that population . 
The Mission believes that URNG has committed human rights violations and has failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population , by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting the " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines or explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals . 
Having been instigated by Belgrade to serve as an instrument in a genocidal campaign against their neighbours and having been influenced by an incessant anti-Croatian propaganda campaign from Belgrade , many of these ethnic Serbs - even though most are not personally responsible for the crimes committed - have decided to leave rather than face their surviving neighbours who are returning to live in the region .  
" Despite all our technological breakthroughs , we still live in a world where a fifth of the developing world 's population goes hungry every night , a quarter lacks access to even a basic necessity like safe drinking water , and a third lives in a state of abject poverty - at such a margin of human existence that words simply fail to describe it .  
Ensure that the rights of national minorities are protected , and that such groups are able to pursue economic and social development and live in circumstances of full respect for their identity , traditions , forms of social organization and cultural and religious values .  17 .  The Charter of the United Nations has provided a durable framework for the promotion and development of international law .  
The report also noted that URNG had committed human rights violations and had failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines and explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals . 
The Working Group also noted that these workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine human dignity , including forcing them to live separately from their spouse and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and strongly condemned practices of unequal treatment of migrant workers and the denial to them of minimum human consideration and dignity .  
In 1991 , the Bank issued a revised policy ( Operational Directive 4.20 ) , which extends the definition of indigenous peoples to include a much wider array of groups who maintain social and cultural identities distinct from those of the national societies in which they live , who have close attachments to their ancestral lands , and who are susceptible to being disadvantaged in the development process .  
NULLAs far as the situation in southern Sudan is concerned , hundreds of thousands of children continue to live in insecurity in the conflict zones , in danger of being abducted , exposed to lasting psychological trauma , or living in inappropriate conditions .  
Ensure that the rights of persons belonging to national , ethnic and other minorities are protected , and that such persons are able to pursue economic and social development and live in circumstances of full respect for their identity , traditions , forms of social organization and cultural and religious values .  
It presented the eradication of poverty as an ethical , social , political and economic imperative ( Declaration , Commitment 2 ) and stressed that societies must respond more effectively to the material and spiritual needs of individuals , their families , and the communities in which they live ( ibid . , para .  NULL  
Although the Turkish Cypriots now live free from Greek Cypriot harassment , oppression and terror , an inhuman embargo on their political , economic , social and cultural activity , imposed by the other side , continues .  
Ensure that the rights of persons belonging to national , ethnic and other minorities are protected , and that such persons are able to pursue economic and social development and live in circumstances of full respect for their identity , traditions , forms of social organization and cultural and religious values .  
Ensure that the rights of persons belonging to national , ethnic and other minorities are protected , and that such persons are able to pursue economic and social development and live in circumstances of full respect for their identity , traditions , forms of social organization and cultural and religious values .

Social services have an essential role to play in preventing the abandonment of rural areas and in seeing to it that services are available where people live and during the accelerated development of large urban areas ; they must ensure the functioning of infrastructure , such as roads and hospitals , built at high cost but threatened with collapse by a lack of will and of personnel able to maintain and manage them .  
The purpose of the process is to create an administration that can carry forward the implementation of democratic social and economic reforms ; an administration capable of utilizing all past experiences and of consistently and dynamically creating conditions for the well-balanced development of the country ; and , finally , an administration that will ensure that the burden of reforms is evenly distributed , that will care about improving the living standards of Polish families , and that will work to ensure that citizens can live in peace , free from the fear of crime and economic abuse .  
The lessons learned so far have proved that without supportive and predictable administrative and legal structures at all levels , and without access to public services particularly to a justice system the private sector and citizens would live in a state of uncertainty and insecurity , hindering the development of their full potential .  
Just as Israel has the right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries and free from threats or acts of force , as affirmed by Security Council resolution 242 ( 1967 ) , the territorial integrity , sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognized boundaries should also be strictly respected , in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions , including resolution 425 ( 1978 ) .  
We are all aware that we live in an age when political decisions can be influenced by the emotional power of visual images , whose instant , worldwide transmission has been made possible by rapid-fire advances in everything from satellite technology to personal computers .  
It is needless to stress that the elimination of poverty and the attainment of the broader goal of sustainable development will remain impossible to achieve unless nations show renewed political resolve to implement policies aimed at enabling humankind to better manage and live with its environment , as agreed to at the Rio de Janeiro summit and at subsequent Conferences .  
We do indeed live in a brutal and unjust world , where the astonishing developments in science and technology and our increasingly sophisticated knowledge base are not matched by the ability of Governments to marshal forces to overcome the social and economic inequities of their countries .  
With a population of fewer than 400,000 people of diverse ethnic and linguistic origins , 80 per cent of whom live in rural settings on hundreds of islands arrayed over 1,600 kilometres of ocean , no other system is workable .  
Indeed , 72 per cent of single heads of households , most of them female , live below the official poverty line , which simply implies a lack of access or limited access to basic social services , including food , sanitation , shelter , basic education and primary health care . 
First , in the health field , action is under way to reach the target of eliminating poliomyelitis ; salt iodization is being implemented ; the rate of maternal mortality has decreased from 143 in 1989 to 107 in 1995 for every 100,000 live births ; 93 per cent of all children have been vaccinated and immunized against hepatitis ; studies and evaluations have been made to supplement current child nutrition information ; and health plans have been drawn up to promote future health care .  
Because we are small and peaceful , and because we have a lengthy history , we bring to the United Nations a vision of the world that is patient and optimistic , and it is our belief that if we have lived in our territory without bellicose conflict for more than 700 years , the same is also possible beyond our borders , for , in the end , the men and women who live in Andorra are different from the rest of mankind only in their collective historical experience .  
This is because of the close interrelationship and joint interests among members of the international community and the common destiny that binds us together once we recognize that we live in a global village in which geographic borders can not protect others from the physical or mental effects of those problems .  
I am confident that this session of the General Assembly will live up to the expectations of Governments and the hopes of peoples : that all of us will take a new step in humankind 's difficult transition towards a world united in its diversity , a world that is open to universal economic and spiritual development , a world that promises security and stability a world in which States cooperate on an equal footing .  
New Zealand will make that commitment , because we are committed to building a strengthened and effective United Nations that is ready and able to tackle the challenges that lie ahead , and a United Nations system that is more internationally democratic and more representative of the world we live in as the century draws to a close .  
We are convinced that the adoption of this balanced draft resolution will be a timely signal of support for efforts to establish a Middle East whose peoples and Governments can live in conditions of good-neighbourliness , broad international cooperation and crucial economic development .  
Peace should have prevailed in the post-cold-war world , in which equal members of the international community should respect each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , refrain from invading each other or interfering in each other 's internal affairs , and live in harmony with each other , in a spirit of seeking common ground and putting aside differences .  
Several aspects can be determined which identify or refer to people living in poverty : although much attention is given to the problems of the urban poor , in many countries the poor most often live in rural or isolated areas ; they often have large families and low life expectancy ; they survive without benefit of many basic services ; they evidence a low level of participation in economic and political life ; they often lack the basic means for productive employment ; and they generally lack a sense of security in their lives .  
The vast majority of the people in developing countries live in rural areas , with daily nutritional intake below basic requirements , high infant mortality rates , shorter life expectancy than that in industrialized countries and limited or no access to safe water and sanitation . 
The current supply of energy to rural areas of developing countries where the bulk of the population live is inadequate ; there is therefore an urgent need to expand substantially the supply of energy , including rural electrification , to stimulate economic growth or at least help arrest , reverse and eventually eradicate poverty , which is rampant in these areas .  
In these cities and towns , large sections of the world 's urban population live in inadequate conditions and are confronted with serious problems , including environmental problems , that are exacerbated by inadequate planning and managerial capacities , lack of investment and technology , and insufficient mobilization and inappropriate allocation of financial resources , as well as by a lack of social and economic opportunities .  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole of the States in which such persons live ,  
" Micro-organisms " : bacteria , viruses , mycoplasmas , rickettsiae or fungi , whether natural , enhanced or modified , either in the form of " isolated live cultures " , including in dormant form or in dried preparations , or as material , including living material , which has been deliberately inoculated or contaminated with such cultures .  
As we move into the twenty-first century , we offer a positive vision of sustainable human settlements , a sense of hope for our common future and an exhortation to join a truly worthwhile and engaging challenge , that of building together a world where everyone can live in a safe home with a promise of a decent life of dignity , good health , safety , happiness and hope .  
In urban areas , it is the poor who most often are forced to live in dense squatter settlements characterized by unsanitary conditions , or near hazardous industrial plants .  
For the moment , he has observed that since its colonization , Colombia has experienced persistent racial discrimination : the indigenous population and Black people have been marginalized , and live in deplorable economic and social conditions - they are the poorest groups .  
All that the people of southern Africa are asking for now is a chance to live in peace so that they can address the myriad problems and challenges left unattended for decades by previous colonial and racist regimes in their region . 
In 1991 , the World Bank issued a revised policy which extends its own definition of indigenous people to include a much wider array of groups that maintain cultural and social identities distinct from those of the national societies where they live , have close attachments to their ancestral lands , and are susceptible to being disadvantaged in the development process .  
It is perceived as encompassing the principle of universality in health care , so that all human beings may live with the knowledge that they can seek health care which is accessible , affordable , relevant , and of the requisite quality .  
Health security covers all aspects of the right of every individual to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health , including the right to food in sufficient quantity and of good quality , the right to decent housing and to live in environments where known health risks are controlled , and the right to have access to education and information on health , rights that are enshrined in the various international treaties .  
However , some of the remaining internally displaced persons informed the Representative that they received almost daily visits from local officials , telling them that they were no longer entitled to live in public buildings and threatening them with eviction .  
The Committee is particularly concerned at the insufficient measures and programmes for the protection of the rights of the most vulnerable children , especially girls , children living in rural areas , children who are victims of abuse , children of single parents , children born out of wedlock , abandoned children , disabled children , and children who are , in order to survive , forced to live and / or work in the streets .  
The Committee recommends that special protective measures be implemented in relation to children living in rural areas , children who are victims of abuse , children of single-parent families , children born out of wedlock , abandoned , institutionalized and disabled children , children involved with the juvenile justice system , particularly when deprived of their liberty , children involved in child labour and children who , in order to survive , are forced to live and / or work in the streets .  
They can be used as a basis for designing programmes to improve the situation of children , particularly those belonging to the most disadvantaged groups , including disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children ill-treated and abused within the family , children who are victims of sexual exploitation , and children who are forced to live and / or work in the streets in order to survive .  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
From a technical perspective , to be compatible with the definition of long-term migrant proposed in paragraph 8 above , the stock of international migrants should include all persons who have ever changed their country of usual residence , that is , persons who have spent at least one year of their lives in a country other than the one in which they live at a particular point in time .  
The concept of health security encompasses all aspects of the basic rights to health : the right to freedom of choice and personal security ; the right to food in sufficient quantity and quality ; the right to live and work in environments where known health risks are controlled ; and the right to have access to education , information and decent housing .  
Revisions were made to improve data quality in the following items : ( i ) data on " children ever born " and " children living " should be collected by sex ; ( ii ) " date of birth of the last child born alive " was introduced to replace " live births within the 12 months preceding the census " to measure current fertility ; and ( iii ) " deaths in the 12 months preceding the census " was added to measure current mortality .  
That desire becomes even more urgent given that the boundless mind of man has produced numerous miraculous inventions , opening up a new era called the post-industrial era or the information age , while more than a quarter of the developing world 's population still lives in poverty , some 840-million go hungry or face food insecurity , and even in industrial countries more than 100-million people live below the poverty line and 37-million are jobless . 
A culture of peace will contribute to international cooperation for economic and social development and sustained economic growth in the developing countries of our world and permit the billions of dollars spent each year on armaments of death and mass destruction to be directed towards eradicating poverty , facilitating human development and making our world a better place to live in for all , developed and developing countries alike .  
We also urge them to institute national projects and programmes to meet the demand of international public opinion for promotion of the spirit of brotherhood , tolerance and love ; rejection of violence ; collective responsibility for guaranteeing fundamental human rights for all , regardless of nationality , race , or religious or ethnic affiliation ; and allowing peoples to live in peace and stability .  
Its programmes are geared towards providing Muslim children with information on Islamic culture and life , thus giving them the chance for a balanced understanding of their culture and the culture of the country in which they live , in order to enhance positive participation based on mutual understanding .  
The peri-urban poor live in the most hazardous environment where their health is at risk from exposure to toxic chemicals and pathogens from domestic solid wastes and human faecal wastes .  
Particular problems persisted for Turkey 's rural women in eastern and southeastern Anatolia , who continued to live in traditional social frameworks and were affected by an ongoing armed conflict and whose access to opportunities and services remained severely limited .  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
They can be used as a basis for designing programmes to improve the situation of children , particularly those belonging to the most disadvantaged groups , including disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children ill-treated and abused within the family , in institutions , or deprived of liberty , children who are victims of sexual exploitation , children belonging to minority groups , especially Roma , and children who , in order to survive , are forced to live and / or work in the streets .  
Recognizing the respect for the environment accorded by the cultures of indigenous peoples of the Americas , and considering the special relationship between the indigenous peoples and the environment , lands , resources and territories on which they live and their natural resources .  Recognizing that in many indigenous cultures , traditional collective systems for control and use of land and territory and resources , including bodies of water and coastal areas , are a necessary condition for their survival , social organization , development and their individual and collective well-being . . .  
In the preliminary report ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1995 / 14 ) to the Sub-Commission , the Special Rapporteur underlined that income distribution , both internationally and nationally , was the principal indicator of social integration and of the fulfilment of minimum requirements in respect of economic , social and cultural rights , enabling human beings to live in society . 
The Working Group decided that at its sixteenth session it would focus on the questions of the membership , participation in and mandate of a possible permanent forum , including issues such as equitable geographical distribution on the basis of where indigenous peoples live and the open and authentic representation of indigenous nations , peoples , organizations and communities .  
Expressing its serious concern that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights , in particular those of vulnerable groups in society , continue to be violated in many parts of the world and that millions of people still suffer misery , live in poverty and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ,

Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges the Government of the Sudan to provide adequate security for all special rapporteurs , and to live up to its pledge to provide logistical support to national , regional and international organizations to join the investigations of alleged cases of involuntary disappearance and slavery ;  
The aim of mine-action programmes , therefore , is not only technical - to survey , mark and eradicate mines - but also humanitarian and developmental - to create an environment in which people can live more safely and in which economic and social development can occur free from the constraints imposed by landmine contamination . 
Conscious of the fact that the physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development of the child , the future generation , depends on a safe , secure and adequate place to live , and that children are particularly vulnerable when deprived of an adequate standard of living in that respect ,  
Peace , security and disarmament are vital to a safe and secure planet , and the countless individuals who live daily in constant fear whether because of terrorists , hatred between ethnic groups , internecine warfare or religious persecution gives us much concern . 
In the sphere of collective security and the maintenance of world peace , although major catastrophes have been averted , the United Nations has not succeeded in making real the dream of every human being to live in peace in a world free from the pestilence of war and all the attendant horrors of human carnage and the senseless destruction of everything we hold dear .  
We share the basic premise that we live in a world of contradictions : integration and globalization coexist with fragmentation and marginalization ; computer science , while a source of progress , is also facilitating the expansion of transnational criminal networks , drug trafficking , money laundering and terrorism ; greater awareness of environmental problems is not accompanied by the political will to find satisfactory solutions ; and despite the strengthening of democracy , extremely serious violations of human rights continue to be committed .  
That outcome was averted thanks to initiatives taken and to the resolve of the Governments of Central America and friendly countries , which took the proper steps to find a negotiated political solution that responded to the aspirations of the Central American peoples , and in particular to the sovereign right of States to live in peace and freely to determine their own future free from any foreign interference in matters that are essentially within their internal jurisdiction . 
The European Union expects the Disarmament Commission to live up to expectations , and looks forward to working in a constructive and balanced manner in the coming weeks towards concrete results to guide future multilateral disarmament efforts . 
This peace was pursued on the basis of the mutual recognition of the legitimate rights of both peoples and their desire to live in peaceful coexistence and mutual dignity and security and to achieve a just , lasting and comprehensive peace settlement and a historic reconciliation through the agreed political process .  
The Brazil / Norway Workshop on Consumption and Production Patterns ( Brasilia , November 1996 ) concluded , among other things , that the role of advertising and the media is critical ; that the international community should apply the resources of the media to induce behavioural changes to avoid waste , inefficient resource use and conspicuous consumption ; and that positive messages of how individuals can live in a sustainable manner were required , instead of encouraging ever-rising material consumption or exaggerating the likelihood of environmental disaster .  
Further , where persons are displaced in circumstances which are consistent with international norms , they have a right to live in conditions in which basic rights to food , housing and health are secured , not to speak of reasonable social amenities and the enjoyment of all other basic rights to life , physical security and public freedoms .  
The only explanation seems to lie in the fact that Israel has realized that the Security Council is not prepared to live up to its commitments to stop aggression , thanks to the unqualified and continuous support of certain members who , at most and out of sheer embarrassment , express dissatisfaction with the atrocious Israeli practices in the occupied areas .  
It was the Greek Cypriot armed onslaught in December 1963 against the Turkish Cypriot people and the bi-communal order that led to division on the island when the Turkish Cypriot people were forced to live in enclaves , deprived of all basic necessities and fundamental human rights , for 11 years prior to the legitimate Turkish intervention of 1974 .  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
In the light of new and emerging challenges , faced with conflicting situations , the ordinary citizens of the world yearn for peace and security and aspire towards economic equity and participation in meeting their basic needs and an opportunity to live in comfort . 
They can be used as a basis for designing programmes to improve the situation of children , particularly the most disadvantaged children , including children with disabilities , refugee and internally displaced children , children ill _ treated and abused within the family and in institutions or deprived of liberty , children who are victims of sexual exploitation and children who live and / or work on the street .  
The Presidents agree that the peoples of the Russian Federation and Ukraine shall continue to live and work in peace and harmony , supporting each other at a crucial stage in their history , when they are carrying out , in their independent sovereign States , large-scale reforms with a view to establishing a democratic society and a State based on rule of law , with a socially oriented market economy .  
Particular problems persisted for Turkey 's rural women in eastern and southeastern Anatolia , who continued to live in traditional social frameworks and were affected by an ongoing armed conflict and whose access to opportunities and services remained severely limited .  
These challenges shelter and housing and the need to address urbanization both impact disproportionately and very severely on hundreds of millions of poor and disadvantaged people in nations large and small people who , mostly but not in all cases , live in the developing countries of our world ; people who are huddled in vast urban slums or in rural shacks ; people who lack not just secure work , but also such basic necessities as clean water , sanitation , waste disposal , safe transportation and even the most minimal green spaces to call their own .  
Noting that foreign migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
Disturbed that millions of women worldwide suffer from extremely poor housing and living conditions , including severe pollution , overcrowding , polluted water and inadequate sanitation , all of which give rise to serious mental and physical health problems and cause thousands of women to die , or to live in a permanent state of ill _ health ,  
The stories are heartbreaking doctors and nurses forced to live in the lobby of a closed hospital ; middle-class families who owned their own homes , sent their children to college , travelled abroad , now living by selling their possessions .  
These are activities which can clearly signal a commitment to address human rights issues and to build a society in which all can live freely and to provide a solid legal framework for economic development which will aid national and international investment .  
Education should enable the individual to live and work in a free society , and should promote mutual understanding , tolerance and friendship among peoples and racial , ethnic and religious groups .  
From 1963 , the Turkish Cypriots have been forced to live in scattered enclaves across the island under deplorable conditions , faced with harsh economic restrictions and besieged by hostile Greek Cypriot armed elements .  
Greek Cypriot political and military leadership issued provocative statements while air force and naval units engaged in manoeuvres , using live ammunition , which pronounced the element of offence in order to " capture occupied territories " .  
This vicious circle , which affects in particular the developing world , where more than 90 per cent of infected people live , has a huge impact on the future of our societies because most infected people are in their peak productive and reproductive years . 
They stressed that the current global environment provides a real chance to qualitatively improve the conditions of life for the vast majority of the people who live in poverty , and affirmed their collective commitment to the goal of eradicating poverty .  
One law worthy of note is the Environmental Protection Act of 10 December 1996 , one main objective of which is to defend the human right in environmental matters that is laid down in the Constitution : the right to live in a healthy environment ( article 37.3 ) .  
Education must offer the individual the opportunity to live and work in a free society , and must foster mutual understanding , tolerance and friendship among peoples and racial , ethnic and religious groups .  
It is the mission of culture and science to enable individuals to live in a free society , and to foster mutual understanding , tolerance and friendship among peoples and racial , ethnic and religious groups .  
They are constituted by a limited number of plant species which live under special conditions of shallow brackish water , needing regular inflow of freshwater ; they capture the sandy and loamy products resulting from the erosion of neighbouring land . 
The health of the ethnic minority women is undermined by multiple factors : lack of access to health services in the sparsely populated areas where they live , cultural and language barriers to effective contact with health staff , inadequate sanitation and nutrition , and low levels of education and information .  
The Office 's background investigations of targeted violence further confirmed the observations expressed in my previous report that the nature of violent activity in Kosovo , which has now spread to urban areas , has increased the number of persons who live in fear of being directly affected by violence or arbitrary treatment .  
The law on national education reflected the provisions of article 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by stipulating that education should be directed to the moral , intellectual and physical development of children and should provide them with the basic knowledge they needed to live in society and to have an impact on the countrys socio-economic situation . 
The question should be asked whether it is fair to collect the debt owed by the countries where these people live , which in many cases accounts for more than half of their limited revenues , while in the United States alone , $ 8 billion are spent on cosmetics , in the rich countries , $ 17-billion are spent on pet food and , worldwide , $ 400-billion are spent on narcotic drugs . 
Despite the fact that the majority of the worlds poor still live in rural areas , the rapid urbanization of the developing world has raised awareness of the problems associated with urban poverty , including increasing levels of slum housing , unprotected and informal employment , street children and child labour , crime , drug abuse and homelessness .  
The Law on Social Care and Provision of Social Security of Serbia defines the family in the following manner : for the purposes of exercising the right to material support the family is understood to mean the spouses or two people of different sexes , children ( born in and out of wedlock , adopted or foster ) and kinsmen in the direct line and in the lateral line up to the second degree of kinship , provided they live in a common household .  
Measures for the provision of primary health care are primarily geared to the promotion of health , to preventive health education activities and hygienic and epidemiological policies which are pursued at the level of the community and the municipality , where people live and work .  
One means of accomplishing this will be to disseminate , at the pace dictated by media deadlines , more live footage and quickly edited raw materials for television and radio in particular , including , where possible , audio-visual coverage of United Nations activities in major international developments in which the Organization is a principal player .  
Armed conflict in southern Sudan ruled out plans for the repatriation of refugees from Ethiopia and Uganda ; Somali refugees in Kenya were likewise unable to go back to their country of origin ; Sahrawi refugees continued to live in exile , waiting for a successful conclusion to negotiations on Western Sahara ; refugees from Burundi had to remain in the United Republic of Tanzania , where their presence was a major source of tension between the two States .  
It is in this framework and with these purposes in mind that Hungary expresses its strong desire to live side by side with a democratic Federal Republic of Yugoslavia at peace with its ethnic communities , respectful of all human rights , including the rights of national minorities , and thus ready to rejoin the community of nations .  
I believe that , given the overall state of our relations , we can move forward and embark with determination on the constructive and imaginative search for ways of settling the dispute concerning sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands , South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas in a manner guaranteed to preserve the way of life of the islanders and ensure the economic prosperity and social well-being of all who live in the South Atlantic .  
Consequently , the Special Rapporteur has already expressed the view that indigenous peoples , although they may constitute numerical minorities in a number of the countries in which they now live , are not minorities in accordance with United Nations usage and for the purposes of possible practical action on the part of the Organization . 24 / By the same token , ethnic and / or national minorities are not to be considered indigenous peoples in the United Nations context . 
As mentioned previously , and given the exclusive character that the term indigenous has in this context , other groups , minorities , ethnic groups or peoples who live alongside them on the territory of a present _ day multi _ national or multi _ ethnic African or Asian State _ whose ( sometimes aberrant ) frontiers are the result of a colonial situation , perhaps legally defunct but which continues to cast its shadow on the present _ would thus be excluded from this category of indigenous .  
Particular consideration should be given , in these cases , to the practical day-to-day consequences ( sometimes grave ) of the lack of such agreements for the juridical and political status of the peoples concerned in the mixed societies in which they now live , and for the preservation , promotion and effective realization of their historical rights as peoples , including their human rights and freedoms . 
These negative views were promoted daily and urbi et orbis by the most diverse methods ( scientific literature or simply by word of mouth ) and quickly became part of the conventional wisdom in large sections of the political and academic world , as well as for vast segments of the population at large , in the plurinational societies in which indigenous peoples continue to live today .  
At this point , the Special Rapporteur is prepared to offer , first , some general conclusions applicable to the issues of the study as a whole ; and then to provide more specific conclusions regarding the two main categories of currently existing situations in which indigenous peoples live in multi _ national societies : those in which treaties , agreements or other constructive arrangements exist , and those lacking such juridical instruments .  
For the same reasons , it is especially important to assess fully ( or to reassess ) , from the same point of reference , the relevance and potential utility of the quasi-juridical category of constructive arrangements for indigenous peoples still deprived of any formal and consensual relationship with the States in which they now happen to live .  
I would like in conclusion to express our readiness and sincere desire to work together with all other nations to build a peaceful world in which all people can live happy and productive lives , free from political , social and economic anxieties .  
The effective realization of the right to education provides an essential means of access to an adequate standard of living ; it ensures the access to knowledge required by individuals to develop all their faculties , to improve the quality of their lives , to take clear _ sighted decisions and to continue to learn , in order to live a dignified life within a democratic society .  
These needs comprise both essential learning tools ( such as literacy , oral expression , numeracy and problem solving ) and the basic learning content ( such as knowledge , skills , values and attitudes ) required by human beings to be able to survive , to develop their full capacities , to live and work in dignity , to participate fully in development , to improve the quality of their lives , to make informed decisions and to continue learning ( art . 1 , para . 
Afghan women live in fear for their lives , for they may be beaten to death for the slightest inappropriate conduct or for merely leaving a part of their body uncovered ; for example , a woman was recently stoned to death by fundamentalists for leaving one of her arms exposed while driving a motor vehicle ,  
Noting that migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine their human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
The Committee of Experts also stressed that one of the fundamental precepts of this Convention is that a relationship of respect should be established between indigenous and tribal peoples and the States in which they live , a concept which should not be confused with autonomy or political and territorial independence from the nation State .  
The developing economies where 60 per cent of the worlds elderly now live , rising to 70 per cent in 20 years are challenged to develop human and economic capital while strengthening the social capital of family and community security systems .  
For Latvia to succeed , and for the people of Latvia to have the full opportunity they deserve to live secure , healthy and prosperous lives , Latvia must be integrated into the political , business and intellectual exchange of the global community .  
Considering the care that has been shown by the ruling party to grant citizenship , and thus voting rights , to the " diaspora " ( ethnic Croats who live abroad ) , the Special Rapporteur places special emphasis on the rights of all those who qualify for Croatian citizenship , irrespective of ethnicity , and especially refugees , to claim citizenship in a timely manner , thus enabling them to participate in the forthcoming Croatian elections .  
Arms transfers and trafficking , and the resulting armed conflicts which they feed , are having a devastating impact on social , political and economic life for Africa south of the Sahara , a region endowed with natural resources but which still has pockets in which live the poorest people in the world today . 
Indeed , our continent is home to two thirds of the least developed countries and to three quarters of those at a low level of human development , and almost half of its inhabitants live in absolute poverty .  
I would like to emphasize that it was the Greek Cypriot armed onslaught in December 1963 against the Turkish Cypriots and the binational order that led to the division of the island when the Turkish Cypriots were forced to live in enclaves , deprived of all basic necessities and fundamental human rights , for 11 years prior to the legal Turkish intervention of 1974 .  
The settlement of the Saharan problem would be beneficial not only to the fraternal Saharan and Moroccan peoples but also to all the peoples of the region wishing to live in the Maghreb , to the attainment of domestic peace , to a unified , stable and prosperous Maghreb truly able to solve the countless complex problems arising in a world embarked on globalization .  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
You are , of course , aware of the economic embargo of the past nine years and of the fact that these years have been punctuated by constant military assaults , planned and carried out by the United States , targeting all aspects of life and based on the refusal of that country to allow the people of Iraq to live a life of dignity and exercise its free and independent will .  
Noting that , as the century draws to a close , the Central American countries have achieved significant progress towards the consolidation of democracy and good governance , the strengthening of civilian Governments , respect for human rights and the rule of law , and the promotion of State and economic reforms , sustainable development and regional integration , reflecting the desire of the Central American peoples to live and prosper in a climate of peace and solidarity ,  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,

The Declaration defines basic learning needs as : essential learning tools ( such as literacy , oral expression , numeracy , and problem solving ) and the basic learning content ( such as knowledge , skills , values , and attitudes ) required by human beings to be able to survive , to develop their full capacities , to live and work in dignity , to participate fully in development , to improve the quality of their lives , to make informed decisions , and to continue learning ( art .  1 ) .  
Taking the assessment made to its logical conclusion , the Special Rapporteur finds it inherently unjust that , while the actual perpetrators of the attacks have been punished with the full severity of the law , those who recruited , trained and hired them , supplied the materials and explosives , provided them with papers and paid them , are still at large and enjoying full impunity in the countries where they live .  
The health of ethnic minority women is undermined by multiple factors : lack of access to health services in the sparsely populated areas where they live , cultural and language barriers to effective contact with health staff , inadequate sanitation and nutrition , and low levels of education and information .  
Armed conflict in the southern Sudan ruled out plans for the repatriation of refugees from Ethiopia and Uganda ; Somali refugees in Kenya were likewise unable to go back to their country of origin ; Sahrawi refugees continued to live in exile , waiting for a successful conclusion to negotiations on Western Sahara ; refugees from Burundi had to remain in the United Republic of Tanzania , where their presence was a major source of tension between the two States .  
In this respect , Tunisia calls for international solidarity so as to put an end to the existing disparities between the rich and poor countries , between those with sufficient resources to provide their citizens with a happy old age and enough to live on , and those whose meagre resources are insufficient to meet adequately the many needs of their people , especially the elderly .  
In sub-Saharan Africa , half the population has no access to health care , 42 per cent of the adult population is illiterate , one third have a life expectancy of only 40 years and about 2-million deaths registered in 1998 were caused by AIDS ; 59 per cent of the rural population and 43 per cent of the urban population live in abject poverty , with an annual income of about $ 100 .  
It would be difficult to explain to the growing number of people who live in pockets of poverty throughout the industrialized world that in Copenhagen , four years ago , we decided to help them and integrate them into the framework of the tremendous social development that prevails in their countries .  
Their successful conclusion on the basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions will benefit the peoples of the region including the people of Cyprus , who live with the vision of a free , united and peaceful island , without foreign troops and barbed wire and with its people integrated and cooperating as they did for centuries in the past . 
As we stand at the threshold of the new century , let us rededicate ourselves to demining activities so as to give peoples the opportunity to live in an environment free from the physical , socio-economic and psychological traps these killers create and to ensure that those now living with the threat of landmines will have the chance to enjoy a peaceful and productive existence .  
Yet all these efforts have been frustrated by hostile and aggressive actions taken by the occupying Power , which , far from showing itself ready to negotiate , has continued its policy of illegal settlements and violation of international law and human rights of the Arab people who live the bitter reality of living under occupation .  
The Fourth Committee welcomed the outcome of the Third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , held in Vienna from 19 to 30 July 1999 , and it endorsed the practical benefits and potential offered in all areas of human activity by space technology , the peaceful application of which can contribute to increasing the quality of live and to sustainable economic and social development .

However , for those secondary school students who live in the Islands District , which covers an extensive area , the time required for travelling to some secondary schools within their school net but distant from their places of residence is often longer than that required for travelling to schools in an adjacent school net .  For example , it takes more time for students living in Tung Chung of Lantau Island to go to secondary schools on Ping Chau and Cheung Chau than to those in Tsing Yi , Kwai Chung and Tsuen Wan .

Let me emphasise that it is not our intention to target any single offshore gambling operation - in fact , in drafting this provision , we have considered whether the regulation of live broadcast of odds on TV and radio should be extended to all sporting events .  
However , we are mindful that in the absence of broadcast of odds on other sporting events at the moment , it may not be fully justified to extend the scope of the regulation to cover them .  We therefore proposed to confine the scope of the provision to deal with an existing problem , i.e . the live coverage of odds of unauthorised horse and dog races on TV or radio , because live broadcast of such information is obviously for the purpose of facilitating unlawful gambling activities .

Not every student can be lucky enough to live near hot mineral springs , of course , but every area offers opportunities to give students well rounded , mental and physical education .

In the process of economic development , the government should actively invest more in social welfare , and should , based on the particular circumstances of our country , learn from the experiences of more advanced countries and design a concrete program for the welfare of all the people , so that our citizens can live and work in safety and harmony , and the aged , weak , and handicapped can receive the care they need .  
Because the old Chinatowns , crowded and filthy , with their restaurants and souvenir shops , are located in the heart of city , Peter Kwong calls Chinese Americans living there " downtown Chinese " in distinction to " uptown Chinese , " who are professionals , drive nice cars and live in the suburbs .  
Such words ring only partially true , especially bearing in mind how often the ancients went astray in their observation of nature , as seen in their quaint notion that consuming cinnabar refined from metal and stone could make you live as eternally as those . Resting on the basis of Five Elements theories , no wonder the Eight Cyclical Characters divination method offers skeptics a field day .  
" I was unhappy working in Taipei and felt the farther from the crowds I lived the better for me ; it was the only way to find harmony and emotional balance , " he says . The simpler way of life in the countryside helps filter out distractions and clarifies your thoughts . His rooms and garden are furnished with antique tables , chairs , vases and knickknacks picked up outside . " City life is too materialistic , and often makes us forget how to live alongside nature . "  
The activities of his life after that time have been rather like a search to prove the truth of this ideal . Of course the idea of a global family is a beautiful one , but Needham 's mission to prove the scientific merits of Chinese culture could not live comfortably with the arrogant idea of Western superiority that had come down from the seventeenth century . When the first volume of Science and Civilisation in China was published in 1954 , Needham 's humanistic aspirations were still confronted by two established bodies of opinion .  
In Mogi , just an hour 's drive from Sao Paolo , he met an old friend of his - - Tsai Chang-luan , an expert in herbal medicine - - and several fellow Szechwanese who owned farms there .

To encourage people to participate and understand that bats are nothing to be afraid of , they set up bat-appreciation spots . These are places where people can go near the mouth of a cave in the evening and see one of nature 's most spectacular and lively sights - - bats leaving the roost . The societies also teach people how to build bat feeders to attract suburban bats and allow them to happily live in a human environment .  
Feeling illegal : There are more mainland spouses here illegally who have n't been exposed by the media .

Today , agricultural villages are in a period of transition . The elderly are not accustomed to living with their children in the crowded cities , and they 're unwilling to live in old folk 's homes .

Lin Shan-le , who came to Taiwan to live with relatives , and Li Lan , a student at Hsinpu Junior College , praise " 800O miles " for its deep and fertile subject matter and for daring to tackle sensitive issues . That lover of dramas Ma Yu , on the other hand , believes that " 8000 Miles " goes too far in directly judging mainland trends and cross-strait relations . Sometimes , she says , it has a sneering or glibly debasing tone that makes it more difficult for her to accept .  
It 's the place which bore and suckled us . . . we are bound to her not only by understanding , but also by life and emotion . . . no matter how her lofty mountains and sparkling waters may be despoiled , her deep human intimacy diluted , as long as we live on this island of Taiwan , she will always be home to our spirits , " Su Wen-kui , editor of the periodical Hu Wei Chieh wrote in an article .  
The last generation faced problems getting by day to day , therefore they only ask that life be stable and they are satisfied .

Her father wanted her to go back to their hometown after she graduated from college to teach and live a quiet life . But for her a challenging , stimulating , diverse life was much more attractive .  
His eldest daughter Chung Yu-ching retorts that there is less and less field work to be done , and at home appliances have taken over many tasks formerly done by hand , so it 's impossible to insist that modern women live like those in the past . In Taiwan , young people share a common backdrop to their upbringings , a common language , and a great deal of information . The impact of traditional family education is waning , and can not overcome social values , schooling , and peer interactions .  
Land is state property , and most people live in homes owned by their work units , so that these can not serve as collateral for " start-up capital . " Another reason why private enterprise is having a hard time burgeoning is because " government policy is tilted in favor of foreign and Taiwan investors . " It is still up in the air whether or not the mainland can duplicate Taiwan 's development experience .  
In the coastal regions of every Asian country along the western Pacific ocean live large numbers of marine turtles , but many of the islands where they are distributed lack reliable monitoring and protection . Sea turtles have even gotten innocently embroiled in local wars or been negatively affected by the capers of private individuals . For this reason international conservation groups intend to devote the year 1995 to the West Pacific Marine turtle , hoping to encourage research and protection of marine turtles in this region .  
Q : After you came back , you devoted yourself to encouraging talented people from Taiwan who now live overseas to return home , and you established the Foundation for Development of Outstanding Fellows .

When the movie Eat , Drink , Man , Woman by ROC director Ang Lee had its international release recently , audiences in Europe and America were astonished by what they saw . In the picture , Lang Hsiung is a renowned master chef whose feats include killing a live fish with a jab from his chopsticks and inflating a Peking Duck with his mouth . For audiences in Taiwan , impressed with his skill , the only doubt was whether or not it will lead to us being described abroad as " cruel . "  
On the next outdoor shoot he was confronted with another group of indigenous people who were facing an even more pessimistic , miserable fate than the city 's construction site aborigines . They live in illegal buildings which are soon to be torn down . This time , he put aside his natural feelings of sympathy for his compatriots , and conducted his story carefully with a cool heart . Although still in a terrible mood , he shed no more tears .  
The places to which they have scattered are unusual , as well . Some live high up at the Sun Yat-sen Hall atop Yangming Mountain , and some live down low near Keelung Harbor . Some can be found in tightly guarded army ammunition factories , and in nuclear power plants . Several generations of students and teachers meet to have fun together , and everybody feels as close as one big family .  
Fan applies the differences in the value systems of men and women that psychologists have uncovered to the news media . She notes that , compared to men , women are less likely to be concerned with winning and losing ; women are more concerned with process . Women also do not like abstract and obscure theories , but prefer to see stories about the human side of things - - about how people live their lives . Women are no less interested in ordinary people and disadvantaged groups than they are in the powerful and successful .  
Twenty years ago , our not-so-affluent society expressed its sympathy with actions , and enabled the two-year-old Siamese twins to live on through highly sophisticated surgery , growing up to be the two bright youths of today . Can the society that prides itself on economic accomplishments exert its collective power to help them over their many future hurdles ?  
In fact , outside the charmed circle of leading business families are large numbers of ethnic Chinese whose forebears came as laborers , and who still live at a low economic level with limited educational opportunities , just like the rest of the population . For many young women from this background , marriage is a means of escape from a life of poverty .  
On an ordinary day , however , the couple live very much at peace . They pass their time wandering about the compound , sleeping , bathing , and enjoying breakfast and dinner , which they receive at set times every day . The memories of war have already faded in the distance .  
" In the past , society was very closed , and it was hard to get information , so people really respected their professors , " says Lin Chin-chuan . Now we live amidst an information explosion , with rapid development of all forms of media . Teachers are no longer the only source of knowledge . Naturally the paternalistic , god-like authority they enjoyed in the past has declined , and it has become necessary for them relate to students on a more personal level .  
Chen 's effort to lose weight only succeeded because she was properly motivated . She broke through psychological barriers , and she developed an understanding of the idea that " I want to live well for myself , and make myself into a more disciplined individual . " By the end she had even gained control over her past bad habit of " eating snack food and smoking whenever I felt sad . "  
Fifty years of a common destiny forged in fortune and misfortune have united us all into a closely bound and interdependent community . The first-ever popular presidential election has reconfirmed our collective consciousness that we in Taiwan have to work together as one . How to make this land of ours more beautiful and how to make its inhabitants feel safer and live a happier and more harmonious life is the common responsibility of our 21.3 million people !  
Fiddler crabs of the species Uca borealis have an unusual choice of habitat : they live on muddy sandflats . Though their huge claws are beautifully colored and impressively shaped , they are not very mobile , so it seems they are there just for show - - to scare others off - - and not do any harm .  
It 's not that I 'm hard to scare ( God has given me an adrenal gland , which is His way of telling me to be scared ) . It 's just that I react slowly to authority , and although I am afraid , neither being assassinated , nor being arrested , nor being jumped in a dark alley is a threat to me anymore , because how many more years do I have to live anyway ?  
Tall and handsome , young and enchanting , they nevertheless frequently go through an entire year without seeing the light of day . They sleep during the day and go out at night . They live only indoors , underneath light-bulbs , and for this reason , when one pays close attention to them , their faces always seem a little pale , their voices are scratchy , and faint bags can be seen under their eyes . . . .  
It is an historical asset that is part of the collective memories of the people who live in Taiwan , and also provides living instruction about the history of railroads here , and could also be a concrete way for the government to show their concern for Taiwan 's native culture . " It has more meaning from the perspective of cultural preservation and education . "  
According to the field interviews of cultural writer Ma Teng-yueh , who has traveled extensively writing down the experiences of tattooed tribal elders , the Saisiyat live quite close to the Atayal , and the reason they started tattooing their faces is " the inevitable result of protecting themselves against a stronger enemy . " Therefore , in actuality , among all the indigenous peoples , only Atayal have the inherent custom of facial tattooing . That is why the Qing Dynasty documents usually referred to Atayal as " qingmian fan " ( " tattoo-faced barbarians " ) .  
Along with the evolution of time , the untoward condition of indigenous society has made many of these " facial tattoo treasures " lose the shelter of their younger relatives , due to alcoholism and other problems . Among the medical records of the tattooed old folks of Tai-an Rural Township , quite a few have an impoverished family and live long-term in unhygienic environments . A couple even live alone . Although most of them are taken care of by their relatives , chronic diseases of old age constitute a heavy burden on their children .  
Sogyal Rinpoche is the spiritual heir of an ancient lineage of teachers reaching back several centuries . But he has lived for many years amidst modern society , which is rich in material assets , but whose people are confused and perplexed . In his eyes , most people misuse life and misunderstand death : " Death in fact is a great opportunity . Only when we understand death can we know how to live . "  
It was n't that I had no interest in reading it , but rather was unable to get away from the constant stream of daily activities that keep me busy . Then , however , when I finally struggled through to the second chapter , I read about the idea of " active laziness . " Rinpoche says : " Our lives seem to live us , to possess their own bizarre momentum , to carry us away ; in the end we feel we have no choice or control over them . "  
He observes that according to statistics , nearly 13% of people in the US have some sort of mental disorder . This clearly illustrates the famous words of Jesus Christ : " Man does not live by bread alone . " The ancient religious practices of meditation and contemplating the impermanence of life can positively help modern people , who are undergoing immense changes in social relations and also witnessing rapid transformations both at work and their private lives .  
" They are an important reminder to Taiwan 's society to open its eyes and see the poor and the weak among us , " says Li Chia-tung , Dean of Providence University and a one-time volunteer in a Calcutta hospice . He feels that people , especially people who live in self-proclaimed wealthy and civilized countries , love beauty and do their best to avoid seeing ugly and painful things . This even includes many who work in the field of religion .  
Twenty years ago , people watched Taiwan 's Little League teams fighting for glory abroad on late night TV . A few days ago , people stayed up all night watching a live marathon program , directed by and starring a major criminal . Then came the elections for county and city executives . After the excitement generated by political " stars , " the victory of the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) has rewritten the political map of Taiwan .  
Activities on the tour included both highly refined traditional live budaixi and contemporary TV budaixi . HEPP wisely invited ethnologists-who have wide connections in the field of traditional culture-to organize the event . As a result , virtually all the major puppet theater families from all over Taiwan were brought together . In the world of budaixi , where each " school " carefully distinguishes itself from its competitors , this was truly unprecedented .  
Juju Wang , an associate professor of sociology and anthropology at Tsing Hua University , notes that all of the central government agencies are located up north in Taipei . The city has two-thirds of the island 's universities , over 90 percent of the corporate headquarters , and over 90 percent of its media . The magnetic draw of Taipei has made it an over-loaded city with a deteriorating environment - " a poor place to live amid great wealth . "  
In contrast with today , when wild ducks live on river beds choked with stinking organic chemicals and strewn with styrofoam and other plastics , in written records from the past the ducks suck up red algae , delve beneath green lotus leaves , wash themselves with dew and live among clouds and mists .  
The world has indeed progressed . The hasty passing of half a century has seen an improvement in material conditions , people live longer and have more to eat . Yet the most contagious disease of the late twentieth century has become " hard work . "  
The winning songs included last year 's best sellers like " Sister " by A-Mei , " Faye Wong " by Faye Wong and Wu Bai 's " Summer Night Wind " live album . What was exciting to people in the music business was that the diverse music of new alternative artists like Chang Chen-yueh , Faith Yang , Luan Tan , The King of Kinmen and Lee Ping-hui , and David Tao was also recognized , which illustrated the vitality of the pop music scene in Taiwan .  
Of course , the quality of nursing homes is very uneven , which accounts for much of seniors ' unwillingness to live in them . Yet at a basic level seniors still hold traditional notions about children caring for their parents in old age , and feel that they will lose face and a sense of security if they are apart from their children . Children , meanwhile , bear similar psychological and social pressures . Indeed who , if sufficiently able , would choose to " drop " the care of one 's parents onto institutions ?  
Life in a foreign land requires major adjustment . As Taiwanese senior citizens immigrate to the US to live with relatives during their twilight years , this process is filled with tears and struggle , but also brings to light their considerable resourcefulness .  
" The majority of Taiwanese senior citizens in the US come here to live with their grown children , who mostly have master 's or PhD degrees , and are ' suburban Chinese . ' Because the homes of their children are spread out in middle - and high-class residential areas , unlike members of self-contained urban Chinatowns , elderly Taiwanese suffer great inconvenience if they are unable to communicate in English , " says Peter C . Lee , associate vice-president of the Office of Faculty Affairs at San Jose State University in California .  
As the structure of families and communities changes , the old intimate relations where one would raise the young and care for the old amid the sounds of cocks crowing and dogs barking have been replaced by cold impersonal relations in the urban sea of concrete buildings . As a result , many women have been confined to live lonely lives in their communities .  
But sadly life is an inescapable obligation , and King Mu had not finished his duties here below . As he left , the Queen Mother 's parting words to him were : " Though the peaks stand as high as the clouds , you crossed mountains and rivers to come from the distant east ; may you live to be a hundred , and may we meet again . "  
By the same reasoning , qi which condenses with sufficient harmony may be unchanging and maintain its form eternally . Humans live between heaven and earth , and can participate in the processes by which heaven and earth are nourished and life created and changed . The Yi Jing ( Book of Changes ) lays great stress on the continuous burgeoning of life within the vast universe . Thus we can see that there is a historical background to the continuous emergence of ideas concerning elixirs of immortality and fairylands peopled by immortals .  
The fairy realms portrayed in literature have many established features . A common plot element is that if a visitor to fairyland stays there , he can live there as an immortal forever . But usually the hero is stricken with homesickness and leaves ; once back among the distracting , vulgar pleasures of the mortal world , he never finds his way into fairyland again .  
Zhuangzi ( Chuang-tzu ) states that if one 's view of the world is clouded by preconceptions and expectations , then it is impossible to live beyond the physical limitations faced by ordinary human beings , for one is not living in harmony with the " Dao " of the universe .  
From Laozi it borrows the concepts of non-action , clear understanding , and acting in harmony with nature . From Zhuangzi come the concepts of total freedom and life-for-the-fun-of-it . Combining these concepts , religious Daoism holds that in order to become an immortal , one must be free of joy and anger , eliminate desire , live in quietude and non-action , maintain primitive simplicity , and act in harmony with the natural laws of the universe .  
People have long been aware of the educational and recreational functions of museums . But now the global trend is toward moving the focus of museums away from the elite to the general public , and relating them more closely to the lives of the people who live nearby . From elite to mass  
If the star is successful , the program pays for the person 's desired prize ; otherwise , the person 's hope is left unrealized . The format of this segment resembles the old show Loving Heart , which encouraged people to help some unfortunate . But the new program has an even more direct emotional appeal insofar as it cuts in live shots of the reactions of the hosts and audience members , sometimes zooming in on the superstar celebrities as they weep .  
Although investigation of the relationship between climate and infectious diseases is still at a preliminary stage , excessive human development of jungles and rainforests has increased people 's chances of coming into contact with the microorganisms which live there , and with their natural hosts .  
Chen Hao-yung of the NIPM says that once a virus develops into an urban virus it becomes very hard to eradicate . Viruses are very simple in structure , and as long as they have live cells to act as their hosts they can continue to reproduce . Hence cities , which have dense human populations and also harbor large numbers of rodents and other pests , are perfect breeding grounds for viruses .  
In fact , some experts feel that since most enterovirus cases in Taiwan are in rural areas , it is still the result of poor hygiene . Nonetheless , it is also true that children today live too cleanly : they lack natural sources of infection in their environment , so that when they do meet with a virus they are quite unable to fend it off .  
If you can get them breathing and their hearts beating again , you 've always got a shot at saving them . " But the use of CPR , which was originally intended for saving lives in medical emergencies , has been commandeered by the extend-life-at-all-costs philosophy of the modern medical era . Whether or not their illnesses are curable , if patients can be made to live another day , another hour , or even another minute , all efforts are made to save them .  
These included " fish souls , " made from the lips cut from live sturgeon ; " Xi Shi 's bosom , " made with white fat from pufferfish bellies and named after a famous beauty ; and the " gold soup and jade slices " served by Mrs . Song outside Qiantang Gate , which comprised a thick wild rice stem soup and sliced raw common carp and crucian carp .  
Taiwan 's estuarine shellfish live on plankton and organic matter , and heavy metals accumulate in their bodies ; the fleshy parts such as the foot and adductor muscle can still be eaten , but the central viscera are best left alone . " Even the ' best ' seafood today is n't fit to eat , " writes Lin Ming-yu , a reporter with the Min Sheng Pao newspaper , lamenting the difficulty of finding good seafood in Taiwan .  
Many Takasago Volunteers who survived the cataclysm of the war returned to live under a " new dynasty , " the ROC , and found that their formerly Japanese-speaking world had suddenly become a Mandarin one . The language of the broadcast media had changed overnight , along with the dominant ideology . As time went by , their children and grandchildren grew up under the educational system of the nationalist government , completely different from the system during the Japanese era , and the ex-Volunteers became a lonely , lost group .  
At a time when other groups have achieved heightened visibility and have succeeded in winning general acceptance of their need to preserve their rights , the Hakkas are still saddled with the same old stereotypes they 've always had to live with-invisible , docile , conservative , impassive . . . . Hakka activists have to take to the street to get their own people to adopt a bit of a higher profile . A quick glance at the ranks of society 's post-martial law political and business leaders is revealing .  
Viewing this demographic shift within its proper historical context , however , sheds a different light on the issue . Water resources were seldom located in the plains ; rather , they were most accessible along the middle reaches of rivers . This was a key reason why Taiwan 's early Hakkas chose to live in the hills .  
Yu Shui-pei , a researcher at the Academia Sinica 's Institute of Earth Sciences , is intimately acquainted with the wriggling , writhing ways of this island we live on . In 1990 he began installing sensitive instruments around the island to measure their precise positions using a satellite positioning system .  
When Tiway Sayion retired from his position as principal of Hualien 's Tafalong Primary School after a teaching career that spanned 45 years , his first act was to realize a long-cherished dream-he returned to the tribal community where he was born and built a cabin in which to live . Tiway Sayion 's simple 20-ping cabin is laid out with the kitchen and bathroom on the right and the bedroom on the left . The center is his living room , furnished with only a sofa and bookshelves .  
Last year the Buddha 's Light International Association organized New Year 's Eve dinners in the north , center and south of Taiwan , which were attended by more than 5,000 old folk who live alone . This year they are repeating the exercise , and are including a special event in Nantou County to bring some warmth and love to elderly survivors of the 9 / 21 earthquake there .  
Mainland China shares the same language as Taiwan and it offers attractive investment conditions . It would be surprising if it did n't attract Taiwan firms that are eager to set up offshore . Amid the cross-strait political standoff , one can expect that Taiwan firms in Dongguan will continue to live out this exciting tale of gain and loss .  
What about the three main candidates ? Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party , which advocates Taiwan independence , produced a long and detailed white paper on China policy , which offered some changes and reservations to the independence position . But , in an unguarded moment , Chen also declared " Long live Taiwan 's independent sovereignty ! " and this comment has left many people uncertain which is the real Chen .  
Apart from consolidating democratic achievements , promoting government reforms , and raising economic competitiveness , the new government should , as its foremost objective , closely watch public opinion and implement reforms accordingly , so that the people on this land can live with more dignity , greater self-confidence and a better quality of life .  
It seems they have n't realized yet that they may live to be 85 . They have n't made any preparations for living expenses , vacations , or the enormous medical expenses that can be expected over the next 25 years . " She has encouraged her parents to put part of their savings into a mutual fund or the like , but without success . Indeed , the issue has become a sore point between her and her mother .  
He had so little money that while on the road he had to live out of his van and bathe in mountain streams , but his unflagging enthusiasm has now made the indefatigable Lin an expert on Taiwan 's aquatic plants . He has closely examined and measured their roots , stems , leaves , berries , and petals . He knows what kind of conditions are preferred by each species . He knows that the lantern seedbox , tropical sundew , and primrose willow are at their prettiest between six and nine in the morning .  
And now the tragedy at Pachang Creek , when millions of viewers saw four people swept to their deaths on live TV . Once again , the public is left feeling hurt and angry . And the question is raised : Are incompetence and inefficiency endemic within the structure of our bureaucracy ?  
He illustrates his point by mentioning Straight Ahead with a Rifle , in which Dong continually returns to the image of a bombing range , communicating how it feels to live next to such a place . It is a factor always on the minds of local residents . This repeated use of a single image is a very unusual technique , but it does n't bore the viewer ; on the contrary , it leaves one feeling that he has gained new insight into the subject of the documentary .  
This film returns time and again to images of patriotic slogans on local walls , highlighting the helpless feeling of knowing that the island one calls home has been chosen to serve as a battlefield . Homesick 2000 Meters shows how near the cities of Kinmen and Xiamen are across the water , yet how far apart their residents live due to political reality . The empty scenes in this documentary highlight the longing for home of a people cut off from their roots .  
Where I live in northwestern Switzerland , small municipal refuse bags , which hold 17 liters , cost around NT $ 30 each . Even the largest size of bags only hold 110 liters , yet cost NT $ 108 . This is definitely much more expensive than in Taipei City , but I 've never heard anyone complain that the bags are too dear . I think this is because they do a good job of reducing and separating their waste .  
The mainlanders have introduced the cuisines of their home provinces and a longing for the old country . Likewise , the attitudes of civil servants loyal to the KMT have also taken firm root in Taipei . What 's more , a larger proportion of Hakkas live in Taipei than any place ooutside of their traditional bases in the countryside , and the city also has a large community of aborigines . With this population structure , the Taiwanese chauvinism so prevalent in southern Taiwan is rather rare in Taipei .  
For Cegaw , winning an award for something so close to his heart and home is " something I 'll never forget as long as I live . " In fact , though members of the tribe were enthusiastic about participating in the competition , even Cegaw thought that many other sites were better , and that the chances of a prize were remote . Residents were astonished by the news that the site was named as one of the 100 to get through the preliminary round .  
There were more rock concerts played by more local bands and attended by more fans than ever before in Taiwan this summer , and record companies have now had to introduce new categories for their CD output , such as pop bands , underground bands and live concerts . The most popular band at the moment , Mayday , this year sold 200,000 copies of its second album Long Live Love , which is a remarkable amount given the otherwise sluggish market .  
Yeh Wen-chi emphasizes that the natural history of each dragonfly species is unique , and it is hard to generalize . For instance , the protected giant spiketail only breeds once in three years . It does not fit the general pattern of insects which live fleeting lives and may produce several generations a year .  
Most of Taiwan 's venomous snakes live in low-altitude farmland and sparsely populated countryside . But the hundred-pace viper , which was never very numerous , is at home in densely forested areas at low to medium elevations in the mountains of eastern , central and southern Taiwan . It grows to one-and-a-half meters or more-much the same length as the habu and cobra-but being far thicker and meatier it is much valued by gourmands .  
At the age of 50 , some people already have grandchildren at their knee , while others are getting married for the first time . With more and more people remaining single , rising divorce rates , growing numbers of unmarried mothers , increasing occurrence of infertility , and the emergence of large numbers of families where husband and wife live in different cities , or even-as for many expatriate Taiwanese business people-in different countries , many middle-aged people 's carefully laid life plans have suddenly come to nothing .  
Moreover , environmental protection work touches on things like community consciousness , the livelihood of farmers and fishermen , and aboriginal culture . Often the main obstacle to environmental protection work is the attitudes of people who live in the mountains and depend on the resources there . Thus environmental protection is not simply the responsibility of a few social elites , but includes economic , social , transportation , and even diplomatic and political aspects .  
" They live mixed in with greater crested terns , and this makes them really difficult to pick out . But in our film they do show up very clearly , " says Liang Chieh-te , who was commissioned to film greater crested terns by the Lienchiang County Government . The greater crested tern is around 45 centimeters long . Its most distinctive features are that it has a forked tail like a swallow , a crest of black feathers on its head rather like a Mohican haircut , and a yellow beak .  
" It 's been no easy task searching for a suitable place to live , and we eventually had to make the leap all the way from western Taiwan to Hualien here in the eastern part , " says Chang . They lived in Lukang before , but when that place started to become affected by industrial pollution , they moved to Meilun in Hualien , where they rented a house .  
Seshui lies on the southwest side of Provincial Highway 21 , close to Tayen Tunnel , with Puli to the north and the famous scenic spot Sun Moon Lake to the south . The neighborhood has an area of something over 60 hectares , and 230-plus inhabitants , who live by farming . Their main crops are vegetables such as aubergines and beans , and high-value cash crops such as betel nuts , orchids and Assam tea .  
The pair get married , but the Snake King arrives disguised as a local village girl and steals the magic feather . In the end , Wan Shi turns into a huge boulder to pin down the Snake King , while the egret goddess gives up her magic feather to save the island , which has been laid to waste . Thanks to the sacrifices of Wan Shi and the egret goddess , the people are able to live in peace once again .  
In seeking to answer this question , we poured our energies into building our economy , developing the so-called folk literature , and finding strength in the land where we live . In the process , we developed self-confidence . The severing of official diplomatic ties with the US in 1978 left us even further isolated from the international community , but we responded by redoubling our efforts and pulling together . A national consciousness began to take shape .  
Lo Liu-chih points out that the collared bush robins that live on the ground in the forest understory mainly nest on grassy slopes , where as well as being exposed to major airborne predators such as raptors and crows , they are also apt to attract the attention of land animals such as weasels and rock monkeys . " Large creatures like weasels , birds of prey or nutcrackers may be more sensitive to traffic , and more easily frightened by human activity , " says Lo Liu-chih .  
Commenting on this phenomenon , mainland Chinese cultural critic Xie Xizhang notes that the residential patterns of old Bei-jing were disrupted by the Cultural Revolution . High-ranking government officials used to live primarily on the east side , and the area had a very cultured air . Rich merchants congregated on the west side , while the south side was the plebian part of town .  
In addition to books , his store sold music , doubled as an art gallery , and brought in live performances . With unfinished wooden floors , whitewashed walls , and comfortable seats , the store gave customers an ideal place to lounge and look through the books .  
Yet , whether or not the adjustment of the ratios was professional and fair , the government 's entire funding pie had not grown larger , so if more was going to the 23 counties and cities , that meant the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung would have to learn to live with less . Not surprisingly , the new plan met with fierce opposition in both cities .  
Busy as a bee just to make a living , rushing ahead out of fear of falling behind . In the midst of the hustling e-generation , when competition has become the key in which our lives are orchestrated , and pressure has become a constant , how to put one 's heart at ease and live care-free ? Although trendy prescriptions are legion , some have discovered that returning to the ancestral practice of Chinese calligraphy-using a brush-is modern man 's most " soothing " remedy .  
This year , someone who had a lucky year over the previous year offered the temple 230 taels ( 8.6 kilos ) of gold . The temple decided to break up that amount and make a family of one large and three small golden turtles which would be open to qigui for the public . In front of the temple they even built a clever little landscape garden where the four golden turtles can live a leisurely existence .  
According to interpretations of the Avatamsaka Sutra , our universe is formed of pearl-like individual objects strung together in a net , so that it is difficult to separate what is real from what is illusion ; past , present , and future exist side-by-side ; and no individual can exist in isolation . As a result , people should live in the present , embrace goodness and do good deeds , so that the universe will tend toward harmony .  
In two years of volunteer life , I made sure that I lived each day to the fullest , for this was a most precious life experience . By living in such a destitute environment , I was able to get a taste of life 's many possibilities . I experienced every possible form of culture shock . I learned how to lighten up and lead a simple life , how to work diligently , and how to make the best of my situation and peacefully live life one day at a time .  
It is a pity that , although Taiwan has attained democracy , it has yet to rationalize its public sector . Instead it is increasingly a " street vendor " culture , with fractious grassroots movements here and there , or just plain vulgar . This points to the necessity of us following the path of advanced nations and upgrading our domestic services . Taiwan must create a quality environment in which people want to live .  
Hsu Tzu-you , who has helped terminal cancer patients employing Chinese and Western folk medicine , has in recent years been a forceful proponent of preventative medicine . He states that the human body is a thing of marvel and mystery , explaining how the sympathetic nerve and the parasympathetic nerve help each other obtain balance . But now that people live very sedentary lives , they are constantly exercising their brains but little else .  
A third of Taiwan 's native fern species grow in the damp , shady forest , and endemic Taiwanese plants such as the Taiwan pleione orchid live here too . The ancient false cypresses are a paradise for epiphytic plants , with up to 80 species living on a single tree .  
Of course , now that these religious rituals have become tourist attractions , they have lost a lot of their awe-inspiring and intimidating nature . Indeed , with the many performance troupes that now participate , the night inspection has taken on a festive spirit similar to ordinary temple parades . Nonetheless , the ancient rituals and the chilling legends surrounding them still live on in people 's thoughts as they watch .  
Individuals all have their own particular cultural background and value system . For that reason , the idea that prospective mates should come from similar economic and social backgrounds is not medieval . Most books on marriage include detailed " compatibility " checklists covering everything from ethnicity to where the two people live , their economic standing and level of education , how they interact with their own families , their respective personalities , interests and health , and what they hope for out of life .  
The empress , noting Lei 's unusually delicate features , became worried that he might not live to old age , so she took a brush and wrote the Chinese characters for " eighty " ( �� K �� Q ) between his eyebrows to ensure longevity . But as soon as Lei rose to his feet , the two characters on his forehead became transposed to read " eighteen . " And so Lei Haiqing died at the tender age of 18 , still young and handsome .  
With these two types of sustenance , one material and one spiritual , naturally one can live a long time , " says Lu . In fact , as long ago as the Song dynasty , Su Dongpo had identified three major advantages of eating zhou : " It brings peace of mind , which contributes to well-being , it is easy on the stomach , which contributes to physical energy , and it saves money , which contributes to becoming wealthy . "  
Taken together , these two incidents suggested new possibilities about how people can live their lives . Both featured people who are known as " transgenders " - those who do not fit into traditional male-female gender patterns . Uncomfortable with their physical sex as determined by their chromosomes , they feel driven to change their outward appearance into one that their mind can identify with .  
In particular , the 23 November demonstration on the streets of Taipei by 120,000 farmers and fishermen drew the attention of the whole nation . It stole much of the thunder from the first round of live TV debates between the Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral candidates , which had taken place shortly beforehand . The lack of coordination between the presidential office and the cabinet , the voices of dissent against the central government from within the ruling DPP and the continuing political fallout from the cabinet reshuffle will inevitably impact the Taipei and Kaohsiung elections .  
Among the intergenerational developments raising eyebrows and causing debate at the time were the following : sons and daughters-in-law unwilling to live with their parents after marriage ; younger women leaving home to earn a wage and thereby shifting power in the relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law ; children demanding to make their own decisions about work and marriage ; and the government encouraging three generations to live together under the same roof . In short , the screws were loosening on many of the structures that supported traditional notions about filial piety .  
" Parents should set their kids free , and not just so as to lighten the burdens on their kids , " Lu says . " In the past , while putting all their expectations on their kids , parents stifled their own potential for growth . " He discovered that many seniors felt bitter upon entering old age and discovering that they could not live close to their children . It affected their mental outlook for the entire latter period of their lives .  
For example , some community workers in Hsiufeng Village in Luku Rural Township started a business with only NT $ 500,000 in capital to repackage Luku tea leaves in an elegant and appealing way , and by playing on the heartwarming story behind the sale of the tea : paying for the continued operation of a cafeteria for local elderly people who live alone .  
Whenever Huang Shu-hui thinks of the many cold winter evenings her mother spent in the homes of other people , huddled in front of the fire , she is moved to tears . This motivated her to be successful whatever the cost , so that her mother would never again have to live such a hard life .  
Anyone who has traveled to Kyoto is sure to remember the streets and alleyways lined with elegant and well-maintained traditional Japanese-style residences in which people still live . Strolling those streets one feels the spirit of Japanese literature . These spaces are perhaps unsuitable to financial calculations of their worth . But their value in terms of cultural history is something that even greater economic power could not buy .  
Because financial magazines from Taiwan are still a touchy subject in the mainland , as well as concerns about the ability of mainland editors and reporters to live up to the Commonwealth standard , they have started a new magazine . Last year they started publishing Dongfang Qiyejia in Shanghai , sourcing their launch issue 's content from the senior staff of Commonwealth , to make absolutely certain to produce a magazine just as high in quality as its Taiwanese counterpart .  
In a survey of the dreams of youth taken by Sinorama in December among 19 to 30-year-olds , nearly half ( 46.7% ) included " live as I please , free and unrestrained " as one of their life dreams , far beyond the second most popular choice of " a happy family life " ( 29.8% ) and the third of " a stable job " ( 26.6% ) .  
Unexpected was the fact that children very much hoped to live with their elderly parents and conform to the traditional model of filial piety in this regard , while the image they had for themselves in old age was rather untraditional . Future plans for almost half of them tended toward living with their spouses only or living alone ( 43.9% ) , and they also stressed economic independence ( 44.4% ) .  
Taiwan has a long history of live performance , from simple shows held in crude tents , to fancy choreographed acts with crystal stages and catwalks , and everything in between . Audiences have changed their preferences in step with the changing times . Different audiences have had unique preferences and enjoyed special interactions with certain stars .  
Eventually the detention center called for Wang Chang-li 's assistance . Wang 's kindly , smiling face and sympathetic ear washed away their hostility , and after hearing them plead their case , he encouraged them not to give up on life and to carry on appealing their sentences , to fight for their chance to live .  
The biggest drawback of this type of treatment is that it takes two to three years , which is more than most people can put up with . What 's more , desensitization is also a risky procedure , because allergy shots can in some cases have the opposite effect to that intended , and provoke asthma , allergic rhinitis , and even anaphylactic shock . Therefore , unless they suffer from a severe case of allergy , most people opt to wage a protracted war of resistance or even to live in peaceful coexistence with their allergy .  
In 2000 , the Yushan Weather Station expansion project was finally completed , with the original 100-square-meter wooden hut expanded into a 160-square-meter steel frame structure with a sheet-metal roof . At the same time , new equipment , such as a live video feed system , was added . The number of photovoltaic panels and power storage batteries was also increased , as a result of which the power supply was improved .  
We live in an era of aesthetic sensibil-ity . The cultural economy and creative industries hold sway , and aesthetic sensibility has become a key determinant in individual , business , and national achievement .  
In countries where urbanization has taken place at a rapid pace , urban stress affecting human health , particularly that of the urban poor who live in unserviced areas and often make a living from collecting solid wastes , has increased .  
In 1996 , the Habitat II conference on human settlements , the " City Summit " will discuss a programme of action designed to make urban areas , where the majority of the world 's population will live , safe , humane , healthy and affordable .  
Conscious of the fact that the physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development of the child , the future generation , depends on a safe , secure and adequate place to live ,  
The volume of assistance we offered was the highest , in terms of gross national product , because we wanted to live in a world dominated by justice , a world whose hallmark is human compassion , a world in which the privileged will reach out towards the underprivileged without strings attached .  
Because we live in that kind of economy a key part of our action to deal with the problems of development must , accordingly , be multilateral , and the key problem facing us , both multilaterally and in our bilateral , donor roles , is that within the global economy the gap between rich and poor countries , despite all efforts to resist this , has grown .  
It is an encouraging sign that the international community , through the United Nations , the OAU and the Commonwealth , is just as anxious as the National Provisional Ruling Council Government to see an early end to our destructive war so that our peaceful citizens may once again be able to live in an environment free of fear and anxiety and to engage in their ordinary daily pursuits .  
It had a crash programme to build a nuclear weapon in 1990-1991 ; it had weaponized live biological agents , including the deadly botulin and anthrax organisms , weapons never before used in warfare ; it produced a far greater quantity of chemical weapons , in more diverse forms , than it had previously admitted ; and it deliberately kept these documents hidden from the United Nations Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) , even as it was claiming that all information had been handed over .  
It is regrettable that today , as the United Nations celebrates its fiftieth year since the signing of the Organization 's Charter in San Francisco , many people in Africa continue to live under even harsher conditions of poverty , hunger , disease , civil war and natural disaster .  The plight of the African continent remains a major challenge for the emerging world order .  
As the world 's leaders gather here later this month to reaffirm our collective commitment to our founding Charter , let our fiftieth anniversary celebration also signal a new start for our Organization , a new beginning in which we will address the challenges to global security and development with a fresh sense of equal responsibility and duty and with new structures in place to achieve our united goal of improving the world we live in for all our peoples .  
Social disintegration has increased , the vertical development of nuclear weapons has continued and civil wars and regional conflicts have broken out in most regions in a manner that has given the impression that the globe we live on has suddenly exploded .  
Notwithstanding the impressive achievements of the human race we are forced to live at the same time with unspeakable suffering that mocks all material and spiritual progress in which we might feel some pride as we approach the new century .  
Youth represent 18 per cent of the world population , that is , 1.01-billion persons between 15 to 24 years of age ; 84 per cent of these people live in developing countries and represent a challenge within the context of the economic and social crisis that rages in Africa , as well as representing the enormous potential on which the future of our continent is based . 
While on the subject of youth issues , we should refer to the importance of devoting special attention to the neediest categories of society , especially the handicapped and those who live in rural areas in which only basic services are available to the young , as well as the inhabitants of areas with particular difficulties , such as those under occupation and those afflicted by armed conflicts .  
To be young and live at the end of the twentieth century is to witness a process of constant change all over the world and , at the same time , to encounter a cruelly competitive cultural , social , economic and political reality .  
We are sure that these first 50 years are but the first stage in an unprecedented task that presents no other alternative , given that its chief goal that of assuring that we all live together in peace , as well as the comprehensive development of human beings can be attained only through disinterested cooperation among peoples .  
We constantly acknowledge that we now live in an era in which interconnected economic and social issues have assumed larger prominence on the international agenda , in which the call for cooperation across State boundaries to address these urgencies has intensified , and in which , as a result of our global interdependence , the need for vital , responsive and effective international institutions to address new demands is all the more imperative .  
The figures speak for themselves : some 1-billion people live below the subsistence level ; half of the world 's population may not have access to safe drinking water ; three quarters of the developing world do not have adequate sanitary facilities ; while at least 200-million people lack basic shelter .  
Those Governments that are thus accused of failure to live up to international humanitarian standards are subjected to unilateral arms embargoes imposed on them by the arms - exporting countries , whereas the perpetrators of violence who procure their weapons , perhaps from the very same sources , are never held accountable for their illegal and destabilizing activities .  
The conflict broke out because , contrary to the provisions on the consensus of the three constituent peoples of the Constitution of the former Bosnia and Herzegovina , and with the support of foreign entities , attempts were made to impose the concept of unitary constitutional order under which the Serb people would become a national minority and be forced to live under Muslim domination . 
Recognizing that the grave suffering of the great majority of human beings who live in conditions of poverty demands the immediate attention of the international community and the adoption of concrete actions and measures towards the eradication of poverty within the framework of relevant forthcoming United Nations conferences , particularly the World Summit for Social Development , and within the context of the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty ,  
The large and growing number of children who , due to rural exodus , extreme poverty , abandonment , as well as situations of violence within the family , are forced to live and / or work in the streets , are deprived of their fundamental rights and exposed to various forms of exploitation , is a matter of deep concern .  
The concept of sustainable development is based on the conviction that it should be possible to increase the basic standard of living of the world 's growing population without unnecessarily depleting our finite natural resources and further degrading the environment in which we live .  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole of the States in which such persons live ,  
The 1994 ECA " Economic report " confirms the continued deterioration in social and human conditions and the escalating absolute and relative poverty by pointing out that about 220-million Africans - almost half of the population in sub-Saharan Africa - now live in absolute poverty , unable to meet their most basic needs .  
We came to this Summit , rightly called the " People 's Summit " , convinced that the only genuine path towards a new civilization must be one centred on the human person , on the vigour of human dignity and the freedom of the human spirit , and on the inalienable right of the individual to live a full life guaranteed by the existence of universal social justice .  
In the Mission 's view , the laying of mines in places where people work , live or circulate constitutes a violation of this commitment and of the principles of international humanitarian law , since it puts the civilian population at unnecessary risk and there is no proportionality between the intended military objective and the foreseeable harm that may be caused to that population . 
The Mission believes that URNG has committed human rights violations and has failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population , by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting the " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines or explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals . 
Having been instigated by Belgrade to serve as an instrument in a genocidal campaign against their neighbours and having been influenced by an incessant anti-Croatian propaganda campaign from Belgrade , many of these ethnic Serbs - even though most are not personally responsible for the crimes committed - have decided to leave rather than face their surviving neighbours who are returning to live in the region .  
" Despite all our technological breakthroughs , we still live in a world where a fifth of the developing world 's population goes hungry every night , a quarter lacks access to even a basic necessity like safe drinking water , and a third lives in a state of abject poverty - at such a margin of human existence that words simply fail to describe it .  
Ensure that the rights of national minorities are protected , and that such groups are able to pursue economic and social development and live in circumstances of full respect for their identity , traditions , forms of social organization and cultural and religious values .  17 .  The Charter of the United Nations has provided a durable framework for the promotion and development of international law .  
The report also noted that URNG had committed human rights violations and had failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines and explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals . 
The Working Group also noted that these workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine human dignity , including forcing them to live separately from their spouse and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and strongly condemned practices of unequal treatment of migrant workers and the denial to them of minimum human consideration and dignity .  
In 1991 , the Bank issued a revised policy ( Operational Directive 4.20 ) , which extends the definition of indigenous peoples to include a much wider array of groups who maintain social and cultural identities distinct from those of the national societies in which they live , who have close attachments to their ancestral lands , and who are susceptible to being disadvantaged in the development process .  
NULLAs far as the situation in southern Sudan is concerned , hundreds of thousands of children continue to live in insecurity in the conflict zones , in danger of being abducted , exposed to lasting psychological trauma , or living in inappropriate conditions .  
Ensure that the rights of persons belonging to national , ethnic and other minorities are protected , and that such persons are able to pursue economic and social development and live in circumstances of full respect for their identity , traditions , forms of social organization and cultural and religious values .  
It presented the eradication of poverty as an ethical , social , political and economic imperative ( Declaration , Commitment 2 ) and stressed that societies must respond more effectively to the material and spiritual needs of individuals , their families , and the communities in which they live ( ibid . , para .  NULL  
Although the Turkish Cypriots now live free from Greek Cypriot harassment , oppression and terror , an inhuman embargo on their political , economic , social and cultural activity , imposed by the other side , continues .  
Ensure that the rights of persons belonging to national , ethnic and other minorities are protected , and that such persons are able to pursue economic and social development and live in circumstances of full respect for their identity , traditions , forms of social organization and cultural and religious values .

Social services have an essential role to play in preventing the abandonment of rural areas and in seeing to it that services are available where people live and during the accelerated development of large urban areas ; they must ensure the functioning of infrastructure , such as roads and hospitals , built at high cost but threatened with collapse by a lack of will and of personnel able to maintain and manage them .  
The purpose of the process is to create an administration that can carry forward the implementation of democratic social and economic reforms ; an administration capable of utilizing all past experiences and of consistently and dynamically creating conditions for the well-balanced development of the country ; and , finally , an administration that will ensure that the burden of reforms is evenly distributed , that will care about improving the living standards of Polish families , and that will work to ensure that citizens can live in peace , free from the fear of crime and economic abuse .  
The lessons learned so far have proved that without supportive and predictable administrative and legal structures at all levels , and without access to public services particularly to a justice system the private sector and citizens would live in a state of uncertainty and insecurity , hindering the development of their full potential .  
Just as Israel has the right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries and free from threats or acts of force , as affirmed by Security Council resolution 242 ( 1967 ) , the territorial integrity , sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognized boundaries should also be strictly respected , in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions , including resolution 425 ( 1978 ) .  
We are all aware that we live in an age when political decisions can be influenced by the emotional power of visual images , whose instant , worldwide transmission has been made possible by rapid-fire advances in everything from satellite technology to personal computers .  
It is needless to stress that the elimination of poverty and the attainment of the broader goal of sustainable development will remain impossible to achieve unless nations show renewed political resolve to implement policies aimed at enabling humankind to better manage and live with its environment , as agreed to at the Rio de Janeiro summit and at subsequent Conferences .  
We do indeed live in a brutal and unjust world , where the astonishing developments in science and technology and our increasingly sophisticated knowledge base are not matched by the ability of Governments to marshal forces to overcome the social and economic inequities of their countries .  
With a population of fewer than 400,000 people of diverse ethnic and linguistic origins , 80 per cent of whom live in rural settings on hundreds of islands arrayed over 1,600 kilometres of ocean , no other system is workable .  
Indeed , 72 per cent of single heads of households , most of them female , live below the official poverty line , which simply implies a lack of access or limited access to basic social services , including food , sanitation , shelter , basic education and primary health care . 
First , in the health field , action is under way to reach the target of eliminating poliomyelitis ; salt iodization is being implemented ; the rate of maternal mortality has decreased from 143 in 1989 to 107 in 1995 for every 100,000 live births ; 93 per cent of all children have been vaccinated and immunized against hepatitis ; studies and evaluations have been made to supplement current child nutrition information ; and health plans have been drawn up to promote future health care .  
Because we are small and peaceful , and because we have a lengthy history , we bring to the United Nations a vision of the world that is patient and optimistic , and it is our belief that if we have lived in our territory without bellicose conflict for more than 700 years , the same is also possible beyond our borders , for , in the end , the men and women who live in Andorra are different from the rest of mankind only in their collective historical experience .  
This is because of the close interrelationship and joint interests among members of the international community and the common destiny that binds us together once we recognize that we live in a global village in which geographic borders can not protect others from the physical or mental effects of those problems .  
I am confident that this session of the General Assembly will live up to the expectations of Governments and the hopes of peoples : that all of us will take a new step in humankind 's difficult transition towards a world united in its diversity , a world that is open to universal economic and spiritual development , a world that promises security and stability a world in which States cooperate on an equal footing .  
New Zealand will make that commitment , because we are committed to building a strengthened and effective United Nations that is ready and able to tackle the challenges that lie ahead , and a United Nations system that is more internationally democratic and more representative of the world we live in as the century draws to a close .  
We are convinced that the adoption of this balanced draft resolution will be a timely signal of support for efforts to establish a Middle East whose peoples and Governments can live in conditions of good-neighbourliness , broad international cooperation and crucial economic development .  
Peace should have prevailed in the post-cold-war world , in which equal members of the international community should respect each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , refrain from invading each other or interfering in each other 's internal affairs , and live in harmony with each other , in a spirit of seeking common ground and putting aside differences .  
Several aspects can be determined which identify or refer to people living in poverty : although much attention is given to the problems of the urban poor , in many countries the poor most often live in rural or isolated areas ; they often have large families and low life expectancy ; they survive without benefit of many basic services ; they evidence a low level of participation in economic and political life ; they often lack the basic means for productive employment ; and they generally lack a sense of security in their lives .  
The vast majority of the people in developing countries live in rural areas , with daily nutritional intake below basic requirements , high infant mortality rates , shorter life expectancy than that in industrialized countries and limited or no access to safe water and sanitation . 
The current supply of energy to rural areas of developing countries where the bulk of the population live is inadequate ; there is therefore an urgent need to expand substantially the supply of energy , including rural electrification , to stimulate economic growth or at least help arrest , reverse and eventually eradicate poverty , which is rampant in these areas .  
In these cities and towns , large sections of the world 's urban population live in inadequate conditions and are confronted with serious problems , including environmental problems , that are exacerbated by inadequate planning and managerial capacities , lack of investment and technology , and insufficient mobilization and inappropriate allocation of financial resources , as well as by a lack of social and economic opportunities .  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole of the States in which such persons live ,  
" Micro-organisms " : bacteria , viruses , mycoplasmas , rickettsiae or fungi , whether natural , enhanced or modified , either in the form of " isolated live cultures " , including in dormant form or in dried preparations , or as material , including living material , which has been deliberately inoculated or contaminated with such cultures .  
As we move into the twenty-first century , we offer a positive vision of sustainable human settlements , a sense of hope for our common future and an exhortation to join a truly worthwhile and engaging challenge , that of building together a world where everyone can live in a safe home with a promise of a decent life of dignity , good health , safety , happiness and hope .  
In urban areas , it is the poor who most often are forced to live in dense squatter settlements characterized by unsanitary conditions , or near hazardous industrial plants .  
For the moment , he has observed that since its colonization , Colombia has experienced persistent racial discrimination : the indigenous population and Black people have been marginalized , and live in deplorable economic and social conditions - they are the poorest groups .  
All that the people of southern Africa are asking for now is a chance to live in peace so that they can address the myriad problems and challenges left unattended for decades by previous colonial and racist regimes in their region . 
In 1991 , the World Bank issued a revised policy which extends its own definition of indigenous people to include a much wider array of groups that maintain cultural and social identities distinct from those of the national societies where they live , have close attachments to their ancestral lands , and are susceptible to being disadvantaged in the development process .  
It is perceived as encompassing the principle of universality in health care , so that all human beings may live with the knowledge that they can seek health care which is accessible , affordable , relevant , and of the requisite quality .  
Health security covers all aspects of the right of every individual to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health , including the right to food in sufficient quantity and of good quality , the right to decent housing and to live in environments where known health risks are controlled , and the right to have access to education and information on health , rights that are enshrined in the various international treaties .  
However , some of the remaining internally displaced persons informed the Representative that they received almost daily visits from local officials , telling them that they were no longer entitled to live in public buildings and threatening them with eviction .  
The Committee is particularly concerned at the insufficient measures and programmes for the protection of the rights of the most vulnerable children , especially girls , children living in rural areas , children who are victims of abuse , children of single parents , children born out of wedlock , abandoned children , disabled children , and children who are , in order to survive , forced to live and / or work in the streets .  
The Committee recommends that special protective measures be implemented in relation to children living in rural areas , children who are victims of abuse , children of single-parent families , children born out of wedlock , abandoned , institutionalized and disabled children , children involved with the juvenile justice system , particularly when deprived of their liberty , children involved in child labour and children who , in order to survive , are forced to live and / or work in the streets .  
They can be used as a basis for designing programmes to improve the situation of children , particularly those belonging to the most disadvantaged groups , including disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children ill-treated and abused within the family , children who are victims of sexual exploitation , and children who are forced to live and / or work in the streets in order to survive .  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
From a technical perspective , to be compatible with the definition of long-term migrant proposed in paragraph 8 above , the stock of international migrants should include all persons who have ever changed their country of usual residence , that is , persons who have spent at least one year of their lives in a country other than the one in which they live at a particular point in time .  
The concept of health security encompasses all aspects of the basic rights to health : the right to freedom of choice and personal security ; the right to food in sufficient quantity and quality ; the right to live and work in environments where known health risks are controlled ; and the right to have access to education , information and decent housing .  
Revisions were made to improve data quality in the following items : ( i ) data on " children ever born " and " children living " should be collected by sex ; ( ii ) " date of birth of the last child born alive " was introduced to replace " live births within the 12 months preceding the census " to measure current fertility ; and ( iii ) " deaths in the 12 months preceding the census " was added to measure current mortality .  
That desire becomes even more urgent given that the boundless mind of man has produced numerous miraculous inventions , opening up a new era called the post-industrial era or the information age , while more than a quarter of the developing world 's population still lives in poverty , some 840-million go hungry or face food insecurity , and even in industrial countries more than 100-million people live below the poverty line and 37-million are jobless . 
A culture of peace will contribute to international cooperation for economic and social development and sustained economic growth in the developing countries of our world and permit the billions of dollars spent each year on armaments of death and mass destruction to be directed towards eradicating poverty , facilitating human development and making our world a better place to live in for all , developed and developing countries alike .  
We also urge them to institute national projects and programmes to meet the demand of international public opinion for promotion of the spirit of brotherhood , tolerance and love ; rejection of violence ; collective responsibility for guaranteeing fundamental human rights for all , regardless of nationality , race , or religious or ethnic affiliation ; and allowing peoples to live in peace and stability .  
Its programmes are geared towards providing Muslim children with information on Islamic culture and life , thus giving them the chance for a balanced understanding of their culture and the culture of the country in which they live , in order to enhance positive participation based on mutual understanding .  
The peri-urban poor live in the most hazardous environment where their health is at risk from exposure to toxic chemicals and pathogens from domestic solid wastes and human faecal wastes .  
Particular problems persisted for Turkey 's rural women in eastern and southeastern Anatolia , who continued to live in traditional social frameworks and were affected by an ongoing armed conflict and whose access to opportunities and services remained severely limited .  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
They can be used as a basis for designing programmes to improve the situation of children , particularly those belonging to the most disadvantaged groups , including disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children ill-treated and abused within the family , in institutions , or deprived of liberty , children who are victims of sexual exploitation , children belonging to minority groups , especially Roma , and children who , in order to survive , are forced to live and / or work in the streets .  
Recognizing the respect for the environment accorded by the cultures of indigenous peoples of the Americas , and considering the special relationship between the indigenous peoples and the environment , lands , resources and territories on which they live and their natural resources .  Recognizing that in many indigenous cultures , traditional collective systems for control and use of land and territory and resources , including bodies of water and coastal areas , are a necessary condition for their survival , social organization , development and their individual and collective well-being . . .  
In the preliminary report ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1995 / 14 ) to the Sub-Commission , the Special Rapporteur underlined that income distribution , both internationally and nationally , was the principal indicator of social integration and of the fulfilment of minimum requirements in respect of economic , social and cultural rights , enabling human beings to live in society . 
The Working Group decided that at its sixteenth session it would focus on the questions of the membership , participation in and mandate of a possible permanent forum , including issues such as equitable geographical distribution on the basis of where indigenous peoples live and the open and authentic representation of indigenous nations , peoples , organizations and communities .  
Expressing its serious concern that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights , in particular those of vulnerable groups in society , continue to be violated in many parts of the world and that millions of people still suffer misery , live in poverty and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ,

Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges the Government of the Sudan to provide adequate security for all special rapporteurs , and to live up to its pledge to provide logistical support to national , regional and international organizations to join the investigations of alleged cases of involuntary disappearance and slavery ;  
The aim of mine-action programmes , therefore , is not only technical - to survey , mark and eradicate mines - but also humanitarian and developmental - to create an environment in which people can live more safely and in which economic and social development can occur free from the constraints imposed by landmine contamination . 
Conscious of the fact that the physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development of the child , the future generation , depends on a safe , secure and adequate place to live , and that children are particularly vulnerable when deprived of an adequate standard of living in that respect ,  
Peace , security and disarmament are vital to a safe and secure planet , and the countless individuals who live daily in constant fear whether because of terrorists , hatred between ethnic groups , internecine warfare or religious persecution gives us much concern . 
In the sphere of collective security and the maintenance of world peace , although major catastrophes have been averted , the United Nations has not succeeded in making real the dream of every human being to live in peace in a world free from the pestilence of war and all the attendant horrors of human carnage and the senseless destruction of everything we hold dear .  
We share the basic premise that we live in a world of contradictions : integration and globalization coexist with fragmentation and marginalization ; computer science , while a source of progress , is also facilitating the expansion of transnational criminal networks , drug trafficking , money laundering and terrorism ; greater awareness of environmental problems is not accompanied by the political will to find satisfactory solutions ; and despite the strengthening of democracy , extremely serious violations of human rights continue to be committed .  
That outcome was averted thanks to initiatives taken and to the resolve of the Governments of Central America and friendly countries , which took the proper steps to find a negotiated political solution that responded to the aspirations of the Central American peoples , and in particular to the sovereign right of States to live in peace and freely to determine their own future free from any foreign interference in matters that are essentially within their internal jurisdiction . 
The European Union expects the Disarmament Commission to live up to expectations , and looks forward to working in a constructive and balanced manner in the coming weeks towards concrete results to guide future multilateral disarmament efforts . 
This peace was pursued on the basis of the mutual recognition of the legitimate rights of both peoples and their desire to live in peaceful coexistence and mutual dignity and security and to achieve a just , lasting and comprehensive peace settlement and a historic reconciliation through the agreed political process .  
The Brazil / Norway Workshop on Consumption and Production Patterns ( Brasilia , November 1996 ) concluded , among other things , that the role of advertising and the media is critical ; that the international community should apply the resources of the media to induce behavioural changes to avoid waste , inefficient resource use and conspicuous consumption ; and that positive messages of how individuals can live in a sustainable manner were required , instead of encouraging ever-rising material consumption or exaggerating the likelihood of environmental disaster .  
Further , where persons are displaced in circumstances which are consistent with international norms , they have a right to live in conditions in which basic rights to food , housing and health are secured , not to speak of reasonable social amenities and the enjoyment of all other basic rights to life , physical security and public freedoms .  
The only explanation seems to lie in the fact that Israel has realized that the Security Council is not prepared to live up to its commitments to stop aggression , thanks to the unqualified and continuous support of certain members who , at most and out of sheer embarrassment , express dissatisfaction with the atrocious Israeli practices in the occupied areas .  
It was the Greek Cypriot armed onslaught in December 1963 against the Turkish Cypriot people and the bi-communal order that led to division on the island when the Turkish Cypriot people were forced to live in enclaves , deprived of all basic necessities and fundamental human rights , for 11 years prior to the legitimate Turkish intervention of 1974 .  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
In the light of new and emerging challenges , faced with conflicting situations , the ordinary citizens of the world yearn for peace and security and aspire towards economic equity and participation in meeting their basic needs and an opportunity to live in comfort . 
They can be used as a basis for designing programmes to improve the situation of children , particularly the most disadvantaged children , including children with disabilities , refugee and internally displaced children , children ill _ treated and abused within the family and in institutions or deprived of liberty , children who are victims of sexual exploitation and children who live and / or work on the street .  
The Presidents agree that the peoples of the Russian Federation and Ukraine shall continue to live and work in peace and harmony , supporting each other at a crucial stage in their history , when they are carrying out , in their independent sovereign States , large-scale reforms with a view to establishing a democratic society and a State based on rule of law , with a socially oriented market economy .  
Particular problems persisted for Turkey 's rural women in eastern and southeastern Anatolia , who continued to live in traditional social frameworks and were affected by an ongoing armed conflict and whose access to opportunities and services remained severely limited .  
These challenges shelter and housing and the need to address urbanization both impact disproportionately and very severely on hundreds of millions of poor and disadvantaged people in nations large and small people who , mostly but not in all cases , live in the developing countries of our world ; people who are huddled in vast urban slums or in rural shacks ; people who lack not just secure work , but also such basic necessities as clean water , sanitation , waste disposal , safe transportation and even the most minimal green spaces to call their own .  
Noting that foreign migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
Disturbed that millions of women worldwide suffer from extremely poor housing and living conditions , including severe pollution , overcrowding , polluted water and inadequate sanitation , all of which give rise to serious mental and physical health problems and cause thousands of women to die , or to live in a permanent state of ill _ health ,  
The stories are heartbreaking doctors and nurses forced to live in the lobby of a closed hospital ; middle-class families who owned their own homes , sent their children to college , travelled abroad , now living by selling their possessions .  
These are activities which can clearly signal a commitment to address human rights issues and to build a society in which all can live freely and to provide a solid legal framework for economic development which will aid national and international investment .  
Education should enable the individual to live and work in a free society , and should promote mutual understanding , tolerance and friendship among peoples and racial , ethnic and religious groups .  
From 1963 , the Turkish Cypriots have been forced to live in scattered enclaves across the island under deplorable conditions , faced with harsh economic restrictions and besieged by hostile Greek Cypriot armed elements .  
Greek Cypriot political and military leadership issued provocative statements while air force and naval units engaged in manoeuvres , using live ammunition , which pronounced the element of offence in order to " capture occupied territories " .  
This vicious circle , which affects in particular the developing world , where more than 90 per cent of infected people live , has a huge impact on the future of our societies because most infected people are in their peak productive and reproductive years . 
They stressed that the current global environment provides a real chance to qualitatively improve the conditions of life for the vast majority of the people who live in poverty , and affirmed their collective commitment to the goal of eradicating poverty .  
One law worthy of note is the Environmental Protection Act of 10 December 1996 , one main objective of which is to defend the human right in environmental matters that is laid down in the Constitution : the right to live in a healthy environment ( article 37.3 ) .  
Education must offer the individual the opportunity to live and work in a free society , and must foster mutual understanding , tolerance and friendship among peoples and racial , ethnic and religious groups .  
It is the mission of culture and science to enable individuals to live in a free society , and to foster mutual understanding , tolerance and friendship among peoples and racial , ethnic and religious groups .  
They are constituted by a limited number of plant species which live under special conditions of shallow brackish water , needing regular inflow of freshwater ; they capture the sandy and loamy products resulting from the erosion of neighbouring land . 
The health of the ethnic minority women is undermined by multiple factors : lack of access to health services in the sparsely populated areas where they live , cultural and language barriers to effective contact with health staff , inadequate sanitation and nutrition , and low levels of education and information .  
The Office 's background investigations of targeted violence further confirmed the observations expressed in my previous report that the nature of violent activity in Kosovo , which has now spread to urban areas , has increased the number of persons who live in fear of being directly affected by violence or arbitrary treatment .  
The law on national education reflected the provisions of article 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by stipulating that education should be directed to the moral , intellectual and physical development of children and should provide them with the basic knowledge they needed to live in society and to have an impact on the countrys socio-economic situation . 
The question should be asked whether it is fair to collect the debt owed by the countries where these people live , which in many cases accounts for more than half of their limited revenues , while in the United States alone , $ 8 billion are spent on cosmetics , in the rich countries , $ 17-billion are spent on pet food and , worldwide , $ 400-billion are spent on narcotic drugs . 
Despite the fact that the majority of the worlds poor still live in rural areas , the rapid urbanization of the developing world has raised awareness of the problems associated with urban poverty , including increasing levels of slum housing , unprotected and informal employment , street children and child labour , crime , drug abuse and homelessness .  
The Law on Social Care and Provision of Social Security of Serbia defines the family in the following manner : for the purposes of exercising the right to material support the family is understood to mean the spouses or two people of different sexes , children ( born in and out of wedlock , adopted or foster ) and kinsmen in the direct line and in the lateral line up to the second degree of kinship , provided they live in a common household .  
Measures for the provision of primary health care are primarily geared to the promotion of health , to preventive health education activities and hygienic and epidemiological policies which are pursued at the level of the community and the municipality , where people live and work .  
One means of accomplishing this will be to disseminate , at the pace dictated by media deadlines , more live footage and quickly edited raw materials for television and radio in particular , including , where possible , audio-visual coverage of United Nations activities in major international developments in which the Organization is a principal player .  
Armed conflict in southern Sudan ruled out plans for the repatriation of refugees from Ethiopia and Uganda ; Somali refugees in Kenya were likewise unable to go back to their country of origin ; Sahrawi refugees continued to live in exile , waiting for a successful conclusion to negotiations on Western Sahara ; refugees from Burundi had to remain in the United Republic of Tanzania , where their presence was a major source of tension between the two States .  
It is in this framework and with these purposes in mind that Hungary expresses its strong desire to live side by side with a democratic Federal Republic of Yugoslavia at peace with its ethnic communities , respectful of all human rights , including the rights of national minorities , and thus ready to rejoin the community of nations .  
I believe that , given the overall state of our relations , we can move forward and embark with determination on the constructive and imaginative search for ways of settling the dispute concerning sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands , South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas in a manner guaranteed to preserve the way of life of the islanders and ensure the economic prosperity and social well-being of all who live in the South Atlantic .  
Consequently , the Special Rapporteur has already expressed the view that indigenous peoples , although they may constitute numerical minorities in a number of the countries in which they now live , are not minorities in accordance with United Nations usage and for the purposes of possible practical action on the part of the Organization . 24 / By the same token , ethnic and / or national minorities are not to be considered indigenous peoples in the United Nations context . 
As mentioned previously , and given the exclusive character that the term indigenous has in this context , other groups , minorities , ethnic groups or peoples who live alongside them on the territory of a present _ day multi _ national or multi _ ethnic African or Asian State _ whose ( sometimes aberrant ) frontiers are the result of a colonial situation , perhaps legally defunct but which continues to cast its shadow on the present _ would thus be excluded from this category of indigenous .  
Particular consideration should be given , in these cases , to the practical day-to-day consequences ( sometimes grave ) of the lack of such agreements for the juridical and political status of the peoples concerned in the mixed societies in which they now live , and for the preservation , promotion and effective realization of their historical rights as peoples , including their human rights and freedoms . 
These negative views were promoted daily and urbi et orbis by the most diverse methods ( scientific literature or simply by word of mouth ) and quickly became part of the conventional wisdom in large sections of the political and academic world , as well as for vast segments of the population at large , in the plurinational societies in which indigenous peoples continue to live today .  
At this point , the Special Rapporteur is prepared to offer , first , some general conclusions applicable to the issues of the study as a whole ; and then to provide more specific conclusions regarding the two main categories of currently existing situations in which indigenous peoples live in multi _ national societies : those in which treaties , agreements or other constructive arrangements exist , and those lacking such juridical instruments .  
For the same reasons , it is especially important to assess fully ( or to reassess ) , from the same point of reference , the relevance and potential utility of the quasi-juridical category of constructive arrangements for indigenous peoples still deprived of any formal and consensual relationship with the States in which they now happen to live .  
I would like in conclusion to express our readiness and sincere desire to work together with all other nations to build a peaceful world in which all people can live happy and productive lives , free from political , social and economic anxieties .  
The effective realization of the right to education provides an essential means of access to an adequate standard of living ; it ensures the access to knowledge required by individuals to develop all their faculties , to improve the quality of their lives , to take clear _ sighted decisions and to continue to learn , in order to live a dignified life within a democratic society .  
These needs comprise both essential learning tools ( such as literacy , oral expression , numeracy and problem solving ) and the basic learning content ( such as knowledge , skills , values and attitudes ) required by human beings to be able to survive , to develop their full capacities , to live and work in dignity , to participate fully in development , to improve the quality of their lives , to make informed decisions and to continue learning ( art . 1 , para . 
Afghan women live in fear for their lives , for they may be beaten to death for the slightest inappropriate conduct or for merely leaving a part of their body uncovered ; for example , a woman was recently stoned to death by fundamentalists for leaving one of her arms exposed while driving a motor vehicle ,  
Noting that migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine their human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
The Committee of Experts also stressed that one of the fundamental precepts of this Convention is that a relationship of respect should be established between indigenous and tribal peoples and the States in which they live , a concept which should not be confused with autonomy or political and territorial independence from the nation State .  
The developing economies where 60 per cent of the worlds elderly now live , rising to 70 per cent in 20 years are challenged to develop human and economic capital while strengthening the social capital of family and community security systems .  
For Latvia to succeed , and for the people of Latvia to have the full opportunity they deserve to live secure , healthy and prosperous lives , Latvia must be integrated into the political , business and intellectual exchange of the global community .  
Considering the care that has been shown by the ruling party to grant citizenship , and thus voting rights , to the " diaspora " ( ethnic Croats who live abroad ) , the Special Rapporteur places special emphasis on the rights of all those who qualify for Croatian citizenship , irrespective of ethnicity , and especially refugees , to claim citizenship in a timely manner , thus enabling them to participate in the forthcoming Croatian elections .  
Arms transfers and trafficking , and the resulting armed conflicts which they feed , are having a devastating impact on social , political and economic life for Africa south of the Sahara , a region endowed with natural resources but which still has pockets in which live the poorest people in the world today . 
Indeed , our continent is home to two thirds of the least developed countries and to three quarters of those at a low level of human development , and almost half of its inhabitants live in absolute poverty .  
I would like to emphasize that it was the Greek Cypriot armed onslaught in December 1963 against the Turkish Cypriots and the binational order that led to the division of the island when the Turkish Cypriots were forced to live in enclaves , deprived of all basic necessities and fundamental human rights , for 11 years prior to the legal Turkish intervention of 1974 .  
The settlement of the Saharan problem would be beneficial not only to the fraternal Saharan and Moroccan peoples but also to all the peoples of the region wishing to live in the Maghreb , to the attainment of domestic peace , to a unified , stable and prosperous Maghreb truly able to solve the countless complex problems arising in a world embarked on globalization .  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
You are , of course , aware of the economic embargo of the past nine years and of the fact that these years have been punctuated by constant military assaults , planned and carried out by the United States , targeting all aspects of life and based on the refusal of that country to allow the people of Iraq to live a life of dignity and exercise its free and independent will .  
Noting that , as the century draws to a close , the Central American countries have achieved significant progress towards the consolidation of democracy and good governance , the strengthening of civilian Governments , respect for human rights and the rule of law , and the promotion of State and economic reforms , sustainable development and regional integration , reflecting the desire of the Central American peoples to live and prosper in a climate of peace and solidarity ,

The Declaration defines basic learning needs as : essential learning tools ( such as literacy , oral expression , numeracy , and problem solving ) and the basic learning content ( such as knowledge , skills , values , and attitudes ) required by human beings to be able to survive , to develop their full capacities , to live and work in dignity , to participate fully in development , to improve the quality of their lives , to make informed decisions , and to continue learning ( art .  1 ) .  
Taking the assessment made to its logical conclusion , the Special Rapporteur finds it inherently unjust that , while the actual perpetrators of the attacks have been punished with the full severity of the law , those who recruited , trained and hired them , supplied the materials and explosives , provided them with papers and paid them , are still at large and enjoying full impunity in the countries where they live .  
The health of ethnic minority women is undermined by multiple factors : lack of access to health services in the sparsely populated areas where they live , cultural and language barriers to effective contact with health staff , inadequate sanitation and nutrition , and low levels of education and information .  
Armed conflict in the southern Sudan ruled out plans for the repatriation of refugees from Ethiopia and Uganda ; Somali refugees in Kenya were likewise unable to go back to their country of origin ; Sahrawi refugees continued to live in exile , waiting for a successful conclusion to negotiations on Western Sahara ; refugees from Burundi had to remain in the United Republic of Tanzania , where their presence was a major source of tension between the two States .  
In this respect , Tunisia calls for international solidarity so as to put an end to the existing disparities between the rich and poor countries , between those with sufficient resources to provide their citizens with a happy old age and enough to live on , and those whose meagre resources are insufficient to meet adequately the many needs of their people , especially the elderly .  
In sub-Saharan Africa , half the population has no access to health care , 42 per cent of the adult population is illiterate , one third have a life expectancy of only 40 years and about 2-million deaths registered in 1998 were caused by AIDS ; 59 per cent of the rural population and 43 per cent of the urban population live in abject poverty , with an annual income of about $ 100 .  
It would be difficult to explain to the growing number of people who live in pockets of poverty throughout the industrialized world that in Copenhagen , four years ago , we decided to help them and integrate them into the framework of the tremendous social development that prevails in their countries .  
Their successful conclusion on the basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions will benefit the peoples of the region including the people of Cyprus , who live with the vision of a free , united and peaceful island , without foreign troops and barbed wire and with its people integrated and cooperating as they did for centuries in the past . 
As we stand at the threshold of the new century , let us rededicate ourselves to demining activities so as to give peoples the opportunity to live in an environment free from the physical , socio-economic and psychological traps these killers create and to ensure that those now living with the threat of landmines will have the chance to enjoy a peaceful and productive existence .  
Yet all these efforts have been frustrated by hostile and aggressive actions taken by the occupying Power , which , far from showing itself ready to negotiate , has continued its policy of illegal settlements and violation of international law and human rights of the Arab people who live the bitter reality of living under occupation .  
The Fourth Committee welcomed the outcome of the Third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , held in Vienna from 19 to 30 July 1999 , and it endorsed the practical benefits and potential offered in all areas of human activity by space technology , the peaceful application of which can contribute to increasing the quality of live and to sustainable economic and social development .  
The urban poor , especially women and children , are forced to live in makeshift shelters in appalling and degrading conditions presenting hazards for both physical and mental health .  
Of course , they would love to see a world free of weapons of mass destruction , stockpiles of fissile material and above all , many fewer conventional weapons , to enable them to live a peaceful life.Are we anywhere near these objectives and aspirations ?  
If we truly want the Conference on Disarmament to live up to its responsibilities as the sole multilateral negotiating body on disarmament and international security , let us focus our work here on halting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , in particular nuclear weapons.Let us start today the negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off treaty !  
The interdependence in which SMEs were supposed to live was fraught with increased complexity and risks of instability and marginalization.For many African SMEs , the opportunities created by technological advances , the increased mobility of production factors and regional trading arrangements were either still nominal or not fully accessible . 
To try to make this topic the private domain of the nuclear Powers thus excluding the vast majority of States from the multilateral negotiations necessary in order to attain nuclear disarmament in a time-bound framework and under strict international control would only delay further the legitimate aspirations of mankind to live in a nuclear-weapon-free world .  
Development is unsustainable where the rule of law and equity do not exist ; where ethnic , religious or sexual discrimination are rampant ; where there are restrictions on free speech , free association and the media ; or where large numbers of people live in abject and degrading poverty .  
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights observed that the transformation of the nature of violence in Kosovo had reduced the geographic area of perceived safety and had resulted in a real increase in the number of persons who live in apprehension of direct experience of violence or arbitrary treatment .  
Some government financial assistance is given to pensioners , single parent families , the temporarily disabled , the permanently mentally or physically handicapped and the unemployed or underemployed who do not have sufficient income to live on .  
UNDP defines poverty as human poverty , deprivation in the most basic choices people have such as to live a long and healthy life , to be educated , to have the means to a decent standard of living and to be able to be a part of the life of a community . 
The constitutional provision on the right of the citizens to live in a healthy and safe environment may rightfully be regarded as a key requirement applied to housing which constitutes living space for a human being .  
They also result in inequities in international economic relations and in a widening gap between the rich developed countries of the north and the poor developing countries of the south , where 80 per cent of the worlds poorest live .  
The living conditions in this camp are harsh , especially for widows , elderly women and the many children , who often live in an intolerably precarious state , suffering from illnesses , malnutrition and the cold .  
In this context , we see the reported achievements especially as establishing conditions on the ground allowing the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina to be free to decide to return to their pre-war homes or to choose to live elsewhere , and as developing a modern , independent and effective judiciary system as well as responsible and non-political police structures .  
As far as France is concerned , this settlement must be based , on the one hand , on the reaffirmation and full recognition of Israels irrevocable right to live in peace and security within internationally recognized borders , and , on the other hand , on the establishment of a viable , independent and democratic Palestinian State , and this means the end of the occupation of Palestinian territories .  
It must , however , not be forgotten that migrants are people and that , as such , they have abilities , strengths and potential that need to be enhanced and developed on the basis of respect for their cultural identity , their religious beliefs and all the ways in which they express themselves as human beings and persons wishing to live in dignity .  
Scattered among a dozen makeshift camps along the southern border of the Central African Republic , the refugees live in precarious conditions , involving lack of food , poor or inappropriate medical care and lack of medicines and pitiful accommodation .  
The declaration should affirm the right of every human being hence , also those who are deprived of all their essential rights , wherever in the world they may be to live in an environment in which their human dignity is respected and to enjoy their fundamental rights fully and completely and thus be able to assume their responsibilities towards their families and communities .  It should take into account the efforts and initiatives of individuals and groups living in extreme poverty .  
Urge States in their national efforts , and in cooperation with regional and international financial institutions , to promote the use of public investment and encourage private investment in order to eradicate poverty , particularly in those areas in which indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities predominantly live ;  
Urge the international community to take cognizance of the very real difficulties that peoples of different racial and ethnic backgrounds inevitably experience in seeking to live together and to develop genuine harmonious multiracial societies .  
This implies an increased focus on issues like good governance at national and international levels and the fight against corruption , respect for all internationally recognized human rights , gender issues , capacity and institutional building , social services supply and environmental concerns .  The majority of the poor live in rural areas .  
Refugees and displaced persons already for many years have been deprived of elementary living conditions and the exercise of the most fundamental human rights and freedoms , enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , including the right to live in dignity and safety and participate fully in social and economic life in their places of permanent residence .  
Urges the international community to take cognizance of the very real difficulties that peoples of different racial and ethnic backgrounds inevitably experience in seeking to live together and to develop genuine harmonious multiracial societies .

Pursuant to the Accord , the Kanaks and the other communities assumed responsibility for their shared destiny on the basis of the rehabilitation of the colonized indigenous Kanak people ; the foundations for wanting to live with one another ( citizenship , identity signs specific to New Caledonia ) ; and a gradual and irreversible power to transfer responsibilities towards full sovereignty .  
One of our international shortwave partners , the Costa Rica-based Radio for Peace International , for example , has stated that the programme was of great value to our listeners worldwide and described the live 15-minute format as dynamic and providing a spontaneity not found in the previous format of weekly recorded programmes . 
It is recommended that the General Assembly should reaffirm its full support for the self-determination of the African peoples and their right to live in peace , to benefit from the development that can result from the rational use of their own natural resources and to have their legitimate governments respected and stable , and in that regard it should condemn the mercenary activities frequently organized with the aim of undermining the rights of the African peoples .  
While the share of the national recurrent budget allocated to the health sector has been maintained , on average , at the same level , a lower proportion of the health budget is spent on provincial health services where the majority of the population live .  
In such a culture , Governments would live up to their responsibilities , armed groups would respect the recognized rules of international humanitarian law , the private sector would be conscious of the impact of its engagement in crisis areas , and Member States and international organizations would display the necessary commitment to ensuring decisive and rapid action in the face of crisis .  
In addition and this , too , is a serious matter through the technology of the communications media , which showed the entire world live and direct the distressing images from New York , Washington and Pennsylvania , an entire generation of children and adolescents has been marked by fear and insecurity ; unable to find reasons , they ask themselves why these inhuman acts occurred and what kind of future awaits them .  
The reported drop in mortality rates during the past year is not completely reliable owing to incomplete medical registration processes , limited by high administrative fees and the unsatisfactory introduction throughout the country of the recommendations of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) for the registration of live births .  
Pope John Paul II , on 13 September , in accepting the credentials of the new Ambassador of the United States to the Holy See , said , In facing the challenges of the future , America is called to cherish and live out the deepest values of her national heritage : solidarity and cooperation between peoples ; respect for human rights ; the justice that is the indispensable condition for authentic freedom and lasting peace .  
In the social sphere , bridges should be built not only to improve education and train people to live together in a highly competitive world , but to ensure peaceful coexistence based on tolerance , respect and solidarity , as well as strengthening national and international institutions to ensure the changes needed for new commitments .  
However , over a-billion people had continued to live in extreme poverty , with millions of people unemployed , and a growing number of societies breaking up along racial , ethnic or social fault lines .  
Recognizing that the right of human beings to live free from fear and poverty can not be realized unless , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the other international human rights instruments , conditions are created enabling all human beings to enjoy to the full their economic , social and cultural rights , as well as their civil and political rights ,  
It is imperative that the Afghan people be central to the political plan , and that their human rights , long denied to them , and their legitimate expectation to live in freedom and with dignity in a society where peace is restored and the rule of law protects their lives and their livelihoods against violence and the depredations of powerful warlords , be realized .  
Recognize also that indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant to the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources constitute an important group for the sustainable production and consumption of goods and services , and that they should therefore participate in the design of policies and actions to achieve sustainable development ; that the use and enjoyment of natural resources in the places in which they live should be approached with respect ; and that their knowledge , innovations and practices should be legally protected and that continual feedback which benefits all concerned should thus be established .
