For this reason , it has been unable to correct using a market means the practice of redundant construction in the past .  
It must be pointed out that the Dalai 's current visit to Taiwan is another adverse current designed to split the motherland since the Taiwan authorities gave the green light in mid-March to an overseas " Taiwan independence " organization - - the " World Taiwan Society , " which staged a farce in Taiwan of openly clamoring for " building the country through Taiwan independence . "  
The meeting pointed out : We must achieve phased results in the above-mentioned five respects in one year or so , so that the ongoing spread of law-breaking and criminal activities that seriously disrupt the market economic order will be markedly contained ; big and important cases that the people have strong resentment at , that have serious consequences and adverse repercussions will be exposed and dealt with ; criminal elements who break the law will be severely punished ;  
For example , we can make use of advanced scientific and technological means to establish an appraisal and evaluation system composed of different quality indexes , which can integrate qualitative assessment with quantitative analysis and can link the appraisal made by party organizations with the evaluation conducted by the masses ; enhance the accuracy and rationality of our selection and our use of cadres ; and minimize the adverse influences that may be produced by man-made factors .  
Thus rational and correct command decisions are bound to unleash powerful capability for a belligerent in winning a war with its existing fighting capacity , even under adverse circumstances .  
Some economists of China hold the view that the adverse influence of the decrease in exports on China 's economy has begun to show , but as long as we expand domestic total demand and implement the proactive financial policy and the steady currency policy , we will be able to sustain the stable growth , and there will be no need to adopt the policy of stimulating exports and the economy by appropriately devaluing renminbi .

Hong Kong is a society ruled by law .  However , because of the adverse currents created by those politicians , who call themselves " democrats , " who fight China , make troubles in Hong Kong , and " overthrow Tung Chee-hwa , " this society has lost its harmony and is replete with reckless behaviors .  Currently some Legco members of the " democratic faction " have even taken the lead in violating the law and rebuffing the rule of law in our special administrative region .

Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General [ 1 ] on the implementation of resolution 50 / 10 ;  
Recognizing further that the international community at large and , in particular , international institutions involved in providing economic and financial assistance should continue to take into account and address in a more effective manner the special economic problems of affected third States arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter in view of their magnitude and of the adverse impact on the economy of those States ,  
To this end , every State must take the requisite legislative measures to ensure that the law intervenes by placing restrictions and controls on the biological sciences so that these restrictions and controls can help to curb scientific progress that has an adverse effect on human values and creates legal and ethical problems .  
Recognizing further that the international community at large and , in particular , international institutions involved in providing economic and financial assistance should continue to take into account and address in a more effective manner the special economic problems of affected third States arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter , in view of their magnitude and of the adverse impact on the economy of those States ,  
Firmly upholds the validity of the principles cited in comparable situations by certain Governments which imposed the embargo against Burundi , namely , that the imposition on a State of an economic , commercial or financial blockade also has adverse consequences for the sovereignty and interests of other countries and that the imposition of one State 's jurisdiction on another State is contrary to the principles of international law ;

countries , migration pressures due to climatic change , the protection of migrant women and children from abuse by their sponsors , the right of receiving countries to regulate access to their territory , the adverse consequences of forced migration , the situation of persons whose asylum claims have been rejected , the trafficking in women and children , prostitution and coercive adoption , and the sudden and massive arrival of refugees and displaced persons in need of international protection .  
Many countries ( which have suffered and continue to suffer great material and financial damage as a result of sanctions ) are therefore completely justified in their desire to elaborate basic criteria and conditions for the application and implementation of mandatory sanctions , and develop ways and means of preventing the adverse consequences of such sanctions or , at least , reducing them to a minimum .  
Reiterates the unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of States ;  
The need for such volunteer effort is greater today than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse or HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of society , given the concern of the international community for the eradication of poverty and given the contemporary trend for civil society , in partnership with Governments and the private sector , to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process .  
Convinced that the need for volunteer effort is greater than ever , in light of the adverse impact of such global problems as environmental degradation , poverty , drug abuse and HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of societies , and of the trend for civil society , in partnership with government and the private sector , to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process ,  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the annihilation of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening territorial integrity and international peace and security , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;

Strategies at the regional , national and local levels for reducing the potential risk due to ambient and indoor air pollution should be developed , bearing in mind their serious impacts on human health , including strategies to make parents , families and communities aware of the adverse environmental health impacts of tobacco .  
The objectives envisaged in this section should reflect the need for equity , adequate energy supplies and increasing energy consumption in developing countries and should take into account the situation of countries that are highly dependent on income generated from the production , processing and export , and / or consumption , of fossil fuels and that have serious difficulties in switching to alternative sources of energy , and the situation of countries highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change .  
Several primary needs should be met : to devise effective and coherent arrangements for information and assessment of the impact of sanctions on third States ; to ensure appropriate access by third States to the process ; to develop a method of assessing actual adverse impact ; to explore practical and innovative measures of assistance ; and to enhance coordination and cooperation among relevant institutions and organizations both within and outside the United Nations system .  
The States members of the European Union had given ample proof of their determination to minimize the detrimental effects suffered by third States , not only through their support of the measures stipulated in the relevant resolutions , but also through substantial economic and humanitarian assistance , especially to those countries which had experienced the adverse effects of the measures taken against the former Yugoslavia .  
It focuses on the implementation of crucial activities that exemplify the Decade 's objective to reduce through concerted international action , especially in developing countries , the loss of life , property damage , and social and economic disruption caused by natural and similar disasters that have an adverse impact upon the environment .  
Many countries ( which have suffered and continue to suffer great material and financial damage as a result of sanctions ) are therefore completely justified in their desire to elaborate basic criteria and conditions for the application and implementation of mandatory sanctions , and develop ways and means of preventing the adverse consequences of such sanctions or , at least , reducing them to a minimum .  
Aware that global increases in population , rising levels of urbanization and unsustainable patterns of consumption and production , particularly in developed countries , are stressing the finite natural resource base , stressing fragile ecosystems and causing environmental degradation and adverse health effects ,  
It highlights the continuation of the basically adverse nature of an international economic environment characterized by the North 's increasing monopoly of the decisive elements of development : trade , financial and stock markets , flows of capital and investment , and technology transfer .  
To ensure broad-based support for drug control objectives , UNDCP has sought to involve civil society and foster awareness of the adverse political , economic and social impact of illicit drug trafficking and abuse .

Issues of biosafety have emerged with regard to national capacity needed for the implementation of effective in situ conservation measures , through establishing and maintaining the means to regulate , manage or control risks associated with invasive species and / or the use and release of living modified organisms resulting from biotechnology and likely to have adverse environmental impacts on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
A considerable number of non-governmental organizations , women groups and indigenous people in both developed and developing countries have expressed concern that the promotion of biotechnology is quite undesirable without some international mechanism in place to protect people from possible adverse effects resulting from genetically altered foods and animals , as well as from disadvantages that a biotechnology-driven market might bring to small farmers in developing countries .  
The Commission requested the Secretary-General to establish in the Centre for Human Rights a focal unit with the specific task of following up on the findings of the Special Rapporteur and other issues related to the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights .  
Given the gravity of the concerns highlighted , the mandate remains a most sensitive and difficult one since it relates to a State Member of the United Nations where governmental authority is absent and a State administration non _ existent , with the adverse impact this implies on the observance and protection of basic human rights and freedoms .  
The country does not have the technical , physical or human resources to manufacture weapons of mass destruction , since its principal concern is to promote its economic development plan and to mitigate the adverse impact that the coercive measures imposed on our people have had on all aspects of life .  
Decides to continue consideration of the question of the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights at its fifty _ fourth session under the agenda item entitled : Question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , and study of special problems which the developing countries face in their efforts to achieve these human rights .  
Reiterates the unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of States ;  
Recommends that long-term public awareness and information programmes related to natural disasters , including those induced by El Ni �� and similar disasters with an adverse impact on the environment , be integrated into comprehensive national disaster management programmes that focus on preventive strategies for risk reduction and that those programmes be included as integral elements of United Nations support for social and economic development programmes ;  
The underlying reason for submitting the draft resolution was the fact that the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights in an increasing number of developing countries had reached alarming proportions and had had adverse economic , social and cultural effects .  
The Committee also suggests that a multidisciplinary monitoring and coordinating system be established to assess the progress achieved and difficulties encountered in the realization of the rights recognized by the Convention at the national and local levels , paying particular attention to the adverse effects of economic policies on children .  
Strategies at the regional , national and local levels for reducing the potential risk due to ambient and indoor air pollution should be developed , bearing in mind their serious impacts on human health , including strategies to make parents , families and communities aware of the adverse environmental health impacts of tobacco .  
The objectives envisaged in this section should reflect the need for equity , adequate energy supplies and increasing energy consumption in developing countries and should take into account the situation of countries that are highly dependent on income generated from the production , processing and export , and / or consumption , of fossil fuels and that have serious difficulties in switching to alternative sources of energy , and the situation of countries highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change .  
Political events worldwide have shown that war , national and regional conflicts , occupation , the imposition of fait accompli policies and the denial of the legitimate rights of peoples under occupation have an adverse impact not only on peace and security in a region but on economic , social and environmental development .  
The international community and States should take all the necessary measures to protect the rights of vulnerable segments of the population and give very serious consideration to holding a large _ scale discussion on the practice of embargoes and economic sanctions which are imposed on States and have adverse consequences for the realization of the economic , social and cultural rights of the segments concerned ;  
Convinced that the need for volunteer effort is greater than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse and HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of societies , and the contemporary trend for civil society _ in partnership with Government and the private sector _ to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process ,  
The phenomenon of protracted and growing displacement , warfare that targets civilians and demolishes communities , and the disintegration of political , institutional and economic structures in crisis countries all point to the need for a better understanding of crises and their adverse impact on vulnerable communities .  
Deeply concerned at the recurrence of armed conflicts exacerbated by the illicit transfer of arms , their incidence on the enjoyment of human rights and on the application of international humanitarian law , as well as by their adverse consequences for international and regional peace and security ,  
This performance reflected the combined effects of a variety of factors : the results of most countries efforts to control severe macroeconomic imbalances in 1995 , adverse climate conditions which affected primary production , and the drop in the international prices of the main export goods .  
Such adverse effects may occur not only whenever specific postal material is the subject of sanctions , but also when air traffic to a sanctioned State is interrupted or suspended .  
Deeply concerned at the recurrence of armed conflicts exacerbated by the illicit transfer of arms , their incidence on the enjoyment of human rights and on the application of international humanitarian law , as well as by their adverse consequences for international and regional peace and security ,  
The adverse effects included an increase in poverty , a reduction in the financial resources that were vital for development , the placing in jeopardy of fiscal and monetary policy and economic reform , and an erosion of the capacity of the country targeted to participate fully in world trade and capital markets .  
Some countries were still suffering from the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes , particularly with regard to health and educational infrastructure and services , which necessitated strengthening of international cooperation based on the adoption and implementation of concrete measures aimed at mitigating and completely eliminating their adverse impact .  
It was paradoxical that , as indicated in the same report , a strong official presence which could provide assistance and address global problems that put development progress at risk was still lacking , at a time when the world had been freed from the adverse effects of the cold war and the needs of the developing countries were growing rapidly .  
The decisive response pronounced by Members of the United Nations and several international and regional organizations against the policy of unilateralism , as manifested in the form of authoritarianism , illustrates the profound anxiety and sensitivity of the international community towards the proliferation and the adverse consequences of such coercive and illogical measures .  
The Islamic Republic of Iran , as a Member of the United Nations and a concerned State , while reiterating the principle of the inalienable right of States to choose their political , social , cultural and economic systems , calls upon the Member States to resist such unlawful actions and to make every effort to eliminate their adverse impacts ; and thus preserve the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , in particular those pertaining to national sovereignty , political independence , territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States .  
Recognizing the potentially adverse impact of large fluctuations among the major international currencies on developing countries , Ministers consider it imperative that the Fund fully exercise its powers to ensure effective surveillance over the macroeconomic policies of the countries involved in the management of these currencies .  
Many countries acknowledged that the root causes of the continuing financial crisis were , on the one hand , a poorly thought out and excessive expansion of the scope of United Nations activities during the previous decade , which had had an adverse impact on the effectiveness of the activities of almost all the specialized agencies , funds and programmes of the United Nations , and , on the other hand , the unjust apportionment of the Organization 's expenses among its Member States .  
The expert group expressed deep concern about the potential adverse effects of coercive economic measures on the structure of international relations , in particular in the area of trade and development .  
The deployment of drug control as a political mechanism , in whatever form , by countries against other countries , will have grave , adverse consequences for effective and reliable international , regional and bilateral cooperation .  
It was also essential to promote an enabling international economic environment which ensured a minimum of stability to counter adverse effects arising from sudden movements in private capital flows .  
The falling birth rate is attributable to the sharp deterioration in society 's social and economic situation which , by reducing the level of family welfare , has adverse effects on reproductive behaviour .  
The consequences of the current repressive approach not only affect the immediate humanitarian situation , they also have a direct and major adverse impact on the prospects for a just and lasting political solution .  
As reported in this year 's Trade and Development Report , there is ample evidence to show that Africa 's external debt burden is in fact having a severe adverse effect on both public and private investment and renewed growth .  
The geophysical settings of many small island developing States leave them vulnerable not only to extreme climatological and seismic events but more critically to periods of low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion , soil erosion and mass wasting .  
As chemical and organic pollutants become more pervasive , the adverse impact on marine environments is increasing , and long-term accumulation in marine ecosystems is threatening biodiversity and the local fishing industry upon which many small island developing States are highly dependent .  
The threat of recovery for each and every managerial mistake would stifle initiative , make managers adverse to taking calculated risks when situations so require , and create a culture where procrastination is considered more prudent than decisive and timely action .  
Therefore , while contractual arrangements may be agreed to by the parties to counter the adverse effects of subsequent regulatory changes ( see paras . 60-63 ) , regulatory bodies would be well advised to avoid excessive regulation or unreasonably frequent changes in existing rules .  
As to clandestine structures at the local level , the adverse effects of the continuing impunity of these groups can be gauged , in respect of so-called social cleansing operations , by an incident which occurred on the road to Bethel , La Libertad , in El Petn .  
In that framework , the State played a central role , in cooperation with civil society and economic agents , in counter-balancing the adverse effects on the poor of structural adjustment and macroeconomic policies .  
As noted in document E / CN . 5 / 1999 / 4 , although the multilateral financial institutions have acknowledged the importance of protecting or compensating the poor for the adverse effects of adjustment measures , the poor nevertheless continue to bear the brunt of hardships arising from macroeconomic and structural adjustment .

Calling for common action to tackle development challenges arising from globalization and the adverse effects of the financial crisis , ACC members committed themselves to working together to monitor the impact of the crisis on societies and individuals , help individual countries carry out the necessary structural and institutional reforms , and strengthen or build basic social services , livelihood opportunities and safety nets for the least fortunate .  
Pursuant to agreement with the indigenous peoples concerned , just and fair compensation shall be provided for any such activities and measures taken to mitigate adverse environmental , economic , social , cultural or spiritual impact .  
In a shared vision , the United Nations system should aim to work for a world in which HIV / AIDS transmission is substantially reduced ; where there is affordable treatment , care and support ; where there is a substantial reduction in individual and collective vulnerability to HIV / AIDS ; where there is a significant alleviation of the adverse impact of the epidemic on individuals , communities , and nations ; and where stigma and denial are addressed .  
The Commission , having recognized that the increasing interdependence of economies and the interconnected nature of computer systems call for concerted and coordinated action at the regional and global levels , urged all members and associate members to take early and effective action to bring their countries to the highest possible level of year 2000 ( Y2K ) readiness , not only for their own benefit but also to minimize adverse Y2K effects on vital sectors of other countries .  
A major success of the Decade has been a widespread acceptance of the fact that the growing risk of disasters associated with natural hazards , frequently compounded by uncontrolled or adverse human practices , must be mitigated .  
At its fiftieth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its decision 1998 / 112 , decided to continue consideration of the adverse consequences of economic sanctions on human rights at its fifty _ first session under the agenda sub _ item entitled Implications of humanitarian activities for the enjoyment of human rights .  
In its concluding observations regarding Guatemala ( E / C . 12 / 1 / Add . 3 of 28 May 1996 ) the Committee expressed serious concern at the adverse effects of the economic and social disparities on the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights by the majority of the population , particularly by the indigenous and rural populations of Guatemala .  
The African continent is subject to a wide range of natural hazards , and suffers constantly from natural and other disasters , which have serious adverse effects on societies and national economies as well as on scarce human and material resources .  
This constitutes an adverse structural shift in the economy , though one which still could be reversed through sustained export growth driven by a combination of domestic and foreign investment and further industrial and agricultural production diversification .  
Although this represents a slight increase over the previous year , FDI continues to be hampered by some characteristics shared by most of the LDCs , such as adverse climatic conditions , small domestic markets , export vulnerability , limited transport and communications infrastructure , insufficient domestic investment and lack of a skilled labour force , as well as lack of information on profitable business opportunities ( box 2 ) .  
The geophysical characteristics of many small islands leave them vulnerable to extreme climatological , seismic and volcanic events , and more critically to periods of drought , low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion and soil erosion , among others , and they require increased attention to watershed management , land and water use planning .  
Venezuela believes that unilateral measures that are extraterritorial and coercive in nature , such as the embargo imposed against Cuba , have a negative effect on the legal regime which defines economic and trade relations between nations and an adverse impact on the efforts that have been carried out in order to achieve economic integration at both the continental and subregional levels .  
The two sides further undertake to notify each other immediately in the event of any accidental , unauthorized or unexplained incident that could create the risk of fallout with adverse consequences for both sides , or an outbreak of a nuclear war between the two countries , as well as to adopt measures aimed at diminishing the possibility of such actions , or of such incidents being misrepresented by the other .  
With regard to the indirect effects of economic sanctions , among the most visible and tangible signs of their adverse impact on the economies of so-called third countries are foregone tax and tariff revenues , job losses among both blue-collar and white-collar employees and , as a result , declining living standards among working people and increased social expenditures .  
Concerned that , since the adoption of its resolutions 47 / 19 , 48 / 16 , 49 / 9 , 50 / 10 , 51 / 17 , 52 / 10 and 53 / 4 , further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied , and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries ,

Also stresses the importance of additional debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
The precarious socio-economic situation of LDCs , the structural weaknesses inherent in their economies and the adverse external environment they faced relegated those countries to a weak competitive position .  
The growing openness of some economies made them more vulnerable to adverse external effects and promoted the spread of local economic troubles to other regions of the world , as the recent financial crisis in Asia had demonstrated .  
The representatives of the people of Iraq urge an immediate halt to the daily attacks being carried out by United States and British aircraft under the cloak of the so-called aerial exclusion zones imposed on Iraq without any legal basis , inasmuch as these attacks target civilian and services-related installations such as electric power stations and water treatment plants in such a way as to affect the lives of Iraqis in an adverse manner and inflict harm on them .  
Concerned that , since the adoption of its resolutions 47 / 19 , 48 / 16 , 49 / 9 , 50 / 10 , 51 / 17 , 52 / 10 and 53 / 4 , further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied , and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries ,  
In Africa , in particular , children were all too often the victims of armed conflict , a situation aggravated by natural disaster , disease , an adverse economic environment and the growing burden of foreign debt , while in Palestine and other occupied territories , children were being killed , tortured and imprisoned without having committed any crime .  
In accordance with article 19 of the Convention , there was an urgent need to consider modalities for advance informed agreement outlining appropriate procedures in the field of safe transfer , handling and use of any a living modified organism resulting from biotechnology that might have adverse effects on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
Given that oil is the mainstay of the national economy in the GCC States and the major source of energy in the world as a whole , the Council decided to proceed with the formulation of a unified stance with regard to oil-market conditions that will ensure a balance between supply and demand and will be able to cope with fortuitous events that upset the market and have an adverse impact on the interests of oil producers and consumers alike .  
Conscious that oil is the mainstay of the national economy in the GCC States and the major source of energy in the world as a whole , the Council decided to proceed with the formulation of a unified stance with regard to oil-market conditions that will ensure a balance between supply and demand and will be able to cope with unanticipated events that upset the market and have an adverse impact on the interests of producers and consumers alike .  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism , in all its forms and manifestations , as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of States ;

Significant regularities observed in countries belonging to each of the really existing systemic families led to a comparative assessment where favourable , and adverse trends were mixed on both sides , making objective economic comparison more difficult ( see table 2 ) .  
In view of the serious financial implications of the increased and unprecedented number of ex post facto presentations by field missions , regional economic commissions and international criminal tribunals to their respective local Committees on Contracts , and , when required , to the Headquarters Committee on Contracts ( " the Committee " ) , and in order to ameliorate the adverse consequences of this improper practice , the following provisions should be implemented immediately :

Coupled with the adverse effects of widespread and pervasive poverty , the phenomenon of ageing will have far-reaching implications for the efforts of developing countries to achieve the sustained economic growth and social development which are fundamental for ensuring a better quality of life for the entire population .  
Faced with adverse and sometimes extreme conditions whose horrors the modern media flash instantaneously into all our households , and when the response capability of countries , particularly of the developing countries , is diminished or significantly undermined , mankind suddenly seems reconciled , empathetic and unified ; and from that perspective , humanitarian assistance provided by the United Nations is beneficial and of great value to stricken populations . 
We are all aware of the grave repercussions of such illegal measures and the adverse consequences of making the whole region face an untenable situation , and our deliberations are being held to reject Israeli settlement policies which are aimed at altering the character , legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory .  
The geophysical characteristics of many small islands leave them vulnerable to extreme climatological , seismic and volcanic events , and more critically to periods of drought , low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion and soil erosion , among others , and they require increased attention to watershed management , land and water use planning .  
Where globalization has adverse effects on the provision of an access to social services for all , these effects need to be addressed by positive measures at the local , national , regional and international levels in order to minimize them and to promote social development .  
Many delegations stated that unsustainable consumption and production patterns include both adverse environmental impacts arising from the excess consumption of natural resources , particularly in the developed countries , and unemployment , poverty and underconsumption of basic goods and services , particularly in developing countries .  
To take strong and appropriate action , through the development and enforcement of specific legislation measures , against any kind of illegal , abusive or exploitative tourist activity , including sexual exploitation abuse , in recognition of the fact that such activities have particularly adverse impacts and pose significant social , health and cultural threats , and that all countries have a role to play in the efforts to stamp them out ;  
The Commission invites relevant agencies , particularly the International Maritime Organization , to evaluate whether existing regulations on marine pollution and compliance with them are sufficient to provide adequate protection to fragile coastal zones from adverse impacts as a result of tourist vessel activities .  
Of the estimated 3.1-billion people in rural areas , approximately 2-billion have no access to electricity and about the same number of people rely on traditional energy sources for cooking , such as wood , charcoal and animal and plant wastes , which are associated with adverse environmental effects at the local level .  
The Committee notes that since 1994 , in addressing the budget deficits by slashing social expenditure , the State party has not paid sufficient attention to the adverse consequences for the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights by the Canadian population as a whole , and by vulnerable groups in particular .  
With all key positions in the Missions political and administrative staffing structure filled at the early stages of the Missions deployment , the potential adverse impact of the reported initial vacancy rates on the delivery of the Missions mandated activities was minimized .  
The experience is that these soft forms of tourism can be just as destructive as mass tourism , if they are not planned , developed and managed in a sustainable manner , so as to ensure that there are no adverse effects on the natural environment or the local sociocultural fabric , and that the local community is involved in all development and management phases .  
The main adverse impacts of tourism on the environment are connected to pressure on natural resources , harm to wildlife and habitats ( with associated loss of biological diversity ) , the generation of pollution and wastes , and social and cultural pressures related to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
Some unilateral coercive measures applied against Iran , as well as their adverse economic and social effects on the Iranian people , are reflected in the report ( A 53-293 ) submitted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to the General Assembly under the agenda item entitled ' Human rights questions , including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms ' .  
When , at its fifty-second session , the Committee had been required to take a decision on paragraph 21 of the text that was to become resolution 52-118 , his delegation had drawn attention to the tendency to adopt resolutions that were political in nature on the methods of work of bodies which had been established pursuant to international instruments.If that trend continued , it might have an adverse impact on the effective implementation of the instruments .  
The indirect evidence , which is itself sketchy , is that small island developing States , each one at its own pace , are increasingly using a variety of economic instruments and environmental tools such as the environmental impact assessment ( EIA ) and geographic information systems ( GIS ) , strengthening regulations , reforming relevant policies , and implementing priority projects at the sectoral and subsectoral levels to prevent adverse impacts on the environment .  
During the period under review , a number of small island developing States in all regions have been affected by adverse economic developments which have impaired their financial capacity to implement even priority sustainable development measures.This is particularly true for the Pacific small island developing States , where a combination of internal and external factors have impinged adversely on their economic performance .  
At the impact of the current armed conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , at continuing serious violations of human rights , and international humanitarian law by all parties , in particular :  
Therefore , while contractual arrangements may be agreed to by the parties to counter the adverse effects of subsequent regulatory changes ( see paras . 122-125 ) , regulatory agencies would be well advised to avoid excessive regulation or unreasonably frequent changes in existing rules .  
We are of the view that illegal , unregulated , unreported fishing activities have a severe adverse impact on the effectiveness of measures for the sustainable management and exploitation of marine living resources .

Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
It was a matter of concern that some developed countries continued to impose unilateral protectionist measures and to create new types of protectionism , such as environmental labelling and social clauses , that would have an adverse impact on economic growth and development in the developing countries . 
effective participation in international trade depended also on the solution of the problems they faced in implementing the complex set of Uruguay Round agreements , for which they would require external support , which should have two objectives : to assist them in offsetting the adverse consequences in the short run and to ensure that they could take full advantage of the special measures accorded to them under the various agreements .  
that Burundi continues to face a social , human rights and political crisis that has existed since October 1993 , the adverse effects of which are endangering the national economy , as evidenced by the destruction of economic and social infrastructures , declining production and trade and , as a result , shrinking public revenue ,  
is evident that the continuation of this kind of irresponsible unilateral conduct and arrogant behaviour by the United States Government will set an alarming precedent with far-reaching adverse implications for international peace and security and create uncertainty and insecurity in international relations , for which the United States alone must bear full responsibility .  
The Meeting should therefore give high priority to undertaking a comprehensive review of the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements , with a view to adopting specific and concrete measures to obviate adverse effects to the least developed countries and net food-importing developing countries arising from the implementation of the agreements ; reverse the marginalization of the least developed countries ; and strengthen their capacity to compete in the global economy .  
Negative economic growth rates , persistent imbalances in the commercial and financial fields , increased transitional or structural unemployment , and an absence of coordination in exchange rates and trade policies these are some of the problems connected with the system of the developed world which have an adverse impact on the developing countries .  
Furthermore , pursuant to resolution 1994 / 47 of the Commission on Human Rights , the Secretary-General informed that body , in his report contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 43 , that application of unilateral coercive measures is incompatible with the principle of international cooperation , has an adverse impact on the economies of developing countries suffering under the measures and constitutes a serious violation of the human rights of the individuals , groups and peoples affected .  
Health problems related to adverse environmental conditions , including a lack of access to safe water and sanitation , inadequate waste management , poor drainage , air pollution , and exposure to excessive noise levels , as well as ineffective and inadequate health services , exact a heavy toll on the quality of life and the overall contribution to society of millions of people . 
Reaffirming that sustained economic growth and sustainable development are essential for the prevention of and preparedness for natural disasters and similar disasters with an adverse impact on the environment and that special attention should be given to disaster prevention and preparedness by the Governments concerned as well as by the international community ,  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
Renews its invitation to the international financial institutions , in particular the International Monetary Fund , the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , to continue to pay special attention to the economic problems of the affected States and their adverse social impact and to consider ways and means for mobilizing and providing resources on appropriate terms for mitigating the continuing negative impact of the sanctions on the efforts of the affected States for financial stabilization as well as for development of regional transport and communications infrastructure ;  
Considering that Burundi continues to face a social , human rights and political crisis that has existed since October 1993 , the adverse effects of which are endangering the national economy , as evidenced by the destruction of economic and social infrastructures , declining production and trade and , as a result , shrinking public revenue ,  
The aforementioned 1972 London Dumping Convention for the prevention of marine pollution by waste dumping has been significantly strengthened by amendments in 1993 banning the dumping of radioactive , industrial and incineration wastes ; a new protocol under discussion would ban all marine disposal except in specific cases that could be shown to have no adverse environmental impacts .  
That has required close coordination of macroeconomic policies among major industrial countries to prevent the harmful effects on national economies of any adverse market reactions to actual or perceived changes in national economic situations and associated policies . 
Furthermore , Governments should , where feasible , promote the development of sustainable aquaculture as a means to increase food production and improve the economic basis for local community development , taking into account : ( a ) the need for assistance and transfer of technology and know-how to developing countries ; ( b ) the potential adverse impacts on the environment ; ( c ) the risks of introducing alien species ; and ( d ) the need for improved knowledge in the use of genetic engineering .  
On the one hand , Argentina , Mexico and , to some extent , Uruguay had to manage their economic policies in a climate marked by a sharp contraction of external financing , in which they faced severe slumps in domestic demand , with adverse effects on output and fiscal revenues .  
Barring adverse weather conditions , the progress made in enhancing political and social stability in some countries and the benefits accruing from the impact of domestic economic-policy reforms , coupled with favourable developments in the international economic environment , lead to estimates of regional growth in output of 2.9 per cent in 1996 , as against 2.3 per cent in 1995 .  
In addition , their capacity to take advantage of the expansionary cycles of international and regional trade and to withstand adverse conditions and financial instability must be increased through the diversification of products and markets , the search for foreign investment and partnerships , the use of domestic stabilization mechanisms and better linkages between exports and other productive activities .  
The Mission considers that the deterioration of the conditions in which defendants are held pending trial , and the lengthening of sentences , could have a generalized adverse impact on the protection of individuals against the arbitrary use of State power , while paradoxically failing to achieve the declared aim of protecting the human rights of crime victims .  
Drug abuse has devastating social effects , including its harmful impact on youth , families , other social groups and the workplace , and adverse health consequences as well , including those resulting from the relationship between substance abuse and a number of major diseases and disorders and the spread of human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) .  
Also in that resolution , the General Assembly renewed its invitation to the international financial institutions to continue to pay special attention to the economic problems of the affected States and their adverse social impact and to consider ways and means for mobilizing and providing resources on appropriate terms for mitigating the continuing negative impact of the sanctions on those States .  
The Assembly renewed its request to the competent organs , programmes and specialized agencies of the United Nations system to take into consideration , in programming their development activities , the special needs of the affected States and to consider providing assistance to them from their special programme resources , and renewed its appeal to all States , on an urgent basis , to provide technical , financial and material assistance to the affected States to mitigate the adverse impact of the sanctions on their economies .  
The objectives of the AEQM Plan are to analyse the specific impact of productive activity on all environmental systems in a given geographical space ; to assess the assimilative capacity of those systems ; and based on these two technical assessments , to establish a set of environmental priorities and action plans to improve environmental quality and reduce the adverse environmental impact on air , water and land resources .  
Periodic natural and man-made disasters and other adverse situations , including political instability and civil strife and problems of refugees and their attendant negative consequences , continue to imperil the fragile socio-economic conditions in many least developed countries .  
In its resolution 50 / 58 K , the General Assembly expressed its concern , inter alia , that Burundi continued to face a social and political crisis , the adverse consequences of which were manifest in human rights abuses , the destruction of economic and social infrastructures , declining production and external trade and shrinking public revenue .  
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation also expressed the urgent need for the international community to call upon certain developed countries immediately to eliminate laws and regulations with adverse extra-territorial impacts and other forms of coercive economic measures against developing countries .  
Recognize that increased use of solar energy can reduce environmental degradation caused by adverse human activities , such as industrial pollution and deforestation , and that it is the responsibility of Governments and all sectors of civil society to work together to find lasting solutions to problems threatening the sustainable development of humanity ;  
There are still many countries in desperate economic circumstances , with high levels of external debt , minimal foreign investment , low levels of savings , poor terms of trade , adverse balances of payments and minimal participation in the global economy .  
The right of option must be exercised within a reasonable period from the date of succession and must have no adverse consequences for the persons concerned , particularly with regard to their residence in the successor State or their movable or immovable property in that State - a new rule which derived from the progressive development of law and accorded with international human rights standards .  
Concerned that , since the adoption of its resolutions 47 / 19 , 48 / 16 , 49 / 9 and 50 / 10 , further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied , and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries ,  
Concerned that , since the adoption of its resolutions 47 / 19 , 48 / 16 , 49 / 9 and 50 / 10 , further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied , and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries , 1 .  Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General [ 1 ] on the implementation of resolution 50 / 10 ;  
Recognizing further that the international community at large and , in particular , international institutions involved in providing economic and financial assistance should continue to take into account and address in a more effective manner the special economic problems of affected third States arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter in view of their magnitude and of the adverse impact on the economy of those States ,  
To this end , every State must take the requisite legislative measures to ensure that the law intervenes by placing restrictions and controls on the biological sciences so that these restrictions and controls can help to curb scientific progress that has an adverse effect on human values and creates legal and ethical problems .  
Recognizing further that the international community at large and , in particular , international institutions involved in providing economic and financial assistance should continue to take into account and address in a more effective manner the special economic problems of affected third States arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter , in view of their magnitude and of the adverse impact on the economy of those States ,  
Firmly upholds the validity of the principles cited in comparable situations by certain Governments which imposed the embargo against Burundi , namely , that the imposition on a State of an economic , commercial or financial blockade also has adverse consequences for the sovereignty and interests of other countries and that the imposition of one State 's jurisdiction on another State is contrary to the principles of international law ;  
Firmly upholds the validity of the principles cited in comparable situations by certain Governments which imposed the embargo against Burundi , namely , that the imposition on a State of an economic , commercial or financial blockade also has adverse consequences for the sovereignty and interests of other countries and that the imposition of one State 's jurisdiction on another State is contrary to the principles of international law ;  
countries , migration pressures due to climatic change , the protection of migrant women and children from abuse by their sponsors , the right of receiving countries to regulate access to their territory , the adverse consequences of forced migration , the situation of persons whose asylum claims have been rejected , the trafficking in women and children , prostitution and coercive adoption , and the sudden and massive arrival of refugees and displaced persons in need of international protection .  
Many countries ( which have suffered and continue to suffer great material and financial damage as a result of sanctions ) are therefore completely justified in their desire to elaborate basic criteria and conditions for the application and implementation of mandatory sanctions , and develop ways and means of preventing the adverse consequences of such sanctions or , at least , reducing them to a minimum .  
Reiterates the unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of States ;  
The need for such volunteer effort is greater today than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse or HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of society , given the concern of the international community for the eradication of poverty and given the contemporary trend for civil society , in partnership with Governments and the private sector , to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process .  
Convinced that the need for volunteer effort is greater than ever , in light of the adverse impact of such global problems as environmental degradation , poverty , drug abuse and HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of societies , and of the trend for civil society , in partnership with government and the private sector , to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process ,  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the annihilation of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening territorial integrity and international peace and security , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the annihilation of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening territorial integrity and international peace and security , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;  
Strategies at the regional , national and local levels for reducing the potential risk due to ambient and indoor air pollution should be developed , bearing in mind their serious impacts on human health , including strategies to make parents , families and communities aware of the adverse environmental health impacts of tobacco .  
The objectives envisaged in this section should reflect the need for equity , adequate energy supplies and increasing energy consumption in developing countries and should take into account the situation of countries that are highly dependent on income generated from the production , processing and export , and / or consumption , of fossil fuels and that have serious difficulties in switching to alternative sources of energy , and the situation of countries highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change .  
Several primary needs should be met : to devise effective and coherent arrangements for information and assessment of the impact of sanctions on third States ; to ensure appropriate access by third States to the process ; to develop a method of assessing actual adverse impact ; to explore practical and innovative measures of assistance ; and to enhance coordination and cooperation among relevant institutions and organizations both within and outside the United Nations system .  
The States members of the European Union had given ample proof of their determination to minimize the detrimental effects suffered by third States , not only through their support of the measures stipulated in the relevant resolutions , but also through substantial economic and humanitarian assistance , especially to those countries which had experienced the adverse effects of the measures taken against the former Yugoslavia .  
It focuses on the implementation of crucial activities that exemplify the Decade 's objective to reduce through concerted international action , especially in developing countries , the loss of life , property damage , and social and economic disruption caused by natural and similar disasters that have an adverse impact upon the environment .  
Many countries ( which have suffered and continue to suffer great material and financial damage as a result of sanctions ) are therefore completely justified in their desire to elaborate basic criteria and conditions for the application and implementation of mandatory sanctions , and develop ways and means of preventing the adverse consequences of such sanctions or , at least , reducing them to a minimum .  
Aware that global increases in population , rising levels of urbanization and unsustainable patterns of consumption and production , particularly in developed countries , are stressing the finite natural resource base , stressing fragile ecosystems and causing environmental degradation and adverse health effects ,  
It highlights the continuation of the basically adverse nature of an international economic environment characterized by the North 's increasing monopoly of the decisive elements of development : trade , financial and stock markets , flows of capital and investment , and technology transfer .  
To ensure broad-based support for drug control objectives , UNDCP has sought to involve civil society and foster awareness of the adverse political , economic and social impact of illicit drug trafficking and abuse .  
Recognizing further that the international community at large and , in particular , international institutions involved in providing economic and financial assistance should continue to take into account and address in a more effective manner the special economic problems of affected third States arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter , in view of their magnitude and of the adverse impact on the economy of those States ,  
Issues of biosafety have emerged with regard to national capacity needed for the implementation of effective in situ conservation measures , through establishing and maintaining the means to regulate , manage or control risks associated with invasive species and / or the use and release of living modified organisms resulting from biotechnology and likely to have adverse environmental impacts on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
A considerable number of non-governmental organizations , women groups and indigenous people in both developed and developing countries have expressed concern that the promotion of biotechnology is quite undesirable without some international mechanism in place to protect people from possible adverse effects resulting from genetically altered foods and animals , as well as from disadvantages that a biotechnology-driven market might bring to small farmers in developing countries .  
The Commission requested the Secretary-General to establish in the Centre for Human Rights a focal unit with the specific task of following up on the findings of the Special Rapporteur and other issues related to the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights .  
Given the gravity of the concerns highlighted , the mandate remains a most sensitive and difficult one since it relates to a State Member of the United Nations where governmental authority is absent and a State administration non _ existent , with the adverse impact this implies on the observance and protection of basic human rights and freedoms .  
The country does not have the technical , physical or human resources to manufacture weapons of mass destruction , since its principal concern is to promote its economic development plan and to mitigate the adverse impact that the coercive measures imposed on our people have had on all aspects of life .  
Decides to continue consideration of the question of the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights at its fifty _ fourth session under the agenda item entitled : Question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , and study of special problems which the developing countries face in their efforts to achieve these human rights .  
Reiterates the unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of States ;  
Recommends that long-term public awareness and information programmes related to natural disasters , including those induced by El Ni �� and similar disasters with an adverse impact on the environment , be integrated into comprehensive national disaster management programmes that focus on preventive strategies for risk reduction and that those programmes be included as integral elements of United Nations support for social and economic development programmes ;  
The underlying reason for submitting the draft resolution was the fact that the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights in an increasing number of developing countries had reached alarming proportions and had had adverse economic , social and cultural effects .  
The Committee also suggests that a multidisciplinary monitoring and coordinating system be established to assess the progress achieved and difficulties encountered in the realization of the rights recognized by the Convention at the national and local levels , paying particular attention to the adverse effects of economic policies on children .  
Strategies at the regional , national and local levels for reducing the potential risk due to ambient and indoor air pollution should be developed , bearing in mind their serious impacts on human health , including strategies to make parents , families and communities aware of the adverse environmental health impacts of tobacco .  
The objectives envisaged in this section should reflect the need for equity , adequate energy supplies and increasing energy consumption in developing countries and should take into account the situation of countries that are highly dependent on income generated from the production , processing and export , and / or consumption , of fossil fuels and that have serious difficulties in switching to alternative sources of energy , and the situation of countries highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change .  
Political events worldwide have shown that war , national and regional conflicts , occupation , the imposition of fait accompli policies and the denial of the legitimate rights of peoples under occupation have an adverse impact not only on peace and security in a region but on economic , social and environmental development .  
The international community and States should take all the necessary measures to protect the rights of vulnerable segments of the population and give very serious consideration to holding a large _ scale discussion on the practice of embargoes and economic sanctions which are imposed on States and have adverse consequences for the realization of the economic , social and cultural rights of the segments concerned ;  
Convinced that the need for volunteer effort is greater than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse and HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of societies , and the contemporary trend for civil society _ in partnership with Government and the private sector _ to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process ,  
The phenomenon of protracted and growing displacement , warfare that targets civilians and demolishes communities , and the disintegration of political , institutional and economic structures in crisis countries all point to the need for a better understanding of crises and their adverse impact on vulnerable communities .  
Deeply concerned at the recurrence of armed conflicts exacerbated by the illicit transfer of arms , their incidence on the enjoyment of human rights and on the application of international humanitarian law , as well as by their adverse consequences for international and regional peace and security ,  
This performance reflected the combined effects of a variety of factors : the results of most countries efforts to control severe macroeconomic imbalances in 1995 , adverse climate conditions which affected primary production , and the drop in the international prices of the main export goods .  
Such adverse effects may occur not only whenever specific postal material is the subject of sanctions , but also when air traffic to a sanctioned State is interrupted or suspended .  
Deeply concerned at the recurrence of armed conflicts exacerbated by the illicit transfer of arms , their incidence on the enjoyment of human rights and on the application of international humanitarian law , as well as by their adverse consequences for international and regional peace and security ,  
The adverse effects included an increase in poverty , a reduction in the financial resources that were vital for development , the placing in jeopardy of fiscal and monetary policy and economic reform , and an erosion of the capacity of the country targeted to participate fully in world trade and capital markets .  
Some countries were still suffering from the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes , particularly with regard to health and educational infrastructure and services , which necessitated strengthening of international cooperation based on the adoption and implementation of concrete measures aimed at mitigating and completely eliminating their adverse impact .  
It was paradoxical that , as indicated in the same report , a strong official presence which could provide assistance and address global problems that put development progress at risk was still lacking , at a time when the world had been freed from the adverse effects of the cold war and the needs of the developing countries were growing rapidly .  
The decisive response pronounced by Members of the United Nations and several international and regional organizations against the policy of unilateralism , as manifested in the form of authoritarianism , illustrates the profound anxiety and sensitivity of the international community towards the proliferation and the adverse consequences of such coercive and illogical measures .  
The Islamic Republic of Iran , as a Member of the United Nations and a concerned State , while reiterating the principle of the inalienable right of States to choose their political , social , cultural and economic systems , calls upon the Member States to resist such unlawful actions and to make every effort to eliminate their adverse impacts ; and thus preserve the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , in particular those pertaining to national sovereignty , political independence , territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States .  
Recognizing the potentially adverse impact of large fluctuations among the major international currencies on developing countries , Ministers consider it imperative that the Fund fully exercise its powers to ensure effective surveillance over the macroeconomic policies of the countries involved in the management of these currencies .  
Many countries acknowledged that the root causes of the continuing financial crisis were , on the one hand , a poorly thought out and excessive expansion of the scope of United Nations activities during the previous decade , which had had an adverse impact on the effectiveness of the activities of almost all the specialized agencies , funds and programmes of the United Nations , and , on the other hand , the unjust apportionment of the Organization 's expenses among its Member States .  
The expert group expressed deep concern about the potential adverse effects of coercive economic measures on the structure of international relations , in particular in the area of trade and development .  
The deployment of drug control as a political mechanism , in whatever form , by countries against other countries , will have grave , adverse consequences for effective and reliable international , regional and bilateral cooperation .  
It was also essential to promote an enabling international economic environment which ensured a minimum of stability to counter adverse effects arising from sudden movements in private capital flows .  
The falling birth rate is attributable to the sharp deterioration in society 's social and economic situation which , by reducing the level of family welfare , has adverse effects on reproductive behaviour .  
The consequences of the current repressive approach not only affect the immediate humanitarian situation , they also have a direct and major adverse impact on the prospects for a just and lasting political solution .  
As reported in this year 's Trade and Development Report , there is ample evidence to show that Africa 's external debt burden is in fact having a severe adverse effect on both public and private investment and renewed growth .  
The geophysical settings of many small island developing States leave them vulnerable not only to extreme climatological and seismic events but more critically to periods of low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion , soil erosion and mass wasting .  
As chemical and organic pollutants become more pervasive , the adverse impact on marine environments is increasing , and long-term accumulation in marine ecosystems is threatening biodiversity and the local fishing industry upon which many small island developing States are highly dependent .  
The threat of recovery for each and every managerial mistake would stifle initiative , make managers adverse to taking calculated risks when situations so require , and create a culture where procrastination is considered more prudent than decisive and timely action .  
Therefore , while contractual arrangements may be agreed to by the parties to counter the adverse effects of subsequent regulatory changes ( see paras . 60-63 ) , regulatory bodies would be well advised to avoid excessive regulation or unreasonably frequent changes in existing rules .  
As to clandestine structures at the local level , the adverse effects of the continuing impunity of these groups can be gauged , in respect of so-called social cleansing operations , by an incident which occurred on the road to Bethel , La Libertad , in El Petn .  
In that framework , the State played a central role , in cooperation with civil society and economic agents , in counter-balancing the adverse effects on the poor of structural adjustment and macroeconomic policies .  
As noted in document E / CN . 5 / 1999 / 4 , although the multilateral financial institutions have acknowledged the importance of protecting or compensating the poor for the adverse effects of adjustment measures , the poor nevertheless continue to bear the brunt of hardships arising from macroeconomic and structural adjustment .  
At the impact of the current conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and at continuing serious violations of human rights , fundamental freedoms and relevant provisions of international humanitarian law perpetrated by all parties to the conflict , in particular :  
At the impact of the current conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and at continuing serious violations of human rights , fundamental freedoms and relevant provisions of international humanitarian law perpetrated by all parties to the conflict , in particular :  
To take strong and appropriate action , through the development and enforcement of specific legislation / measures , against any kind of illegal , abusive or exploitative tourist activity , including sexual exploitation / abuse , in recognition of the fact that such activities have particularly adverse impacts and pose significant social , health and cultural threats , and that all countries have a role to play in the efforts to stamp them out ;  
Invites relevant agencies , particularly the International Maritime Organization , to evaluate whether existing regulations on marine pollution and compliance with them are sufficient to provide adequate protection to fragile coastal zones from adverse impacts as a result of tourist vessel activities ;  
Calling for common action to tackle development challenges arising from globalization and the adverse effects of the financial crisis , ACC members committed themselves to working together to monitor the impact of the crisis on societies and individuals , help individual countries carry out the necessary structural and institutional reforms , and strengthen or build basic social services , livelihood opportunities and safety nets for the least fortunate .  
Pursuant to agreement with the indigenous peoples concerned , just and fair compensation shall be provided for any such activities and measures taken to mitigate adverse environmental , economic , social , cultural or spiritual impact .  
In a shared vision , the United Nations system should aim to work for a world in which HIV / AIDS transmission is substantially reduced ; where there is affordable treatment , care and support ; where there is a substantial reduction in individual and collective vulnerability to HIV / AIDS ; where there is a significant alleviation of the adverse impact of the epidemic on individuals , communities , and nations ; and where stigma and denial are addressed .  
The Commission , having recognized that the increasing interdependence of economies and the interconnected nature of computer systems call for concerted and coordinated action at the regional and global levels , urged all members and associate members to take early and effective action to bring their countries to the highest possible level of year 2000 ( Y2K ) readiness , not only for their own benefit but also to minimize adverse Y2K effects on vital sectors of other countries .  
A major success of the Decade has been a widespread acceptance of the fact that the growing risk of disasters associated with natural hazards , frequently compounded by uncontrolled or adverse human practices , must be mitigated .  
At its fiftieth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its decision 1998 / 112 , decided to continue consideration of the adverse consequences of economic sanctions on human rights at its fifty _ first session under the agenda sub _ item entitled Implications of humanitarian activities for the enjoyment of human rights .  
In its concluding observations regarding Guatemala ( E / C . 12 / 1 / Add . 3 of 28 May 1996 ) the Committee expressed serious concern at the adverse effects of the economic and social disparities on the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights by the majority of the population , particularly by the indigenous and rural populations of Guatemala .  
The African continent is subject to a wide range of natural hazards , and suffers constantly from natural and other disasters , which have serious adverse effects on societies and national economies as well as on scarce human and material resources .  
This constitutes an adverse structural shift in the economy , though one which still could be reversed through sustained export growth driven by a combination of domestic and foreign investment and further industrial and agricultural production diversification .  
Although this represents a slight increase over the previous year , FDI continues to be hampered by some characteristics shared by most of the LDCs , such as adverse climatic conditions , small domestic markets , export vulnerability , limited transport and communications infrastructure , insufficient domestic investment and lack of a skilled labour force , as well as lack of information on profitable business opportunities ( box 2 ) .  
The geophysical characteristics of many small islands leave them vulnerable to extreme climatological , seismic and volcanic events , and more critically to periods of drought , low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion and soil erosion , among others , and they require increased attention to watershed management , land and water use planning .  
Venezuela believes that unilateral measures that are extraterritorial and coercive in nature , such as the embargo imposed against Cuba , have a negative effect on the legal regime which defines economic and trade relations between nations and an adverse impact on the efforts that have been carried out in order to achieve economic integration at both the continental and subregional levels .  
The two sides further undertake to notify each other immediately in the event of any accidental , unauthorized or unexplained incident that could create the risk of fallout with adverse consequences for both sides , or an outbreak of a nuclear war between the two countries , as well as to adopt measures aimed at diminishing the possibility of such actions , or of such incidents being misrepresented by the other .  
With regard to the indirect effects of economic sanctions , among the most visible and tangible signs of their adverse impact on the economies of so-called third countries are foregone tax and tariff revenues , job losses among both blue-collar and white-collar employees and , as a result , declining living standards among working people and increased social expenditures .  
Concerned that , since the adoption of its resolutions 47 / 19 , 48 / 16 , 49 / 9 , 50 / 10 , 51 / 17 , 52 / 10 and 53 / 4 , further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied , and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries ,  
Taking into account that elderly refugees are particularly affected by social disintegration , chronic dependency and other adverse aspects of the refugee condition , calls on States , UNHCR and other concerned actors to make renewed efforts to ensure that the rights , needs and dignity of elderly refugee are fully respected and addressed through appropriate programme activities ;  
Also stresses the importance of additional debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
The precarious socio-economic situation of LDCs , the structural weaknesses inherent in their economies and the adverse external environment they faced relegated those countries to a weak competitive position .  
The growing openness of some economies made them more vulnerable to adverse external effects and promoted the spread of local economic troubles to other regions of the world , as the recent financial crisis in Asia had demonstrated .  
The representatives of the people of Iraq urge an immediate halt to the daily attacks being carried out by United States and British aircraft under the cloak of the so-called aerial exclusion zones imposed on Iraq without any legal basis , inasmuch as these attacks target civilian and services-related installations such as electric power stations and water treatment plants in such a way as to affect the lives of Iraqis in an adverse manner and inflict harm on them .
