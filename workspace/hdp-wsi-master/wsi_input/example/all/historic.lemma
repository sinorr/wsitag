In the new situation of reform and opening-up and developing a socialist market economy , when the historic topic of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " lies ahead , it is both the earnest expectation of the Party and the masses and the objective requirement for implementing our military 's sacred mission to strengthen the military 's ideological and morality construction and to cultivate revolutionary military professions with the " Four Haves " .  
In a new historic stage , the construction of the ranks of cadres faces many new cases and new problems , among which is the conspicuous contradiction of the scientific and technological qualities in the ranks of cadres failing to conform to the requirements for constructing our military modernization and for winning regional wars under high-tech conditions .  
The main points of dialectic materialism and historic materialism are : The world is material , unified , and interactively linked , and change is developed from low to high , from simple to complex ;  
Since the historic meeting between the leaders of the DPRK and ROK , Kim Chong-il and Kim Tae-chung , held in mid-June in which the " North-South Joint Declaration " was signed , both sides have developed a series of exchanges and cooperation in political , economic , cultural , and other fields , with gratifying progress made .

As students of military academies , we shoulder the historic mission of relying on science and technology to build a strong army and accelerate the modernization of our army 's armament and equipment .  We must more consciously strengthen our cultivation of Marxist theories and scientific spirit , arm ourselves with modern scientific knowledge , and exert to spread the fruits of socialist spiritual and cultural progress .  We must never allow fallacies of " Falungong " to contaminate our sacred school campuses .  
Under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the CMC with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , the whole army persisted in being guided by Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on army building in the new period and Chairman Jiang Zemin 's series of important expositions on army building , and implemented in depth the military strategic guidelines for the new era ; closely centering on the two historic topics of " winning when fighting " and " not degenerating , " we achieved very great success in vigorously enhancing overall construction centered on modernization .  
A certain unit in the navy has actively explored adapting to the new path of future warfare , characterized by rapid and cross-territory emergency support logistics , realizing the two great leaps of changing from the one type of solitary missile support unit of the past to multiple series and multiple types of missile support , and from transferring missiles from reserves for support into direct provision of real-fire missile support to operational troops .  This has enabled the troops ' missile support capability to manifest historic changes .  
It has not only failed to make progress in formulating policies or in implementing practical measures for enhancing cross-strait political mutual trust .  On the contrary , it has regressed in this regard .  In particular , let us take as examples some recent events including the " Chin Mei-ling incident , " the " incident of Yoshinori Kobayashi 's entry to Taiwan , " and the " incident where Japan revised a textbook on historic facts on Japan 's invasion into China . "

To smoothly accomplish the Tenth Five-Year Plan , achieving the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive , and basically realizing socialist modernization in the middle of this century is the glorious and arduous historic mission for the working class and the broad working masses in our country .  
We must , with a strong sense of historic mission , actively plunge into the great practice of socialist modernization , and fully display our initiative and creativity to fulfill the key tasks in our country 's development in the period of the Tenth Five-Year Plan , and promote the sustained , high-speed , and healthy development of the national economy .  
Today , old comrades like us who used to work under his direct leadership and who stood with him through storm and stress in shouldering the historic mission are cherishing all the more this long-tested and loyal communist fighter , proletarian revolutionary and China 's outstanding leader on the diplomatic front .

At the moment of commemorating the 80th anniversary of the party 's founding , we should seriously sum up the historical achievements of the united front and more profoundly understand its development regularity and historic mission .  This is of great significance for further consolidating and developing the most extensive patriotic united front and make it better serve the fulfillment of the three major tasks of the party and the state in the new century .  
In the development course of our party over the past 80 years , the three generations of the leading bodies of the party separately with Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin at the core established and developed the most extensive united front to win over the people 's support and rally strength to the maximum .  The united front made historic contributions to China 's revolution , construction , and reforms and scored brilliant achievements .

In our party 's magnificent course of development over the past 80 years , the three generations of its central collective leadership with Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin as the core , respectively , have set up and developed the broadest united front , and it has won over the hearts of people and strengthened their cohesion to the maximum ; thus , the united front has made historic contributions to China 's revolution , construction , and reform , adding a glorious chapter to Chinese history .  
As the vanguard of the Chinese working class , the CPC always represents the requirements for the development of China 's advanced social productive forces , the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest possible masses of the people in China . Such a class status and such a historic mission have determined that the united front can be led only by the CPC .

We must keep firmly in mind the purpose of the party , maintain close links with the masses , and serve the people wholeheartedly ; we must maintain the lofty communist values and revolutionary integrity and be the first to bear hardship and the last to enjoy comforts ; we must fortify our convictions , strengthen our spirits , engage in unostentatious hard work , advance in a pioneering spirit , and add a new chapter to history by scoring new historic achievements .

Kok appreciated the achievements scored by China in human rights .  Because of the differences in historic , economic , and social development between various countries , it is very important for them to carry out constructive dialogue based on mutual respect .  
Therefore , one of important tasks for the return of Hong Kong to the motherland was to find out a chief executive who truly loves the country and Hong Kong and who can shoulder the heavy duties at a historic turning point .  The election of Tung Chee-hwa was widely acclaimed by people at home and abroad as well as by people of the central government and the international community .  Hong Kong residents also are happy to have such a person as their chief executive .  
The meeting maintained that the Central Ideological and Political Work Meeting is an important meeting held at the historic moment of our party in its advance toward the new century , and also a major move of the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core which adheres to the strategic principle of " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to both " for promoting the cause of reform , opening up , and modernization in a comprehensive way .  
Shortly after Hong Kong completed the historic turn of being recovered by the motherland , it encountered the fierce impact of the Asian financial storm .  At the critical moment , when Hong Kong was being attacked from all sides by international speculators , the central government resolutely indicated that it would support , at all costs , keeping the Hong Kong currency 's exchange rate linked to the US dollar .  This greatly bolstered the SAR Government 's determination to safeguard the Hong Kong people 's wealth .  
This year is the last year of the " National Eight-seven Plan for Tackling Tough Problems in Poverty Relief " ; all localities and departments concerned must seriously implement the central arrangements for development for poverty relief ; with poor villages as the main battleground , and with the focus on developing crop cultivation and livestock raising and the construction of basic farmland , they should adhere to the guideline of developmental poverty relief and concentrate forces and increase input in an effort to fulfill this historic task .

"  
This " Proposal " which outlines the grand blueprint for China 's modernization drive in the 21st century is the phasal guideline for the ruling party to realize its dream of making the country strong and prosperous in the new century .  It is a historic document guiding China 's economic and social development in the next five years .  It is therefore of great and far-reaching significance .  
However , such a contrast does reflect , to a certain extent , a phenomenon , that is , unlike large-scale prominent enterprises in the overseas , some domestic enterprises fail to understand the historic opportunity arising from the development of the vast western region .  They lack the sense of urgency in grasping the opportunity .  It can not even be ruled out that some enterprises regard the party Central Committee 's strategic policy decision on the development of the western region as a political slogan .  
and Returning to the Country in Triumph . On display in the 1,300-square-meter exhibition hall were over 320 historic photos , 900 precious historic relics , 24 graphics , nine oil paintings , two huge sculptures , and six scenes .

On condition that the basic socialist system is upheld , the special economic zones have taken the lead in carrying out reform , gaining fresh experiences in exploring ways to undertake socialist modernization with Chinese characteristics .  In the historic process of shifting from the planned economy to a socialist market economy , the special economic zones have played an important role as a testing ground ;  
The development of the Shenzhen and other special economic zones and the New Pudong District is a splendid miniature and a vivid reflection of the historic changes and great achievements made in our country since the beginning of its reform and opening up as well as an effective confirmation of correct party leadership and the superiority of the socialist system .  
In new historic conditions , the special economic zones should conscientiously sum up their successful experiences , come to grips with existing problems , continue to " create more favorable conditions and attain a still higher goal , " strive to make fresh outstanding achievements , and take the lead in basically realizing modernization .  
2 ) Recording major political and historic events : The distribution of Hong Kong and Macao commemorative gold and silver coins were designed to give publicity to " one country , two systems " and the " basic law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region .

An outstanding characteristic of the adjustment of the US Asia-Pacific policy is that it has strengthened contact and dialog with northeast Asia , southeast Asia and south Asia and further developed relations with non-ally countries , even brought about the relaxation of ties with so-called " hostile countries . "  Major headway or historic breakthroughs have been made in these regards .  
The plenary session defined three major tasks that the CPC must undertake as it heads into the new century - - that is , continuing with the modernization drive , accomplishing reunification of the motherland , and safeguarding world peace and promoting common development .  It was a historic , strategic policy decision on the part of the CPC to have included among the three major tasks the accomplishment of reunification of the motherland .  
The overall living standard has witnessed a historic change from simply having enough food and clothing to leading a relatively comfortable life .  Compared with 1995 , Xinjiang 's fiscal revenue nearly doubled to 13.55 billion yuan , with annual growth of 14.5 percent .  
Making continuous efforts to push forward the modernization drive , accomplishing the reunification of the motherland as well as safeguarding world peace , and promoting common development represent our three major historic tasks in the new century .  The tasks are also a joint work and sacred duty for all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation , including personages of the CPC , all democratic parties , federations of industry and commerce , and personages without party affiliation .  
Li Tieying pointed out in his speech , at the historic moment of the turn of the century , standing at the plane of historical materialism , Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " has made a new and scientific summation of our party 's nature , purpose , and tasks , and embodied the innovative spirit of making efforts to open up new realms in Marxism geared to the 21st century .  
This is the first time that advanced productive forces and advanced culture , that is , material and spiritual civilization , have been scientifically and dialectically linked to the fundamental interests of the people , and that advanced nature and the fundamental interests of the people have been unified in the people 's historic practice .  
Yuan Longping courageously broke into the forbidden zone of breeding self-pollinating crops , an area considered worldwide as impenetrable .  He presented a fresh view on taking advantage of paddy rice heterosis , achieved a historic breakthrough in paddy rice breeding , and made an outstanding contribution to China 's grain production and the development of agricultural science .  
The committee members pointed out : With the successful fulfillment of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , our nation has basically solved the issue of providing sufficient food and clothing for the 1.3 billion people throughout the country , and the living standards of the people in the main have reached the level of being comparatively well-off .  Our nation has accomplished the two historic changes from poverty to getting sufficient food and clothing , and then from getting sufficient food and clothing to enjoying a comparatively better-off life .  
Grasping development as the main theme , Tianjin has three great historic tasks to fulfill at the start of the new century : to build a modern international port city and a major economic center of north China ; to establish a relatively perfect socialist market economy structure ; and to become one of the regions in the lead in basically achieving modernization .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin has pointed out : " A very important reason for China 's backwardness after the 15th century was that China 's feudal rulers closed the door to international intercourse , indulged in parochial arrogance , and could not stand the development of world science and technology , with the result that the Chinese nation sadly missed its historic opportunity , " " and fell far behind the western countries , with the result that it encountered defeat after defeat at the hands of the powerful ships and cannon of the western powers . "  
In the face of various tasks , Deputy Uyunqimg believed : In the 10th Five-Year Plan period , Inner Mongolia will seize the historic opportunity brought by the large-scale development of the west , effectively strengthen ecological and environmental protection , bring about sustainable economic and social development , and create conditions for its development coordinated with nationwide development step by step .  
The key areas of collection and compilation included materials on the educational , social , economical and historical aspects of Hong Kong . As services provided by the Urban Council in Hong Kong in over a century are closely related to the Hong Kong society and the livelihood of its people , their historic value will certainly be of interest to the general public and will surely be included in our collection .  
Other components include a brand platform that positions Hong Kong as both a business location and a ' dynamic physical and cultural hub ' ; a programme to communicate Hong Kong 's strong competitive position to audiences around the world ; a Brand Book explaining the philosophy behind the new brand as well as application guidelines ; a striking photo book showing modern , natural and historic Hong Kong ; and a new brand-related video production .  
It also serves to promote cultural exchange between Hong Kong and Shanghai .

First and foremost , under the concept of ' One Country Two Systems ' , we have made the historic transition while preserving Hong Kong 's core values - the rule of law , a clean , accountable civil service , the free and unfettered flow of information and ideas , and a level playing field for business .  
At the beginning of the 21st century , the Republic of China will advance into the ninetieth year of its existence . The dozen years remaining before this historic watershed should be spent holding fast to a steady and unflagging program of hard work and daily toil so that the visionary plan for the rapid development of our country and people can be transformed from blueprint to reality .  
My fieldwork was carried out before the communist occupation of the mainland , when the streets and historic buildings were in good shape and Chinese culture was well maintained . I travelled south of the Yangtze by boat , rode on horseback , and travelled by wooden handcart on the loess plain , genuinely experiencing the original China at first hand .  
Taipei is also a place where construction is crude and lacks any aesthetic sense , where the first ones to tear down historic buildings come out ahead , and where residential and commercial space is mixed together chaotically . Hsia Chu-joe , a professor in the Graduate Institute of Building and Planning at National Taiwan University , describes Taipei as " sticky cake " : Neither officials nor urban planners can do anything with it .  
Comparing the graceful architecture of Quanzhou 's Empress of Heaven Temple , with its mix of Song style and Ming structure , to the entirely new constructions of Meizhou 's temple complex , Huang Bingyan calls attention to the fact that the Mother Temple was still able to be appointed as a major province-level protected historic site , and with a tone of competitive spite , he adds , " That 's just for raising the status of the Mother Temple .  
Before returning to Taiwan , Lien Chan 's delegation , as expected , went to another European nation on a mission of " academic diplomacy . " This time Lien went to historic Trinity College Dublin , where he spoke with Provost Tom Mitchell about increasing academic exchange between the two nations . Somewhat earlier , a former vice president of Ireland paid him a short visit .  
Over the years the HUF has prepared guided introductions to six trails , with the most popular being the Chihshan Rock Trail in Shihlin , which combines natural scenery with Class Two historic cultural artifacts . And since Mayor Chen Shui-bian declared that this trail would be made part of the city 's high school entrance exams , many dedicated parents have come here to collect informa - tion for their kids .  
Venice , that romantic city on the water filled with historic architecture , was the wellspring of European capitalism and the Renaissance , and in recent years has developed into an important international exhibition center for movies , music and architecture . The celebrated film festival and this biennial art exhibition are two of the city 's great achievements .  
" To be honest , from a greater historical perspective , it would be pushing it to call Wistaria House a ' real ' historic landmark , " says Huang Fu-san , director of the Academica Sinica 's Institute of Taiwan History . However , the Taipei city government decided to list Wistaria House as a landmark . The committee is trying to set a new example whereby historic landmarks are judged not only by external criteria , but by their individual " personality " and history as well .  
Worried , the MOF , acting through the Keelung Tariff Bureau , then decided to reclaim its portion of Wistaria House at the end of July , before the city government had publicly declared the teahouse a historic landmark . It sealed off the old residence with plywood boards and closed up the flower garden . All that was left of the teahouse was Chou Yu 's two-story Western-style house , forcing him " to run the ship on half an engine . "  
Architecture scholar Wang Chen-hwa says that there are three kinds of historic building restoration : The first is untouched preservation , leaving a building how it is without touching a thing . Secondly , when a building has urban historical significance , there is restored preservation . Thirdly , if the building is still connected to people 's lives and is usable , a preservation method that involves active utilization of the building can be adopted . " Historic buildings are living and changing all the time , " he says .  
In past cases where private property has been set aside for public use , the owner generally has n't received reasonable compensation and has also lost the chance to benefit from increased land prices . No wonder that people in Taiwan say : " Being the owner of a historic building is just too painful . "  
" There does not need to be a conflict between the needs of urban development and historical building preservation , " says Tseng Shu-cheng , an assistant professor in Tamkang University 's Architecture Department . Preserving historic buildings or spaces is not intended to stop time and halt development . On the contrary it is intended to use their historical essence to make a new and creative use of the space .  
Those who " set out with great hopes only to return defeated " were left both angry and disappointed . As one person who works in the media noted , in metropolitan Taipei , " The leisure industry was pushing its leisure facilities down people 's throats all day long . Media packaging made for holiday crowds of historic dimensions on government-sponsored educational package tours and at private amusement parks , new department stores and even the Hollywood-transplanted Warner Village movie theater complex . "  
In addition to the snacks sold at the little stalls crowded around the entrance to the temple of the city god , there are plenty of other traditional foods to be found in the tight web of streets and historic sites of Hsinchu 's city center . These include round meat dumplings , meat broth , duck noodles and Hakka-style broad rice noodles .  
In recent times , due to the limited productive value of its mainly agricultural economy , the township had become rather run-down and had been losing population to other areas . Nonetheless , it still had many distinctive historic features such as Chichi Railway Station and Minghsin Academy , along with traditional rural scenes such as tobacco fields , banana groves , fruit orchards and tree-lined roads . These assets had long ago given Lin the idea of using them as tourist resources to breathe new life into Chichi .  
Also , in the future , whole historic settlements or streets can be considered monuments to be preserved . Finally , a law governing control and treatment of rare diseases , will allow importation of appropriate medications , treatments , and essential life-saving nutritional supplements for those suffering from tens of unusual ailments .  
9-11 has left us at the brink of war , but the possibility of military conflict as a result of US retaliation is not the only worry . A fluke incident and a single leader 's misjudgment in many other flashpoints worldwide could push us beyond the point of no return . The historic enmity between Israel and Palestine comes to mind , as do the ethnic and religious killing in Eastern Europe . North and South Korea are another cause for concern .  
" Huashan lies at the juncture of the Philippine tectonic plate and the Eurasian plate . After serious earthquakes , the crust is loosened and altered , and the topography shows very obvious changes , " says Chiu Tsun-lung , director of the " Lake Bottom Culture Association , " and now a member of the 921 community reconstruction committee . He says that Huashan also has a rich cultural atmosphere . The historic artifacts left behind by pioneers combined with the natural environment provide valuable resources for " mountain education " in Taiwan .  
The Chen clan of Hsiyu traces its local roots to a pair of brothers who came here from Kinmen during the Qing dynasty and set up a trade in Chinese herbal medicines . This old home is still in excellent condition . Thanks to its distinctive atmosphere , all of Erhkan Village has been designated a historic preservation district , the first time ever that an entire village has received this designation anywhere in the ROC .  
But this kind of standard is not entirely suitable for the wooden structures typical in Asian countries . For example , places like Japan 's Horyuji Temple must be extensively repaired every 20 years , even disassembled so that rotten lumber can be replaced . Fortunately , this can be done through systematically teaching traditional skills to successive generations and careful recording of the original work , so that these wooden historic sites can maintain a high level of quality and authenticity .  
But the reason why the Chin-kuashih-Chiufen area can be considered a world heritage asset , argues Monica C . Kuo , president of the Chinese Institute of Landscape Architects in Taiwan , is that its historic impact extended far and wide . From a historical perspective , the gold produced in Chinkuashih and Chiufen profoundly influenced the economic and colonial history of Asia in the first half of the last century .  
All visitors to Lukang inevitably go exploring . Besides the three major historic sites mentioned earlier , when you stroll through the narrow streets , even without deliberately looking , you just need to raise your head and you will frequently see exquisitely carved plafonds , decorative ceramic window frames , and vases inlayed into walls , providing a stream of delightful surprises .  
It occupies about six hectares , divided into three parts : an upper compound , a lower compound , and a garden . Because the buildings had authentic antique carving , painting , and craftsmanship , they were considered a classic example of early architectural arts in Taiwan , and long ago the Estate was designated as a Grade 2 national historic site by the Ministry of the Interior .  
" To be designated a historic site , a building must be a repository of excellent stories , " observes Yu Chao-ching . " Otherwise , its architectural workmanship must be remarkable . Its character , special qualities and worth must first be understood . " Yu points out that successful architectural preservation is a process of constant change-of preserving what is good in a site , and then adding new good things to it .  
A related inscription can still be found near the Fuyu Temple located in the old part of Tanshui . In order to familiarize people with Taiwan and the Customs Museum , whenever Yeh travels or undertakes on-site study in Taiwan or abroad , he distributes the promotional brochures he carries around , hoping that people will visit alternative historical sites and museums , which are often not on the beaten track . Then they will realize the truth of the saying that " when historic figures have faded away , the city will remain .  
Wu Se-hwa states that capital for cultural creative industries includes the following : copyrighted music , literature , fine arts and animation ; locations that can serve as the background for creativity , such as historic sites and natural scenery ; creative talent ; and language or customs that reveal the special flavor of an area .  
Fortunately , both Kinmen and Matsu undeniably possess rich tourism assets . Kinmen offers an aggregation of overseas emigrant culture , historic front-line military sights , and Southern Fujianese culture . Matsu , on the other hand , has intact communities of Eastern Fujianese style architecture and a rare species of tern . The larger question , though , is where and how do Kinmen and Matsu best fit in ?  
In an era of strong environmental consciousness , when reports of disasters are frequent , naturally a land-use policy that gives the environment central importance is going to get a generally positive response .

This is of great significance for further consolidating and developing the most extensive patriotic united front and make it better serve the fulfillment of the three major tasks of the party and the state in the new century .  
In the development course of our party over the past 80 years , the three generations of the leading bodies of the party separately with Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin at the core established and developed the most extensive united front to win over the people 's support and rally strength to the maximum .  The united front made historic contributions to China 's revolution , construction , and reforms and scored brilliant achievements .  
Under the leadership of the CPC , under the guidance of the party three-generation leading collectives with Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin as the core and , through the unremitting hard work of all party members and the people of all nationalities across the country , who have united as one in their struggle , tremendous changes of historic significance have taken place in the economic , political , cultural , and social features of China .  
In our party 's magnificent course of development over the past 80 years , the three generations of its central collective leadership with Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin as the core , respectively , have set up and developed the broadest united front , and it has won over the hearts of people and strengthened their cohesion to the maximum ; thus , the united front has made historic contributions to China 's revolution , construction , and reform , adding a glorious chapter to Chinese history .  
As the vanguard of the Chinese working class , the CPC always represents the requirements for the development of China 's advanced social productive forces , the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest possible masses of the people in China . Such a class status and such a historic mission have determined that the united front can be led only by the CPC .  
in addition to displaying in highly concise language a winding yet majestic , and vigorous yet resplendent and multicolored scroll of history , the speech also stood at the plane of the era and applied " three enlightenments " to sum up and encapsulate the party 's basic experiences over 80 years and propose the great historic undertakings of two 100-year periods . 
While celebrating the 80th anniversary of CPC founding and marching toward the future , we must , as is required by the three represents , ? closely center round the basic issue of what kind of party to build and how under the new historical conditions and closely grasp the two major historic subjects of enhancing the party abilities of administration and art of leadership and resisting corruption , guarding against degeneration and warding off risks , and push party building to a new stage .  
We must keep firmly in mind the purpose of the party , maintain close links with the masses , and serve the people wholeheartedly ; we must maintain the lofty communist values and revolutionary integrity and be the first to bear hardship and the last to enjoy comforts ; we must fortify our convictions , strengthen our spirits , engage in unostentatious hard work , advance in a pioneering spirit , and add a new chapter to history by scoring new historic achievements .

During the talks , the Chinese and Russian heads of state have earnestly reviewed the development of Sino-Russian ties over the past 10 years .  They pointed out : Establishing a strategic cooperative partnershipthat is equal and trusting is a correct historic choice , and has decisive impacts on the following : when China and Russia strive to comprehensively strengthen cooperation , when China and Russia strive to consolidate their peoples ' friendship , and when the world strives to establish a fair and rational new international order .  
The broad ranks of veteran comrades have realized that General Secretary Jiang 's important speech delivered on 1 July contains rich contents and shows great foresight .

Kok appreciated the achievements scored by China in human rights .  Because of the differences in historic , economic , and social development between various countries , it is very important for them to carry out constructive dialogue based on mutual respect .  
Therefore , one of important tasks for the return of Hong Kong to the motherland was to find out a chief executive who truly loves the country and Hong Kong and who can shoulder the heavy duties at a historic turning point .  The election of Tung Chee-hwa was widely acclaimed by people at home and abroad as well as by people of the central government and the international community .  Hong Kong residents also are happy to have such a person as their chief executive .  
The meeting maintained that the Central Ideological and Political Work Meeting is an important meeting held at the historic moment of our party in its advance toward the new century , and also a major move of the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core which adheres to the strategic principle of " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to both " for promoting the cause of reform , opening up , and modernization in a comprehensive way .  
Shortly after Hong Kong completed the historic turn of being recovered by the motherland , it encountered the fierce impact of the Asian financial storm .  At the critical moment , when Hong Kong was being attacked from all sides by international speculators , the central government resolutely indicated that it would support , at all costs , keeping the Hong Kong currency 's exchange rate linked to the US dollar .  This greatly bolstered the SAR Government 's determination to safeguard the Hong Kong people 's wealth .  
This year is the last year of the " National Eight-seven Plan for Tackling Tough Problems in Poverty Relief " ; all localities and departments concerned must seriously implement the central arrangements for development for poverty relief ; with poor villages as the main battleground , and with the focus on developing crop cultivation and livestock raising and the construction of basic farmland , they should adhere to the guideline of developmental poverty relief and concentrate forces and increase input in an effort to fulfill this historic task .

This grand and esteemed Christian leader reminded the broad masses of Christian disciples : " We should always remember historic setbacks ; uphold the correct principles of facilitating self-administration , self-support , and self-propagation ; and facilitate a healthy development of Christianity in China so as to contribute to world peace and socialist spiritual civilization . "  
This " Proposal " which outlines the grand blueprint for China 's modernization drive in the 21st century is the phasal guideline for the ruling party to realize its dream of making the country strong and prosperous in the new century .  It is a historic document guiding China 's economic and social development in the next five years .  It is therefore of great and far-reaching significance .  
However , such a contrast does reflect , to a certain extent , a phenomenon , that is , unlike large-scale prominent enterprises in the overseas , some domestic enterprises fail to understand the historic opportunity arising from the development of the vast western region .  They lack the sense of urgency in grasping the opportunity .  It can not even be ruled out that some enterprises regard the party Central Committee 's strategic policy decision on the development of the western region as a political slogan .  
and Returning to the Country in Triumph . On display in the 1,300-square-meter exhibition hall were over 320 historic photos , 900 precious historic relics , 24 graphics , nine oil paintings , two huge sculptures , and six scenes .

On condition that the basic socialist system is upheld , the special economic zones have taken the lead in carrying out reform , gaining fresh experiences in exploring ways to undertake socialist modernization with Chinese characteristics .  In the historic process of shifting from the planned economy to a socialist market economy , the special economic zones have played an important role as a testing ground ;  
The development of the Shenzhen and other special economic zones and the New Pudong District is a splendid miniature and a vivid reflection of the historic changes and great achievements made in our country since the beginning of its reform and opening up as well as an effective confirmation of correct party leadership and the superiority of the socialist system .  
In new historic conditions , the special economic zones should conscientiously sum up their successful experiences , come to grips with existing problems , continue to " create more favorable conditions and attain a still higher goal , " strive to make fresh outstanding achievements , and take the lead in basically realizing modernization .  
2 ) Recording major political and historic events : The distribution of Hong Kong and Macao commemorative gold and silver coins were designed to give publicity to " one country , two systems " and the " basic law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region . " At the same time , they recorded the smooth return of Hong Kong and Macao to Chinese sovereignty , two major international and historic events , and expressed the fervent hope of the people throughout China for the motherland 's reunification . 
An outstanding characteristic of the adjustment of the US Asia-Pacific policy is that it has strengthened contact and dialog with northeast Asia , southeast Asia and south Asia and further developed relations with non-ally countries , even brought about the relaxation of ties with so-called " hostile countries . "  Major headway or historic breakthroughs have been made in these regards .  
The plenary session defined three major tasks that the CPC must undertake as it heads into the new century - - that is , continuing with the modernization drive , accomplishing reunification of the motherland , and safeguarding world peace and promoting common development .  It was a historic , strategic policy decision on the part of the CPC to have included among the three major tasks the accomplishment of reunification of the motherland .  
The overall living standard has witnessed a historic change from simply having enough food and clothing to leading a relatively comfortable life .  Compared with 1995 , Xinjiang 's fiscal revenue nearly doubled to 13.55 billion yuan , with annual growth of 14.5 percent .  
Making continuous efforts to push forward the modernization drive , accomplishing the reunification of the motherland as well as safeguarding world peace , and promoting common development represent our three major historic tasks in the new century .  The tasks are also a joint work and sacred duty for all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation , including personages of the CPC , all democratic parties , federations of industry and commerce , and personages without party affiliation .  
Li Tieying pointed out in his speech , at the historic moment of the turn of the century , standing at the plane of historical materialism , Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " has made a new and scientific summation of our party 's nature , purpose , and tasks , and embodied the innovative spirit of making efforts to open up new realms in Marxism geared to the 21st century .  
This is the first time that advanced productive forces and advanced culture , that is , material and spiritual civilization , have been scientifically and dialectically linked to the fundamental interests of the people , and that advanced nature and the fundamental interests of the people have been unified in the people 's historic practice .  
Yuan Longping courageously broke into the forbidden zone of breeding self-pollinating crops , an area considered worldwide as impenetrable .  He presented a fresh view on taking advantage of paddy rice heterosis , achieved a historic breakthrough in paddy rice breeding , and made an outstanding contribution to China 's grain production and the development of agricultural science .  
The committee members pointed out : With the successful fulfillment of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , our nation has basically solved the issue of providing sufficient food and clothing for the 1.3 billion people throughout the country , and the living standards of the people in the main have reached the level of being comparatively well-off .  Our nation has accomplished the two historic changes from poverty to getting sufficient food and clothing , and then from getting sufficient food and clothing to enjoying a comparatively better-off life .  
Grasping development as the main theme , Tianjin has three great historic tasks to fulfill at the start of the new century : to build a modern international port city and a major economic center of north China ; to establish a relatively perfect socialist market economy structure ; and to become one of the regions in the lead in basically achieving modernization .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin has pointed out : " A very important reason for China 's backwardness after the 15th century was that China 's feudal rulers closed the door to international intercourse , indulged in parochial arrogance , and could not stand the development of world science and technology , with the result that the Chinese nation sadly missed its historic opportunity , " " and fell far behind the western countries , with the result that it encountered defeat after defeat at the hands of the powerful ships and cannon of the western powers . "  
In the face of various tasks , Deputy Uyunqimg believed : In the 10th Five-Year Plan period , Inner Mongolia will seize the historic opportunity brought by the large-scale development of the west , effectively strengthen ecological and environmental protection , bring about sustainable economic and social development , and create conditions for its development coordinated with nationwide development step by step .  
The key areas of collection and compilation included materials on the educational , social , economical and historical aspects of Hong Kong . As services provided by the Urban Council in Hong Kong in over a century are closely related to the Hong Kong society and the livelihood of its people , their historic value will certainly be of interest to the general public and will surely be included in our collection .  
Other components include a brand platform that positions Hong Kong as both a business location and a ' dynamic physical and cultural hub ' ; a programme to communicate Hong Kong 's strong competitive position to audiences around the world ; a Brand Book explaining the philosophy behind the new brand as well as application guidelines ; a striking photo book showing modern , natural and historic Hong Kong ; and a new brand-related video production .  
It also serves to promote cultural exchange between Hong Kong and Shanghai . Among the over three hundred documents chosen for this exhibition , the Shanghai Library provides a large number of precious exhibits including folk prints , rare books , autograph books of famous Chinese scholars , correspondence handwritten by famous Chinese , and genealogy manuscripts .  Also on display are historic documents selected from the donations collected through the Documents Collection Campaign launched in January 2001 .  
First and foremost , under the concept of ' One Country Two Systems ' , we have made the historic transition while preserving Hong Kong 's core values - the rule of law , a clean , accountable civil service , the free and unfettered flow of information and ideas , and a level playing field for business .  
At the beginning of the 21st century , the Republic of China will advance into the ninetieth year of its existence . The dozen years remaining before this historic watershed should be spent holding fast to a steady and unflagging program of hard work and daily toil so that the visionary plan for the rapid development of our country and people can be transformed from blueprint to reality .  
My fieldwork was carried out before the communist occupation of the mainland , when the streets and historic buildings were in good shape and Chinese culture was well maintained . I travelled south of the Yangtze by boat , rode on horseback , and travelled by wooden handcart on the loess plain , genuinely experiencing the original China at first hand .  
Taipei is also a place where construction is crude and lacks any aesthetic sense , where the first ones to tear down historic buildings come out ahead , and where residential and commercial space is mixed together chaotically . Hsia Chu-joe , a professor in the Graduate Institute of Building and Planning at National Taiwan University , describes Taipei as " sticky cake " : Neither officials nor urban planners can do anything with it .  
Comparing the graceful architecture of Quanzhou 's Empress of Heaven Temple , with its mix of Song style and Ming structure , to the entirely new constructions of Meizhou 's temple complex , Huang Bingyan calls attention to the fact that the Mother Temple was still able to be appointed as a major province-level protected historic site , and with a tone of competitive spite , he adds , " That 's just for raising the status of the Mother Temple .  
Before returning to Taiwan , Lien Chan 's delegation , as expected , went to another European nation on a mission of " academic diplomacy . " This time Lien went to historic Trinity College Dublin , where he spoke with Provost Tom Mitchell about increasing academic exchange between the two nations . Somewhat earlier , a former vice president of Ireland paid him a short visit .  
Over the years the HUF has prepared guided introductions to six trails , with the most popular being the Chihshan Rock Trail in Shihlin , which combines natural scenery with Class Two historic cultural artifacts . And since Mayor Chen Shui-bian declared that this trail would be made part of the city 's high school entrance exams , many dedicated parents have come here to collect informa - tion for their kids .  
Venice , that romantic city on the water filled with historic architecture , was the wellspring of European capitalism and the Renaissance , and in recent years has developed into an important international exhibition center for movies , music and architecture . The celebrated film festival and this biennial art exhibition are two of the city 's great achievements .  
" To be honest , from a greater historical perspective , it would be pushing it to call Wistaria House a ' real ' historic landmark , " says Huang Fu-san , director of the Academica Sinica 's Institute of Taiwan History . However , the Taipei city government decided to list Wistaria House as a landmark . The committee is trying to set a new example whereby historic landmarks are judged not only by external criteria , but by their individual " personality " and history as well .  
Worried , the MOF , acting through the Keelung Tariff Bureau , then decided to reclaim its portion of Wistaria House at the end of July , before the city government had publicly declared the teahouse a historic landmark . It sealed off the old residence with plywood boards and closed up the flower garden . All that was left of the teahouse was Chou Yu 's two-story Western-style house , forcing him " to run the ship on half an engine . "  
Architecture scholar Wang Chen-hwa says that there are three kinds of historic building restoration : The first is untouched preservation , leaving a building how it is without touching a thing . Secondly , when a building has urban historical significance , there is restored preservation . Thirdly , if the building is still connected to people 's lives and is usable , a preservation method that involves active utilization of the building can be adopted . " Historic buildings are living and changing all the time , " he says .  
In past cases where private property has been set aside for public use , the owner generally has n't received reasonable compensation and has also lost the chance to benefit from increased land prices . No wonder that people in Taiwan say : " Being the owner of a historic building is just too painful . "  
" There does not need to be a conflict between the needs of urban development and historical building preservation , " says Tseng Shu-cheng , an assistant professor in Tamkang University 's Architecture Department . Preserving historic buildings or spaces is not intended to stop time and halt development . On the contrary it is intended to use their historical essence to make a new and creative use of the space .  
Those who " set out with great hopes only to return defeated " were left both angry and disappointed . As one person who works in the media noted , in metropolitan Taipei , " The leisure industry was pushing its leisure facilities down people 's throats all day long . Media packaging made for holiday crowds of historic dimensions on government-sponsored educational package tours and at private amusement parks , new department stores and even the Hollywood-transplanted Warner Village movie theater complex . "  
In addition to the snacks sold at the little stalls crowded around the entrance to the temple of the city god , there are plenty of other traditional foods to be found in the tight web of streets and historic sites of Hsinchu 's city center . These include round meat dumplings , meat broth , duck noodles and Hakka-style broad rice noodles .  
In recent times , due to the limited productive value of its mainly agricultural economy , the township had become rather run-down and had been losing population to other areas . Nonetheless , it still had many distinctive historic features such as Chichi Railway Station and Minghsin Academy , along with traditional rural scenes such as tobacco fields , banana groves , fruit orchards and tree-lined roads . These assets had long ago given Lin the idea of using them as tourist resources to breathe new life into Chichi .  
Also , in the future , whole historic settlements or streets can be considered monuments to be preserved . Finally , a law governing control and treatment of rare diseases , will allow importation of appropriate medications , treatments , and essential life-saving nutritional supplements for those suffering from tens of unusual ailments .  
9-11 has left us at the brink of war , but the possibility of military conflict as a result of US retaliation is not the only worry . A fluke incident and a single leader 's misjudgment in many other flashpoints worldwide could push us beyond the point of no return . The historic enmity between Israel and Palestine comes to mind , as do the ethnic and religious killing in Eastern Europe . North and South Korea are another cause for concern .  
" Huashan lies at the juncture of the Philippine tectonic plate and the Eurasian plate . After serious earthquakes , the crust is loosened and altered , and the topography shows very obvious changes , " says Chiu Tsun-lung , director of the " Lake Bottom Culture Association , " and now a member of the 921 community reconstruction committee . He says that Huashan also has a rich cultural atmosphere . The historic artifacts left behind by pioneers combined with the natural environment provide valuable resources for " mountain education " in Taiwan .  
The Chen clan of Hsiyu traces its local roots to a pair of brothers who came here from Kinmen during the Qing dynasty and set up a trade in Chinese herbal medicines . This old home is still in excellent condition . Thanks to its distinctive atmosphere , all of Erhkan Village has been designated a historic preservation district , the first time ever that an entire village has received this designation anywhere in the ROC .  
But this kind of standard is not entirely suitable for the wooden structures typical in Asian countries . For example , places like Japan 's Horyuji Temple must be extensively repaired every 20 years , even disassembled so that rotten lumber can be replaced . Fortunately , this can be done through systematically teaching traditional skills to successive generations and careful recording of the original work , so that these wooden historic sites can maintain a high level of quality and authenticity .  
But the reason why the Chin-kuashih-Chiufen area can be considered a world heritage asset , argues Monica C . Kuo , president of the Chinese Institute of Landscape Architects in Taiwan , is that its historic impact extended far and wide . From a historical perspective , the gold produced in Chinkuashih and Chiufen profoundly influenced the economic and colonial history of Asia in the first half of the last century .  
All visitors to Lukang inevitably go exploring . Besides the three major historic sites mentioned earlier , when you stroll through the narrow streets , even without deliberately looking , you just need to raise your head and you will frequently see exquisitely carved plafonds , decorative ceramic window frames , and vases inlayed into walls , providing a stream of delightful surprises .  
It occupies about six hectares , divided into three parts : an upper compound , a lower compound , and a garden . Because the buildings had authentic antique carving , painting , and craftsmanship , they were considered a classic example of early architectural arts in Taiwan , and long ago the Estate was designated as a Grade 2 national historic site by the Ministry of the Interior .  
" To be designated a historic site , a building must be a repository of excellent stories , " observes Yu Chao-ching . " Otherwise , its architectural workmanship must be remarkable . Its character , special qualities and worth must first be understood . " Yu points out that successful architectural preservation is a process of constant change-of preserving what is good in a site , and then adding new good things to it .  
A related inscription can still be found near the Fuyu Temple located in the old part of Tanshui . In order to familiarize people with Taiwan and the Customs Museum , whenever Yeh travels or undertakes on-site study in Taiwan or abroad , he distributes the promotional brochures he carries around , hoping that people will visit alternative historical sites and museums , which are often not on the beaten track . Then they will realize the truth of the saying that " when historic figures have faded away , the city will remain .  
Wu Se-hwa states that capital for cultural creative industries includes the following : copyrighted music , literature , fine arts and animation ; locations that can serve as the background for creativity , such as historic sites and natural scenery ; creative talent ; and language or customs that reveal the special flavor of an area .  
Fortunately , both Kinmen and Matsu undeniably possess rich tourism assets . Kinmen offers an aggregation of overseas emigrant culture , historic front-line military sights , and Southern Fujianese culture . Matsu , on the other hand , has intact communities of Eastern Fujianese style architecture and a rare species of tern . The larger question , though , is where and how do Kinmen and Matsu best fit in ?  
In an era of strong environmental consciousness , when reports of disasters are frequent , naturally a land-use policy that gives the environment central importance is going to get a generally positive response . But because the government actually promoted mountain agriculture for half a century , now hundreds of thousands of farmers and workers in related industries depend on it for their livelihood , and there is also the question of the cultural and historic needs of Aborigines who call the mountain forests home .  
Agreeing that the issue of legal tender coins commemorating the fiftieth anniversary would be a fitting way for States to honour and provide a suitable lasting memento of this historic occasion ,  
Most States represented in this Hall were not present at the historic signing of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco 50 years ago , but on gaining independence they applied for membership in this Organization as an essential part of their quest for a secure and stable international environment and improved standards of living .  
The end of the East-West bipolarity that plagued the world during the cold war and the disappearance of the ideological demarcation line that divided the world into two camps should prompt us to seize this historic opportunity afforded us by the current transitional period to lay down new foundations for North-South cooperation and to narrow the economic gap between them .  
Philip ( Solomon Islands ) : It is indeed fitting that this historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly is being presided over by Mr . Freitas do Amara of Portugal , a distinguished teacher of law , an experienced parliamentarian , and the founder of one of the major political parties that helped to return vibrant democracy to his homeland .  
In 1987 , when our Governments decided to take up the historic challenge of achieving a political solution to the Central American crisis through the peace process adopted in Esquipulas II , they also recognized that peace and development were inseparable and that the consolidation of democracy presupposed the establishment of a system of well-being and economic and social justice , which is indispensable in helping to overcome the deep-rooted causes of that conflict .  
Regrettably , this great historic victory was attained at a high price : the heavy of loss of human lives , incredible suffering , unprecedented material losses .  
Such a fact underscores the need to respect and to take into consideration the historic religious and cultural characteristics of the peoples of every region when drafting any international document , so that the door may not be left ajar for the introduction of controversial issues after international compromises had been reached on such issues in previous conferences .  
One can not forget that the historic changes of a few years ago those changes which finally , once and for all , sealed the fate of totalitarianism actually took place along a line of confrontation which kept Europe and the entire world divided into two opposing ideological and military camps for several decades . 
With the support and active cooperation of Committee members , I am certain that the First Committee of the General Assembly , at this historic fiftieth session , will be able to further contribute substantially towards attaining our common objective a world free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and with a greatly reduced level of conventional weapons and of violence in general .  
While tensions that have arisen in historic moments , happily behind us , have given us a world more free and open to achieving the ultimate objectives of the Charter to practice tolerance and peaceful coexistence , maintain international peace and security and save succeeding generations from the scourge of war today 's peace is still a peace of little wars , local and regional conflicts fanned by drastic differences of an ethnic , economic or religious nature .  
In conclusion , Nigeria would like to see the First Committee at this historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly motivated by the desire for cooperation in finding genuine and lasting solutions to those problems that continue to confront us in the area of disarmament in the remaining part of this twentieth century , in order to bequeath to the next generation in the twenty-first century a world which is indeed free of these weapons of mass destruction . 
As regards the assurances given by Mr . Batu that Turkey does not harbour any designs or territorial ambitions against Greece or any of its neighbours and without going into any historic retrospection that would give ample and eloquent proof of Turkey 's traditional performance in the broader area of the Balkans and the Middle East , suffice it to recall the notorious contemporary case of the military invasion and ongoing occupation of Cyprus .  
All those working at the Tribunal realize the historic role which they have to play in setting precedents for future international criminal organs , notably a permanent criminal court - " the missing link of international law " - and they have watched with great interest the tentative moves towards turning the United Nations International Law Commission 's draft statute for a permanent criminal court into a viable court .  
Now , when we commemorate the historic injustice of 55 years ago , let our thoughts not be overwhelmed by the memory of the nefarious characters , Hitler , Mussolini and Stalin , who together assumed grave responsibilities for some of the most horrifying acts of territorial rape in the modern history of Europe , but rather remember the great politicians , Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer , the makers of the historic Franco-German reconciliation !  
We must assume the historic commitment to accept the challenge and to devote ourselves with enthusiasm to the shaping of a new world , which will do away with political , religious and racial intolerance , which will eliminate inequality and social backwardness , which will establish human fraternity and solidarity , a new world in which the beacon of freedom and democracy will light its path . 
While historic factors such as the low level of African incomes and inadequate domestic technical expertise and capacity explain a part of this situation , it is also the general perception that inappropriate macroeconomic policies , combined with an antiquated and ineffective legal , regulatory and prudential framework , have been the main impediments .  
At its 14th meeting , the Committee agreed that the issuance of legal-tender coins commemorating the fiftieth anniversary would be a fitting way for Member States to honour and provide a suitable lasting memento of this historic occasion and decided to recommend to the General Assembly that it adopt a resolution endorsing this programme ( see para . 34 below , draft resolution I ) .  
Liberia will again become a respected and active Member of this Organization , whose sterling principles have continued to stand the test of time , as evidenced by our observance a few weeks ago of the historic fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations .  
the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations at the Ministerial Meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee , held at Marrakesh , Morocco , from 12 to 15 April 1994 , and noting that the Uruguay Round agreements [ 8 ] / represent a historic achievement , which is expected to contribute to strengthening the world economy and to lead to more trade , investment , employment and income growth throughout the world and in particular to the promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the developing countries ,

All these falsities , many of them recorded in United Nations documents , hide the bankruptcy of development prospects for most of the poor countries , which is already threatening world stability and aggravating the ecological deterioration we all recognized several years ago at the historic Rio Conference .  
The special significance of this historic event is that , based on the successes achieved over the last 10 years of renewal , reform and national revival , the Congress decided to lead the country into a new phase of industrialization and modernization , with a view to doubling by the year 2000 the 1990 per-capita gross domestic product and essentially transforming Viet Nam into an industrialized country in the next 20 to 25 years .

Freitas do Amaral , who , in the course of the historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly , made an undeniable contribution to the continued progress of the United Nations .  
The Declaration and Programme of Action adopted at the Summit , containing an important set of commitments and recommendations to be implemented , became a historic landmark that established the international consensus on the goals to be pursued and achieved in the area of social development for the coming decades .
