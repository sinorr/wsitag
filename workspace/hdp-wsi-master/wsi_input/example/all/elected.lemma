Xinhua News Agency report of May 23rd from Berlin ( by staff reporter Rong Changhai ) - Horst Koehler , dual candidate of both Germany 's main opposition party , the Christian Union Alliance , and the Liberal Free Democratic Party , won 604 votes , more than the necessary votes for an elected president , in the first round of voting in Germany 's federal assembly on the 23rd , to become Germany 's ninth postwar president .

When Junichiro Koizumi was elected president of the Liberal Democratic Party , but was not yet elected prime minister of Japan , he already declared he favored revising Japan 's Peace Constitution and supported changing the Self-Defense Force into armed forces .  He was also ready to visit the Yasukuni Shrine .  
As a matter of fact , that a rightwing politician like Koizumi can become the president of a ruling party and the prime minister of Japan and that an extreme rightwing politician like Shintaro Ishihara could be elected Tokyo Governor a few years ago have precisely reflected that the rightist trend is gaining momentum in Japan 's political arena .  
Some current provincial governors and ministers ( excluding those in special departments ) between the ages of 62 and 65 years ( the age for retirement at this level ) will be retired ahead of time by the end of this year so that their younger successors may be elected into the party central committee next year at the 16th party congress .  
The fact that after being elected prime minister Koizumi insisted on stating that he would pay respects at the shrine , heedless of domestic opposition and external protests , shows not only his individual political attitude but is also an expression of the swelling growth of rightist forces in society , and people should be particularly concerned about this .  
In the last two years , since he was elected chairman of the Ninth NPC standing committee in 1998 , Li Peng has gained in-depth understanding of NPC work and has made considerable contributions to conducting legislative research and strengthening the rule of law in governing the country , according to the source .

After Chen Shui-bian , who had been a member of the opposition party , was elected as Taiwan 's new leader , the outside generally doubted whether or not the armed forces , which had been controlled by the Kuomintang over a long time , would take orders from Chen Shui-bian , who previously was strongly opposed to interference in government work by the military , called for cutting military spending , and exposed the dark side of the military , and doubted whether or not the military would stage a coup d'tat .  
After Putin was elected as Russia 's top leader , his administrative principles and foreign policy have become calmer and more pragmatic , and he has paid more attention to domestic affairs and become more familiar with the European security issue .  Some media maintained that Putin was focusing on the foreign affairs related to the United States and Europe .  
Thus , the Taiwan side may possibly ask for procuring Kidd-class destroyers before the opening of the annual US-Taiwan arms sales negotiations scheduled to be held in April . If this is really true , newly elected President Bush will meet , for the first time , a grim challenge in handling the subtle military balance between " China " and Taiwan .  
An ironic fact was that some local people even tried to " pick a bone from an egg " by taking advantage of Ma Ying-jeou 's visit to Hong Kong . They argued that the Hong Kong general public 's strong interest in Ma Ying-jeou 's visit was not derived from their concern about the motherland 's reunification and Hong Kong 's urban construction , but was derived from their interest in " seeing the mayor being elected democratically in Chinese society . "  
At his work posts , he made great contributions to the party 's ethnic work , united front work , and socialist cause .  In 1978 , he was elected as vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee . Though being at an advanced age , he still paid close attention to the unity of the people of all ethnic groups and the development of the areas inhabited by ethnic minorities , and still cared about the development and use of water resources in the motherland .  
But it is also in the voters ' own interest to exercise their franchise as those elected would have a major say in determining their quality of life , such as in the areas of environmental hygiene , housing , medical services , and in the provision of public amenities , as well as recreational and sports facilities and services . "  
( b ) To vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot , guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors ; ' . 
" I have no doubt that the long term goal of the community of Hong Kong is to have a stable political structure providing a constructive and workable relationship between our executive-led government and a legislature elected through universal suffrage .  Many stakeholders are involved .  The administration will be expected to take a lead in coming up with alternative proposals .

" We are also accountable to the Legislative Council , now fully elected , and increasingly representative under the timetable laid down in the Basic Law . The civil service has long recognised that dynamic , and willingly accepts its responsibility in explaining , defending and arguing for its policies and proposals before legislators . " 
Shareholders and relevant persons may still ask for a full set of financial documents from the company even if they have elected to receive the summary financial report and have received it , subject to the request being made prior to the next general meeting .  The company is required to send out the documents within 14 days upon receipt of the relevant notification .  
Because of this , electronic filing could not be accepted if double signatures were required , e.g . for a married taxpayer who had elected joint assessment or personal assessment and a taxpayer who had been nominated by the spouse for a home loan interest deduction , " the spokesman said .  
Furthermore , following the return of Hong Kong to the motherland , and with the elected Chief Executive , a fully elected legislature , the increasingly progressive and aggressive media , Government operation and policy formulation are subject to increasing public scrutiny and pressure .  In addition to expectation for Principal Officials to undertake their statutory duties , they have to cover political work within the community .  
Regarding the details of the proposal , Mr Lam said in respect of GC and FC elections , the candidates who got elected or had received 5 % of valid votes or more would be given financial support .

After graduation from college , he engaged in journalistic , cultural and educational work . Later , he served as an executive member of the party 's Taiwan provincial office based at Chang chow , Fukien province , and was elected a member of the party 's Sixth National Congress .  
Although fiercely competitive , this channel of selection and replacement assists in social integration . ( 2 ) A gradual increase in the average level of education and expertise of elected officials has helped increase the efficiency and capability of the political system . ( 3 ) Native Taiwanese have a comparatively better chance of serving in public office through elections , while mainlanders often pass through other recruitment channels .  
From being elected to the Legislative Yuan with the highest number of votes in the country , to his " change in careers " to become an executive branch official , Environmental Protection Administration Director Jaw Shau-kong has used his broad public support as his shield in undertaking the work of protecting the environment . Although he has run up against counterattacks from polluting industries and is seen as wreaking havoc in the " political ecology , " he has for this very reason accumulated even greater political resources : constituent support .  
Heavy on Public Opinion : In the 1985 Taipei City Council election , his vote total was high enough to elect four city councilmen [ Taiwan uses a multiple member single vote system ] . In the 1986 Legislative Yuan election , he was elected with 140,000 votes , highest in his district . In repeated electoral victories , he has overwhelmingly won over voters .  
But since social mores have changed , women no longer need guarantees to be elected to the Legislative Yuan , and have , like men , won with the largest number of votes in a given district ( Taiwan having multiple-member districts ) . After entering the Legislative Yuan , they have gone from a passive , " decorative " role to become bold , frank " women warriors " who have the courage to take responsibility for things . Their evolution deserves attention !  
Originally , outside of the dikes there were 17 acres of protected aboriginal land . In 1976 this had been eradicated by flowing soil and rocks carried from upstream . Although the county government agreed to compensate the residents NT $ 143,800 per acre , the aborigines no longer had enough to invest in recovering the land , since " after another year it would just be washed out again ! " says Chuoshui Rural Township elected official Chang Yi-hsiung unhappily .  
Too much water for the pot : Such frequent switching was not really surprising considering there were 403 candidates fighting over 161 seats . With such a narrow chance of getting elected , even the well-oiled machine of the ruling Kuomintang ( KMT ) party was unable to smooth over the competing demands of its candidates .  
Wang Hsing-ching observes that most people are far less ready to accept an aboriginal at the head of an administration than as a councillor , provincial assembly member or other elected representative , " for such representatives only represent their minority community , but the local chief executive represents a whole county or city , including the Han Chinese as well as the ' native people . ' '  
" This is because in the past in every medium of communication , the listener 's role was the smallest , " says " Nation United " host Ling Er-hsiang . Every time a major incident takes place , the media hurriedly interview government officials and expert scholars or elected representatives . " But really , the people are most important , not to mention the fact that the opinions of some common citizens are more outstanding and cut closer to reality . "  
Of course , everyone has their own version of the story , and it is hard to say who is right or wrong . But Li , looking at things from the point of view of enterprise development , feels that democratization in Taiwan is divorced from the rule of law , that the media is biased , that local elected officials stir up the population to win favor , and that the government - - though willing to help - - is unable to do anything . All these keep investors from moving forward . "  
Since , Chen argued , it is impossible to be completely loyal to two separate entities at the same time , it is only proper that parliamentarians should give up dual nationality . Following this logic , the government stipulated in the 1991 amendments to the Election and Recall Law that those elected as representatives must give up foreign citizenship before they are sworn into office .  
For example , just prior to the major provincial and municipal elections at the end of last year , Mary Tseng , secretary-general of the Wild Bird Society of Taipei , organized their semi-annual waterfowl festival in Kuantu . The Wild Bird Society invited candidates from all three major parties to take part in the huge gathering . Of course , the harvest was bountiful - - at the event all three parties ' candidates promised once elected to build a nature preserve in Kuantu .  
Despite its many special features , the Big Egg was battered by ridicule at first . In interpellations , one elected representative accused the Taoyuan County chief executive , Liu Pang-you , of being a liar for saying that Taoyuan 's stadium was Taiwan 's first domed stadium . The representative claimed that Liu was misleading the public because " the Taoyuan stadium is by no means an ' egg . ' A true domed stadium is an air-supported structure [ with air pressure inside exceeding that outside ] , and should hold 40-50,000 people . "  
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan - tseh believes that achievements in scholarship within Taiwan depend to a great extent on cooperative efforts between academics at home and abroad . As the gap with overseas scholarship is closed , the number of Taiwan-resident scholars elected to the Academia Sinica will increase , and more overseas scholars will be willing to return to Taiwan . The most important thing is to make contributions toward academic development in Taiwan , and the only standard of judgment should be the level of academic work .  
Among those elected , the five in the category of math and physical sciences are all engineering specialists , suggesting that applied science is being given increasing importance within the Academia Sinica . There was more diversity in the biology / chemistry group , with electees including specialists in medicine , neurology and molecular biology . The social science and humanities group , meanwhile , following an old tradition , continued to be dominated by economists .  
Of late , members of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly , the highest publicly elected body at the provincial level , have been embroiled in numerous scandals involving election bribery , libel charges , financial disputes and various lawsuits . In an effort to clean itself up and drive out malevolent forces , the Assembly conducted a prayer session in honor of the " good brothers , " thereby resorting to ghosts instead of turning to the common people .  
Among constitutional disputes , while the proposal to abolish the Taiwan Provincial Government ( TPG ) was placed only on the second day of the agenda , it gained even more attention than reforming the central level system . Dissent was found , however , not among the three parties , but in the " provincial " representatives directly involved . Governor James Soong , elected by popular vote , was left in the most embarrassing position . He skipped the debate by pleading that they had to answer interpellations from provincial assemblymen .  
Originally the Defense Ministry planned to use the land for residential housing . But the local governments , elected officials at all levels , and scholars and experts , all lobbied for different proposals . There were people calling for the land to be used for commercial real estate , for a trade center , for a new city government office complex , for a university . . . . The argument raged for years .  
In future , a nine-member commission , nominated by the premier and named by the president , and a consultative assembly will oversee whatever activities still remain for the downsized provincial government . County and municipal level executives and assemblies will continue to be popularly elected .  
Following local opposition to the fourth nuclear power station , the sixth naphtha cracker and other major projects , Bayer of Germany has , almost on the eve of the start of construction work , called a halt to its plan to build a chemical plant in the Taichung Harbor zone . This followed the newly elected county magistrate 's insistence that a referendum would be called to decide whether the plan should be allowed to go ahead . Although the central government is attempting to mediate , the future of the Bayer plan is now uncertain .  
Most property rights cases in which constitutional interpretations are sought affect individual citizens ' rights , and attract little outside attention or interference . But in other areas social forces ( such as civic groups and the media ) or political forces ( elected representatives ) often get involved .  
Whether lower-level measures related to localization of government can be implemented smoothly remains to be seen . These lower-level measures include the consensus reached by the National Development Conference on downsizing the TPG , making the jobs of village chief and township chief into positions appointed by the central government rather than elected by the public , and ending elections for village and township councils . Many are worried that parochialism may become more apparent when tasks that were originally handled by the TPG are handed over to local governments .  
However , Chen Shui-bian 's iron fist in dealing with illegal video game arcades , the razing of illegal structures and actions against the sex industry and licensed prostitutes , as well as his constant disputes with the city council , led to growing opposition from interested parties and groups representing the disadvantaged . This in turn meant that many voters had reservations about the rough-and-tumble style of their first elected mayor .  
If elected , I will change the obsolete bureaucratism in the central government , and undertake complete reinvention of the government . I will create a clean , honest , and capable government , one that adheres to the concept of " government by partnership , " so that whatever the local governments can do , the central government should not get involved in ; and whatever the private sector can do , the central government should also not get involved .  
The ruling party itself adopted her causes-democracy , freedom , and the ROC 's return to the United Nations-as its own . She found herself in the mainstream , and became one of the most influential members of the opposition party . She served in the national legislature , was invited to serve as a national policy advisor to the president , and was elected to two consecutive terms as county commissioner in Taoyuan . Before her second term was half finished , Chen Shui-bian selected her as his vice-presidential running mate .  
This visit , which has been called " soft diplomacy , " breaks the previous mold of focusing on political and economic power . Instead , the vice president 's delegation included members of the cultural , religious , and scientific communities , and elected officials as well .  
The elected heads of Taipei County , Taichung City , Tainan City , Ilan County , and other local governments around Taiwan are in virtually unanimous agreement that " the central government should completely re-think its revenue sharing philosophy and formulate consistent criteria for determining a fair distribution . Such criteria might include population , land area , and degree of need . "  
A plethora of media reports about medical malpractice disputes seem to announce a crisis of confidence between doctors and patients . When patients are dissatisfied with or doubtful about the treatment they receive at hospitals and clinics , the majority choose to remain silent and put their experience down to bad luck , while some voice their concerns directly to the doctor , hospital or local health bureau . But others seek out their elected representatives , complain to the media , throw eggs , carry coffins through the streets in protest , or institute legal proceedings .  
So what is the current situation in the broadcast media in Taiwan ? The extent of involvement of political actors is indeed serious . Recently the Government Information Office announced the results of an investigation into the running of electronic media by holders of public office . It shows that among 366 such media outlets , 67 elected or executive branch officials are board members , managers , stockholders , or founders .  
In terms of agreement , both sides realize that although democratic government is essentially " representative government , " duly elected representatives and officials are sometimes unable to carry out fully and impartially the duties entrusted to them by the electorate . To correct the insufficiencies of " indirect democracy " one must thus rely on the " direct democracy " of the popular referendum . This is an important element in the deepening and reform of the democratic process .  
The completion of National Highway No . 3 bears witness to tremendous changes in Taiwan . During the period of its construction , the island experienced rapid economic , social and political changes , and the heroes who built the road had to face a host of challenges , including waves of citizens ' protests , meddling from elected officials and organized crime , and investigations by judicial agencies , as well as natural disasters such as the 921 earthquake . The difficulties of construction included record-setting bridges , tunnels and challenges of all kinds .

In the face of the intransigent position of the military junta , which has refused to step down , bringing about further deterioration of the situation in the country , which has one of the world 's lowest living standards , and threatening regional peace and security , the Polish delegation believes that the measures recommended by ECOWAS , which the Security Council would take by adopting the present draft resolution , are appropriate for the objective of the expeditious restoration of the democratically elected Government of Sierra Leone .

They argued that the Hong Kong general public 's strong interest in Ma Ying-jeou 's visit was not derived from their concern about the motherland 's reunification and Hong Kong 's urban construction , but was derived from their interest in " seeing the mayor being elected democratically in Chinese society . "  
At his work posts , he made great contributions to the party 's ethnic work , united front work , and socialist cause .  In 1978 , he was elected as vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee . Though being at an advanced age , he still paid close attention to the unity of the people of all ethnic groups and the development of the areas inhabited by ethnic minorities , and still cared about the development and use of water resources in the motherland .  
But it is also in the voters ' own interest to exercise their franchise as those elected would have a major say in determining their quality of life , such as in the areas of environmental hygiene , housing , medical services , and in the provision of public amenities , as well as recreational and sports facilities and services . "  
( b ) To vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot , guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors ; ' . 
" I have no doubt that the long term goal of the community of Hong Kong is to have a stable political structure providing a constructive and workable relationship between our executive-led government and a legislature elected through universal suffrage .  Many stakeholders are involved .  The administration will be expected to take a lead in coming up with alternative proposals .

Many stakeholders are involved .  The administration will be expected to take a lead in coming up with alternative proposals .  
" We are also accountable to the Legislative Council , now fully elected , and increasingly representative under the timetable laid down in the Basic Law . The civil service has long recognised that dynamic , and willingly accepts its responsibility in explaining , defending and arguing for its policies and proposals before legislators . " 
Shareholders and relevant persons may still ask for a full set of financial documents from the company even if they have elected to receive the summary financial report and have received it , subject to the request being made prior to the next general meeting .  The company is required to send out the documents within 14 days upon receipt of the relevant notification .  
Because of this , electronic filing could not be accepted if double signatures were required , e.g . for a married taxpayer who had elected joint assessment or personal assessment and a taxpayer who had been nominated by the spouse for a home loan interest deduction , " the spokesman said .  
Furthermore , following the return of Hong Kong to the motherland , and with the elected Chief Executive , a fully elected legislature , the increasingly progressive and aggressive media , Government operation and policy formulation are subject to increasing public scrutiny and pressure .  In addition to expectation for Principal Officials to undertake their statutory duties , they have to cover political work within the community .  
Regarding the details of the proposal , Mr Lam said in respect of GC and FC elections , the candidates who got elected or had received 5 % of valid votes or more would be given financial support .

After graduation from college , he engaged in journalistic , cultural and educational work . Later , he served as an executive member of the party 's Taiwan provincial office based at Chang chow , Fukien province , and was elected a member of the party 's Sixth National Congress .  
Although fiercely competitive , this channel of selection and replacement assists in social integration . ( 2 ) A gradual increase in the average level of education and expertise of elected officials has helped increase the efficiency and capability of the political system . ( 3 ) Native Taiwanese have a comparatively better chance of serving in public office through elections , while mainlanders often pass through other recruitment channels .  
From being elected to the Legislative Yuan with the highest number of votes in the country , to his " change in careers " to become an executive branch official , Environmental Protection Administration Director Jaw Shau-kong has used his broad public support as his shield in undertaking the work of protecting the environment . Although he has run up against counterattacks from polluting industries and is seen as wreaking havoc in the " political ecology , " he has for this very reason accumulated even greater political resources : constituent support .  
Heavy on Public Opinion : In the 1985 Taipei City Council election , his vote total was high enough to elect four city councilmen [ Taiwan uses a multiple member single vote system ] . In the 1986 Legislative Yuan election , he was elected with 140,000 votes , highest in his district . In repeated electoral victories , he has overwhelmingly won over voters .  
But since social mores have changed , women no longer need guarantees to be elected to the Legislative Yuan , and have , like men , won with the largest number of votes in a given district ( Taiwan having multiple-member districts ) . After entering the Legislative Yuan , they have gone from a passive , " decorative " role to become bold , frank " women warriors " who have the courage to take responsibility for things . Their evolution deserves attention !  
Originally , outside of the dikes there were 17 acres of protected aboriginal land . In 1976 this had been eradicated by flowing soil and rocks carried from upstream . Although the county government agreed to compensate the residents NT $ 143,800 per acre , the aborigines no longer had enough to invest in recovering the land , since " after another year it would just be washed out again ! " says Chuoshui Rural Township elected official Chang Yi-hsiung unhappily .  
Too much water for the pot : Such frequent switching was not really surprising considering there were 403 candidates fighting over 161 seats . With such a narrow chance of getting elected , even the well-oiled machine of the ruling Kuomintang ( KMT ) party was unable to smooth over the competing demands of its candidates .  
Wang Hsing-ching observes that most people are far less ready to accept an aboriginal at the head of an administration than as a councillor , provincial assembly member or other elected representative , " for such representatives only represent their minority community , but the local chief executive represents a whole county or city , including the Han Chinese as well as the ' native people . ' '  
" This is because in the past in every medium of communication , the listener 's role was the smallest , " says " Nation United " host Ling Er-hsiang . Every time a major incident takes place , the media hurriedly interview government officials and expert scholars or elected representatives . " But really , the people are most important , not to mention the fact that the opinions of some common citizens are more outstanding and cut closer to reality . "  
Of course , everyone has their own version of the story , and it is hard to say who is right or wrong . But Li , looking at things from the point of view of enterprise development , feels that democratization in Taiwan is divorced from the rule of law , that the media is biased , that local elected officials stir up the population to win favor , and that the government - - though willing to help - - is unable to do anything . All these keep investors from moving forward . "  
Since , Chen argued , it is impossible to be completely loyal to two separate entities at the same time , it is only proper that parliamentarians should give up dual nationality . Following this logic , the government stipulated in the 1991 amendments to the Election and Recall Law that those elected as representatives must give up foreign citizenship before they are sworn into office .  
For example , just prior to the major provincial and municipal elections at the end of last year , Mary Tseng , secretary-general of the Wild Bird Society of Taipei , organized their semi-annual waterfowl festival in Kuantu . The Wild Bird Society invited candidates from all three major parties to take part in the huge gathering . Of course , the harvest was bountiful - - at the event all three parties ' candidates promised once elected to build a nature preserve in Kuantu .  
Despite its many special features , the Big Egg was battered by ridicule at first . In interpellations , one elected representative accused the Taoyuan County chief executive , Liu Pang-you , of being a liar for saying that Taoyuan 's stadium was Taiwan 's first domed stadium . The representative claimed that Liu was misleading the public because " the Taoyuan stadium is by no means an ' egg . ' A true domed stadium is an air-supported structure [ with air pressure inside exceeding that outside ] , and should hold 40-50,000 people . "  
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan - tseh believes that achievements in scholarship within Taiwan depend to a great extent on cooperative efforts between academics at home and abroad . As the gap with overseas scholarship is closed , the number of Taiwan-resident scholars elected to the Academia Sinica will increase , and more overseas scholars will be willing to return to Taiwan . The most important thing is to make contributions toward academic development in Taiwan , and the only standard of judgment should be the level of academic work .  
Among those elected , the five in the category of math and physical sciences are all engineering specialists , suggesting that applied science is being given increasing importance within the Academia Sinica . There was more diversity in the biology / chemistry group , with electees including specialists in medicine , neurology and molecular biology . The social science and humanities group , meanwhile , following an old tradition , continued to be dominated by economists .  
Of late , members of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly , the highest publicly elected body at the provincial level , have been embroiled in numerous scandals involving election bribery , libel charges , financial disputes and various lawsuits . In an effort to clean itself up and drive out malevolent forces , the Assembly conducted a prayer session in honor of the " good brothers , " thereby resorting to ghosts instead of turning to the common people .  
Among constitutional disputes , while the proposal to abolish the Taiwan Provincial Government ( TPG ) was placed only on the second day of the agenda , it gained even more attention than reforming the central level system . Dissent was found , however , not among the three parties , but in the " provincial " representatives directly involved . Governor James Soong , elected by popular vote , was left in the most embarrassing position . He skipped the debate by pleading that they had to answer interpellations from provincial assemblymen .  
Originally the Defense Ministry planned to use the land for residential housing . But the local governments , elected officials at all levels , and scholars and experts , all lobbied for different proposals . There were people calling for the land to be used for commercial real estate , for a trade center , for a new city government office complex , for a university . . . . The argument raged for years .  
In future , a nine-member commission , nominated by the premier and named by the president , and a consultative assembly will oversee whatever activities still remain for the downsized provincial government . County and municipal level executives and assemblies will continue to be popularly elected .  
Following local opposition to the fourth nuclear power station , the sixth naphtha cracker and other major projects , Bayer of Germany has , almost on the eve of the start of construction work , called a halt to its plan to build a chemical plant in the Taichung Harbor zone . This followed the newly elected county magistrate 's insistence that a referendum would be called to decide whether the plan should be allowed to go ahead . Although the central government is attempting to mediate , the future of the Bayer plan is now uncertain .  
Most property rights cases in which constitutional interpretations are sought affect individual citizens ' rights , and attract little outside attention or interference . But in other areas social forces ( such as civic groups and the media ) or political forces ( elected representatives ) often get involved .  
Whether lower-level measures related to localization of government can be implemented smoothly remains to be seen . These lower-level measures include the consensus reached by the National Development Conference on downsizing the TPG , making the jobs of village chief and township chief into positions appointed by the central government rather than elected by the public , and ending elections for village and township councils . Many are worried that parochialism may become more apparent when tasks that were originally handled by the TPG are handed over to local governments .  
However , Chen Shui-bian 's iron fist in dealing with illegal video game arcades , the razing of illegal structures and actions against the sex industry and licensed prostitutes , as well as his constant disputes with the city council , led to growing opposition from interested parties and groups representing the disadvantaged . This in turn meant that many voters had reservations about the rough-and-tumble style of their first elected mayor .  
If elected , I will change the obsolete bureaucratism in the central government , and undertake complete reinvention of the government . I will create a clean , honest , and capable government , one that adheres to the concept of " government by partnership , " so that whatever the local governments can do , the central government should not get involved in ; and whatever the private sector can do , the central government should also not get involved .  
The ruling party itself adopted her causes-democracy , freedom , and the ROC 's return to the United Nations-as its own . She found herself in the mainstream , and became one of the most influential members of the opposition party . She served in the national legislature , was invited to serve as a national policy advisor to the president , and was elected to two consecutive terms as county commissioner in Taoyuan . Before her second term was half finished , Chen Shui-bian selected her as his vice-presidential running mate .  
This visit , which has been called " soft diplomacy , " breaks the previous mold of focusing on political and economic power . Instead , the vice president 's delegation included members of the cultural , religious , and scientific communities , and elected officials as well .  
The elected heads of Taipei County , Taichung City , Tainan City , Ilan County , and other local governments around Taiwan are in virtually unanimous agreement that " the central government should completely re-think its revenue sharing philosophy and formulate consistent criteria for determining a fair distribution . Such criteria might include population , land area , and degree of need . "  
A plethora of media reports about medical malpractice disputes seem to announce a crisis of confidence between doctors and patients . When patients are dissatisfied with or doubtful about the treatment they receive at hospitals and clinics , the majority choose to remain silent and put their experience down to bad luck , while some voice their concerns directly to the doctor , hospital or local health bureau . But others seek out their elected representatives , complain to the media , throw eggs , carry coffins through the streets in protest , or institute legal proceedings .  
So what is the current situation in the broadcast media in Taiwan ? The extent of involvement of political actors is indeed serious . Recently the Government Information Office announced the results of an investigation into the running of electronic media by holders of public office . It shows that among 366 such media outlets , 67 elected or executive branch officials are board members , managers , stockholders , or founders .  
In terms of agreement , both sides realize that although democratic government is essentially " representative government , " duly elected representatives and officials are sometimes unable to carry out fully and impartially the duties entrusted to them by the electorate . To correct the insufficiencies of " indirect democracy " one must thus rely on the " direct democracy " of the popular referendum . This is an important element in the deepening and reform of the democratic process .  
The completion of National Highway No . 3 bears witness to tremendous changes in Taiwan . During the period of its construction , the island experienced rapid economic , social and political changes , and the heroes who built the road had to face a host of challenges , including waves of citizens ' protests , meddling from elected officials and organized crime , and investigations by judicial agencies , as well as natural disasters such as the 921 earthquake . The difficulties of construction included record-setting bridges , tunnels and challenges of all kinds .
