At the time of great social changes taking place and during a special historical era of moving from a closed society to an opened society , people should experience bigger fluctuations in ideology and mentality .

All these should eventually be resolved in practice through relying on the self-education of the masses .  
We revamped our concepts and emancipated our minds , guiding all areas to actively and boldly develop civil air defense reform practice .  We broke with the closed state , throwing open the doors , and sharply developing and utilizing early-stage projects , with projects integrating peacetime with wartime , such as underground markets , parking garages , production shops , and cultural entertainment places , springing up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain .  
The first contradiction is that some groups and individuals may exploit their resource advantages , previously acquired under the traditional system , to pursue gains under market conditions , thereby forming exclusive , speculative , and closed benefit-distribution groups whose resource-monopoly capability will undermine a balanced interest-differentiation process based on the normal development of the market economy .  
At present , Taiwan is engulfed in political turbulence and continuous economic depression .  Large numbers of businesses have closed down or suspended operations , the unemployment rate is climbing higher and higher , and the people 's " pain index " continues to rise .

Strictly speaking , keeping oneself clean in a sense also means being worldly-wise and playing safe .  This kind of people do not care how other people look at them and think that , as long as they are not involved , it is better for them to be onlookers .  Some people , although knowing that someone did something wrong , pretend not to know anything and keep one eye closed .

Last year , Diamonds in the Rough helped 10,000 graduates of junior high schools all over the province , each through individual guidance . The guidance counselor - - usually the child 's ninth grade counselor - - regularly telephones them each week and visits their homes or the places they study or work , listening to their heartfelt concerns , correcting their thinking and giving them information on finding jobs or continuing their schooling .

There is still much room for discussion about whether zoos should be closed , but those trying to maintain a little conventional dignity must be careful in censuring others as inhumane .

The challenge inside the systemPerhaps in Taiwan the democratic climate has not reached maturity , yet the administrative system , originally closed and operating from the top downward , has opened a door to the outside .

" In the past , society was very closed , and it was hard to get information , so people really respected their professors , " says Lin Chin-chuan . Now we live amidst an information explosion , with rapid development of all forms of media . Teachers are no longer the only source of knowledge .

For instance , irregular meal times have given him digestion problems ; he has hemorrhoids from long hours in the driver 's seat ; driving with the windows closed and the air conditioning on to keep out the polluted air gives him aching joints ; watching the road and traffic signals all day tires his eyes and makes his vision blurry ; using the clutch constantly in stop-go traffic leaves his left leg painful and weak , and so on .  
Since 1993 , as part of a major government crackdown , the government has thus far closed down over 30 underground amphetamine laboratories . Nearly 14 tons of raw materials , finished products , and semi-finished products were uncovered . The industry 's history then repeated itself , only this time it was Taiwan drug manufacturers putting up the capital and providing the equipment and technology , as factories moved westward to coastal China ( especially Fujian ) . Goods produced there are either sold to Taiwanese businessmen or shipped out to Taiwan , Japan , and Korea .  
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan - tseh believes that achievements in scholarship within Taiwan depend to a great extent on cooperative efforts between academics at home and abroad . As the gap with overseas scholarship is closed , the number of Taiwan-resident scholars elected to the Academia Sinica will increase , and more overseas scholars will be willing to return to Taiwan .

Otherwise , it is not impossible that similar crises of family and social ethics will again occur .

The ancient Egyptian monarchs that ruled over the Nile River Valley longed for eternal life and were wrapped up as mummies , in the hope that they would come to life again " like a water lily reopening . " Water lilies were often used in funeral ceremonies , and people would pray that the deceased would , like a closed water lily flower , have the chance of blooming again .

Worried , the MOF , acting through the Keelung Tariff Bureau , then decided to reclaim its portion of Wistaria House at the end of July , before the city government had publicly declared the teahouse a historic landmark . It sealed off the old residence with plywood boards and closed up the flower garden . All that was left of the teahouse was Chou Yu 's two-story Western-style house , forcing him " to run the ship on half an engine . "  
In addition to Wistaria 's old friends and acquaintances , foreign travelers who had heard of the teahouse abroad and ventured here to see it were also shocked that half of it had been boarded up . People were afraid that no one would maintain the closed off section ; the garden would turn into a tangle of weeds and a haven for insects . Water collecting on the roof would surely damage the wooden structure .

From my personal perspective as someone involved in many different fields , and also from the East Asian perspective , this is a good thing . Classical Western art is very structured , and over the centuries has built up a formidable degree of internal consistency . But it is this very internal consistency that turns Western art into a closed system . When art evolves to a certain point , it becomes what is known in Buddhism as " worldly wisdom , " which means to regard " the seeming " as real .  
I think if we had invited artists from outside the field of visual arts to come and critique " An Award for Taipei Biennale , " they could have provided some very trenchant insights , because the impact of modern art on classical art has been a matter of the external challenging the internal . External concepts pounded away at an internally closed system .  
Some say the family is like a refuge where members can find shelter from life 's trials and hardships . Others say the family is like a financial institution that provides for daily necessities .

Viewed from this perspective the FMT could capture in an irreversible way weapons material declared as excess in an ongoing process ; prevent altogether or regulate the further production of weapons _ grade materials for legitimate uses such as fuel for research reactors , naval reactors , etc . ; make closed _ down production and associated facilities subject to verification to prevent their reuse for weapons purposes .  
What links many of these seemingly disparate issues is an often inchoate , but nevertheless palpable , fear on the part of large numbers of thoughtful people , in developing , and developed countries alike , that impersonal forces beyond their control and accountable to no one - distant bureaucracies , mammoth transnational corporations , international organizations meeting behind closed doors - are taking over their lives .

At the time of great social changes taking place and during a special historical era of moving from a closed society to an opened society , people should experience bigger fluctuations in ideology and mentality .  They might feel confused and incomprehensible about the new social phenomena which are constantly emerging or even make deviations and errors in understanding .  All these should eventually be resolved in practice through relying on the self-education of the masses .  
We revamped our concepts and emancipated our minds , guiding all areas to actively and boldly develop civil air defense reform practice .  We broke with the closed state , throwing open the doors , and sharply developing and utilizing early-stage projects , with projects integrating peacetime with wartime , such as underground markets , parking garages , production shops , and cultural entertainment places , springing up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain .  
The first contradiction is that some groups and individuals may exploit their resource advantages , previously acquired under the traditional system , to pursue gains under market conditions , thereby forming exclusive , speculative , and closed benefit-distribution groups whose resource-monopoly capability will undermine a balanced interest-differentiation process based on the normal development of the market economy .  
At present , Taiwan is engulfed in political turbulence and continuous economic depression .  Large numbers of businesses have closed down or suspended operations , the unemployment rate is climbing higher and higher , and the people 's " pain index " continues to rise .

In the wake of the gradual deepening of China 's market-oriented reform of the foreign currency interest rates , its foreign currency interest rates are no longer shut in their own closed environment and are instead linking tracks with the international financial community ; they are following international practices and rules and regulations to increasingly move up and down in sync with the international interest rates .

Strictly speaking , keeping oneself clean in a sense also means being worldly-wise and playing safe .  This kind of people do not care how other people look at them and think that , as long as they are not involved , it is better for them to be onlookers .  Some people , although knowing that someone did something wrong , pretend not to know anything and keep one eye closed .

Last year , Diamonds in the Rough helped 10,000 graduates of junior high schools all over the province , each through individual guidance . The guidance counselor - - usually the child 's ninth grade counselor - - regularly telephones them each week and visits their homes or the places they study or work , listening to their heartfelt concerns , correcting their thinking and giving them information on finding jobs or continuing their schooling . How long does counseling have to go on before a case is considered closed ?  
There is still much room for discussion about whether zoos should be closed , but those trying to maintain a little conventional dignity must be careful in censuring others as inhumane .

They should have applied to set up , and by not doing so they have violated their responsibilities under the Broadcasting Law . These are two different situations .  
The challenge inside the systemPerhaps in Taiwan the democratic climate has not reached maturity , yet the administrative system , originally closed and operating from the top downward , has opened a door to the outside . In the past two or three years , reform groups have been commissioned by the government in some areas , and more and more have begun to be incorporated within the parameters of the system .  
" In the past , society was very closed , and it was hard to get information , so people really respected their professors , " says Lin Chin-chuan . Now we live amidst an information explosion , with rapid development of all forms of media . Teachers are no longer the only source of knowledge . Naturally the paternalistic , god-like authority they enjoyed in the past has declined , and it has become necessary for them relate to students on a more personal level .  
For instance , irregular meal times have given him digestion problems ; he has hemorrhoids from long hours in the driver 's seat ; driving with the windows closed and the air conditioning on to keep out the polluted air gives him aching joints ; watching the road and traffic signals all day tires his eyes and makes his vision blurry ; using the clutch constantly in stop-go traffic leaves his left leg painful and weak , and so on .  
Since 1993 , as part of a major government crackdown , the government has thus far closed down over 30 underground amphetamine laboratories . Nearly 14 tons of raw materials , finished products , and semi-finished products were uncovered . The industry 's history then repeated itself , only this time it was Taiwan drug manufacturers putting up the capital and providing the equipment and technology , as factories moved westward to coastal China ( especially Fujian ) . Goods produced there are either sold to Taiwanese businessmen or shipped out to Taiwan , Japan , and Korea .  
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan - tseh believes that achievements in scholarship within Taiwan depend to a great extent on cooperative efforts between academics at home and abroad . As the gap with overseas scholarship is closed , the number of Taiwan-resident scholars elected to the Academia Sinica will increase , and more overseas scholars will be willing to return to Taiwan . The most important thing is to make contributions toward academic development in Taiwan , and the only standard of judgment should be the level of academic work .  
Against this background , Huang advises that it is inappropriate for students , lacking experience in society and with immature minds , to be allowed to participate in long-termed , closed activities like the summer camp .

Otherwise , it is not impossible that similar crises of family and social ethics will again occur .  
While they wait for the museum , much of the historical heritage has been disappearing , particularly over the last decade . Many branch lines have closed , and a number of wooden stations which had great character have been torn down and replaced . Many precious carriages , after being withdrawn from service , have not found a happy retirement home , but have been sold off for scrap at a price of NT $ 5 per kilogram .

The ancient Egyptian monarchs that ruled over the Nile River Valley longed for eternal life and were wrapped up as mummies , in the hope that they would come to life again " like a water lily reopening . " Water lilies were often used in funeral ceremonies , and people would pray that the deceased would , like a closed water lily flower , have the chance of blooming again . In 1361 BC , the tomb of King Tutan-kamen was finished in Egypt , and was n't unsealed until 1922 .  
Worried , the MOF , acting through the Keelung Tariff Bureau , then decided to reclaim its portion of Wistaria House at the end of July , before the city government had publicly declared the teahouse a historic landmark . It sealed off the old residence with plywood boards and closed up the flower garden . All that was left of the teahouse was Chou Yu 's two-story Western-style house , forcing him " to run the ship on half an engine . "  
In addition to Wistaria 's old friends and acquaintances , foreign travelers who had heard of the teahouse abroad and ventured here to see it were also shocked that half of it had been boarded up . People were afraid that no one would maintain the closed off section ; the garden would turn into a tangle of weeds and a haven for insects . Water collecting on the roof would surely damage the wooden structure .  
When the Kaohsiung Museum of Science opened last year , it experienced disaster in the form of crowds which damaged exhibits .

The bronze statue has sharp facial features-bushy eyebrows , big eyes that glare at the viewer , an aquiline nose , and a tightly closed mouth that reaches very nearly from ear to ear . The facial muscles are tensed , the expression is solemn , and both arms are held out in a circle , as if performing some kind of sacred rite .  
In addition to the towering bronze statue , the two burial pits also contained 57 bronze heads . Sharp lines delineate big , protruding eyes and tightly closed lips . While each of these figures was used in religious rites , the air of religious intensity in each face is hidden behind a mask .  
Looking at the larger environment , in recent years , the global financial crisis and cross-strait tensions have caused economic turbulence , and firms have closed factories and laid off personnel .

Typhoon Trami , a " mini " typhoon with a radius of just 100 km , closed in on southern Taiwan on July 11 .

In 1996 Chou read an article about oceanographic research in which the writer , inspired by everyday experience , described how even in a closed room with no direct light source , scattered sunlight ( " ambient light " ) entering the room and striking objects is reflected into people 's eyes to form images , so that people in the room can still see each other .  
They are equipped not only with radar , wireless communication equipment , and net winches , but everything actually is operable , and even the doors and windows can be opened and closed . His handiwork captures the real thing so well that it 's downright spooky . Even old seadogs gush in praise when they see his boats .  
The book indicates the positions of " reflex zones " on the feet that correspond to the organs of the urinary , digestive , circulatory and immune systems , and states that the nerve endings in these reflex zones are linked to the major organs of the body . People 's feet spend months and years closed up in " shoe hell , " so that the blood circulation is restricted , and this can easily lead to poor health .  
The mid-1990s saw a crisis in the local paint industry as production costs increased in Taiwan . Most traditional paint factories closed or moved overseas , while those that remained were forced to make layoffs or cut back salaries .  
There have also been numerous cases that have been reported only after the patient has died . Even more worrisome is that Taiwan 's leading medical institution-National Taiwan University Hospital-confirmed after a long period of rumors that there had been hospital transmission .

Many respiratory-tract infectious diseases , including Legionnaires Disease and SARS , spread quickly through closed air-conditioning systems ; extended-wear contact lenses are ideal breeding grounds for bacterial conjunctivitis ; in many cosmetic products there are bovine collagens containing mad cow disease proteins ; and " airport malaria " circles the globe on airliners .  
From my personal perspective as someone involved in many different fields , and also from the East Asian perspective , this is a good thing . Classical Western art is very structured , and over the centuries has built up a formidable degree of internal consistency . But it is this very internal consistency that turns Western art into a closed system . When art evolves to a certain point , it becomes what is known in Buddhism as " worldly wisdom , " which means to regard " the seeming " as real .  
I think if we had invited artists from outside the field of visual arts to come and critique " An Award for Taipei Biennale , " they could have provided some very trenchant insights , because the impact of modern art on classical art has been a matter of the external challenging the internal . External concepts pounded away at an internally closed system .  
Some say the family is like a refuge where members can find shelter from life 's trials and hardships . Others say the family is like a financial institution that provides for daily necessities . Some people liken the family to a silk cocoon-warm and comfortable but closed off and restrictive . Yet others liken the family to a poisonous snake where members are bound together , but by bonds of hatred and dislike instead of love and caring .  
The sudden influx of 20,000 people into the city from the fierce fighting suburban areas , have further deteriorated the living condition there , with the prices of daily necessities shooting up to an unbearable level and many stores having been closed down , social welfare department officials said  
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 50-44 at 10,887-39 The index fell 16-52 points Tuesday , recovering from a 112 point drop that was triggered by the Federal 's warning of possible rise in interest rates in the coming months if necessary while leaving rates unchanged at present  
The Council 's current practices , characterized by the closed and secret nature of the vast majority of the substantive deliberations of its members , make it ever more necessary to meet our demand for an analytical , complete and integral report .  
Since before the 1980s , Central America had begun to suffer the effects of a deep political , economic and social crisis that came about precisely because national societies had developed within a system of limited democracy in particular , because social programmes were not formulated or executed , a doctrine of national security was promoted , political arenas were closed and civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights were violated in one way or another . 
Since then , the country has removed strategic and tactical nuclear weapons , closed scores of bases and demobilized many thousands of military personnel , transferring to local authorities the responsibility of providing them with housing and basic services .
