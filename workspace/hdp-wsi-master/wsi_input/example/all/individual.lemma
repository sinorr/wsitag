Individual beings then make a choice depending upon their free will and their spiritual needs " ( p . 185 ) .

Traditional Chinese placed great emphasis on proper rituals or patterns of behavior , and failure to observe these was deemed to be criminal .

However , restrained by his conditioning through years of bureaucratic experience , he appeared overcautious in the midst of exposition and argumentation .  
The aim of educational reform is to put into practice a concept of education that imparts happiness , contentment , pluralism and mutual respect . Such education is designed to develop potentialities , respect individualism , promote humanism , and encourage creativity .

Ample room will be reserved for individual originality and personal traits to ensure the continued pursuit of self-growth and self-realization .  
Some borrow movements from Chinese opera , while others search for characteristic Chinese body language in tai-chi or meditation . Others adapt the techniques of Western modern dance .

His Cloud Gate dance company is built on a foundation of techniques developed by American choreographer Martha Graham , with subject matter drawn from current events in Taiwan or from Chinese classics ( like Dream of the Red Chamber or The Legend of the White Snake ) .  
These figures suggest citizens ' ability to separate the individual from the issue at stake and to be both hard-headed and sympathetic .

Based upon various different research conclusions , Goleman expresses the strong belief that social problems , particularly the worsening problems among children and adolescents , are linked to the emotions .

The mix of Chinese and barbarian was at first a matter of necessity . But since it has continually renewed and reproduced itself , with the efforts of each new generation , there has been a qualitative change . If individual cells in the primordial soup can come together to form a new organism , this organism is not just a mechanical combination of the original cells , but is an organic " creation . "  
Yang Wen-I notes that the Biennale has always been an open-application exhibition . For instance , four years ago the motion artist Li Ming-shen applied as an individual .

Multiplication / Fragmentation is formally listed as part of the Biennale de Venezia 97 and is included in the show 's official catalog .  
" To be honest , from a greater historical perspective , it would be pushing it to call Wistaria House a ' real ' historic landmark , " says Huang Fu-san , director of the Academica Sinica 's Institute of Taiwan History .

The committee is trying to set a new example whereby historic landmarks are judged not only by external criteria , but by their individual " personality " and history as well .  
" The only purpose of financial operations is to turn a profit .

Whether or not legislation is passed , perhaps in the end it will still be a matter for individual choice and conscience , and the new issues created by modern technological " solutions " by which humans seek to " overcome nature , " such as human cloning , cryogenics and so on , will continue to constantly force mankind to search for still more comprehensive and precisely formulated social rules , and will forever push " evolution " to new heights .  
Apart from affirming the principle of sexual equality , this ruling also stressed that the constitution protects the freedom to choose one 's own residence .

" It is essential that both husband and wife respect each other 's dignity . "  
If employees feel this is not enough , they will be free to negotiate increased amounts with their employers , " says Anita Liu . For example , if the boss and workers each pay an additional 2% , then the workers will be doing a bit of " enforced saving " for their pensions .

It is precisely this use of synergistic combinations of natural substances-both from animals and plants-as opposed to the use of individually active chemical substances , " says Chang , who holds a doctorate in chemistry and is certified as a doctor of Chinese medicine . If only individual active components from herbal medicines are extracted and used , then the special synergistic character of herbal medicines will be lost .  
The US Federal Drug Administration has accepted the use of herbal drugs , and Medicare and Medicaid now cover it . " While many of its methods still defy explanation , Chinese medicine does provide an entirely different model for modern medicine and thus is a priceless asset , " Chen says .

One tea setting presents a vision of layers of purple ; a vegetable basket off to the side lends a bucolic touch . Another is coffee colored with a touch of grey , setting a light and frisky mood . And there is also a setting which is entirely blue , the individual pieces of teaware looking like cool observers standing off to one side .  
She adds , with particular reference to the problem of overtime pay , " It is especially unfair given that employer and employee interact as economic entities , a status in which every individual should be equal . " The final irony of all is that the overtime regulations are frequently not observed by employers , so the people who are punished most are those single women who obediently agree to work past the legal limits on their overtime hours .  
Chou , whose primary area of research is clinical statistics , states that most of this research is limited to extractions and animal research in the Chinese medical laboratory , or consists of individual case reports .

And even in these cases , the design is still rough .  
Most property rights cases in which constitutional interpretations are sought affect individual citizens ' rights , and attract little outside attention or interference .

These not only provide entertainment for the individual , but are a recreational activity among friends .  
According to museum employee Lu Yu-hua , many people express surprise that there should be an entire museum devoted solely to paper , but when you really think about it , there 's really nothing strange about it . When paper was first invented , the raw materials from which it was made differed from one region to the next . A single sheet of paper spoke volumes about local climates and vegetation ; its very existence enabled the spread of knowledge , and could record the history of an individual or an entire nation !  
But unlike these resilient structures , many newly-built apartment blocks came crashing down completely without warning . Many anomalies such as concertinaed individual storeys , rebars ( reinforcing bars ) pulled clean and straight out of the bases of columns , rebars snapped through like dry spaghetti , and even the joints between beams and columns filled out with cooking-oil cans , were reported to the world by the international media , to the shame of Taiwan 's construction industry .  
With wisdom and intelligence , the people of the Han institutionalized the country 's political , economic and social systems , laying down the framework for the subsequent development of Chinese society .

This was a period when individual freedoms were extended , encouraging one of the most remarkable flowerings of literature , fine art and handicrafts in history .  
The problem was eventually fixed through the combined efforts of a number of American computer scientists . Realizing that the increasing size and complexity of computer networks made it impossible for any individual to discover all the holes within them , these scientists established the Computer Emergency Response Team ( CERT ) at Carnegie-Mellon University . They hoped that by working together , network security issues could be predicted and resolved .

You can find as succinct a description of Zhu Xi 's importance as any in the Taiwan middle-school textbook History of Chinese Culture , which notes that Zhu Xi spent a lifetime annotating the Confucian classics , and established his own academies to teach others .

His spirit permeated the daily lives , outlooks , and spiritual inclinations of Chinese people . "  
According to statistics of the Ministry of Finance , 87.5% of the trading volume on the Taiwan stock exchange comes from individual investors . In 1999 turnover was 288% ( that is , total trading volume was 2.88 times the total value of the market ) , which , though considerably down from nearly 600% ten years before , remained four times higher than the New York stock exchange .

With longer lifespans and less rigid social values , patterns of living once shared by all have been replaced by a growing diversity of individual experiences . In middle age , some people set up successful businesses , while others lose their jobs and are faced with poverty ; working women find themselves squeezed between the exhausting demands of children and housework on the one hand and their jobs on the other , while at the same time many single women face a daily battle with loneliness .  
" When the market gets tired of soft and pretty idols , it swings back toward androgynous tomboy types like Feng Fei-fei , " Wang notes . " Sun Yan Zi fills this need perfectly .

Moreover , access to the outside world was completely severed for a week .  
With regard to copyrighted imports such as newspapers , magazines , recordings and books , Chao explains that everything that has research value ( whether the copyright is held by an individual or an organization ) can be imported .

According to interpretations of the Avatamsaka Sutra , our universe is formed of pearl-like individual objects strung together in a net , so that it is difficult to separate what is real from what is illusion ; past , present , and future exist side-by-side ; and no individual can exist in isolation . As a result , people should live in the present , embrace goodness and do good deeds , so that the universe will tend toward harmony .  
The Internet in fact closely resembles the intangible , borderless world of connected individual " pearls . " We never know how extensive or long-lasting might be the impact of a single small idea or action , but we can imagine that every molecule in the vast universe is connected . The area which illustrates such profound ideas is also , interestingly enough , the one that provides the most plain fun .

Leading it home is an old farming woman , who is carrying a bundle of sugar cane and wearing leggings and a broad rimmed hat with a covering scarf knotted under her chin . The simple and rustic scene does a good job of conveying Taiwan 's slow pace of life in those days .  
And so , apart from designing and carving , when his fellow workers were off work and at leisure , Huang busied himself attending exhibitions and doing relevant research in the field .

Sister Therese says women spend varying amounts of time in the Good Shepherd center . During an average two-week to three-month stay of an urgent case , the social workers first try to get an understanding of the new bride 's background and situation .

Secondly , to avoid referendum issues being controlled by special-interest groups , laws must be passed to regulate public announcements , provide for the balanced presentation of information and guarantee the free flow of information .  
Eric Lin / tr . by Phil Newell We may only have just opened chapter one of the 21st century , but already the twists and turns in the world are coming so fast that it makes your head spin . Taiwanese have always prided themselves on their adaptability and nose for the latest in global trends , but in an age in which even industrial technology comes and goes in the blink of an eye , even the most agile individual is likely to find him - or herself buffeted by time 's waves into unforeseen directions .

As a result of last year 's SARS outbreak , checking temperatures became an important part of medical checkups , but this extra step also put the persons responsible for checking temperatures at risk . One student , whose girlfriend is a nurse , came up with an earring thermometer that can be directly clipped to the earlobe . If the body temperature of the individual exceeds 38 oC , the heat transmitted through a conductive metal insert in the thermometer causes mercury to expand , activating a warning light .

At the heart of democracy and its inherent political pluralism are certain basic guarantees that uphold the sovereignty of the people , the worth and dignity of the individual , the rule of law , full respect for and protection of fundamental human rights and , above all , the peaceful search for human development .  
It follows that the existence of a consistent pattern of gross , flagrant or mass violations of human rights in a country does not as such constitute a sufficient ground for determining that a person would be in danger of being subjected to torture upon his return to that country ; additional grounds must exist that indicate that the individual concerned would be personally at risk .  
Article 22 , paragraph 5 ( b ) , of the Convention precludes the Committee from considering any communication from an individual , unless it has ascertained that the individual has exhausted all available domestic remedies ; this rule does not apply if it is established that the application of domestic remedies has been or would be unreasonable prolonged or would be unlikely to bring effective relief .

Such developments have been accompanied by a natural yearning for the achievement of development in both its economic and social domains , while developments on the negative side have generated a wider cycle of racial , national and religious disputes in some regions of the world that have led to a noticeable retreat from respect for human rights and basic freedoms of the human individual , as well as regression of development both in the economic and social spheres .  
Perhaps this new humanitarian world order , because of its aims which would make the human being the main focus of international action in such areas as the eradication of poverty and unemployment and the bridging of the gap between the rich and the poor , on both the individual and societal levels , may well furnish the solid foundation upon which we can build the desired new world order whose parameters have not crystallized as yet .  
The affirmation of human dignity and the universal rights of the individual upheld by the Charter of the United Nations can be achieved only through respect for different ethnic , religious , cultural and political identities , through an efficient system of collective security , and through respect for a law-governed State and international law .  
The global order can no longer be based solely on the special position of the anti-fascist coalition or the nuclear club , or on economic or military power ; rather , first and foremost , it should be based on the real contribution of individual countries to the prevention of every form of totalitarianism and to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; on their role within global socio-economic development ; on their democratic achievement ; and on their regional importance .  
We , the leaders of the modern world , are faced with a great responsibility : we must be united and rise above our distinct personal , party and national interests , and seek the vision of a new world which will hold a future for every individual , every nation and State , for the universality of spirit and for the tolerance of the different .

Although the use of this recourse legally conceals an individual 's real status as a mercenary , information such as the origin of the contractual relationship , the payment , the type of services arranged for and the simultaneous use of other nationalities and passports may serve as evidence in establishing the true status of persons who are justifiably suspected of engaging in mercenary activities .  
In the context of the new demands on operational activities , the capacity for policy connections between the different strands of political , economic , social and environmental factors has become important .

States should ensure that data are collected from vessels flying their flag on fishing activities according to the operational characteristics of each fishing method ( e.g . , each individual tow for trawl , each set for long-line and purse-seine , each school fished for pole-and-line and each day fished for troll ) and in sufficient detail to facilitate effective stock assessment ;  
It is , however , in relation to national action at the country level - in assisting individual countries to translate the outcomes of the conferences into concrete national policies and programmes , and in providing resident coordinators and country-level teams with coherent system-wide support - that existing inter-agency efforts need to be especially reinforced .  
It also welcomed the call in the Plan of Action for more systematic coordination among specialized agencies , regional organizations , national institutions and NGOs , and the assignment of that responsibility to the High Commissioner ; coordinated international action in the area of human rights education would result in more effective assistance to individual countries without weakening their sense of " ownership " of curricula reforms .

40 Given the typical characteristics of rural areas , such as sparseness of population , lack of trained personnel , low initial demand and high costs of installing individual services , it was suggested that the introduction of enhanced information exchange in rural areas of Africa should be achieved through the establishment of telecentres where services would be pooled to serve the entire community .  
After the full and final reimbursement of all accepted claims from eligible participating Governments in the Unified Task Force , the balance of individual contributions remaining in the fund was transferred , according to the wishes of the contributing countries , to the two sub-accounts established for the support of the Somali police force and judicial and penal systems , and for the support of UNOSOM II forces .  
The Commission noted that growing awareness of the UNCITRAL legal texts in many countries , in particular developing countries and newly independent States , had resulted in increased requests for training and technical assistance from individual Governments or regional organizations .  
The detailed information required for these purposes includes the response time for each individual unit , any political or material preconditions , period of self-sufficiency , level of equipment , probable port of departure , total surface / volume / weight , number of vehicles , number of containers , information on particularly large or heavy items , information on dangerous cargo ( e.g . ammunition ) and any specific handling instructions .  
Besides its harmful effects on the individual , drug abuse represented a major handicap to economic and social development , lowering productivity and imposing a heavy burden on health-care facilities and social service agencies .  
On 24 November , at border crossing point Sremska Raca , a Mission team 's local female interpreter was harassed in the ladies room by an intoxicated individual wearing a military uniform .  
Also stresses that the governing bodies of all funds , programmes and specialized agencies should make further progress in order to ensure that the prescribed limits on field-level authority for cancelling , modifying and adding activities within approved programmes and shifting resources within approved budget lines of individual components of a programme and among components of a programme , with the approval of national authorities , should be expanded to become equal and uniform , to the maximum extent possible , in the context of enhanced accountability ;  
Promote greater governmental involvement in the selection process for resident coordinators , in particular by ensuring that national Governments are consulted before the post profile for resident coordinators is passed to the Joint Consultative Group on Policies , and keeping up to date the selection criteria for resident coordinators and , through the respective executive heads , for senior representatives of United Nations agencies in the field , bearing in mind the specific circumstances of individual countries ;  
Also decides that the field-level committees organized by the United Nations system country team , which were established in accordance with paragraph 40 of General Assembly resolution 47 / 199 , should review substantive activities - including draft country programmes , sectoral programmes and projects - prior to their approval by individual organizations , and should exchange experience acquired , on the understanding that the result of the work of the review committee should be submitted to national Governments for final approval through the national focal points ;

selective or double standards in dealing with human rights violations should be avoided ; racist laws and practices , particularly ethnic cleansing and mass deportation , should be resisted regardless of their perpetrators or causes ; all fundamental freedoms should be considered equally important ; arbitrary , undemocratic methods should not be used in international relations on the pretext of defending the rights of the individual , since the will of the international community represented the free will of every State ; and priority should be given to particularly serious human rights violations .  
These processes are , paradoxically , at the basis of both integration and fragmentation phenomena ; they challenge individual States , and the international community as a whole , to take innovative initiatives that address the social risks that are emerging at the global level along with environmental risks .  
In this context , the major tool utilized by public administration in its work should not be decisions taken on an individual basis , but regulations intended to create mechanisms and frameworks within which independent activity can take place and social and economic entities can produce initiatives .  
The process of political harmonization and reconciliation initiated by the Government encouraged the individual and collective participation of civil society in all activities , promoting a climate of trust that to date has facilitated the functioning of a growing free market economy with social justice . 
The reform altered 65 of the Constitution 's 202 articles , with respect to individual rights ; the rights and responsibilities of and guarantees for the Nicaraguan people ; political and social rights ; the rights of the Nicaraguan family ; defence and the national economy ; agrarian reform and public finances ; education and culture ; the organization of the State ; municipal affairs ; and the Atlantic Coast communities . 
Since the moment last November when you , Sir , were kind enough to entrust me with the coordination of these consultations , we have held a total of 36 full days of meetings , in addition to many informal consultations , or hallway meetings in many cases coordinated by specific delegations that generously devoted their time and efforts to act as facilitators as well as countless individual contacts and joint internal discussions within the various groups .  
One person less going to bed with an empty stomach , one person less torn with pain , one person less denied shelter small pragmatic steps inspired by the innate dignity of each human being ; acts of caring solidarity which each individual , each family , each community is capable of ; commitment to others generates hope .  
Any government , institution or individual seeking to promote human rights should bear in mind the significance of national and regional peculiarities as well as historical , cultural and religious backgrounds and the stage of economic development .  
We believe that development challenges to any country can be met only by taking into account the global economic system as a solution that involves the development of a comprehensive framework combining international and local efforts , with a view to improving the performance of the economy in a favourable environment wherein local and regional circumstances and the priorities and special conditions of each individual State are taken into consideration .  
While we should not allow that individual consensual elements of the reform process be held hostage to progress in unrelated issues , there seems to be an evident need to reach a political agreement , at least on the basic philosophy of the major premises of the reform agenda .  
While we are aware that the matter of economic and individual personal development is first and foremost a national responsibility , we are deeply conscious that our limited domestic resources constitute a severe constraint upon us in our quest to fulfil this obligation .  
Thus while it acknowledged that individual countries bear the primary responsibility for the attainment of the goals of the conference , it also recognized that the support of the international community as a whole including of the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , bilateral donors , non-governmental organizations and all actors of civil society will be crucial if we are to realize all the objectives of the conference .  
Even though it is important to reaffirm a strong commitment of the private sector , donor Governments , agencies and non-governmental organizations to genuine partnership for the accelerated industrial growth of Africa , a critical step must be made to design policies based on the real needs of individual African economies , as development will take place in Africa only when its peoples have democratic control over their own policies .  
The true dimensions of this problem can clearly be seen when it is set against the background of the technical and material restrictions on demining that prevent any easy or rapid implementation and when we consider the risks and costs that make it prohibitive to individual countries .  
There may be no other single individual who has been as instrumental or as effective in leading the world community in recent years in the difficult search for common ground , particularly on issues relating to environmentally sustainable development .  
In this sea of change in international relations , the whole concept of international security has increasingly moved away from the bipolar view , concerned largely with military security , to one which assigns a central role to sustainable development and the welfare of the individual .  
Note that , as far as education systems are concerned , basic education is the only appropriate way of meeting fundamental educational needs and enabling every individual to become a real participant in society and an effective and responsible participant in the economic , social and cultural development of his or her country ;  
At its 57th meeting , the Council reached a new turning point in the history of the Commission , when it concluded and authorized the full payment of compensation for all pending successful category B claims through its consideration and approval of the fourth and final report of the Panel of Commissioners on individual claims for serious personal injury or death ( S / AC . 26 / 1995 / 6 and S / AC . 26 / Dec . 34 ( 1995 ) ) .  
Ratification of the Convention had also had a positive educational impact on the public , had satisfied a long-standing demand by women 's organizations and had stimulated legislative , administrative and other measures on the part of individual ministries .  
Iraq had repeatedly stated that a responsive environment and suitable economic and political conditions were essential to guarantee fundamental rights of the individual , which were the pillar of the Iraqi political and constitutional system .  
Had the Special Rapporteur behaved in a neutral or objective manner , he would have called , without any hesitation and for purely humanitarian , legal and moral reasons , for the lifting of sanctions , at least in part on the grounds that human rights must be respected not only by individual countries but also by international organizations , particularly the Security Council .  
The promotion of democracy , the strengthening of the protection of human rights and economic and social development formed an interdependent whole , as the World Conference on Human Rights had already stated ; democracy opened the way for the promotion and protection of fundamental freedoms but was able to sustain and consolidate itself only if it was able to respond to the individual and collective needs of citizens .  
Military contingents , including military , technical and rear support units ( subunits ) , shall be fully supplied with weapons and military equipment , spare parts and military and technical supplies , and technical servicing , evacuation and repair components under schedules , tables and norms specially drawn up for them , taking into account the physical and geographical conditions of the region in which their tasks are carried out and in accordance with individual agreements .  
Developing innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for human settlements development and creating a supportive environment for the mobilization of resources by civil society , including beneficiary and individual voluntary contributions ;  
Also stresses that the governing bodies of all funds , programmes and specialized agencies should make further progress in order to ensure that the prescribed limits on field-level authority for cancelling , modifying and adding activities within approved programmes and shifting resources within approved budget lines of individual components of a programme and among components of a programme , with the approval of national authorities , should be expanded to become equal and uniform , to the maximum extent possible , in the context of enhanced accountability ;  
Promote greater governmental involvement in the selection process for resident coordinators , in particular by ensuring that national Governments are consulted before the post profile for resident coordinators is passed to the Joint Consultative Group on Policies , and keeping up to date the selection criteria for resident coordinators and , through the respective executive heads , for senior representatives of United Nations agencies in the field , bearing in mind the specific circumstances of individual countries ;  
Also decides that the field-level committees organized by the United Nations system country team , which were established in accordance with paragraph 40 of General Assembly resolution 47 / 199 , should review substantive activities - including draft country programmes , sectoral programmes and projects - prior to their approval by individual organizations , and should exchange experience acquired , on the understanding that the result of the work of the review committee should be submitted to national Governments for final approval through the national focal points ;  
In spite of some encouraging individual examples of the growth of official development assistance ( ODA ) , as well as of some promising approaches towards mobilizing domestic and international resources for sustainable development identified and explored by the Commission through its Ad Hoc Inter-sessional Working Group on Finance , the overall picture in regard to the implementation of all the recommendations and commitments related to finance as contained in Agenda 21 remains an area of concern .  
44 The observers of non-governmental organizations and individual experts at the Ninth Congress as well as at the fourth session of the Commission fulfilled an important function , particularly by making statements in their capacity as observers on the substantive topics of the agendas , based on their extensive experiences as practitioners working in the field or as distinguished scholars in the area of crime prevention and criminal justice .  
54 In more than two thirds of the responding countries , law enforcement officials were always obliged , before using firearms against persons , to wait between the warning and the direct use of firearms against persons to give the offender sufficient time to observe the warning ; about a quarter reported that this principle was applied usually ; United Kingdom law enforcement officers , depending on their discretion in individual cases , had to wait between warning and the use of firearms only in exceptional cases or never . 
Directly tied into this process has been the continued dissemination of individual country information through the very successful investment seminars and round-table discussions which have enabled private companies , financial institutions and technical advisers to gain a better understanding of various countries and their risk factors , and to develop good working relationships with private and government officials and the multilateral and bilateral aid institutions , all with a view towards creating a sustainable economic and environmentally sound base of operations on which to build within the various countries .  
Rather than the initial very simple structure of a pure equity investment by an individual foreign investor where risk was self insured , a number of joint venture investments have concluded and have been structured to include a mix of equity and non-recourse project debt , with insurance provided by either private or agency insurers .  
It is understandable that the restoration of such confidence may be impeded by the deep wounds and distrust left by the conflict at the individual human level as well as by current political calculations .  
There were also concerns , however , that the new technologies would lead to growing social and economic gaps and injustice , and would threaten cultural diversity , religious values and even individual freedom ; there was therefore a need to study ways to make the new technologies widely accessible and supportive of sustainable development .  
Some of the perceived potential benefits include pleasure derived directly from the psychopharmacological effects of the drug ; pleasure derived indirectly through the perceived improved performance of the individual in different contexts ; the thrill of indulging in " risky " behaviour ; and the social benefits that may be derived from being associated with a group or subculture in which illicit drugs are consumed .  
Perceived potential costs of illicit drug use include the possible health effects of acute or chronic toxicity ; the risk of arrest and punishment ; the effect on academic or career performance ; the danger , if caught , of being expelled from school or losing a job ; the risk of resultant stigma attached to the label of illicit drug user ; and individual feelings of guilt about defying parents , the law or a religious code .  
In other countries , such as has been independently reported in Malaysia , traditional healing as a means of treatment of dependence is sometimes based on beliefs that persons are vulnerable to supernatural influences , as well as physical causes , which increase the probability of dependence arising . 56 In such instances , traditional healers focus upon the well-being of the individual , and detoxification involves the use of herbal medicines , physical exercise and the promotion of physical health .  NULLThe role of acupuncture in the treatment of dependence has become more widespread in recent years .  
An individual in Iraq ( the Director-General of a major missile establishment ) alleged to be responsible for this acquisition , stated that he had destroyed , in August 1995 , all guidance and control components received and had informed Iraq 's governmental authorities on two occasions , in August and October 1995 , about the receipt of these proscribed items .

" Persons of Viet-Nam origin above the age of eighteen at the date of coming into operation of the present Convention who have acquired French citizenship after 8 March 1949 by individual or collective administrative measure or by judicial decision shall acquire Viet-Nam nationality with the right to opt for French nationality under the provisions laid down by the present Convention . " 
Educational institutions will be assisted in designing and implementing preventive education and health promotion programmes to be integrated into a comprehensive health education context covering both physical and psycho-social health , addressing cognitive factors , attitudes and skills , emphasizing the individual and group behaviours that put a person at risk , both as concerns drug abuse and other health-related problems . 
Ensuring that due priority is given and adequate resources made available , at the national , regional and international levels , to combat the threat to individual and public health posed by the rapid spread of HIV / AIDS globally and by the re-emergence of major diseases , such as tuberculosis , malaria , onchocerciasis ( river blindness ) and diarrhoeal diseases , in particular cholera ;  
The political and professional debate has in recent years focused , and is likely to continue to focus , on a number of major questions : the relationship between a high level of social provision and individual incentives to work and national competitiveness ; the extent to which individual and family responsibility might be undermined by social provision ; the relative efficiency of public and private provision and of various mixes of the two ; how to divide responsibility among different levels of government ; and how to keep costs in check .  
Regarding the specific subject of national execution , the outstanding issue is still the need to formulate a clear and acceptable definition of the term " national execution " in order to prevent varying interpretations by individual United Nations agencies responsible for applying it .  
ECLAC has made major efforts over the past five years to develop a more efficient and effective secretariat through more streamlined organization , cost-saving measures , rigorous programming , training , improving horizontal and vertical communication between staff , and enhancing responsibility and accountability on the part of individual staff members and organizational units .  
Female employees assigned to work that is not allowed to be performed by pregnant women or to work that , in medical opinion , would threaten the pregnancy and for that reason are reassigned to other lower paid work during pregnancy until the ninth month after childbirth are allocated complementary pregnancy and maternity benefits , amounting to the difference between their average earnings before being reassigned to lower paid work , and those earned in the individual calendar months following such reassignment .  
It has since been determined that the list contained several apparent errors : it included an individual who had already been granted amnesty , a number of non-combatants , several elderly persons and at least one person who died some years ago .  
Their central objectives are to improve the economic position of members , whether individuals or enterprises , denied access to other banking institutions owing to their inability to offer sufficiently sound collateral ; to facilitate the continual recycling of cooperative capital into cooperative enterprise ; and to attract and manage capital obtained from outside the cooperative sector for use by individual cooperatives .  
It would also be acceptable if paragraph 2 , instead of remaining vague about the functions of the joint management mechanism , were to list them in detail ( data collection , project design and implementation , approval of activities planned by individual States , exercise of regulatory power , peaceful settlement of disputes and exploration of potential sources of financing , to name but a few ) .  
This reflects varying economic , environmental , social , cultural and religious values and needs , which operate within legal and policy frameworks usually specific to individual countries .  
It further implies that individual countries review and test the practical possibilities to measure and periodically assess specific indicators at the field level and that they assess their relevance to prevailing environmental , economic , social and institutional realities of the country concerned .  
While there appears to be general agreement on sustainability criteria , it has become increasingly clear that indicators , through which progress is monitored over time , must be tailored to meet specified economic , environmental , social and cultural conditions , operating within institutional , legal and policy frameworks specific to individual countries .  
For this to be a viable arrangement , the current value of the gross salary corresponding to the individual 's level at retirement would have to be used as the point of reference , as it is expected that retirees will be reassigned to functions similar or identical to those for which they were compensated prior to retirement .  
A properly designed , voluntary and independently accredited certification scheme at the global level can be a means by which the various interested parties can hold producers accountable ; it can provide a market-based incentive to the individual producer to improve management ; it can meet consumer demands for wood from well-managed forests without creating trade discriminations ; and it can be a mechanism for monitoring multiple factors involved in forest use .  
The eradication of poverty can not be accomplished through anti-poverty programmes alone but will require democratic participation , and changes in economic structures in order to ensure access for all to resources , opportunities and public services , to undertake policies geared to more equitable distribution of wealth and income , to implement social protection for those who can not support themselves , and to assist people confronted with unforeseen catastrophe , whether individual or collective , natural , social or technological .  
Recovery may also be sought from States contributing contingents where combat-related damage is caused by members of their national contingent in violation of international humanitarian law and where the international criminal responsibility of the individual member is entailed .  
They include : financial and temporal limitations , counter-claims and set-offs , and recovery from States contributing contingents for damage caused by gross negligence , wilful misconduct , or which entails the international criminal responsibility of the individual member of the Force .  
Consequently , in his previous report to the General Assembly ( A / 50 / 390 , para . 28 ) , the Special Rapporteur indicated that illicit activities in which nationality is used to mask their mercenary nature by a Power that recruits , prepares and pays an individual to perpetrate a criminal act against another country , its Government , its property or a given sector of its population should be analysed and debated with a view to revising current international provisions on the subject .  
In addition to promoting mutual understanding and solidarity through cultural cooperation between peoples , the assistance aims at creating equal and free opportunities for the individual , in accordance with the aims and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , the development of human resources and the respect of the individual , as well as the creation of pluralistic civil societies .  
The Commission on Human Rights , by its resolution 1982 / 29 of 11 March 1982 , recommended that the Economic and Social Council request the Chairman of the Commission to appoint an individual of recognized international standing as special rapporteur to submit a comprehensive report to the Commission at its thirty-ninth session on the occurrence and extent of the practice of summary or arbitrary executions , together with his conclusions and recommendations .  
In addition , Tunisia 's penal system is sufficiently well developed from the standpoint of criminal legislation and juridical institutions to ensure the punishment of any use of scientific progress for purposes prejudicial to human life or individual freedom or privacy .  
However , it is still the case that the means placed in man 's hands by science and technology , which now enable him to affect , even indirectly , the physical integrity , freedom or privacy of the individual , constitute a serious threat to human rights in any country , especially since scientific and technological progress has achieved such a degree of sophistication that individuals hardly have any truly " private " life any more and are no longer safe from genetic manipulation .  
It is to be hoped that the scientifically advanced nations will effectively control the use of scientific progress by their nationals or public authorities and prevent any use detrimental to the natural wealth and the human , genetic and biological resources of the less developed nations or to the individual freedom and privacy of their citizens , especially with respect to trade in and management of waste materials .  
His delegation welcomed the recent initiative to tackle the problem of multilateral debt and to enhance rescheduling by the Paris Club ; however , the approach must be broadened , bearing in mind the requirements of economic growth and social and environmental sector investments .  There was still a pressing need to find an early and lasting solution to all types of debt which also took into account the problems and requirements of individual countries .  
With the active and permanent participation of the people through Guatemalan organizations , political forces and social sectors , this renewal of institutions must embrace all levels , from local authorities to the functioning of State bodies , so that all those who are entrusted with public authority fulfil their commitment to serve social justice , political participation , and the security and full development of the individual ,  
The necessary amendments shall continue to be made to the corresponding regulations so that the military education system is consistent , in its philosophical framework , with respect for the Guatemalan Constitution and other laws , with a culture of peace and democratic coexistence , with the doctrine defined in this Agreement , and with national values , the integral development of the individual , knowledge of our national history , respect for human rights and the identity and rights of the indigenous peoples , and the primacy of the individual .  
Health security covers all aspects of the right of every individual to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health , including the right to food in sufficient quantity and of good quality , the right to decent housing and to live in environments where known health risks are controlled , and the right to have access to education and information on health , rights that are enshrined in the various international treaties .

The Greek Ministry of Justice reported that the Greek Constitution and legislation fully safeguard both equality in the enjoyment of fundamental individual and social rights and freedoms for all citizens irrespective of race , colour , religion and ethnic or national origin ( art . 5 ) , and freedom of religious conscience .  
In addition to the constitutional protection of individual and social rights and freedoms , Greece has signed and sanctioned virtually all international conventions on human rights and on the elimination of racial discrimination , in particular :  
A penal component , prohibiting any racial , ethnic or religious discrimination against an individual or community and strengthening the penalties to be handed down on conviction for racist offences by adding deprivation of civil rights for 5 to 10 years ;  
To criminalizing in an effective manner acts of bribery of any public official or elected representative , by any private or public corporation or individual , taking action where appropriate through coordinated efforts but without in any way precluding , impeding or delaying international , regional or national actions to further the implementation of this Declaration , including :

To denying , in countries that do not already do so and in accordance with the fundamental principles of their legal systems , the tax deductibility of bribes paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a Member State to any public official or elected representative of another country ;  
On the subject of protection of the individual , the Special Rapporteur earnestly hopes that restrictions on the freedom of movement of religious officials will be lifted and that the campaigns of harassment and intimidation directed against them , which are also prejudicial to their followers , will cease , thus enabling the Muslim brotherhoods to realize their full potential without fear , constraint or self-censorship , subject , of course , to respect for public order and the law and the avoidance of violence , extremism and obscurantism .  
To criminalize in an effective manner acts of bribery in international commercial transactions of any public official or elected representative , by any private or public corporation or individual , taking action where appropriate in a coordinated manner , but without in any way precluding , impeding or delaying international , regional or national actions to further the implementation of this Declaration ;

At its fifty-first session , the Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1995 / 82 of 8 March 1995 , aware of the rapid development of the life sciences and the dangers that certain practices may pose to the integrity and dignity of the individual and seeking to ensure that scientific progress benefits individuals and develops in a manner respectful of fundamental human rights , invited Governments , the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system ,  
According to the Standard Professional Code for German Physicians , which underlies all individual professional codes in this respect , all physicians , prior to conducting any clinical trial on a human person or epidemiological research using personal data , must seek the advice of a medical ethics commission on the medical and legal issues involved .  
Others had felt that certain kinds of environmental damage , such as damage caused by the deliberate detonation of nuclear explosions or pollution of entire rivers , should entail the individual criminal responsibility of those responsible , particularly since the fate of future generations was at stake .  
In our world of interdependency and in the light of the vital need to protect a core of fundamental norms of international law , States can no longer afford to retrench behind traditional notions of sovereignty , concepts of cultural relativism , disparities in national legislation and independence of national courts to plead non-implementation of international obligations , particularly where these are aimed at protection of the individual .  
The offer , promise or giving of any payment , gift or other advantage , directly or indirectly , by any private or public corporation , including a transnational corporation , or individual from a State to any public official or elected representative of another country as undue consideration for performing or refraining from the performance of that official 's or representative 's duties in connection with an international commercial transaction ;

Finally , we did find offensive the implicit or explicit suggestion that the Tribunal should exhibit impartiality by , in future , indicting the same number of people from each ethnic background .  That truly would be a perversion of justice that would transform the Tribunal into a political court designed to serve the political expediency of some , or refashion history and ignore the essential foundation of individual responsibility .  
To that end , the court should be based on optional jurisdiction , its jurisdiction should cover only the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole , it should ensure respect for and primacy of national criminal justice systems , it should be an independent international juridical institution , and accused persons should be accorded all relevant individual human rights and commonly recognized procedural guarantees .  
As regards the sources which reported alleged cases of arbitrary detention to the Working Group , it may be noted that of the 205 individual cases submitted by the Working Group to Governments during the period under consideration , 10 were based on information communicated by members of the families or relatives of the detained persons , 91 on information communicated by local or regional non _ governmental organizations , and 104 on information provided by international non _ governmental organizations enjoying consultative status with the Economic and Social Council .  
These actors include international and regional intergovernmental organizations ; individual States ; parliamentarians ; non-governmental organizations from the local to the global levels ; and private actors such as legal professionals , the media , academics , private institutions and civic associations , including ethnic , cultural and religious groups .  
Because democratic Governments are freely chosen by their citizens and held accountable through periodic and genuine elections and other mechanisms , they are more likely to promote and respect the rule of law , respect individual and minority rights , cope effectively with social conflict , absorb migrant populations and respond to the needs of marginalized groups .  
Support for a culture of democracy has proved critical to success in holding free and fair elections in which all actors in society - government officials , political leaders , parliamentarians , judicial officials , police and military forces and individual citizens - play their accorded roles .  
At the same time , new channels of political expression and activity for individual citizens are developing outside governmental structures but inside the public sphere once considered the virtually exclusive province of government ; the proliferation of non-governmental organizations from the local to the global and the expansion of activity through international political associations , or " political internationals " , both make clear the deficiencies of existing governmental structures in the face of global change .  
Moreover , " international relations " - not relations among nations but relations among sovereign States - are increasingly shaped not only by the States themselves but also by an expanding array of non-State actors on the " international " scene , ranging all the way from individual persons to civic associations , non-governmental organizations , local authorities , private multinational business , academia , the media , parliamentarians and regional and international intergovernmental organizations .  
While democratization must take place at all levels of human society - local , national , regional and global - the special power of democratization lies in its logic , which flows from the individual human person , the one irreducible entity in world affairs and the logical source of all human rights .  
At later stages of planning , the Secretariat will require more detailed information , such as the response time for each individual unit , any political or material preconditions , period of self-sufficiency , level of equipment , probable port of departure , total surface / volume / weight , number and types of vehicles , number of containers , information on particularly large or heavy items , and information on dangerous cargo ( e.g . , ammunition ) , and any specific handling instructions .  
It was pointed out that in some jurisdictions the relief that could be granted by the court before the opening of insolvency proceedings or before recognition of a foreign proceeding was limited to relief measures of an individual nature provided under national rules on civil procedure ( i.e . measures covering specific assets identified by a creditor ) and did not extend to special relief measures available under special rules concerning collective insolvency proceedings .  
The Commission , however , decided that the automatic stay should cover not only execution of claims but also the individual actions and proceedings conducted prior to execution ; that was considered necessary to allow the foreign representative the necessary temporary respite to organize the affairs of the debtor without having to participate in possibly numerous actions against the debtor .  
In response to that suggestion it was observed that in legal systems that recognized insolvency proceedings of natural persons , such as individual traders or merchants , it would sometimes be difficult to establish a clear distinction between the debtors business and personal affairs , and that proceedings apparently falling in the latter category might well have influence on the debtors assets and liabilities .  
It was said that , if such standing was to be conferred on the foreign representative , it should extend only to actions that were available to the local insolvency administrator in the context of an insolvency proceeding opened in the enacting State ; care should be taken to avoid creating an impression that the foreign representative was equated with individual creditors , who under many legal systems had a right to initiate actions to avoid or otherwise render ineffective legal acts detrimental to creditors .  
At the same time , States are moving towards establishing the individual penal responsibility of those who commit extremely grave international crimes , through the creation of special courts and the forthcoming establishment of an international criminal court .  
However , at the end of the day , all of us who are democratizing agree that basic fundamentals must be met , among them the promotion of the existence of representative government elected by the majority of the population through secret ballot , in regular periodic and genuine elections , as well as the promotion of party competition , an independent judiciary , guarantees of fundamental human rights and individual freedoms , transparency and accountability under the rule of law , a free and independent press and the growth of civil society .  
At the threshold of the third millennium , it is unacceptable that poverty and pollution still dominate the daily lives of billions of people all over the world ; it is unacceptable that hostilities and hatred still create deadly new conflicts and humanitarian disasters , between and within States on all continents ; and it is unacceptable that basic human and individual rights are still widely violated through injustice by Governments and the negligence of the international community .  
At the local level , the non-governmental organizations working with UNRWA range from support groups for individual hospitals or centres for the disabled to societies for the physically or mentally handicapped , covering a particular town or area , locally based law centres , women 's associations , universities , medical associations and camp or village committees .  
In addition , during its session , the Governing Council considered reports submitted by a number of Governments on the distribution of compensation awarded to successful claimants in category B . The Council agreed that further discussion was needed regarding the situation where , following the transfer of funds to the relevant Governments or international organizations , awarded compensation has not been distributed to individual claimants , for one reason or another , after a reasonable period of time has elapsed . 
The Commission 's operations also constituted a very democratic process in which no veto power was considered , all claimant countries were treated equally and , for the first time in history , an absolute priority was given to individual claimants , particularly the most deprived and needy , which added a significant humanitarian dimension to the Commission 's work . 
Whereas , given a situation where there is social and economic injustice , including discriminatory practices against indigenous peoples , and the systematic denial of individual and collective rights and safeguards , the peoples concerned have the right to seek the necessary democratic change ,  
RECOGNIZING the importance of observance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and other international human rights instruments , as well as respect for international humanitarian law applicable to armed conflicts , and bearing in mind the complementarity between human rights and international humanitarian law in improving protection of the individual and respect for his dignity in situations of armed conflict ,  
According to a recent UNDP publication , 5 there are , today , good opportunities in remote rural areas of developing countries for using renewable sources of energy at competitive costs to meet the small-scale mechanical or electric power needs of the individual household , farm or village .  
The response of individual organizations of the United Nations system to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development 's sustainable development agenda is assessed in terms of the three basic functions of intergovernmental organizations : ( a ) policy development , ( b ) the collection , synthesis , analysis and dissemination of data and information to inform action at all levels and ( c ) the delivery of technical and financial support to strengthen human and institutional capabilities at national and regional levels .  
As to the decentralized nature of the international statistical system in terms of subject , member States should be able to take a holistic view across all subject areas of the international statistical system , which at the moment is not possible because there are no mechanisms or processes in place for doing so ; the Commission itself does not have a broad enough reach and the individual components of the international statistical system are quite heterogeneous . 
Moreover , analysis of trafficking trends and of conclusions thereon , as well as of specific trafficking routes and methods , is often incomplete as a result of the scarcity of individual seizure reports transmitted by Governments to international organizations and the relatively low rates of interception of illicit drug trafficking in some of the key trafficking countries and regions .  
Replace the existing text with the following : 3 .  To re-examining , with a view to denying it in countries which do not already do so , the tax deductibility of bribes , paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a member State to any public official of another country , in accordance with the basic principles of its legal order ;  
Also , with a view to clarifying that paragraph ( 4 ) also covered insolvencies of individuals , it was proposed to redraft paragraph ( 4 ) to provide that , absent proof to the contrary , the registered office was deemed to be the centre of the main interests of a legal entity , and the habitual residence was deemed to be the centre of the main interests of an individual .  
The third stage , once the crisis is contained , is to stimulate recovery , by recreating accountable systems of governance , reviving commercial and economic activity , promoting social cohesion , rebuilding infrastructure , restoring health and education services and encouraging individual enterprises .  
It is united by shared organizational values and managerial principles that foster effective teamwork , high standards and managerial and individual responsibility and clear norms of staff conduct ; is secure in the justness of its accountability framework and in the provisions for staff empowerment , recognition and sanctions which that framework actively guarantees .  45 .  It has improved leadership styles and has established among all staff a strong culture of efficiency and professionalism .  
Regardless of the approach adopted by individual countries , national forest programmes should be viewed as long-term iterative processes , and should be based on guiding principles recognizing the following key elements : national sovereignty and country leadership , consistency with national policies and international commitments , integration with the country 's sustainable development strategies , partnership and participation , and holistic and intersectoral approaches .  
In a second step , during the biennium 1997-1998 , it will be necessary to supplement the new version with a number of new provisions , such as detailed packing instructions for individual substances and other provisions normally found in instruments regulating the transport of dangerous goods by one given mode , so that the model regulation can be directly integrated into national or international instruments , without substantial redrafting .  
Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action and , at the same time , cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions , societies and economies , where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential ,  
It will comprise [ government representatives ] [ persons nominated by governments , acting in their individual capacity ] who are experts [ in social , economic , legal , technical , scientific and technological , and / or environmental fields ] [ with relevant knowledge ] in the field of the Convention .  
With regard to the financial management of resources devoted to NGOs , ACC members agree with the need for a better accounting and reporting procedure , however they are not convinced that the resulting ability to produce comparative statistics will be particularly useful , since the operating budgets of organizations and agencies are very different and their individual needs in terms of cooperation with NGOs are fully adapted to their respective roles and mandates .  
Against this backdrop , the Survey is organized as follows : chapter I briefly describes how the developing ESCAP region fares in the emerging global scene ; chapter II shows the recent performance of individual countries in terms of selected macroeconomic and social development indicators which impinge on participation in the globalization and regionalization processes ; chapters III and IV analyse the benefits and risks of integration into the international and regional economy focusing on foreign trade and external finance ( including FDI ) . 
Regretting the human rights violations , both individual and collective , the marginalization and discrimination that the indigenous populations in Guatemala suffered and are suffering , together with the continued deterioration of the economic and social situation , with its serious consequences for the great majority of the population , particularly for the indigenous peoples of Guatemala and the most vulnerable sectors of Guatemalan society ,  
The premises are thus established for us to attain our main objective , which is the establishment of the true rule of law , under which the individual and collective rights of all citizens will be respected and protected by law , and under which the political differences and the different parties can find in the Parliament an appropriate forum for discussions and review .  
Consequently , it is the individual concerned , the citizen , who is fully entitled , directly or indirectly , to choose those who exercise the governmental , representative or legislative function , and who renews or withdraws his trust _ or rather his delegation of authority _ at predetermined intervals and in accordance with rules that protect his freedom of choice and punish any attempt to vitiate or divert it .  
Recognizing the respect for the environment accorded by the cultures of indigenous peoples of the Americas , and considering the special relationship between the indigenous peoples and the environment , lands , resources and territories on which they live and their natural resources .  Recognizing that in many indigenous cultures , traditional collective systems for control and use of land and territory and resources , including bodies of water and coastal areas , are a necessary condition for their survival , social organization , development and their individual and collective well-being . . .  
The Inter _ American Court of Human Rights , for example , in a ground _ breaking ruling , found that amnesty for the perpetrators of serious human rights violations was incompatible with the right of every individual to a fair hearing before an impartial and independent court .  
All these elements should , in fact , be sought out and thoroughly explored in order to assess objectively whether ( and , eventually , to what extent ) international human rights law is moving beyond the traditional dichotomy of individual versus State , beyond the duty of States to respect and ensure the observance of human rights , and towards the creation of obligations applicable also to private individuals and other non _ State actors , including liberation movements and terrorist organizations .  
Collective expulsions or population transfers usually target national , ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities and thus , prima facie , violate individual as well as collective rights contained in several important international human rights instruments , in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Rights of the Child .  
The human rights system has the legal obligation to observe the economic system and to signal the greater or lesser impact it is having in meeting the needs of individual human beings and on their enjoyment of essential civil , economic , social , political and cultural rights .  
Many States have successfully implemented comparatively rapid procedures at points of entry which ensure a fair and competent assessment of the need for international protection , and UNHCR encourages States to ensure the rights of the individual through proper legal safeguards , in developing such procedures .  
Having due regard to all relevant definitions of the practice of forced evictions under international human rights provisions and instruments , the present Guidelines apply to instances of forced evictions in which there are acts and / or omissions involving the coerced and involuntary removal of individuals , groups and communities from their homes and / or lands and common property resources they occupy or are dependent upon , thus eliminating or limiting the possibility of an individual , group or community residing or working in a particular dwelling , residence or place .  
Reflecting the requirements of the situation prevailing at the time , the respected leader Comrade Kim Il Sung , in his speech on 6 August 1971 , advanced the policy of new , wide-ranging negotiations whereby we were ready to come into contact at any time with all political parties including the ruling " Democratic Republican Party " , social organizations and individual personages of south Korea . 
To ensure success , however , it is imperative to immediately provide employment opportunities and to generate incomes for the local population ; this will require focused action over a medium _ term period to relieve the population through communal and municipal local infrastructure works , food _ for _ work initiatives ( particularly for rural infrastructure development ) , integration of rural women into the local economy through training and related support for small _ scale economic activities , provision of ample micro _ and small _ scale credit at the individual and enterprise levels etc . 
The individual elements of a culture of peace are therefore : non-violence and respect for human rights , respect and solidarity among all peoples and dialogue between cultures , the linkage of peace to democratic participation and sustainable human development , the free flow and sharing of information and knowledge , contribution to conflict-prevention and post-conflict peace-building , and equality between women and men , all best supported through projects in which people take an active role in transforming their values , attitudes and behaviours .  
The presence of the multinational protection force affectively blocked the risk of Albania sliding towards anarchy or even internal political conflict and allowed the various international organizations and individual States willing to provide practical help to Albania to organize assistance in a secure environment .  Thus a notable improvement in the situation in the country was brought about in a short period of time , restoring confidence in national prospects .  
Taking into account the substantial quantitative and qualitative differences between the needs of individual countries , his Government had felt that separate programmes for humanitarian assistance and assistance with recovery and development should be implemented for each country , rather than administered by a supranational structure established within the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States for the distribution or redistribution of humanitarian and other forms of assistance .  
The Committee shall comprise [ government representatives ] [ persons nominated by governments , acting in their individual capacity ] who are experts [ in social , economic , legal , technical , scientific and technological , and / or environmental fields ] [ with relevant knowledge ] in the field of the Convention . [ one ] [ two ] [ three ] years based on equitable geographical distribution [ and the principle of rotation ] [ other arrangement . . . . ] .  
They agreed that old stereotypes of seniors as dependent should be abandoned , and they discussed how to promote the active ageing of their older citizens with due regard to their individual choices and circumstances , including removing disincentives to labour force participation and lowering barriers to flexible and part-time employment that exist in some countries .  
National reports on the implementation of Agenda 21 have proved to be a valuable means of sharing information at the international and regional levels and , even more important , of providing a focus for the coordination of issues related to sustainable development at the national level within individual countries .  
Rather , we are appealing to the conscience of the continent , as well as to individual consciences , asking that these acts of violence not be repeated , that the truth be known , that justice prevail , that the human person be respected and that the United Nations and the non-governmental organizations be permitted to work under the protection of full respect for international humanitarian law .  
As indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on sources for the financing of development ( see A / 52 / 399 ) , there has been a shift in the composition of financial flows to developing countries from public to private sector sources , with the latter now accounting for an overwhelming share of the total ( albeit not for all individual countries ) .  This situation is unlikely to be reversed in the foreseeable future .  
The Secretary-General had , in his previous report ( A / 50 / 480 ) , suggested that themes be selected in the light of the principal objectives of the dialogue ; that is , to promote broader and deeper understanding of issues of a global or transboundary nature that cut across individual , regional or group interests .  
Whereas during the armed rebellion and aggression against Croatia many criminal acts , grave breaches of international humanitarian law and of the basic rights of the individual were committed ,  
Instead , it had institutionalized the peaceful settlement of disputes through the establishment of a Permanent Court of Arbitration and , in case of armed conflict , had imposed certain limits and duties on the parties at war , down to the level of the individual , in the first genuine attempt by the international community to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war .  
The Assembly welcomed the proposed measures outlined by the Government of Cambodia in its comments5 on the report of the Special Representative , to ensure that the forthcoming communal and national elections were free and fair , that members of the armed forces remained neutral during the election campaign , that the individual vote was confidential and that local and international observers were welcomed .  
Resources that should be expended on providing a better life for present and future generations are being wasted on war machines and on vain efforts to acquire elusive military security on an individual national basis , instead of reliance on and pursuit of collective security .  
Emphasizing the need for accurate , objective and comprehensive information , as well as for a wide exchange of experiences and lessons learned by individual countries in protecting and promoting the rights and welfare of women migrant workers for policy formulation and joint action ,  
Urges concerned Governments , particularly those of sending and receiving countries , to strengthen their national efforts to protect and promote the rights and welfare of women migrant workers through sustained bilateral , regional , interregional and international cooperation , including by developing strategies and joint action , and taking into account innovative approaches and experiences of individual Member States ;  
Even recent advances in the scientific understanding of these complex events leave much to speculation or , at best , any systematic patterns observed may be highly opportunistic to specific events or individual examples .  
Unless national and local capabilities for basic early warning functions are improved within individual countries , external enhancements in hazard forecasting and telecommunications will not necessarily lead to successful mitigation practices .  
Emphasizes the right to education as a human right , and calls upon States to make education accessible to children with special educational needs in a manner conducive to the child 's achieving the fullest possible social integration and individual development , and to adopt an integrated approach to providing adequate support and appropriate education for such children ;  
Though we fully realize that peace and security , as well as stability , in the region of the Middle East will be achieved only when a comprehensive , just and lasting settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict in all its dimensions is attained , it is essential to create the necessary climate and security conditions based on equal security for all , security at the lowest level of armament , and security that would not allow for the military superiority of any individual party .  
Another delegation , speaking on behalf of a large group , suggested that the Task Force consider that the role of United Nations information centres should be more focused on the issues relevant to individual countries , that they should have sufficient resources to carry out their main tasks , and that they should be integrated where appropriate and beneficial .  
Another delegation , speaking on behalf of a large group , suggested that the Task Force consider that the role of United Nations information centres should be more focused on the issues relevant to individual countries , that they should have sufficient resources to carry out their main tasks , and that they should be integrated where appropriate and beneficial .  
First , humanitarian law had a more limited objective than did human rights law , since it was applicable solely in situations of armed conflict and , without seeking to improve society , sought to protect the life , dignity and physical integrity of the individual against violence and arbitrary behaviour .  
Emphasizes the right to education as a human right , and calls upon States to make education accessible to children with special educational needs in a manner conducive to the child 's achieving the fullest possible social integration and individual development , and to adopt an integrated approach to providing adequate support and appropriate education for such children ;  
Treaty bodies were encouraged to appoint individual members to liaise with specialized agencies or other intergovernmental bodies of most relevance to their respective mandate and to invite representatives of international financial institutions and other international and multilateral and development institutions to present to them an analysis of the impact of their activities on women 's enjoyment of economic and social rights in the light of international standards in general , and in relation to particular States .  
Underlying these responses are three basic premises : first , that orderly and planned migration can be a positive force for social and economic development ; secondly , that the long-term manageability of international migration hinges on making the option to remain in one 's country a viable one for all peoples ; and thirdly , that isolated action , whether by an individual State or by a group , can not effectively address what is today a global phenomenon in an interdependent world .  
While acknowledging that the various working groups within the Organization were dealing with individual aspects of this problem , the sponsor noted that they were doing so in a context and manner which were primarily political and operational in nature , whereas the Special Committee , being a body with highly qualified legal expertise , was best suited for dealing with the mere legal aspects of the matter , which were the subject of the proposed declaration .  
The annex makes reference to the identification by the Panel of numerous practical disadvantages to independent audits and management reviews by individual Member States and to the fact that the Financial Regulations of the United Nations stipulate that the external auditors appointed by the organizations ' governing bodies are solely responsible for the conduct of audits .  
This will be possible only if the Organization becomes better able to fulfil its basic tasks the maintenance of international peace and security and comprehensive economic and social development , particularly in developing countries and to ensure broad respect for the promotion and protection of individual and collective human rights . 
Respect for human rights is achieved not only through the functioning of instruments to monitor compliance with international treaties but also through political , social and economic measures that allow human rights to become an integral part of social development and a part of the everyday life of each individual .  
The experience gained from the functioning of these two ad hoc tribunals has paved the way for the wider acceptance of the idea of an international criminal court , thus creating a firm legal basis at the universal level for the establishment of individual criminal responsibility with regard to war crimes and crimes against humanity .  
They have also stressed that such sanctions should not be based merely on political expediency , but rather should be firmly based on international law ; that they should be implemented according to the principles of justice and international law ; that they should not serve individual or factional interests ; that in their implementation , consideration should be given to the human suffering that they cause ; and that a time limit should be set for their lifting .  
Each must agree to subordinate its individual decision and discretion to a global political will , manifested through truly democratic and representative organs of the United Nations , reflecting the authentic judgement of the world community of States .  
International cooperation and the benefits that are drawn from it , whether through bilateral or multilateral means , can not be a substitute for what individual countries must do to ensure that sustainable development is achieved and economic growth is realized .  
And yet in my country , which today is in the grip of civil war , almost everything has been done since the sovereign national conference to spare our young democracy from the tragic upheavals inherent in any sudden social change , which in this case consisted of the move from a single-party political regime banning any organized opposition to a veritable explosion of freedoms individual , political and religious .  
In this era of accelerating change in so many areas in every portion of our diverse global community , it is of singular importance to the well-being of each of our individual national communities , as it is for the overall international global community , that we recognize , observe and be faithful to those values and principles which , inherently , are unchanging .  
Not only do basic health and education produce invaluable individual and social benefits , both are essential for sustainable economic development and constitute an investment in people \ x { e5b8 } hope for the future .  
This has preserved and duly protected the right of legitimate defence , both individual and collective , provided for in Article 51 of the Charter a right that my country believes is one of the pillars underlying international coexistence and a guarantee for the respect of the territorial integrity of States .  
In this regard , the Habitat Agenda contains numerous suggestions for action , such as ensuring legal protection from discrimination in access to shelter and basic services ; helping the family in its supporting , educating and nurturing roles ; and encouraging social and economic policies that are designed to meet the housing needs of families and their individual members .  
Such challenges include the weakening of family ties due partially to spatial mobility ; gradual shifting away from extended to nuclear and more flexible family forms ; an increasing emphasis on individual rather than communitarian social values ; and a redefining of the traditional roles and expectations of individual family members , particularly those of women as caregivers , towards more egalitarian and task-sharing partnerships within the family .  
But the individual and collective efforts of small island developing States have so far made little or no real impact on the magnitude of the problems facing them , including the more frequent occurrence of hurricanes , storm surges and coastal inundation , and the resulting loss of valuable economic resources and marine biodiversity stocks .  
Policy will in future need to give more attention to improving individual choice and flexibility : to allowing people to continue to work when they wish or need to do so , while encouraging those who can retire earlier to take up socially productive activities , remunerated or not , part-time or casual , as appropriate , and to create the conditions for this broader recognition of work and employment .  
Thus , adopting an integrated treatment of the bases of economic growth , by not only ensuring macroeconomic balance and stability but also directing attention to the industrial base and incentive structures , may do much to enhance the viability of policies that address the environmental and social aspects of sustainable development in individual countries .  
The risk to an individual or to a coherent group of individuals should be limited to a maximum tolerable level above which risks are considered unacceptable except in extraordinary circumstances such as saving life .  
To deny , in countries that do not already do so , the tax deductibility of bribes paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a State to any public official or elected representative of another country and , to that end , to examine their respective modalities for doing so ;  
Policies for promoting domestic resources mobilization should include macroeconomic and structural reforms , public expenditure reforms , the promotion of environmental taxes and charges , a review of existing subsidy policies , and financial sector development to promote personal saving and access to credit , taking into account the characteristics and capabilities of individual countries .  
Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action and , at the same time , cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions , societies and economies , where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential ,  
Notes with appreciation the strengthened training programmes , inter alia , people management training , upgrading of substantive skills , information technology , communications and training in all six official languages on an equal basis , and requests the Secretary-General to continue to invest in the Organization 's future capacity by sustaining and expanding these programmes in order to meet organizational needs and individual career development aspirations ;

Regretting the human rights violations , both individual and collective , the marginalization and discrimination suffered by the indigenous populations in Guatemala , together with the continued deterioration of the economic and social situation , with its serious consequences for the great majority of the population , particularly for the indigenous peoples of Guatemala and the most vulnerable sectors of Guatemalan society ,  
Calls upon individual donor countries , international organizations and non _ governmental organizations to incorporate human rights principles and objectives into the humanitarian and development work they carry out in Somalia and to cooperate with the independent expert ;  
The approach represents the satellite as a combination of individual elements and positions these to provide maximum protection to the satellite components .  [ 29 ] The PLATFORM model uses a novel element termed SHIELD [ 30 ] which uses genetic algorithms to determine the optimal configuration of a spacecraft based on the encountered environment and design constraints such as thermal and mass balancing .  
Since those rules were of a technical nature , they did not require any further clarification ; however , Committee members were free to comment on them , either during the forthcoming discussion or in the observations of individual States , which the Commission and its Special Rapporteur awaited with interest .  16 .  Article 27 , which was the last provision of the draft articles , had been included at a late stage and the decision as to its placement in the text had been left for the second reading .  
Calls upon individual donor countries , international organizations and non _ governmental organizations to incorporate human rights principles and objectives into the humanitarian and development work they carry out in Somalia and to cooperate with the independent expert ;  
As yet , however , no clear legal guidelines have been established for determining which individual instances may be considered at the international level without the assent of the State concerned ( in the light of the above ) .  
In addition , the declaration must without fail refer to the inseparable link between the responsibility of the State that the perpetrated gross and massive violations of human rights which can be classified as international crimes and the individual responsibility of persons participating in their perpetration .  
National reports on the implementation of Agenda 21 have proved to be a valuable means of sharing information at the international and regional levels and , even more important , of providing a focus for the coordination of issues related to sustainable development at the national level within individual countries .  
It is for the State and the international community to organize the political and legal framework needed to undertake , with any chance of success , the campaign against impunity for violations of economic , social or cultural rights , whether individual or collective .  
For the international community to be guilty of massive violations of collective and individual economic rights would be an utter aberration and the greatest contradiction developed within the United Nations system .  
These collective or communal rights are to individual economic , social and cultural rights what democracy and the rule of law are to civil and political rights .  
Any transaction for the transfer of wastes is a serious violation of the right to a healthy environment and , quite obviously , of the whole set of human rights , whether individual or collective , economic , social and cultural or civil and political .  
Although applying the procedures of an optional protocol would not give the Committee any jurisdictional authority , it would provide an opportunity through regular reports and individual communications to submit useful recommendations to the States parties and would make a major contribution to the campaign against impunity for violations of economic , social and cultural rights .  
In many cases , those responsible for violations of economic , social and cultural rights and of the collective rights with an economic content such as the right to development or the right to a healthy environment , are sometimes international entities applying policies which constitute veritable sources of large-scale and serious violations of collective and individual rights in the countries with weak economies .  
The Seminar pointed out the fundamental contradiction between the increasing restrictions to individual mobility and the free flow of goods and services as encouraged by transnational corporations and international financial institutions .  
As of 30 June , the office of the Human Rights Ombudsperson had opened 1,692 provisional files , registered 713 cases , issued 10 final reports in individual cases and eight special reports ; 38 requests for interim measures have been successful , and 21 have not been implemented by the authorities . 
Recalling also that , in its resolution 40 / 61 of 9 December 1985 , the General Assembly stated that it was mindful of the necessity of maintaining and safeguarding the basic rights of the individual in accordance with the relevant human rights instruments and generally accepted international standards ,  
In addition to natural capital , physical or produced capital , and to the now widely accepted notion of human capital , social capital refers to the functioning of the various institutions that are critical to individual welfare and social integration .  
The Sub _ Commission recognizes the efforts of the Government of Guatemala and urges it to continue with its policy of implementing measures for the protection and promotion of both individual and collective human rights and fundamental freedoms ; to continue to take practical measures against poverty and to eradicate extreme poverty in order to raise the living standards of the population ; and to redouble the efforts already instituted to overcome the marginalization and discrimination to which the indigenous peoples of Guatemala have been , and continue to be subjected .  
A common vision had developed that sound financial and economic policies , including development of human resources and respect for human rights , good governance , individual initiative and the private sector , were critical to creating an environment conducive to economic growth , environmental sustainability and social equity .

Mr . Premier , would you please discuss for a moment your individual evaluations and expectations ?  
According to Wang Ming-yang , a lecturer in industrial engineering at National Tsing Hua University , the problem lies in mass production . In a traditional society , where products were made by hand , clothing and everyday items could be custom designed to fit the individual .  
I always find that our literary works are lenient and tolerant toward the individual , yet harsh and demanding toward society and the greater environment . This is a problem worth pondering and one I want to ask each of you to think about today .  
The scene was northern China , the language spontaneous and sometimes colloquial , and the mood ranging from nostalgia to humor . This was followed by impressionistic pieces on foreign lands , such as Paris and London , which coincided with the period of exoticism in the late fifties but are unmistakably individual because of their dramatic rather than merely lyrical treatment .  
Within these three goals , these are our efforts in each individual area : In the area of national defense : Following the policy of military modernization , we have built up formidable armed forces , successfully developed sophisticated weaponry according to a predetermined plan , and implemented the policy of using only highly qualified soldiers ; over the past five years , military personnel have been reduced by over 35,000 persons .

The advantages furnished by residence in college can do little more than stimulate and aid the personal efforts " of the individual student . The report remained influential through the Civil War , and moderated the speed of the introduction of a utilitarian curriculum into US universities .  
" The system of agents has long been in place abroad , and is the long-term trend , " explains Luc Kwanten . For people overseas who have the publishing rights , dealing with a single agent saves a great deal of trouble over negotiating with individual publishers whose operating situations are unclear . For the domestic publishing industry , going through an agency saves even more in expenses than setting up your own publishing rights department or hiring specially trained negotiators . "

When some of the ridiculous aspects of contemporary funerals are mentioned , Hsu Fu-chuan , a professor at the Taiwan Institute of Technology who has studied quite a bit about traditional funeral rites , ca n't help but sigh .

The only thing is , in today 's changing society , who will pass these ceremonies along ?  
" No men , no money , no power . Even if there is just as much courage and character at the local level , and as much love for the land and people , everything just gets rubbed out , " says one individual who formerly served as a county executive . Today , comfortably ensconced in his central government official 's office , he describes his former days as " hectic from start to finish , yet I was often so frustrated or felt so powerless that I was unable to sleep at night . "  
Fortunately , after years of contention , the situation has slightly improved . Today it is no longer necessary to get approval from the central government for anyone below civil service level 8 . And with regard to the top officials who can make or break the administration of a city or county , the executive has more room to haggle if he or she does not approve of the individual selected by the provincial government . The more influential chiefs can even recommend candidates and ask the provincial government to formally appoint them .  
Doing away with stereotypes : As far as Chang Hsiao-hung is concerned , postmodern game stratagems , or as she terms it , " gender performance , " can lend feminism new vitality and allow it to adapt to complex , changing postmodern culture . Madonna personifies the complexities , contradictions , and ambiguities of postmodern culture . Her daring , unpredictable performance style is in fact a bench mark for breaking through the confines of the stereotypes of early feminism and opening up today 's feminism to the pursuit of individual needs .  
He says , " True religion takes the self-awareness of the innateness of individual being as its foundation . This either calls up innate understanding and comprehension , or establishes active and positive beliefs , providing the truth about the end of the universe , the ultimate purpose of human life , and paths to follow to achieve the liberation of the soul , and other specific answers . Individual beings then make a choice depending upon their free will and their spiritual needs " ( p . 185 ) .

The Ministry of Education , which has jurisdiction over sunken ships , argues that Huang has always been trying to get commissioned to do the work of recovering the artifacts .

Traditional Chinese placed great emphasis on proper rituals or patterns of behavior , and failure to observe these was deemed to be criminal . For example , these days a lack of filial piety is considered to be a personal moral problem , in which outsiders should not get too involved . But in the past it was a serious offense . Not only could the individual be punished through the state legal system , family law was even more rigorous and inescapable , and violators were expelled from the clan .  
In his opening speech , he attempted to appeal to people 's emotions , recalling his background from a farming family . In addition , he was able to discuss individual topics pragmatically , presenting tangible arguments instead of theoretical discourse about broad principles . Lin spoke with intensity and assurance on the constitutional system , with which he is very familiar . However , restrained by his conditioning through years of bureaucratic experience , he appeared overcautious in the midst of exposition and argumentation .  
The aim of educational reform is to put into practice a concept of education that imparts happiness , contentment , pluralism and mutual respect . Such education is designed to develop potentialities , respect individualism , promote humanism , and encourage creativity . All unreasonable restrictions will be removed to allow the emergence of a system of life-long learning . Ample room will be reserved for individual originality and personal traits to ensure the continued pursuit of self-growth and self-realization .  
Some borrow movements from Chinese opera , while others search for characteristic Chinese body language in tai-chi or meditation . Others adapt the techniques of Western modern dance . One individual of the latter type of is Lin Huai-min . His Cloud Gate dance company is built on a foundation of techniques developed by American choreographer Martha Graham , with subject matter drawn from current events in Taiwan or from Chinese classics ( like Dream of the Red Chamber or The Legend of the White Snake ) .  
These figures suggest citizens ' ability to separate the individual from the issue at stake and to be both hard-headed and sympathetic . This again reminds us that freedom and democracy are our most precious assets , and that open debate creates an informed electorate . We look forward to the people nudging the government and society to be ever-more efficient and competitive .  
Based upon various different research conclusions , Goleman expresses the strong belief that social problems , particularly the worsening problems among children and adolescents , are linked to the emotions . For example , crime rates , suicide rates , underage pregnancy and drug use , as well as many kinds of psychological disorders such as depression and anorexia can all be attributed to individual emotional disorders or defects .  
Chiang Han-kuang believes that in actuality the main purpose for promoting EQ is to teach everyone to pay attention to emotional and psychological health , to understand individual personalities , to become more mature and stable and to maintain a balance between the body and the mind . The point should be to pursue the true meaning of health and happiness , not such superficial viewpoints as distinguishing EQ grades or gaining advantages .  
The mix of Chinese and barbarian was at first a matter of necessity . But since it has continually renewed and reproduced itself , with the efforts of each new generation , there has been a qualitative change . If individual cells in the primordial soup can come together to form a new organism , this organism is not just a mechanical combination of the original cells , but is an organic " creation . "  
Yang Wen-I notes that the Biennale has always been an open-application exhibition . For instance , four years ago the motion artist Li Ming-shen applied as an individual . But this time the curators filed the application , and after careful consideration of the Biennale selection committee , it was accepted . Multiplication / Fragmentation is formally listed as part of the Biennale de Venezia 97 and is included in the show 's official catalog .  
" To be honest , from a greater historical perspective , it would be pushing it to call Wistaria House a ' real ' historic landmark , " says Huang Fu-san , director of the Academica Sinica 's Institute of Taiwan History . However , the Taipei city government decided to list Wistaria House as a landmark . The committee is trying to set a new example whereby historic landmarks are judged not only by external criteria , but by their individual " personality " and history as well .  
" The only purpose of financial operations is to turn a profit . There 's no such thing as moral or immoral , and no such thing as it being fair or unfair to hardworking individual countries or firms , " says Ding Kung-wha , highlighting the pragmatic and unsentimental nature of the financial world .  
Furthermore , as investors grow more sophisticated and experienced , " direct participation " in financial markets , in which individual investors take risks themselves and can earn higher profits , is playing an ever greater role in advanced Western countries : shares , bonds , mutual funds and even options have all become part of the everyday life of white-collar workers .  
Whether or not legislation is passed , perhaps in the end it will still be a matter for individual choice and conscience , and the new issues created by modern technological " solutions " by which humans seek to " overcome nature , " such as human cloning , cryogenics and so on , will continue to constantly force mankind to search for still more comprehensive and precisely formulated social rules , and will forever push " evolution " to new heights .  
Apart from affirming the principle of sexual equality , this ruling also stressed that the constitution protects the freedom to choose one 's own residence . " Family relationships , freedom to choose one 's residence , and equality of the sexes , all of which are protected by the constitution , are interrelated , and among the inalienable rights of an individual , " wrote the China Times in an editorial . " It is essential that both husband and wife respect each other 's dignity . "  
If employees feel this is not enough , they will be free to negotiate increased amounts with their employers , " says Anita Liu . For example , if the boss and workers each pay an additional 2% , then the workers will be doing a bit of " enforced saving " for their pensions . The most important reform envisaged under the new system is the change from a collective retirement fund account opened by the firm , to an individual account for each worker .  
It is precisely this use of synergistic combinations of natural substances-both from animals and plants-as opposed to the use of individually active chemical substances , " says Chang , who holds a doctorate in chemistry and is certified as a doctor of Chinese medicine . If only individual active components from herbal medicines are extracted and used , then the special synergistic character of herbal medicines will be lost .  
The US Federal Drug Administration has accepted the use of herbal drugs , and Medicare and Medicaid now cover it . " While many of its methods still defy explanation , Chinese medicine does provide an entirely different model for modern medicine and thus is a priceless asset , " Chen says . " Yet the scientific method as used in Western medicine shows clearly how individual medicines work and provides Chinese medicine with effective new techniques . "  
One tea setting presents a vision of layers of purple ; a vegetable basket off to the side lends a bucolic touch . Another is coffee colored with a touch of grey , setting a light and frisky mood . And there is also a setting which is entirely blue , the individual pieces of teaware looking like cool observers standing off to one side .  
She adds , with particular reference to the problem of overtime pay , " It is especially unfair given that employer and employee interact as economic entities , a status in which every individual should be equal . " The final irony of all is that the overtime regulations are frequently not observed by employers , so the people who are punished most are those single women who obediently agree to work past the legal limits on their overtime hours .  
Chou , whose primary area of research is clinical statistics , states that most of this research is limited to extractions and animal research in the Chinese medical laboratory , or consists of individual case reports . It focuses on the search for individual problems and is not widely applicable general research . " Only a very few projects can really be said to have been designed as clinical trials . And even in these cases , the design is still rough .  
Most property rights cases in which constitutional interpretations are sought affect individual citizens ' rights , and attract little outside attention or interference . But in other areas social forces ( such as civic groups and the media ) or political forces ( elected representatives ) often get involved .  
Wang Anyi 's short story was a trailblazer , because it appeared at a time when communist ideology still held considerable sway in the literary sphere . " Wang feels that there is no need for a writer to play the part of a social scientist and use a novel as a means of criticizing anything . She has always focused on the individual .  
Under the ROC 's " Standard Criteria for Identifying Hazardous Industrial Wastes , " hazardous wastes are divided into three major categories . The first comprises specifically listed substances which are generated by industrial processes or are inherently toxic .

This includes substances such as powerful oxidants which may cause other materials to ignite .  
They opposed cliched formalism in writing , and advocated the use of the modern vernacular instead of the previously dominant classical Chinese .

Besides formal competitions and ever more sophisticated and complex chess theories , variations have been developed-like blind chess ( no looking at the board , or even no board at all ) , " hidden " chess ( in which the pieces start turned over and in random positions ) , and pre-arranged endgames . These not only provide entertainment for the individual , but are a recreational activity among friends .  
According to museum employee Lu Yu-hua , many people express surprise that there should be an entire museum devoted solely to paper , but when you really think about it , there 's really nothing strange about it . When paper was first invented , the raw materials from which it was made differed from one region to the next . A single sheet of paper spoke volumes about local climates and vegetation ; its very existence enabled the spread of knowledge , and could record the history of an individual or an entire nation !  
But unlike these resilient structures , many newly-built apartment blocks came crashing down completely without warning . Many anomalies such as concertinaed individual storeys , rebars ( reinforcing bars ) pulled clean and straight out of the bases of columns , rebars snapped through like dry spaghetti , and even the joints between beams and columns filled out with cooking-oil cans , were reported to the world by the international media , to the shame of Taiwan 's construction industry .  
With wisdom and intelligence , the people of the Han institutionalized the country 's political , economic and social systems , laying down the framework for the subsequent development of Chinese society . By the time the second millennium arrived , it was the era of the ultra-refined Song dynasty . This was a period when individual freedoms were extended , encouraging one of the most remarkable flowerings of literature , fine art and handicrafts in history .  
The problem was eventually fixed through the combined efforts of a number of American computer scientists . Realizing that the increasing size and complexity of computer networks made it impossible for any individual to discover all the holes within them , these scientists established the Computer Emergency Response Team ( CERT ) at Carnegie-Mellon University . They hoped that by working together , network security issues could be predicted and resolved .  
After returning to Taiwan , Chen worked diligently to bring the theory and methods she learned into this country . Working with a social service agency , she handled individual cases of domestic violence . She has come away feeling somewhat powerless and disappointed .  
The " organic law " will , among other changes , cause individual services to lose their respective intelligence agencies , which will be unified under the general staff . The political warfare system ( an autonomous system of political commissar-type officers , created in early Republican times , to ensure the loyalty of the military to the nationalist revolution 's leaders ) will be reorganized and its functions will undergo a qualitative change .  
You can find as succinct a description of Zhu Xi 's importance as any in the Taiwan middle-school textbook History of Chinese Culture , which notes that Zhu Xi spent a lifetime annotating the Confucian classics , and established his own academies to teach others . It declaims : " You could say that , prior to the ascendance of Western power , Zhu Xi had the greatest influence on East Asian civilization of any one individual . His spirit permeated the daily lives , outlooks , and spiritual inclinations of Chinese people . "  
According to statistics of the Ministry of Finance , 87.5% of the trading volume on the Taiwan stock exchange comes from individual investors . In 1999 turnover was 288% ( that is , total trading volume was 2.88 times the total value of the market ) , which , though considerably down from nearly 600% ten years before , remained four times higher than the New York stock exchange . Despite numerous painful lessons in the past , the habit of chasing a rising market and cutthroat selling in a falling market has proven difficult to change .  
In the future , when everything is connected , information technology will be an inescapable part of daily life . Your personal information will be included in various government or private databanks , to be monitored and processed by those who control these databanks . At the same time , each individual can build a little private Internet of their own , and put everything about themselves in for ease of management .  
The 15-member committee finished its three-month review on September 15 without coming to a conclusive decision , with individual committee members in sharp disagreement over the per-kilowatt cost of nuclear power , the cost of canceling construction , and the cost to society of having a nuclear plant in operation . Many have criticized the Re-Evaluation Committee as " a complete waste of money , time , and energy . "  
The 47% share previously allotted to Taipei and Kaohsiung was decided upon last year after the government canceled a plan to abolish all local sales taxes and replace them with a single national sales tax . Now that this share has been lowered to 43% , the other cities and counties have seen their combined share go up to 39% , with each local government 's individual share calculated on the basis of population , land area , and other factors .  
With longer lifespans and less rigid social values , patterns of living once shared by all have been replaced by a growing diversity of individual experiences . In middle age , some people set up successful businesses , while others lose their jobs and are faced with poverty ; working women find themselves squeezed between the exhausting demands of children and housework on the one hand and their jobs on the other , while at the same time many single women face a daily battle with loneliness .  
" When the market gets tired of soft and pretty idols , it swings back toward androgynous tomboy types like Feng Fei-fei , " Wang notes . " Sun Yan Zi fills this need perfectly . " Moreover , she has had the right material , with producer Peter Li providing songs that have individual character but stop short of being avant garde . This has allowed her to stand apart from the pop singers who just blindly follow the marketplace .  
Over the past 50 years , no other individual has been appointed to ministerial posts overseeing all three areas of economic , financial and technological development affairs . During his long tenure guiding economic and financial policy , he nearly single-handedly planted the seeds for the development of Taiwan 's information industry .  
Lan Po-chou believes that Taiwanese historiography needs to be developed concurrently on an official level , through the full opening of archives , and on an individual one , through oral history . Only by rigorously pursuing both these lines of historical inquiry in tandem can the true history of Taiwan be recovered .  
At the same time , he has worked all his life in his capacity as an individual artist to promote contemporary Taiwanese art both at home and abroad . To this end , he has organized countless solo and joint exhibits , talked his good friend and printmaker Chu Wei-pai into opening an art gallery , introduced to Taiwan 's art community the works of such expatriate painters as Charng Yuh and Chao Wu-chi , and done many other things to inject renewed life into Taiwan 's arts scene .  
The devastating earthquake two years ago-the biggest in 100 years-caused 70 of the village 's 156 residences to collapse , not to mention the 30-plus houses that were left partially crippled by the disaster . While fortunately only one individual received minor injuries , none of the public buildings , including Tannan Elementary , the police station , and the village 's Catholic church , were left unscathed-in fact , most were totally destroyed . Moreover , access to the outside world was completely severed for a week .  
With regard to copyrighted imports such as newspapers , magazines , recordings and books , Chao explains that everything that has research value ( whether the copyright is held by an individual or an organization ) can be imported . Books and recordings of a cultural nature can likewise be published in Taiwan , so long as applications are filled and sensitive passages amended . But news-oriented newspapers and magazines from the mainland can not be published or sold here .  
A lot of people in my business have also attended these spiritual growth classes , hoping to break through their personal difficulties , have more harmonious personal relationships , and progress to a higher level at work , " says Chen Tsu-yin . Chen recently entered the insurance business , and this year , despite her great terror about meeting people , won the annual best individual achievement prize given by her company 's customer service department .  
According to interpretations of the Avatamsaka Sutra , our universe is formed of pearl-like individual objects strung together in a net , so that it is difficult to separate what is real from what is illusion ; past , present , and future exist side-by-side ; and no individual can exist in isolation . As a result , people should live in the present , embrace goodness and do good deeds , so that the universe will tend toward harmony .  
The Internet in fact closely resembles the intangible , borderless world of connected individual " pearls . " We never know how extensive or long-lasting might be the impact of a single small idea or action , but we can imagine that every molecule in the vast universe is connected . The area which illustrates such profound ideas is also , interestingly enough , the one that provides the most plain fun .  
His 1944 painting On the Way Home shows an old water buffalo , drawn with such precision that you can see its individual hairs . Leading it home is an old farming woman , who is carrying a bundle of sugar cane and wearing leggings and a broad rimmed hat with a covering scarf knotted under her chin . The simple and rustic scene does a good job of conveying Taiwan 's slow pace of life in those days .  
And so , apart from designing and carving , when his fellow workers were off work and at leisure , Huang busied himself attending exhibitions and doing relevant research in the field . " I wanted , " Huang says , describing his individual creative aspirations , " to create my own creative vocabulary for jade carving that was suited to this brilliant , expansive and constantly evolving age . And I 've never wavered from working to accomplish this . "  
Li Tung-liang , a director of the Chaoyang Lukang Association , points out that in the early years of the Guangxu reign period ( 1871-1908 ) of the Qing dynasty , the Quanzhou woodcarving master Li Ko-chiu moved to Lukang , where he gathered together all the local wood sculptors and organized a guild . Today , a century later , its namesake organization selects an annual chief organizer by casting for divination sticks ; this individual is then responsible for arranging the ceremony honoring Lu Ban .  
But chief editor Chuang Hui-chiu has done a masterful job of just that , spinning a broad tapestry that shows the interplay between individual emotions and collective experience . This she achieves by inviting contributions from over 30 persons from all walks of life who have played prominent roles in the gay movement over the past decade . By allowing each writer their own individual perspective , the book avoids the difficulties of historiography while providing students of social movements with a rigorous yet creative presentation of the facts .  
Every shot in A Journey of Impressions is like an individual photograph . The camera work has great feeling , and in concert with the relaxing and rhythmic musical soundtrack , it brought the documentary happily into the realm of reportage .

The global order can no longer be based solely on the special position of the anti-fascist coalition or the nuclear club , or on economic or military power ; rather , first and foremost , it should be based on the real contribution of individual countries to the prevention of every form of totalitarianism and to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; on their role within global socio-economic development ; on their democratic achievement ; and on their regional importance .

The reform altered 65 of the Constitution 's 202 articles , with respect to individual rights ; the rights and responsibilities of and guarantees for the Nicaraguan people ; political and social rights ; the rights of the Nicaraguan family ; defence and the national economy ; agrarian reform and public finances ; education and culture ; the organization of the State ; municipal affairs ; and the Atlantic Coast communities . 
Since the moment last November when you , Sir , were kind enough to entrust me with the coordination of these consultations , we have held a total of 36 full days of meetings , in addition to many informal consultations , or hallway meetings in many cases coordinated by specific delegations that generously devoted their time and efforts to act as facilitators as well as countless individual contacts and joint internal discussions within the various groups .  
One person less going to bed with an empty stomach , one person less torn with pain , one person less denied shelter small pragmatic steps inspired by the innate dignity of each human being ; acts of caring solidarity which each individual , each family , each community is capable of ; commitment to others generates hope .  
Any government , institution or individual seeking to promote human rights should bear in mind the significance of national and regional peculiarities as well as historical , cultural and religious backgrounds and the stage of economic development .  
We believe that development challenges to any country can be met only by taking into account the global economic system as a solution that involves the development of a comprehensive framework combining international and local efforts , with a view to improving the performance of the economy in a favourable environment wherein local and regional circumstances and the priorities and special conditions of each individual State are taken into consideration .  
While we should not allow that individual consensual elements of the reform process be held hostage to progress in unrelated issues , there seems to be an evident need to reach a political agreement , at least on the basic philosophy of the major premises of the reform agenda .  
While we are aware that the matter of economic and individual personal development is first and foremost a national responsibility , we are deeply conscious that our limited domestic resources constitute a severe constraint upon us in our quest to fulfil this obligation .  
Thus while it acknowledged that individual countries bear the primary responsibility for the attainment of the goals of the conference , it also recognized that the support of the international community as a whole including of the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , bilateral donors , non-governmental organizations and all actors of civil society will be crucial if we are to realize all the objectives of the conference .  
Even though it is important to reaffirm a strong commitment of the private sector , donor Governments , agencies and non-governmental organizations to genuine partnership for the accelerated industrial growth of Africa , a critical step must be made to design policies based on the real needs of individual African economies , as development will take place in Africa only when its peoples have democratic control over their own policies .  
The true dimensions of this problem can clearly be seen when it is set against the background of the technical and material restrictions on demining that prevent any easy or rapid implementation and when we consider the risks and costs that make it prohibitive to individual countries .  
There may be no other single individual who has been as instrumental or as effective in leading the world community in recent years in the difficult search for common ground , particularly on issues relating to environmentally sustainable development .  
In this sea of change in international relations , the whole concept of international security has increasingly moved away from the bipolar view , concerned largely with military security , to one which assigns a central role to sustainable development and the welfare of the individual .  
Note that , as far as education systems are concerned , basic education is the only appropriate way of meeting fundamental educational needs and enabling every individual to become a real participant in society and an effective and responsible participant in the economic , social and cultural development of his or her country ;  
At its 57th meeting , the Council reached a new turning point in the history of the Commission , when it concluded and authorized the full payment of compensation for all pending successful category B claims through its consideration and approval of the fourth and final report of the Panel of Commissioners on individual claims for serious personal injury or death ( S / AC . 26 / 1995 / 6 and S / AC . 26 / Dec . 34 ( 1995 ) ) .  
Ratification of the Convention had also had a positive educational impact on the public , had satisfied a long-standing demand by women 's organizations and had stimulated legislative , administrative and other measures on the part of individual ministries .  
Iraq had repeatedly stated that a responsive environment and suitable economic and political conditions were essential to guarantee fundamental rights of the individual , which were the pillar of the Iraqi political and constitutional system .  
Had the Special Rapporteur behaved in a neutral or objective manner , he would have called , without any hesitation and for purely humanitarian , legal and moral reasons , for the lifting of sanctions , at least in part on the grounds that human rights must be respected not only by individual countries but also by international organizations , particularly the Security Council .  
The promotion of democracy , the strengthening of the protection of human rights and economic and social development formed an interdependent whole , as the World Conference on Human Rights had already stated ; democracy opened the way for the promotion and protection of fundamental freedoms but was able to sustain and consolidate itself only if it was able to respond to the individual and collective needs of citizens .  
Military contingents , including military , technical and rear support units ( subunits ) , shall be fully supplied with weapons and military equipment , spare parts and military and technical supplies , and technical servicing , evacuation and repair components under schedules , tables and norms specially drawn up for them , taking into account the physical and geographical conditions of the region in which their tasks are carried out and in accordance with individual agreements .  
Developing innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for human settlements development and creating a supportive environment for the mobilization of resources by civil society , including beneficiary and individual voluntary contributions ;  
Also stresses that the governing bodies of all funds , programmes and specialized agencies should make further progress in order to ensure that the prescribed limits on field-level authority for cancelling , modifying and adding activities within approved programmes and shifting resources within approved budget lines of individual components of a programme and among components of a programme , with the approval of national authorities , should be expanded to become equal and uniform , to the maximum extent possible , in the context of enhanced accountability ;  
Promote greater governmental involvement in the selection process for resident coordinators , in particular by ensuring that national Governments are consulted before the post profile for resident coordinators is passed to the Joint Consultative Group on Policies , and keeping up to date the selection criteria for resident coordinators and , through the respective executive heads , for senior representatives of United Nations agencies in the field , bearing in mind the specific circumstances of individual countries ;  
Also decides that the field-level committees organized by the United Nations system country team , which were established in accordance with paragraph 40 of General Assembly resolution 47 / 199 , should review substantive activities - including draft country programmes , sectoral programmes and projects - prior to their approval by individual organizations , and should exchange experience acquired , on the understanding that the result of the work of the review committee should be submitted to national Governments for final approval through the national focal points ;  
In spite of some encouraging individual examples of the growth of official development assistance ( ODA ) , as well as of some promising approaches towards mobilizing domestic and international resources for sustainable development identified and explored by the Commission through its Ad Hoc Inter-sessional Working Group on Finance , the overall picture in regard to the implementation of all the recommendations and commitments related to finance as contained in Agenda 21 remains an area of concern .  
44 The observers of non-governmental organizations and individual experts at the Ninth Congress as well as at the fourth session of the Commission fulfilled an important function , particularly by making statements in their capacity as observers on the substantive topics of the agendas , based on their extensive experiences as practitioners working in the field or as distinguished scholars in the area of crime prevention and criminal justice .  
54 In more than two thirds of the responding countries , law enforcement officials were always obliged , before using firearms against persons , to wait between the warning and the direct use of firearms against persons to give the offender sufficient time to observe the warning ; about a quarter reported that this principle was applied usually ; United Kingdom law enforcement officers , depending on their discretion in individual cases , had to wait between warning and the use of firearms only in exceptional cases or never . 
Directly tied into this process has been the continued dissemination of individual country information through the very successful investment seminars and round-table discussions which have enabled private companies , financial institutions and technical advisers to gain a better understanding of various countries and their risk factors , and to develop good working relationships with private and government officials and the multilateral and bilateral aid institutions , all with a view towards creating a sustainable economic and environmentally sound base of operations on which to build within the various countries .  
Rather than the initial very simple structure of a pure equity investment by an individual foreign investor where risk was self insured , a number of joint venture investments have concluded and have been structured to include a mix of equity and non-recourse project debt , with insurance provided by either private or agency insurers .  
It is understandable that the restoration of such confidence may be impeded by the deep wounds and distrust left by the conflict at the individual human level as well as by current political calculations .  
There were also concerns , however , that the new technologies would lead to growing social and economic gaps and injustice , and would threaten cultural diversity , religious values and even individual freedom ; there was therefore a need to study ways to make the new technologies widely accessible and supportive of sustainable development .  
Some of the perceived potential benefits include pleasure derived directly from the psychopharmacological effects of the drug ; pleasure derived indirectly through the perceived improved performance of the individual in different contexts ; the thrill of indulging in " risky " behaviour ; and the social benefits that may be derived from being associated with a group or subculture in which illicit drugs are consumed .  
Perceived potential costs of illicit drug use include the possible health effects of acute or chronic toxicity ; the risk of arrest and punishment ; the effect on academic or career performance ; the danger , if caught , of being expelled from school or losing a job ; the risk of resultant stigma attached to the label of illicit drug user ; and individual feelings of guilt about defying parents , the law or a religious code .  
In other countries , such as has been independently reported in Malaysia , traditional healing as a means of treatment of dependence is sometimes based on beliefs that persons are vulnerable to supernatural influences , as well as physical causes , which increase the probability of dependence arising . 56 In such instances , traditional healers focus upon the well-being of the individual , and detoxification involves the use of herbal medicines , physical exercise and the promotion of physical health .  NULLThe role of acupuncture in the treatment of dependence has become more widespread in recent years .  
An individual in Iraq ( the Director-General of a major missile establishment ) alleged to be responsible for this acquisition , stated that he had destroyed , in August 1995 , all guidance and control components received and had informed Iraq 's governmental authorities on two occasions , in August and October 1995 , about the receipt of these proscribed items .  
" Persons of Viet-Nam origin aged more than eighteen at the date of coming into operation of the present Convention , and who have acquired French nationality prior to 8 March 1949 either by individual or collective administrative measure or by judicial decision shall retain French nationality with the right to opt for Viet-Nam nationality under the provisions laid down by the present Convention . 
" Persons of Viet-Nam origin above the age of eighteen at the date of coming into operation of the present Convention who have acquired French citizenship after 8 March 1949 by individual or collective administrative measure or by judicial decision shall acquire Viet-Nam nationality with the right to opt for French nationality under the provisions laid down by the present Convention . " 
Educational institutions will be assisted in designing and implementing preventive education and health promotion programmes to be integrated into a comprehensive health education context covering both physical and psycho-social health , addressing cognitive factors , attitudes and skills , emphasizing the individual and group behaviours that put a person at risk , both as concerns drug abuse and other health-related problems . 
Ensuring that due priority is given and adequate resources made available , at the national , regional and international levels , to combat the threat to individual and public health posed by the rapid spread of HIV / AIDS globally and by the re-emergence of major diseases , such as tuberculosis , malaria , onchocerciasis ( river blindness ) and diarrhoeal diseases , in particular cholera ;  
The political and professional debate has in recent years focused , and is likely to continue to focus , on a number of major questions : the relationship between a high level of social provision and individual incentives to work and national competitiveness ; the extent to which individual and family responsibility might be undermined by social provision ; the relative efficiency of public and private provision and of various mixes of the two ; how to divide responsibility among different levels of government ; and how to keep costs in check .  
Regarding the specific subject of national execution , the outstanding issue is still the need to formulate a clear and acceptable definition of the term " national execution " in order to prevent varying interpretations by individual United Nations agencies responsible for applying it .  
ECLAC has made major efforts over the past five years to develop a more efficient and effective secretariat through more streamlined organization , cost-saving measures , rigorous programming , training , improving horizontal and vertical communication between staff , and enhancing responsibility and accountability on the part of individual staff members and organizational units .  
Female employees assigned to work that is not allowed to be performed by pregnant women or to work that , in medical opinion , would threaten the pregnancy and for that reason are reassigned to other lower paid work during pregnancy until the ninth month after childbirth are allocated complementary pregnancy and maternity benefits , amounting to the difference between their average earnings before being reassigned to lower paid work , and those earned in the individual calendar months following such reassignment .  
It has since been determined that the list contained several apparent errors : it included an individual who had already been granted amnesty , a number of non-combatants , several elderly persons and at least one person who died some years ago .  
Their central objectives are to improve the economic position of members , whether individuals or enterprises , denied access to other banking institutions owing to their inability to offer sufficiently sound collateral ; to facilitate the continual recycling of cooperative capital into cooperative enterprise ; and to attract and manage capital obtained from outside the cooperative sector for use by individual cooperatives .  
It would also be acceptable if paragraph 2 , instead of remaining vague about the functions of the joint management mechanism , were to list them in detail ( data collection , project design and implementation , approval of activities planned by individual States , exercise of regulatory power , peaceful settlement of disputes and exploration of potential sources of financing , to name but a few ) .  
This reflects varying economic , environmental , social , cultural and religious values and needs , which operate within legal and policy frameworks usually specific to individual countries .  
It further implies that individual countries review and test the practical possibilities to measure and periodically assess specific indicators at the field level and that they assess their relevance to prevailing environmental , economic , social and institutional realities of the country concerned .  
While there appears to be general agreement on sustainability criteria , it has become increasingly clear that indicators , through which progress is monitored over time , must be tailored to meet specified economic , environmental , social and cultural conditions , operating within institutional , legal and policy frameworks specific to individual countries .  
For this to be a viable arrangement , the current value of the gross salary corresponding to the individual 's level at retirement would have to be used as the point of reference , as it is expected that retirees will be reassigned to functions similar or identical to those for which they were compensated prior to retirement .  
A properly designed , voluntary and independently accredited certification scheme at the global level can be a means by which the various interested parties can hold producers accountable ; it can provide a market-based incentive to the individual producer to improve management ; it can meet consumer demands for wood from well-managed forests without creating trade discriminations ; and it can be a mechanism for monitoring multiple factors involved in forest use .  
The eradication of poverty can not be accomplished through anti-poverty programmes alone but will require democratic participation , and changes in economic structures in order to ensure access for all to resources , opportunities and public services , to undertake policies geared to more equitable distribution of wealth and income , to implement social protection for those who can not support themselves , and to assist people confronted with unforeseen catastrophe , whether individual or collective , natural , social or technological .  
Recovery may also be sought from States contributing contingents where combat-related damage is caused by members of their national contingent in violation of international humanitarian law and where the international criminal responsibility of the individual member is entailed .  
They include : financial and temporal limitations , counter-claims and set-offs , and recovery from States contributing contingents for damage caused by gross negligence , wilful misconduct , or which entails the international criminal responsibility of the individual member of the Force .  
Consequently , in his previous report to the General Assembly ( A / 50 / 390 , para . 28 ) , the Special Rapporteur indicated that illicit activities in which nationality is used to mask their mercenary nature by a Power that recruits , prepares and pays an individual to perpetrate a criminal act against another country , its Government , its property or a given sector of its population should be analysed and debated with a view to revising current international provisions on the subject .  
In addition to promoting mutual understanding and solidarity through cultural cooperation between peoples , the assistance aims at creating equal and free opportunities for the individual , in accordance with the aims and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , the development of human resources and the respect of the individual , as well as the creation of pluralistic civil societies .  
The Commission on Human Rights , by its resolution 1982 / 29 of 11 March 1982 , recommended that the Economic and Social Council request the Chairman of the Commission to appoint an individual of recognized international standing as special rapporteur to submit a comprehensive report to the Commission at its thirty-ninth session on the occurrence and extent of the practice of summary or arbitrary executions , together with his conclusions and recommendations .  
In addition , Tunisia 's penal system is sufficiently well developed from the standpoint of criminal legislation and juridical institutions to ensure the punishment of any use of scientific progress for purposes prejudicial to human life or individual freedom or privacy .  
However , it is still the case that the means placed in man 's hands by science and technology , which now enable him to affect , even indirectly , the physical integrity , freedom or privacy of the individual , constitute a serious threat to human rights in any country , especially since scientific and technological progress has achieved such a degree of sophistication that individuals hardly have any truly " private " life any more and are no longer safe from genetic manipulation .  
It is to be hoped that the scientifically advanced nations will effectively control the use of scientific progress by their nationals or public authorities and prevent any use detrimental to the natural wealth and the human , genetic and biological resources of the less developed nations or to the individual freedom and privacy of their citizens , especially with respect to trade in and management of waste materials .  
His delegation welcomed the recent initiative to tackle the problem of multilateral debt and to enhance rescheduling by the Paris Club ; however , the approach must be broadened , bearing in mind the requirements of economic growth and social and environmental sector investments .  There was still a pressing need to find an early and lasting solution to all types of debt which also took into account the problems and requirements of individual countries .  
With the active and permanent participation of the people through Guatemalan organizations , political forces and social sectors , this renewal of institutions must embrace all levels , from local authorities to the functioning of State bodies , so that all those who are entrusted with public authority fulfil their commitment to serve social justice , political participation , and the security and full development of the individual ,  
The necessary amendments shall continue to be made to the corresponding regulations so that the military education system is consistent , in its philosophical framework , with respect for the Guatemalan Constitution and other laws , with a culture of peace and democratic coexistence , with the doctrine defined in this Agreement , and with national values , the integral development of the individual , knowledge of our national history , respect for human rights and the identity and rights of the indigenous peoples , and the primacy of the individual .  
Health security covers all aspects of the right of every individual to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health , including the right to food in sufficient quantity and of good quality , the right to decent housing and to live in environments where known health risks are controlled , and the right to have access to education and information on health , rights that are enshrined in the various international treaties .  
With respect to dual nationals of the claimant and respondent States , the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal has held that international law requires that the individual be a dominant and effective national of the claimant State .  
The Greek Ministry of Justice reported that the Greek Constitution and legislation fully safeguard both equality in the enjoyment of fundamental individual and social rights and freedoms for all citizens irrespective of race , colour , religion and ethnic or national origin ( art . 5 ) , and freedom of religious conscience .  
In addition to the constitutional protection of individual and social rights and freedoms , Greece has signed and sanctioned virtually all international conventions on human rights and on the elimination of racial discrimination , in particular :  
A penal component , prohibiting any racial , ethnic or religious discrimination against an individual or community and strengthening the penalties to be handed down on conviction for racist offences by adding deprivation of civil rights for 5 to 10 years ;  
To criminalizing in an effective manner acts of bribery of any public official or elected representative , by any private or public corporation or individual , taking action where appropriate through coordinated efforts but without in any way precluding , impeding or delaying international , regional or national actions to further the implementation of this Declaration , including :  
The offer , promise or giving of any payment , gift or other advantage , directly or indirectly , by any private or public corporation or individual from a Member State to any public official or elected representative of another country as undue consideration for performing or refraining from the performance of that official 's or representative 's duties in connection with an international commercial transaction ;  
The soliciting , demanding , accepting or receiving , directly or indirectly , by any public official or elected representative of a Member State from any private or public corporation or individual from another country of any payment , gift or other advantage , as undue consideration for performing or refraining from the performance of that official 's or representative 's duties in connection with an international commercial transaction ;  
To denying , in countries that do not already do so and in accordance with the fundamental principles of their legal systems , the tax deductibility of bribes paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a Member State to any public official or elected representative of another country ;  
On the subject of protection of the individual , the Special Rapporteur earnestly hopes that restrictions on the freedom of movement of religious officials will be lifted and that the campaigns of harassment and intimidation directed against them , which are also prejudicial to their followers , will cease , thus enabling the Muslim brotherhoods to realize their full potential without fear , constraint or self-censorship , subject , of course , to respect for public order and the law and the avoidance of violence , extremism and obscurantism .  
To criminalize in an effective manner acts of bribery in international commercial transactions of any public official or elected representative , by any private or public corporation or individual , taking action where appropriate in a coordinated manner , but without in any way precluding , impeding or delaying international , regional or national actions to further the implementation of this Declaration ;  
The offer , promise or giving of any payment , gift or other advantage , directly or indirectly , by any private or public corporation , including a transnational corporation , or individual from a State to any public official or elected representative of another country as undue consideration for performing or refraining from the performance of that official 's or representative 's duties in connection with an international commercial transaction ;  
The soliciting , demanding , accepting or receiving , directly or indirectly , by any public official or elected representative of a State from any private or public corporation , including a transnational corporation , or individual from another country of any payment , gift or other advantage , as undue consideration for performing or refraining from the performance of that official 's or representative 's duties in connection with an international commercial transaction ;  
Please describe specific measures taken to guarantee the child 's right to life and to create an environment conducive to ensuring to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child , including physical , mental , spiritual , moral , psychological and social development , in a manner compatible with human dignity , and to prepare the child for an individual life in a free society .  
In response to invitations by the General Assembly , and its request that the Secretary-General approach Governments for voluntary contributions in cash or in kind , individual Governments have contributed the services of personnel to support activities in peacekeeping , disarmament , humanitarian assistance , international tribunals , economic and social research , internal oversight services , administration and management .  
The principles elaborated in the above-mentioned administrative instruction on non-reimbursable loans for technical cooperation projects ( ST / AI / 231 / Rev . 1 ) , particularly in terms of an agreement or understanding between the United Nations and the donor and the issuance of a special service agreement with the individual , have been applied only in a limited number of cases .  
The offer , promise or giving of any payment , gift or other advantage , directly or indirectly , by any private or public corporation , including a transnational corporation , or individual from a State to any public official or elected representative of another country as undue consideration for performing or refraining from the performance of that official 's or representative 's duties in connection with an international commercial transaction ;  
The soliciting , demanding , accepting or receiving , directly or indirectly , by any public official or elected representative of a State from any private or public corporation , including a transnational corporation , or individual from another country of any payment , gift or other advantage , as undue consideration for performing or refraining from the performance of that official 's or representative 's duties in connection with an international commercial transaction ;  
To deny , in countries that do not already do so , the tax deductibility of bribes paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a Member State to any public official or elected representative of another country , and to that end , to examine their respective modalities for doing so ;  
The question is limited to a small number of individual and isolated cases in which the offenders are held accountable and punished , in case the investigation and the judicial verdict prove it , in the light of the State 's desire to ensure the enforcement of the law while showing no indulgence towards offenders of the crime of torture , as reflected in the detailed replies of the Egyptian authorities to the Committee .  
Welcomes the proposed measures outlined by the Government of Cambodia in its comments [ 6 ] on the report of the Special Representative to ensure that the forthcoming communal and national elections are free and fair , that members of the armed forces remain neutral during the election campaign , that the individual vote is confidential and that local and international observers are welcomed ;  
Welcomes the proposed measures outlined by the Government of Cambodia in its comments [ 52 ] on the report of the Special Representative to ensure that the forthcoming communal and national elections are free and fair , that members of the armed forces remain neutral during the election campaign , that the individual vote is confidential and that local and international observers are welcomed ;  
At its fifty-first session , the Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1995 / 82 of 8 March 1995 , aware of the rapid development of the life sciences and the dangers that certain practices may pose to the integrity and dignity of the individual and seeking to ensure that scientific progress benefits individuals and develops in a manner respectful of fundamental human rights , invited Governments , the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system ,  
According to the Standard Professional Code for German Physicians , which underlies all individual professional codes in this respect , all physicians , prior to conducting any clinical trial on a human person or epidemiological research using personal data , must seek the advice of a medical ethics commission on the medical and legal issues involved .  
Others had felt that certain kinds of environmental damage , such as damage caused by the deliberate detonation of nuclear explosions or pollution of entire rivers , should entail the individual criminal responsibility of those responsible , particularly since the fate of future generations was at stake .  
In our world of interdependency and in the light of the vital need to protect a core of fundamental norms of international law , States can no longer afford to retrench behind traditional notions of sovereignty , concepts of cultural relativism , disparities in national legislation and independence of national courts to plead non-implementation of international obligations , particularly where these are aimed at protection of the individual .  
The offer , promise or giving of any payment , gift or other advantage , directly or indirectly , by any private or public corporation , including a transnational corporation , or individual from a State to any public official or elected representative of another country as undue consideration for performing or refraining from the performance of that official 's or representative 's duties in connection with an international commercial transaction ;  
The soliciting , demanding , accepting or receiving , directly or indirectly , by any public official or elected representative of a State from any private or public corporation , including a transnational corporation , or individual from another country of any payment , gift or other advantage , as undue consideration for performing or refraining from the performance of that official 's or representative 's duties in connection with an international commercial transaction ;  
To deny , in countries that do not already do so , the tax deductibility of bribes paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a State to any public official or elected representative of another country , and to that end , to examine their respective modalities for doing so ;  
Regardless of the approach adopted by individual countries , NFPs or other relevant policy frameworks , as long-term iterative processes , should be based on [ guiding principles recognizing ] the following key elements : national sovereignty and country leadership ; consistency with national policies and international commitments ; integration with the country 's sustainable development strategies ; partnership and participation ; [ and ] holistic and intersectoral approaches that recognize forests as diverse ecosystems ; and secure land and property rights . 7 bis .  
Authorizes the Secretary-General to commence the gradual and progressive withdrawal of UNAVEM III formed military units from individual quartering areas prior to February 1997 , and to accelerate the withdrawal schedule subsequently , if former combatants vacate the quartering areas in accordance with the Lusaka Protocol and other factors are conducive to withdrawal , without putting at risk the successful completion of the peace process ;  
Authorizes the Secretary-General to commence the gradual and progressive withdrawal of UNAVEM III formed military units from individual quartering areas prior to February 1997 , and to accelerate the withdrawal schedule subsequently , if former combatants vacate the quartering areas in accordance with the Lusaka Protocol and other factors are conducive to withdrawal , without putting at risk the successful completion of the peace process ;  
Finally , we did find offensive the implicit or explicit suggestion that the Tribunal should exhibit impartiality by , in future , indicting the same number of people from each ethnic background .  That truly would be a perversion of justice that would transform the Tribunal into a political court designed to serve the political expediency of some , or refashion history and ignore the essential foundation of individual responsibility .  
To that end , the court should be based on optional jurisdiction , its jurisdiction should cover only the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole , it should ensure respect for and primacy of national criminal justice systems , it should be an independent international juridical institution , and accused persons should be accorded all relevant individual human rights and commonly recognized procedural guarantees .  
As regards the sources which reported alleged cases of arbitrary detention to the Working Group , it may be noted that of the 205 individual cases submitted by the Working Group to Governments during the period under consideration , 10 were based on information communicated by members of the families or relatives of the detained persons , 91 on information communicated by local or regional non _ governmental organizations , and 104 on information provided by international non _ governmental organizations enjoying consultative status with the Economic and Social Council .  
These actors include international and regional intergovernmental organizations ; individual States ; parliamentarians ; non-governmental organizations from the local to the global levels ; and private actors such as legal professionals , the media , academics , private institutions and civic associations , including ethnic , cultural and religious groups .  
Because democratic Governments are freely chosen by their citizens and held accountable through periodic and genuine elections and other mechanisms , they are more likely to promote and respect the rule of law , respect individual and minority rights , cope effectively with social conflict , absorb migrant populations and respond to the needs of marginalized groups .  
Support for a culture of democracy has proved critical to success in holding free and fair elections in which all actors in society - government officials , political leaders , parliamentarians , judicial officials , police and military forces and individual citizens - play their accorded roles .  
At the same time , new channels of political expression and activity for individual citizens are developing outside governmental structures but inside the public sphere once considered the virtually exclusive province of government ; the proliferation of non-governmental organizations from the local to the global and the expansion of activity through international political associations , or " political internationals " , both make clear the deficiencies of existing governmental structures in the face of global change .  
Moreover , " international relations " - not relations among nations but relations among sovereign States - are increasingly shaped not only by the States themselves but also by an expanding array of non-State actors on the " international " scene , ranging all the way from individual persons to civic associations , non-governmental organizations , local authorities , private multinational business , academia , the media , parliamentarians and regional and international intergovernmental organizations .  
While democratization must take place at all levels of human society - local , national , regional and global - the special power of democratization lies in its logic , which flows from the individual human person , the one irreducible entity in world affairs and the logical source of all human rights .  
At later stages of planning , the Secretariat will require more detailed information , such as the response time for each individual unit , any political or material preconditions , period of self-sufficiency , level of equipment , probable port of departure , total surface / volume / weight , number and types of vehicles , number of containers , information on particularly large or heavy items , and information on dangerous cargo ( e.g . , ammunition ) , and any specific handling instructions .  
It was pointed out that in some jurisdictions the relief that could be granted by the court before the opening of insolvency proceedings or before recognition of a foreign proceeding was limited to relief measures of an individual nature provided under national rules on civil procedure ( i.e . measures covering specific assets identified by a creditor ) and did not extend to special relief measures available under special rules concerning collective insolvency proceedings .  
The Commission , however , decided that the automatic stay should cover not only execution of claims but also the individual actions and proceedings conducted prior to execution ; that was considered necessary to allow the foreign representative the necessary temporary respite to organize the affairs of the debtor without having to participate in possibly numerous actions against the debtor .  
In response to that suggestion it was observed that in legal systems that recognized insolvency proceedings of natural persons , such as individual traders or merchants , it would sometimes be difficult to establish a clear distinction between the debtors business and personal affairs , and that proceedings apparently falling in the latter category might well have influence on the debtors assets and liabilities .  
It was said that , if such standing was to be conferred on the foreign representative , it should extend only to actions that were available to the local insolvency administrator in the context of an insolvency proceeding opened in the enacting State ; care should be taken to avoid creating an impression that the foreign representative was equated with individual creditors , who under many legal systems had a right to initiate actions to avoid or otherwise render ineffective legal acts detrimental to creditors .  
At the same time , States are moving towards establishing the individual penal responsibility of those who commit extremely grave international crimes , through the creation of special courts and the forthcoming establishment of an international criminal court .  
However , at the end of the day , all of us who are democratizing agree that basic fundamentals must be met , among them the promotion of the existence of representative government elected by the majority of the population through secret ballot , in regular periodic and genuine elections , as well as the promotion of party competition , an independent judiciary , guarantees of fundamental human rights and individual freedoms , transparency and accountability under the rule of law , a free and independent press and the growth of civil society .  
At the threshold of the third millennium , it is unacceptable that poverty and pollution still dominate the daily lives of billions of people all over the world ; it is unacceptable that hostilities and hatred still create deadly new conflicts and humanitarian disasters , between and within States on all continents ; and it is unacceptable that basic human and individual rights are still widely violated through injustice by Governments and the negligence of the international community .  
At the local level , the non-governmental organizations working with UNRWA range from support groups for individual hospitals or centres for the disabled to societies for the physically or mentally handicapped , covering a particular town or area , locally based law centres , women 's associations , universities , medical associations and camp or village committees .  
In addition , during its session , the Governing Council considered reports submitted by a number of Governments on the distribution of compensation awarded to successful claimants in category B . The Council agreed that further discussion was needed regarding the situation where , following the transfer of funds to the relevant Governments or international organizations , awarded compensation has not been distributed to individual claimants , for one reason or another , after a reasonable period of time has elapsed . 
The Commission 's operations also constituted a very democratic process in which no veto power was considered , all claimant countries were treated equally and , for the first time in history , an absolute priority was given to individual claimants , particularly the most deprived and needy , which added a significant humanitarian dimension to the Commission 's work . 
Whereas , given a situation where there is social and economic injustice , including discriminatory practices against indigenous peoples , and the systematic denial of individual and collective rights and safeguards , the peoples concerned have the right to seek the necessary democratic change ,  
RECOGNIZING the importance of observance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and other international human rights instruments , as well as respect for international humanitarian law applicable to armed conflicts , and bearing in mind the complementarity between human rights and international humanitarian law in improving protection of the individual and respect for his dignity in situations of armed conflict ,  
According to a recent UNDP publication , 5 there are , today , good opportunities in remote rural areas of developing countries for using renewable sources of energy at competitive costs to meet the small-scale mechanical or electric power needs of the individual household , farm or village .  
The response of individual organizations of the United Nations system to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development 's sustainable development agenda is assessed in terms of the three basic functions of intergovernmental organizations : ( a ) policy development , ( b ) the collection , synthesis , analysis and dissemination of data and information to inform action at all levels and ( c ) the delivery of technical and financial support to strengthen human and institutional capabilities at national and regional levels .  
As to the decentralized nature of the international statistical system in terms of subject , member States should be able to take a holistic view across all subject areas of the international statistical system , which at the moment is not possible because there are no mechanisms or processes in place for doing so ; the Commission itself does not have a broad enough reach and the individual components of the international statistical system are quite heterogeneous . 
Moreover , analysis of trafficking trends and of conclusions thereon , as well as of specific trafficking routes and methods , is often incomplete as a result of the scarcity of individual seizure reports transmitted by Governments to international organizations and the relatively low rates of interception of illicit drug trafficking in some of the key trafficking countries and regions .  
Replace the existing text with the following : 3 .  To re-examining , with a view to denying it in countries which do not already do so , the tax deductibility of bribes , paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a member State to any public official of another country , in accordance with the basic principles of its legal order ;  
Also , with a view to clarifying that paragraph ( 4 ) also covered insolvencies of individuals , it was proposed to redraft paragraph ( 4 ) to provide that , absent proof to the contrary , the registered office was deemed to be the centre of the main interests of a legal entity , and the habitual residence was deemed to be the centre of the main interests of an individual .  
The third stage , once the crisis is contained , is to stimulate recovery , by recreating accountable systems of governance , reviving commercial and economic activity , promoting social cohesion , rebuilding infrastructure , restoring health and education services and encouraging individual enterprises .  
It is united by shared organizational values and managerial principles that foster effective teamwork , high standards and managerial and individual responsibility and clear norms of staff conduct ; is secure in the justness of its accountability framework and in the provisions for staff empowerment , recognition and sanctions which that framework actively guarantees .  45 .  It has improved leadership styles and has established among all staff a strong culture of efficiency and professionalism .  
Regardless of the approach adopted by individual countries , national forest programmes should be viewed as long-term iterative processes , and should be based on guiding principles recognizing the following key elements : national sovereignty and country leadership , consistency with national policies and international commitments , integration with the country 's sustainable development strategies , partnership and participation , and holistic and intersectoral approaches .  
In a second step , during the biennium 1997-1998 , it will be necessary to supplement the new version with a number of new provisions , such as detailed packing instructions for individual substances and other provisions normally found in instruments regulating the transport of dangerous goods by one given mode , so that the model regulation can be directly integrated into national or international instruments , without substantial redrafting .  
Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action and , at the same time , cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions , societies and economies , where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential ,  
It will comprise [ government representatives ] [ persons nominated by governments , acting in their individual capacity ] who are experts [ in social , economic , legal , technical , scientific and technological , and / or environmental fields ] [ with relevant knowledge ] in the field of the Convention .  
With regard to the financial management of resources devoted to NGOs , ACC members agree with the need for a better accounting and reporting procedure , however they are not convinced that the resulting ability to produce comparative statistics will be particularly useful , since the operating budgets of organizations and agencies are very different and their individual needs in terms of cooperation with NGOs are fully adapted to their respective roles and mandates .  
Against this backdrop , the Survey is organized as follows : chapter I briefly describes how the developing ESCAP region fares in the emerging global scene ; chapter II shows the recent performance of individual countries in terms of selected macroeconomic and social development indicators which impinge on participation in the globalization and regionalization processes ; chapters III and IV analyse the benefits and risks of integration into the international and regional economy focusing on foreign trade and external finance ( including FDI ) . 
Regretting the human rights violations , both individual and collective , the marginalization and discrimination that the indigenous populations in Guatemala suffered and are suffering , together with the continued deterioration of the economic and social situation , with its serious consequences for the great majority of the population , particularly for the indigenous peoples of Guatemala and the most vulnerable sectors of Guatemalan society ,  
The premises are thus established for us to attain our main objective , which is the establishment of the true rule of law , under which the individual and collective rights of all citizens will be respected and protected by law , and under which the political differences and the different parties can find in the Parliament an appropriate forum for discussions and review .  
Consequently , it is the individual concerned , the citizen , who is fully entitled , directly or indirectly , to choose those who exercise the governmental , representative or legislative function , and who renews or withdraws his trust _ or rather his delegation of authority _ at predetermined intervals and in accordance with rules that protect his freedom of choice and punish any attempt to vitiate or divert it .  
Recognizing the respect for the environment accorded by the cultures of indigenous peoples of the Americas , and considering the special relationship between the indigenous peoples and the environment , lands , resources and territories on which they live and their natural resources .  Recognizing that in many indigenous cultures , traditional collective systems for control and use of land and territory and resources , including bodies of water and coastal areas , are a necessary condition for their survival , social organization , development and their individual and collective well-being . . .  
The Inter _ American Court of Human Rights , for example , in a ground _ breaking ruling , found that amnesty for the perpetrators of serious human rights violations was incompatible with the right of every individual to a fair hearing before an impartial and independent court .  
All these elements should , in fact , be sought out and thoroughly explored in order to assess objectively whether ( and , eventually , to what extent ) international human rights law is moving beyond the traditional dichotomy of individual versus State , beyond the duty of States to respect and ensure the observance of human rights , and towards the creation of obligations applicable also to private individuals and other non _ State actors , including liberation movements and terrorist organizations .  
Collective expulsions or population transfers usually target national , ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities and thus , prima facie , violate individual as well as collective rights contained in several important international human rights instruments , in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Rights of the Child .  
The human rights system has the legal obligation to observe the economic system and to signal the greater or lesser impact it is having in meeting the needs of individual human beings and on their enjoyment of essential civil , economic , social , political and cultural rights .  
Many States have successfully implemented comparatively rapid procedures at points of entry which ensure a fair and competent assessment of the need for international protection , and UNHCR encourages States to ensure the rights of the individual through proper legal safeguards , in developing such procedures .  
Having due regard to all relevant definitions of the practice of forced evictions under international human rights provisions and instruments , the present Guidelines apply to instances of forced evictions in which there are acts and / or omissions involving the coerced and involuntary removal of individuals , groups and communities from their homes and / or lands and common property resources they occupy or are dependent upon , thus eliminating or limiting the possibility of an individual , group or community residing or working in a particular dwelling , residence or place .  
Reflecting the requirements of the situation prevailing at the time , the respected leader Comrade Kim Il Sung , in his speech on 6 August 1971 , advanced the policy of new , wide-ranging negotiations whereby we were ready to come into contact at any time with all political parties including the ruling " Democratic Republican Party " , social organizations and individual personages of south Korea . 
To ensure success , however , it is imperative to immediately provide employment opportunities and to generate incomes for the local population ; this will require focused action over a medium _ term period to relieve the population through communal and municipal local infrastructure works , food _ for _ work initiatives ( particularly for rural infrastructure development ) , integration of rural women into the local economy through training and related support for small _ scale economic activities , provision of ample micro _ and small _ scale credit at the individual and enterprise levels etc . 
The individual elements of a culture of peace are therefore : non-violence and respect for human rights , respect and solidarity among all peoples and dialogue between cultures , the linkage of peace to democratic participation and sustainable human development , the free flow and sharing of information and knowledge , contribution to conflict-prevention and post-conflict peace-building , and equality between women and men , all best supported through projects in which people take an active role in transforming their values , attitudes and behaviours .  
The presence of the multinational protection force affectively blocked the risk of Albania sliding towards anarchy or even internal political conflict and allowed the various international organizations and individual States willing to provide practical help to Albania to organize assistance in a secure environment .  Thus a notable improvement in the situation in the country was brought about in a short period of time , restoring confidence in national prospects .  
Taking into account the substantial quantitative and qualitative differences between the needs of individual countries , his Government had felt that separate programmes for humanitarian assistance and assistance with recovery and development should be implemented for each country , rather than administered by a supranational structure established within the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States for the distribution or redistribution of humanitarian and other forms of assistance .  
The Committee shall comprise [ government representatives ] [ persons nominated by governments , acting in their individual capacity ] who are experts [ in social , economic , legal , technical , scientific and technological , and / or environmental fields ] [ with relevant knowledge ] in the field of the Convention . [ one ] [ two ] [ three ] years based on equitable geographical distribution [ and the principle of rotation ] [ other arrangement . . . . ] .  
They agreed that old stereotypes of seniors as dependent should be abandoned , and they discussed how to promote the active ageing of their older citizens with due regard to their individual choices and circumstances , including removing disincentives to labour force participation and lowering barriers to flexible and part-time employment that exist in some countries .  
National reports on the implementation of Agenda 21 have proved to be a valuable means of sharing information at the international and regional levels and , even more important , of providing a focus for the coordination of issues related to sustainable development at the national level within individual countries .  
Rather , we are appealing to the conscience of the continent , as well as to individual consciences , asking that these acts of violence not be repeated , that the truth be known , that justice prevail , that the human person be respected and that the United Nations and the non-governmental organizations be permitted to work under the protection of full respect for international humanitarian law .  
As indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on sources for the financing of development ( see A / 52 / 399 ) , there has been a shift in the composition of financial flows to developing countries from public to private sector sources , with the latter now accounting for an overwhelming share of the total ( albeit not for all individual countries ) .  This situation is unlikely to be reversed in the foreseeable future .  
The Secretary-General had , in his previous report ( A / 50 / 480 ) , suggested that themes be selected in the light of the principal objectives of the dialogue ; that is , to promote broader and deeper understanding of issues of a global or transboundary nature that cut across individual , regional or group interests .  
Whereas during the armed rebellion and aggression against Croatia many criminal acts , grave breaches of international humanitarian law and of the basic rights of the individual were committed ,  
Instead , it had institutionalized the peaceful settlement of disputes through the establishment of a Permanent Court of Arbitration and , in case of armed conflict , had imposed certain limits and duties on the parties at war , down to the level of the individual , in the first genuine attempt by the international community to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war .  
The Assembly welcomed the proposed measures outlined by the Government of Cambodia in its comments5 on the report of the Special Representative , to ensure that the forthcoming communal and national elections were free and fair , that members of the armed forces remained neutral during the election campaign , that the individual vote was confidential and that local and international observers were welcomed .  
Resources that should be expended on providing a better life for present and future generations are being wasted on war machines and on vain efforts to acquire elusive military security on an individual national basis , instead of reliance on and pursuit of collective security .  
Emphasizing the need for accurate , objective and comprehensive information , as well as for a wide exchange of experiences and lessons learned by individual countries in protecting and promoting the rights and welfare of women migrant workers for policy formulation and joint action ,  
Urges concerned Governments , particularly those of sending and receiving countries , to strengthen their national efforts to protect and promote the rights and welfare of women migrant workers through sustained bilateral , regional , interregional and international cooperation , including by developing strategies and joint action , and taking into account innovative approaches and experiences of individual Member States ;  
Even recent advances in the scientific understanding of these complex events leave much to speculation or , at best , any systematic patterns observed may be highly opportunistic to specific events or individual examples .  
Unless national and local capabilities for basic early warning functions are improved within individual countries , external enhancements in hazard forecasting and telecommunications will not necessarily lead to successful mitigation practices .  
Emphasizes the right to education as a human right , and calls upon States to make education accessible to children with special educational needs in a manner conducive to the child 's achieving the fullest possible social integration and individual development , and to adopt an integrated approach to providing adequate support and appropriate education for such children ;  
Though we fully realize that peace and security , as well as stability , in the region of the Middle East will be achieved only when a comprehensive , just and lasting settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict in all its dimensions is attained , it is essential to create the necessary climate and security conditions based on equal security for all , security at the lowest level of armament , and security that would not allow for the military superiority of any individual party .  
Another delegation , speaking on behalf of a large group , suggested that the Task Force consider that the role of United Nations information centres should be more focused on the issues relevant to individual countries , that they should have sufficient resources to carry out their main tasks , and that they should be integrated where appropriate and beneficial .  
Another delegation , speaking on behalf of a large group , suggested that the Task Force consider that the role of United Nations information centres should be more focused on the issues relevant to individual countries , that they should have sufficient resources to carry out their main tasks , and that they should be integrated where appropriate and beneficial .  
First , humanitarian law had a more limited objective than did human rights law , since it was applicable solely in situations of armed conflict and , without seeking to improve society , sought to protect the life , dignity and physical integrity of the individual against violence and arbitrary behaviour .  
Emphasizes the right to education as a human right , and calls upon States to make education accessible to children with special educational needs in a manner conducive to the child 's achieving the fullest possible social integration and individual development , and to adopt an integrated approach to providing adequate support and appropriate education for such children ;  
Treaty bodies were encouraged to appoint individual members to liaise with specialized agencies or other intergovernmental bodies of most relevance to their respective mandate and to invite representatives of international financial institutions and other international and multilateral and development institutions to present to them an analysis of the impact of their activities on women 's enjoyment of economic and social rights in the light of international standards in general , and in relation to particular States .  
Underlying these responses are three basic premises : first , that orderly and planned migration can be a positive force for social and economic development ; secondly , that the long-term manageability of international migration hinges on making the option to remain in one 's country a viable one for all peoples ; and thirdly , that isolated action , whether by an individual State or by a group , can not effectively address what is today a global phenomenon in an interdependent world .  
While acknowledging that the various working groups within the Organization were dealing with individual aspects of this problem , the sponsor noted that they were doing so in a context and manner which were primarily political and operational in nature , whereas the Special Committee , being a body with highly qualified legal expertise , was best suited for dealing with the mere legal aspects of the matter , which were the subject of the proposed declaration .  
The annex makes reference to the identification by the Panel of numerous practical disadvantages to independent audits and management reviews by individual Member States and to the fact that the Financial Regulations of the United Nations stipulate that the external auditors appointed by the organizations ' governing bodies are solely responsible for the conduct of audits .  
This will be possible only if the Organization becomes better able to fulfil its basic tasks the maintenance of international peace and security and comprehensive economic and social development , particularly in developing countries and to ensure broad respect for the promotion and protection of individual and collective human rights . 
Respect for human rights is achieved not only through the functioning of instruments to monitor compliance with international treaties but also through political , social and economic measures that allow human rights to become an integral part of social development and a part of the everyday life of each individual .  
The experience gained from the functioning of these two ad hoc tribunals has paved the way for the wider acceptance of the idea of an international criminal court , thus creating a firm legal basis at the universal level for the establishment of individual criminal responsibility with regard to war crimes and crimes against humanity .  
They have also stressed that such sanctions should not be based merely on political expediency , but rather should be firmly based on international law ; that they should be implemented according to the principles of justice and international law ; that they should not serve individual or factional interests ; that in their implementation , consideration should be given to the human suffering that they cause ; and that a time limit should be set for their lifting .  
Each must agree to subordinate its individual decision and discretion to a global political will , manifested through truly democratic and representative organs of the United Nations , reflecting the authentic judgement of the world community of States .  
International cooperation and the benefits that are drawn from it , whether through bilateral or multilateral means , can not be a substitute for what individual countries must do to ensure that sustainable development is achieved and economic growth is realized .  
And yet in my country , which today is in the grip of civil war , almost everything has been done since the sovereign national conference to spare our young democracy from the tragic upheavals inherent in any sudden social change , which in this case consisted of the move from a single-party political regime banning any organized opposition to a veritable explosion of freedoms individual , political and religious .  
In this era of accelerating change in so many areas in every portion of our diverse global community , it is of singular importance to the well-being of each of our individual national communities , as it is for the overall international global community , that we recognize , observe and be faithful to those values and principles which , inherently , are unchanging .  
Not only do basic health and education produce invaluable individual and social benefits , both are essential for sustainable economic development and constitute an investment in people \ x { e5b8 } hope for the future .  
This has preserved and duly protected the right of legitimate defence , both individual and collective , provided for in Article 51 of the Charter a right that my country believes is one of the pillars underlying international coexistence and a guarantee for the respect of the territorial integrity of States .  
In this regard , the Habitat Agenda contains numerous suggestions for action , such as ensuring legal protection from discrimination in access to shelter and basic services ; helping the family in its supporting , educating and nurturing roles ; and encouraging social and economic policies that are designed to meet the housing needs of families and their individual members .  
Such challenges include the weakening of family ties due partially to spatial mobility ; gradual shifting away from extended to nuclear and more flexible family forms ; an increasing emphasis on individual rather than communitarian social values ; and a redefining of the traditional roles and expectations of individual family members , particularly those of women as caregivers , towards more egalitarian and task-sharing partnerships within the family .  
But the individual and collective efforts of small island developing States have so far made little or no real impact on the magnitude of the problems facing them , including the more frequent occurrence of hurricanes , storm surges and coastal inundation , and the resulting loss of valuable economic resources and marine biodiversity stocks .  
Policy will in future need to give more attention to improving individual choice and flexibility : to allowing people to continue to work when they wish or need to do so , while encouraging those who can retire earlier to take up socially productive activities , remunerated or not , part-time or casual , as appropriate , and to create the conditions for this broader recognition of work and employment .  
Thus , adopting an integrated treatment of the bases of economic growth , by not only ensuring macroeconomic balance and stability but also directing attention to the industrial base and incentive structures , may do much to enhance the viability of policies that address the environmental and social aspects of sustainable development in individual countries .  
The risk to an individual or to a coherent group of individuals should be limited to a maximum tolerable level above which risks are considered unacceptable except in extraordinary circumstances such as saving life .  
To deny , in countries that do not already do so , the tax deductibility of bribes paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a State to any public official or elected representative of another country and , to that end , to examine their respective modalities for doing so ;  
Policies for promoting domestic resources mobilization should include macroeconomic and structural reforms , public expenditure reforms , the promotion of environmental taxes and charges , a review of existing subsidy policies , and financial sector development to promote personal saving and access to credit , taking into account the characteristics and capabilities of individual countries .  
Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action and , at the same time , cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions , societies and economies , where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential ,  
Notes with appreciation the strengthened training programmes , inter alia , people management training , upgrading of substantive skills , information technology , communications and training in all six official languages on an equal basis , and requests the Secretary-General to continue to invest in the Organization 's future capacity by sustaining and expanding these programmes in order to meet organizational needs and individual career development aspirations ;

Regretting the human rights violations , both individual and collective , the marginalization and discrimination suffered by the indigenous populations in Guatemala , together with the continued deterioration of the economic and social situation , with its serious consequences for the great majority of the population , particularly for the indigenous peoples of Guatemala and the most vulnerable sectors of Guatemalan society ,  
Calls upon individual donor countries , international organizations and non _ governmental organizations to incorporate human rights principles and objectives into the humanitarian and development work they carry out in Somalia and to cooperate with the independent expert ;  
The approach represents the satellite as a combination of individual elements and positions these to provide maximum protection to the satellite components .  [ 29 ] The PLATFORM model uses a novel element termed SHIELD [ 30 ] which uses genetic algorithms to determine the optimal configuration of a spacecraft based on the encountered environment and design constraints such as thermal and mass balancing .  
Since those rules were of a technical nature , they did not require any further clarification ; however , Committee members were free to comment on them , either during the forthcoming discussion or in the observations of individual States , which the Commission and its Special Rapporteur awaited with interest .  16 .  Article 27 , which was the last provision of the draft articles , had been included at a late stage and the decision as to its placement in the text had been left for the second reading .  
Calls upon individual donor countries , international organizations and non _ governmental organizations to incorporate human rights principles and objectives into the humanitarian and development work they carry out in Somalia and to cooperate with the independent expert ;  
As yet , however , no clear legal guidelines have been established for determining which individual instances may be considered at the international level without the assent of the State concerned ( in the light of the above ) .  
In addition , the declaration must without fail refer to the inseparable link between the responsibility of the State that the perpetrated gross and massive violations of human rights which can be classified as international crimes and the individual responsibility of persons participating in their perpetration .  
National reports on the implementation of Agenda 21 have proved to be a valuable means of sharing information at the international and regional levels and , even more important , of providing a focus for the coordination of issues related to sustainable development at the national level within individual countries .  
It is for the State and the international community to organize the political and legal framework needed to undertake , with any chance of success , the campaign against impunity for violations of economic , social or cultural rights , whether individual or collective .  
For the international community to be guilty of massive violations of collective and individual economic rights would be an utter aberration and the greatest contradiction developed within the United Nations system .  
These collective or communal rights are to individual economic , social and cultural rights what democracy and the rule of law are to civil and political rights .  
Any transaction for the transfer of wastes is a serious violation of the right to a healthy environment and , quite obviously , of the whole set of human rights , whether individual or collective , economic , social and cultural or civil and political .  
Although applying the procedures of an optional protocol would not give the Committee any jurisdictional authority , it would provide an opportunity through regular reports and individual communications to submit useful recommendations to the States parties and would make a major contribution to the campaign against impunity for violations of economic , social and cultural rights .  
In many cases , those responsible for violations of economic , social and cultural rights and of the collective rights with an economic content such as the right to development or the right to a healthy environment , are sometimes international entities applying policies which constitute veritable sources of large-scale and serious violations of collective and individual rights in the countries with weak economies .  
The Seminar pointed out the fundamental contradiction between the increasing restrictions to individual mobility and the free flow of goods and services as encouraged by transnational corporations and international financial institutions .  
As of 30 June , the office of the Human Rights Ombudsperson had opened 1,692 provisional files , registered 713 cases , issued 10 final reports in individual cases and eight special reports ; 38 requests for interim measures have been successful , and 21 have not been implemented by the authorities . 
Recalling also that , in its resolution 40 / 61 of 9 December 1985 , the General Assembly stated that it was mindful of the necessity of maintaining and safeguarding the basic rights of the individual in accordance with the relevant human rights instruments and generally accepted international standards ,  
In addition to natural capital , physical or produced capital , and to the now widely accepted notion of human capital , social capital refers to the functioning of the various institutions that are critical to individual welfare and social integration .  
The Sub _ Commission recognizes the efforts of the Government of Guatemala and urges it to continue with its policy of implementing measures for the protection and promotion of both individual and collective human rights and fundamental freedoms ; to continue to take practical measures against poverty and to eradicate extreme poverty in order to raise the living standards of the population ; and to redouble the efforts already instituted to overcome the marginalization and discrimination to which the indigenous peoples of Guatemala have been , and continue to be subjected .  
A common vision had developed that sound financial and economic policies , including development of human resources and respect for human rights , good governance , individual initiative and the private sector , were critical to creating an environment conducive to economic growth , environmental sustainability and social equity .  
Lastly , he endorsed the view expressed in paragraph 51 of the report that limiting the exposure of middle-income countries to the more volatile forms of finance before their economies were ready and maintaining the confidence of international financial investors was central to avoiding new crises , and that while individual countries had a central responsibility in that regard , the international community was also undertaking to play a greater role . 
The few cases where licences have been granted to supply certain drugs , under the sponsorship of the International Committee of the Red Cross or a diplomatic mission , have been handled on an individual basis , and not for the whole shipment but for partial shipments , after a complex and lengthy process lasting on average about seven months , which has discouraged the initiative of some organizations that were planning to donate medicine to Cuban hospitals . 
The civil society , including those involved in its political , economic , social and cultural life , needs to be fully engaged to promote democratic principles and harmony between the society , the individual and the environment as a basis for a culture of peace .  
The Inter _ American Court of Human Rights , for example , in a ground _ breaking ruling , found that amnesty for the perpetrators of serious human rights violations was incompatible with the right of every individual to a fair hearing before an impartial and independent court .  
Although such measures may be imposed not only by individual States , but also by a group of States , the determination or judgement of alleged wrongful or objectionable policies of target States subject to coercive economic measures is made by sender State ( s ) largely on a unilateral or narrow-group basis .  
As the first comprehensive international proclamation of the basic rights of the individual , it established a common understanding of human rights for mankind .  
UNPF implemented a complicated and time-consuming exercise of converting multiple inventory databases , supported by individual asset managers , into a single , unified mission-wide inventory database based on the REALITY systems fixed assets module .  
Education should enable the individual to live and work in a free society , and should promote mutual understanding , tolerance and friendship among peoples and racial , ethnic and religious groups .  
In contrast , many problems in the economic , social and cultural rights domain are systemic in nature and better suited to a review resulting in broad recommendations , rather than narrow findings of fault in individual circumstances .  
A volunteer assignment compact , administered in a quick , decentralized manner , providing individual volunteers with more choice and flexibility by monetizing travel and terminal expenses , unaccompanied shipment costs and home-leave entitlements ;  
While the latter issue affects any participating individual and community , indigenous populations arguably have minimal access to the legal advice and political power necessary to secure an outcome satisfactory to them .  
In the efforts to find a fair and effective solution to the external debt crisis , a differential approach , based on the special problems of each individual State , should be applied .  
There is , however , a need to transform these clusters into local / regional growth poles reaping the benefits of both physical proximity and networking , thus raising their competitiveness at both the individual firm and systemic level .  
In view of the confirmed role of hemispheric partnership as essential to the welfare of our people and to strengthening a system of individual freedom and social justice based on respect for human rights within a framework of democratic institutions ,  
His Government supported the rights-based approach insofar as it implied that both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights were inherent to the individual or the collective rather than conferred by an act of welfare or charity .  
The Labour Code ( art . 116 ) sets out penalties for illegal abortion , indicating that illegal abortion carried out by an individual with an advanced medical degree is punishable by a fine equivalent to 50 to 100 times the minimum monthly wage .  
Illegal abortion carried out by an individual who does not have an advanced medical degree is punishable by a fine equivalent to 150 to 200 times the minimum monthly wage .  
Holders of special procedures mandates have refined their methods of work ; increased the frequency of their country visits ; initiated , in some cases , comprehensive comparative analytical studies ; and developed procedures for handling individual complaints .  
IMF undertakes a periodic review of global capital markets , and principles adopted in the BIS committees may be included by IMF in its surveillance of the financial sectors of individual developed and developing countries .  
Education must offer the individual the opportunity to live and work in a free society , and must foster mutual understanding , tolerance and friendship among peoples and racial , ethnic and religious groups .  
There is a need to transform these clusters into local / regional growth poles reaping the benefits of both physical proximity and networking , thus raising their competitiveness at both the individual firm and systemic level .  
Raising awareness and understanding , at the community and individual level , of the need to integrate externalities into economic reasoning , combining this with the sale of a non-traditional good , namely , certified tons of carbon reduced or sequestered ;  
Although the prime responsibility for the execution of regional programmes and projects rests with small island developing States Governments , in view of the meagre resources of individual small island developing States and the high costs of regional programmes there is an obvious need for adequate financial support from the international community for timely and effective implementation of regional programmes .

Food , shelter or any other basic material need of the individual can be satisfied through coercive means , including rationing , and economies can be prosperous in terms of investment , production and growth in a totalitarian political context .  
It is clearer than ever that unequal gender relations and wide gender gaps in social , economic , political and civic spheres do not just deny the individual rights of girls and women they reduce human capabilities as a whole .

Since the right to development has been recognized as a human right distinct from the individual civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , it is indeed necessary to consider a monitoring mechanism that is separate from the treaty bodies .  
Government , the business community and individual businesses should cooperate in their respective ways so that HRD policies use the role of the private sector as a motor for their implementation , bearing in mind the need for regulatory and institutional change to make training and HRD effective .  
The former instrument had required direct incorporation of the principle of individual responsibility into existing norms of international humanitarian law ; the Rules of Procedure and Evidence had rightly combined various traditional and procedural traditions .  
These developments have contributed to improving protection of individuals in all situations through , for example , the elaboration of the rules applicable in internal armed conflict , the establishment of individual criminal responsibility under international law for violations of laws applicable to all armed conflicts and the clarification of the conditions under which a State may be held responsible for acts by non-State entities .

The sixth and most important step , which will have an immediate , positive impact , is to direct greater investment and efforts towards increasing societal awareness of HIV / AIDS , and to create an international sense of responsibility at the individual level , with greater emphasis on decent behaviour and adherence to moral values and virtues .  
HIV / AIDS is now a classic , modern health issue , closely connected with individual and collective human behaviour , strongly influenced by broad social and economic forces and linked particularly closely to social discrimination .  
Three basic acts a law on medicine , a law on epidemiological safety , and governmental regulations ensure that every member of society , including people living with HIV / AIDS , is entitled to access to information and education on health ; that HIV testing of an individual is voluntary and confidential ; that an infected individual may work at any trade or profession ; and that antiretroviral therapy for people with HIV infection is available free , so far .
