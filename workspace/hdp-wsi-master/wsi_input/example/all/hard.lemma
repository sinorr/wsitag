Their ideological and political quality , work style , words and deeds have a direct bearing on the implementation of the party 's line , principles and policies in rural areas , on the reform , development and stability in rural areas , and on the relations between the party and the masses and between the cadres and the masses .

Wu Bangguo also urged the CWCE to work hard and turn itself into a work organ which is honest and diligent in performing its official duties , aims to attain tangible results with a high efficiency , and dares to forge ahead in a pioneering spirit ; and which is trusted by the central authorities and welcomed by enterprises .

These achievements are the results of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core taking charge of the overall situation and providing correct leadership , and the results of all levels throughout the country implementing the central policy decision on expanding domestic demand and the series of guidelines and policies , and working hard with concerted efforts .  
Only if all sectors devote great , genuine , and hard efforts in improving scientific management and extract efficiency , quality , and returns from management can they truly implement well the central guidelines , policies , and reform measures , and promote the healthy development of economic and social undertakings .  
Most comrades are now seizing time to study and work hard ; but , undeniably , there still exist many phenomena of not treasuring time : a lot of valuable time is wasted by overstaffing , buck-passing , mountains of documents , oceans of meetings , empty talk , platitudes , fault-finding , meaningless debate , blind decision-making , misguided and arbitrary command , absent-mindedness , doing nothing , extravagant living , and pleasure-seeking .  All this is truly painful to see and worrisome .  
Now , the vast majority of the rest of the poor are those living in remote areas which are hard to get to and lacking in resources and where the ecological environment is extremely bad .

For many years we have worked hard to put into practice Deng Xiaoping 's thinking of common prosperity .  Having gained a certain economic strength , we began to carry out the " project of common prosperity " and , relying mainly upon the financial departments at the city level for many consecutive years , raised funds totaling 1.88-billion yuan and put them into the relatively backward areas of the city in a bid to improve their infrastructure facilities , industrial layout , and cultural and educational conditions , thereby bringing about the coordinated development of various localities .  
We will certainly live up to the earnest expectations of the party 's central committee .  In accordance with the requirements of the " Three Represents , " we will strengthen the party building in a comprehensive way , lead the people of the entire city to summon up all their courage and energy , forge ahead in a pioneering spirit , and work hard to build Shenzhen into a socialist demonstration city bearing Chinese characteristics and taking the lead in basically realizing modernization .  
In particular , the eastern coastal areas should make efforts to establish the socialist market economy before other areas , realize the goal for the reform and development of the state-owned enterprises before other areas , complete the readjustment of the economic structure , and optimize and upgrade the industry before other areas , and realize basic agricultural modernization before other areas .  In short , they should work hard to realize modernization before other areas and make greater contribution to building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Thus , they are more liable to the impact of erroneous ideas and bad phenomena .  In addition , reserve officers and men are scattered over many areas and are engaged in the work of various professions and trades .

Meanwhile , we should also see that the satisfactory economic efficiency attained by state enterprises last year was closely linked with the policy support of the state , besides the hard efforts made by the enterprises .

All types of educational institutions at all levels and all educators in the country are shouldering a solemn mission .  They should have a fundamental aim of improving the quality of our nationals , give priority to cultivating the students ' innovativeness and practical abilities , and try hard to bring up developers of and successors to the socialist cause who achieve all-round moral , academic , physical , and artistic development .  
In view of such an understanding , we have specially stressed the point in our ideological and theoretical education that theory and practice are not of a relationship of simply fitting one into the other ; meanwhile , we have also taken special note to guide people to study and master a series of intermediate links in the process of transforming theory into reality , and guide people to consciously work hard for the materialization of such a transformation .  
Party members , especially leading cadres , must establish a correct world outlook , outlook on life and value , stress theoretical study , political awareness and good conduct , keep firmly in mind the party 's purpose , maintain close ties with the people , be clean and self-disciplined , oppose corruption , maintain the fine style of doing hard work , maintain a good spiritual state , and withstand the test of power , money and attractive women .

The Central Committee gives its full support to the Party 's basic line , continuing to uphold economic construction as the center , working hard to rectify the phenomenon of ' one hand rather hard , one hand rather soft ' , and strengthening ideological and political work and the building of the Party " .  
The United States and Russia have already taken the lead in paying equal attention to guarding against the soft damages from the information offensive weapons and the hard damages from the ammunition of precise guidance , rather than laying undue emphasis on guarding against hard damages to economic targets .  
As all types of economic targets are large in number and wide in scope ; are interrelated with one another ; and are under the control of different departments , some of which are also large in size ; are exposed to a large extent ; and are highly vulnerable owing to their state of production , operation , or utilization in peace time , it is difficult and costly to protect them .  Also it is unrealistic to protect them in an all-round way and hard to raise their protection efficiency .  
Accordingly , to adapt to the changing circumstances and promote the long-term dynamic stability in our international balance of payments , as well as safeguarding national economic security and the interests of foreign investors , we must concentrate hard on the key issue of improving the quality of utilization of foreign capital .

During the Gulf War , with their indomitable information superiority and firepower superiority , the multinational force headed by the United States carried out integrated strikes of soft interference and suppression and hard , substantive destruction against Iraq that were compound , consecutive and highly intensive .  This opened people 's eyes to not only the " remnants " of mechanized war but also the new features of informationized war .  
This successful exercise , with a landing operation as its backdrop , has showed clearly that the multidimensional combat ability of our army is being enhanced today , as it not only has the means to cope with hard offensives launched by the enemy with such high-tech weapons as cruise missile and armed helicopter ; but also has the right measures to counter soft assaults , such as network attacks , which base on high technologies means .  
In diligently studying and understanding this important exposition , we have the profound feeling that only by firmly grasping the key points of strengthening and improving ideological and political work and working hard to enhance " one feeling three qualities " can ideological and political work provide formidable impetus and guarantees for reform and opening up and modernization construction in an atmosphere of continuing innovation and expanding advances .  
We urge the mass media workers to feel proud of their lofty mission of safeguarding world peace , sow the seed of tolerance and friendliness among the people by means of their hard work every day , and make impartial and objective reports , especially reports on the religious situation in various countries , in order to promote mutual understanding among the people .

At the same time , he also pointed out a number of problems that were currently existing in the province 's press and propaganda work .  For example , the time effectiveness of the press work still remains poor , news coverage lacks a required depth , the contents of news reports tend to be identical , some newspapers have showed vulgar tastes , and a handful of publications have even failed to keep to a correct opinion orientation .  All these need to be overcome with hard efforts in the practical work in the future .  
With the ideological and political quality of the party rank and file and party cadres being enhanced , they will have a strong sense of fighting against corruption and keeping themselves clean and honest in performing official duties .  This will not only eliminate the root cause that engenders corruption , but will also make it hard for corrupt elements to cover up their malpractices .  
Third , cadre appointments must be based on the principle of incorruptibility .  Outstanding candidates selected through democratic procedures and proved to be honest and upright in their behavior by the assessment of the organization should be appointed to key positions without hesitation so that they may play a exemplary and guiding role in the cadre contingent and encourage all cadres to maintain the spirit of working hard in making progress .  
They should learn their lofty passion of fighting for the motherland , their fighting will for struggling persistently and their spiritual attainment of continuous pursuit .

To better prepare for military struggles , all the company 's officers and men have focused their attention on the magic of science and technology .  With the assistance of their superiors and scientific research departments , they have worked hard and searched for countermeasures to overcome problems , and ultimately developed the simulated ship-based missile launch platform .  This has solved missile launchers ' difficulty in taking aim and launching missiles because of the disturbance by winds and waves while working on the sea , and formulated a complete set of methods for combat and training .

With regard to strengthening mutual trust and cooperation in the military sphere , although Sergeyev 's visit has avoided another storm arising in bilateral military cooperation ties on account of the espionage affair , the hard ice that has long formed between the two countries can hardly undergo a complete thaw in one or two visits , and " a still more difficult path lies ahead . "  
In the past decade , with the implementation of President Jiang Zemin 's instruction on " working hard to build revolutionized , modernized and regularized anti-chemical warfare units , " our country 's anti-chemical warfare units have basically formed a new fighting system marked by the new generation of " ordinance for anti-chemical warfare " and has achieved significant progress in solving major and difficult problems .  Our country has in the main formed a new type of anti-chemical warfare training system with a new generation of training program .  
Upon receiving orders , the anti-chemical warfare battalion of a group army under the Lanzhou Military Region immediately took part in rescue work .

It has been only 80 years since the time the first socialist state was founded , so most socialist states have a history of 40 or 50 years , which places them at the initial development stage .  Their economic , political , and social working mechanisms have not been completely developed and established , they still strive hard exploring how to fully develop the advantages of socialism .  
Showing the entire process of the operation of Air Force radar units , including rapid deployment , line erection , combat warning , rush repairs , and troop withdrawal , this war game , which was close to actual combat , served to display the high mobility of our radar units in the face of the " soft " and " hard " antipersonnel forces of the " enemy " under actual-combat conditions , as well as their capabilities to accurately and rapidly discover and handle enemy movements .

However , the developed countries in the West tried hard to dominate and control the globalization process and attempted to establish an international economic order more favorable to themselves .  On the other hand , the vast number of developing countries are facing various risks and stern challenges to their economic security and economic sovereignty .  Interference and anti-interference , Control and anti-control has become a prominent characteristic of the current international political contradictions and struggle .  
This is a hard battle and a declaration of an all-out war against the dark and evil forces .  It is also a vigorous test for the public security organs : in order to crack down , first the problem has to be faced squarely , the " protective umbrella " for the dark and evil forces has to be uncovered , and the intertwining network of connections has to be destroyed ;  
Under the leadership of local party committee and government and with the support of the broad masses of the people , public security organs at various places have carried forward the spirit of brave fight and persistent battle , hit hard , moved toward a good beginning of the special target struggle on " hitting the mob and eliminating devils , " and obtained preliminary results .

The local planning , finance , agricultural , supervision , audit , grain , statistical , and quality and technological supervision departments and branches of the Agricultural Development Bank and branches of the Central Grain Reserve Company and other departments and units must take a step further to strengthen cooperation and coordination , give full play to their respective functions and roles , and work hard to make sure that proper personnel are assigned , that the work is done , and that the responsibilities are fulfilled .  
The overall quality of the main bodies of our rural markets does not measure up to that in developed western countries .  Many peasants and farm enterprises not only do not understand international agricultural trade , but also have little knowledge about the domestic market situations involving agricultural products and agricultural key elements .  It will be hard for them to participate in a timely and effective way in vigorous international market competition after our entry in the WTO .  
At the current human rights meeting , the United States once again groundlessly attacked China , set forth an anti-China motion , and provoked confrontation .  To retort , Ambassador Qiao Zonghuai pointed out in all seriousness that the United States was keen to dish out human rights motions against other countries , wantonly attacked other countries ' political systems by flaunting the banner of " safeguarding human rights , " tried hard to turn human rights issues into political issues for achieving its political purpose of exerting pressure onto other countries .

We must and hard on the proper grouping of labor-intensive , capital-intensive , technology-intensive , and knowledge-intensive industries .  On the one hand , we must raise the technological standard of all sectors in the national economy , and on the other hand , we must create more jobs to enable massive shift of the agricultural population to the nonagricultural sectors .  
The vast number of trade union cadres should step up investigation and study , work hard to keep abreast , in a timely manner , of the actual conditions of the workers and staff members in difficulty in their localities and units , report them realistically to the party and government authorities , and enthusiastically cooperate with the party , government , and departments concerned to help resolve their practical difficulties and problems .  
If we are unable to achieve breakthroughs in the progress of agricultural science and technology , it will be hard to enhance the comprehensive productive forces in agriculture and agricultural competitiveness , and it will then be hard to meet the demands of all-round building of a comfortably well-off living standard .  
Finally , he pointed out : In the new century , the vast areas inhabited by minority ethnical groups will be facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges , the strategy for the great development of the west will promote economic development in these areas .  The entire people of all ethnical groups throughout the country should be full of confidence , continuously advance the cause of ethnic unity and progress in our country , and work hard for the comprehensive regeneration of the Chinese nation .  
Tsai stressed : We have examined measures or mapped out plans for opening up exchanges between the two shores by taking account of our national security and with such goodwill as working hard to improve relations or pushing forward interaction between the two shores , all of which have reserved broad space for further opening up after the two shores resume dialogues with each other , and this principle has also determined a mode for our government to examine or work out more measures for opening up in future . 
The century of striving by the Chinese nation in making consistent efforts to become stronger , working hard for national prosperity , resisting foreign bullying , and upholding unification has written a moving and tragic but glorious chapter , and laid the foundation for China 's development ; it shines through the ages , and all Chinese should be proud of it .  
He has even advocated the " two-state theory " in disguised form .  This has not only made cross-strait relations more complicated and perilous , but also created chaotic political and economic situations on the island , thereby thwarting the aspirations of the broad masses of Taiwan compatriots for peace , stability , and development .  These perverse acts have met with hard blows given by Chinese at home and abroad , including alumni of Huangpu Military Academy .  
It is necessary to vigorously work hard at ecological environment protection and construction , with the focus on closing the hillsides to grow trees , returning farmland to forest and pasture , and preventing the formation of stone deserts in stony mountain areas ; we must persist in seeking truth from facts , act in light of local conditions , and make active and steady progress .  
First , give priority to preventing , cracking down hard , and punishing corruption in the antigraft , discipline inspection , procuratorate , supervisory , court , auditing , judicial , customs , public security , armed police , and army systems ; since these are state dictatorship organs , on the one hand the state has to ensure that they " eat imperial grain , " and on the other hand the state demands that they must fairly enforce the law and ensure honest government .  This is the precondition for opposing corruption in China .  
I suggest that while stepping up in-depth or meticulous education or transformation work , the government should hold higher the law as a sharp sword ; should more severely crack down on a small number of die-hard elements of " Falungong , " who have plotted or organized activities intended to create a disturbance ; and should firmly prevent such people from fanning the flames of disorder or sabotaging a situation of stability and unity , which we have built with hard efforts .  
After the self-immolation incident occurred , the entire nation expressed its extreme anger at the inhumane crimes of the " Falungong " cult , which are disastrous to the nation and its people .  The masses reacted with anger in many ways against the " Falungong " cult , calling for the government to strike out hard against the cult to protect social stability .  
We should further intensify comprehensive management of public order , crack down hard on various criminal activities in accordance with the law , and wage a special struggle against " triads and evil forces , " with the focus on homicide , explosion , and gun-related grave violence crimes and gang crimes , as well as serious economic crimes .  
Writers participating in the forum appealed to the vast number of writers and literary workers in all parts of the country to swing into action , further recognize the essence of the evil cult and its serious harm to society , work hard to create literary works in support of the on-going major struggle , vividly expose and castigate the sinister feature of Falungong for the broad masses , educate the people and make them recognize the cult feature of Falungong , and make due contributions to the struggle against the cult .  
- - Comprehensively promoting the strategy of " boosting Shandong with science and education , " sticking to the principle of quality education , leading scientific and technical innovation , and industrialization of hi-tech .  Shandong should work hard to attain a new leap in science , technology , and education , and realize the shift of relying on scientific and technological progress and improving the quality of laborers to boost economic construction .  
The resultant good performance often conceals some stark marketing realities and lowers the businesses ' guard .  The operators would find it very hard to keep a cool head to ponder over existing inadequacies and hidden perils .  This is very detrimental to the long-term , lasting development of these businesses .  
The broad masses of transferred military cadres , on the other hand , should preserve and carry forward the fine tradition of the people 's army , serve the interests of the whole , support the reform program , and show understanding and sympathy for the difficulties experienced by the state and local authorities in trying to settle them .  They should take the initiative to obey the arrangements made by the organization and work hard at their new posts to make fresh contributions to the cause of socialist modernization .  
The party and state 's ample rewards to scientific and technological personnel and the hard working and enterprising spirit of the awarded scientists will certainly and utterly inspire the national pride and self-confidence of numerous scientific and technological workers as well as the people throughout the country .  This will also encourage the vast numbers of scientific and technological workers to blaze new trials , initiate undertakings , scale the scientific heights of the world , overcome new challenges , and win a new victory .  
Luo Gan said : Over the past year , the procuratorial organs throughout the country conscientiously studied and worked hard to practice General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents , " continued to set strict demands on their work and the performance of their law enforcement duties , and obviously enhanced the level of fairness in law enforcement and improved the social image of the procuratorial personnel . 
In the new situation and in face of new challenges , we should have a firm grip of the party 's basic line of taking economic construction as a center , seize chances , quicken the tempo of development , exert ourselves to make the country prosperous , and immerse ourselves into hard work .  Only by so doing will we be able to narrow our gap with developed countries .  
We must persistently strive to meet the requirements of the " three represents " and without wavering carry forward the party 's fine tradition and work style .  We must do a better job in carrying forward our party 's work style of seeking truth from facts , integrating theory with practice , establishing close ties with the people , carrying out criticism and self-criticism , being modest and prudent , guarding against arrogance and rashness , and working hard .  
This was the case especially during the " 96-2 " exercise , which was staged under clear-cut stress involving units from different services and arms .  The exercise was directed by the leaders of the Central Military Commission in person , who worked in the forefront , and despite more stringent requirements and arduous and pressing tasks , the base organized officers and men to work hard in face of difficulties and by demonstrating superb fighting capacity , fully fulfilled its tasks in the end .  
After the deputies finished talking , Hu Jintao said : As result of the strong leadership of the party Central Committee and the energetic support of people across the country , as well as the guidance of the Tibet autonomous region party committee and government , people of all ethnic groups have worked hard and basically achieved the goals which the Central Committee 's third forum set for projects to be accomplished in Tibet in the year 2000 .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out : To implement the strategy for the extensive development of the west country , it not only requires plain living and hard struggle on the part of the broad ranks of cadres and masses in the west country over a long period of time , but also calls for energetic support from the people of the whole nation , especially of the eastern regions .  
We should strive to maintain social stability by intensifying our efforts at the comprehensive improvement of public order in the urban and rural areas and strike hard at gangster forces and all kinds of unlawful practices and crimes .  
To make development , it is necessary to further break through various institutional and functional obstacles through reforms and further emancipate the productive forces and arouse the people 's initiative and creativity and stimulate the dynamism of our society .  Without reform , it would be hard to further advance economic development and structural readjustments .  
He pointed out : Generally speaking , the living conditions of the people in our country have been greatly improved and have reached the level of being comparatively well-off .  However , due to various factors , the living conditions of the masses in some areas have been improved at a relatively slow speed , a small number of people among urban and rural residents are still facing more difficulties in their livelihood .  Some people even find it hard to get sufficient food .  
In his speech , Deputy Wang Ke said : In doing the PLA 's logistic work , we must take the initiative to serve the needs of overall national economic construction .  At all times , we must maintain our fine traditions of hard struggle and building the army through diligence and thrift and must make a real effort to successfully manage and make good use of our limited money .  
and great achievements have been made in the construction of socialist material civilization and spiritual civilization .  This is a result of the efforts that Sichuan and Yunnan provincial party committees and provincial governments have made in leading the broad ranks of cadres and masses all over the two provinces to work hard , but live plainly , and forge ahead in a pioneering and enterprising spirit .  
Speaking on building stronger contingents of procuratorial personnel and improving their competency and law enforcing efficiency , Han Zhubin said : The National Procuratorial College , during the course of studying and implementing the important " three represents " thinking and working hard to improve the political awareness and professional competency of procuratorial personnel , trained more than 200 procuratorial officers before they were promoted to serve as chief procurators .  By the end of the year , local procuratorates also had trained one-third of their procuratorial officers on a rotational basis .  
Competition in the aspect of agricultural development comes more often from the foreign market than from the domestic market .  As far as hundreds of millions of peasants are concerned , it is rather difficult to increase their incomes by simply relying on growing crops .  Having insufficient stamina , township enterprises , which flourished some years ago , find it hard to become a major channel for increasing peasants ' incomes in a short period of time .  
During the Tenth Five-Year Plan , the city of Lhasa will take advantage of the construction of the Tibetan railroad to speed up the readjustment of the industrial structure , actively develop new products that have a special plateau flavor and are sought after on the market , and will work hard to try to make its way into markets outside the autonomous region .  It will enhance the vitality of the local economy and achieve leapfrog-style social and economic development . "  
Judged from what has been reflected by the grassroots , right now there are too many inspections , conferences , social etiquette , and functions of all kinds , and they are very time-consuming and high-class .  Consequently , huge manpower and material resources have been wasted .  All levels of leading cadres , who find it hard to cope with , have poured out endless grievances .  
should firmly and unremittingly tackle problems like impure thinking or erroneous styles among personnel concerned ; and should attach great importance to professional training for judges or procurators at the grassroots level by ensuring the greatest support for them in this regard , and by choosing and assigning the best teachers for them as well .  In order to heighten overall quality of judges or procurators , we must work hard for several years to come .  
They pointed out : The key to building a contingent of highly qualified personnel for political and legal work lies in personnel .  We must firmly control entry and ensure smooth exit and must work hard to build a contingent of clean and honest personnel known for a firm political stand , professional proficiency , a fine style , and moral integrity .  
At the same time , we will rely on our own efforts , work hard and perseveringly , combine our own efforts with the solicitude of the central authorities and the support of people across the country ; we will emancipate our minds , adopt new ideas , and accelerate economic and social development in Tibet through ideological , scientific , technological , and institutional innovations .  
Under the conditions of reform , opening up , and developing the market economy , party cadres must make greater effort to build up their party spirit , adopt a correct attitude toward power , position , interests , have the ability to resist the corrosive influence of various decadent ideas , and set a good example in working hard , living thriftily , and performing official duties honestly and uncorruptly .  
In Hebei Province , the provincial government has explicitly demanded that the collection of taxes and fees still owed by peasants from the year before be suspended temporarily .  Peasant households whose incomes dropped substantially for the year were allowed to pay less common retained funds or were exempt from paying them at all .  In places like Zhangjiakou and Chengde , which were hard hit by the drought , the amount of common retained funds collected fell 30-40 percent .  
They should take supporting the large-scale development of the western region as an important way to increase their fighting capacity and cultivate their militant style of enduring hardships and daring to fight a hard battle and promote army building in an all-round way by providing aid to local people in carrying out urgent , difficult , dangerous , or important tasks .  2 .

This has included drafting and enacting new legislation ; selecting a strong team of financial institutions to prepare , manage and underwrite the Share Offer ; and developing a comprehensive advertising campaign , which starts tomorrow .  You have probably noticed some of the material already ; and we will preview the rest shortly .  
" After four years of hard work in deliberating various medical , legal and ethical issues in relation to RT , the PCRT has finished its discussion on the regulatory framework for RT and several major ethical issues , and has put forward its recommendations to the Government .

These hard earned advantages , together with our sound legal system , our advanced telecommunications and other infrastructure facilities , our small and efficient government , and our strength as an international financial centre with a freely convertible currency , should enable Hong Kong companies to secure a significant share of the liberalised trade following China 's WTO accession . "  
" Even though the tenancy between the single operators and the licensees is a commercial matter between the two , the Housing Authority has , in the light of the experience in the 1998 rent re-assessment , considered that it could take a more proactive approach to ensure that the rent reductions granted to the single operators after the rent re-assessment would be passed on to the licensees in full .  This would help the licensees through the current economic hard times , " Ms Chung said in her letter .

First , the student must complete the same course load as a university science or engineering student within four years , on top of receiving specialized training in one of four areas : flying , air mechanics , communications or air defense tactics .

For me and many other overseas Chinese living here , Taipei is such a distant place that it 's hard to sense what it must be like , how it 's changed from quiet and tranquility to bustling crowds and prosperity .

Moreover , Hong Kong has become an international free port in the last twenty years and a financial center .

Q : It is hard to escape the conclusion that in the past the government 's attitude toward the protection of foreign intellectual property rights has been " whether or not this is beneficial for us or harmful for us . " But this time Premier Hau Peitsun clearly stated that infringement of intellectual property rights is a kind of theft - - the perspective is already shifting from " gain or loss " to " right and wrong . "  
Kuo Li-hsin , a lecturer in the Department of Broadcasting and Television of National Chengchih University , argues that at this point it 's hard to say what negative or positive value it will have , but if the audience is just satisfied with this outlet , and abandons normal channels of political participation , such as lowering willingness to vote , then " this might not be such a good thing for political participation itself , " he points out , raising an alternate possibility .  
Having seen his friend die with his own eyes , Chiang was grief stricken , but that very afternoon he still had to fly over the presidential offices and form a perfect " 60 " in the blue sky to celebrate the country 's 60th anniversary .

It is said that when some companies have formed alliances with foreign enterprises , even the plans produced by the partners have been so hard to get to grips with that the contract documents are just left to drafted by the opposite parties before they are signed . The result is that , if later on it is discovered that the technological exchange or financial conditions have not been met as planned , then it is too late to escape .  
So many years later , my memories of duck herding are faint , but a few scenes often come to mind - - sleeping at night on a hard pile of rice straw , the chirping of crickets , a pleasant cool feeling . . . or at night when ducks and people were asleep , and only the insects disturbed the peace .  
Vuu Khai Thanh , initiator of what was then the Binhtien Imex Cooperative Society , relied on hard work and struggle , and the advantages of distributing low-priced goods with insignificant labor costs to Southeast Asia . In 1989 , he received the first license to be issued by the government permitting a private enterprise to engage in direct foreign trade . It was only this that landed him the opportunity to leave the country for an observation tour and go to Taiwan to find technological and management partners , thus speeding up the expansion of the business .  
Two months ago a Canadian artist , J . Fenwick Lansdowne , held an exhibition in Taiwan on the theme of Chinese rare birds . His lively and fine depictions of Chinese birds and their habitats has led many people , including some ecologists , to exclaim : " The Chinese have not been good at giving realistic renderings of birds and their habitats , which is something they should strive hard to do in the future . "  
Realism easy - - art from life hard : Today native culture is increasingly receiving more attention , and people are concerned about indigenous bird species . In science , great emphasis is placed on exact breeds and species , and painters strive to portray Mikado pheasants or other precise species of birds . What must be aspired to in painting birds , apart from aesthetic enjoyment , must still be to let spectators understand birds at a glance . The challenge for artists is very great . "  
And on sweltering summer days , people gather here to enjoy the cool shade . True , when that hard and cold cement road was paved just beyond the reach of its roots , it was a little uncomfortable , but for the most part it had nothing much to complain about . Enjoying largely mild weather , it has dug its roots deep and firm .  
Plants are 90 percent water , and a thriving 100-year-old tree needs to replace close to half a metric ton of water lost to evaporation every day . Without an unending supply of water , a tree will be hard pressed to grow big .  
There are fewer and fewer kids coming along each year now : Two years ago the school still counted 37 heads , with 24 remaining last year , and only an even dozen this year . It 's hard to run a school without students : Leaving aside for a moment the question of economic efficiency , in terms of the quality of instruction , what impact does the small number of students have on learning ?  
This is what makes it possible to read / write such resounding symphonies of overt and covert complex meaning and humor not only into poetry and fiction , which make use of " abstract " expressive techniques such as form and sound or people and events ( whose meaning is so hard to clearly define ) , but even into works of literary criticism .  
On the heels of economic reform , the mainland has been pushing hard to increase its foreign exchange , and so the Pu'er tea grown in Yunnan , where most production is centered , has gradually become familiar to Westerners . Tuo tea , a variety of Pu'er whose cakes are shaped like bowls , won gold medals two years running in contests held in Spain and Germany .  
In order to gain a more prosperous future , Buhe applied at his research institute last September for a sabbatical leave of one year . He is looking into starting a partnership with his friend exporting steel , hoping to make a little extra money to secure his future life . Naturally , because of the toils of hard work , he has not had time to practice his music .  
The famous fishballs and " iron eggs " ( eggs boiled in diluted soy sauce until small and hard ) attracted many customers , and the exhibits , books , magazines and other records of Tanshui 's history opened a window on the town 's past . The You Theater put on local opera performances in the streets , and to watch figures being blown from hot malt sugar was mouth-watering fun for adults and children alike . . . .  
For those cities and counties with less developed economies , or with severe population outflow , the redistribution of funds is of course the best possible plan . But the money is not there just for the asking . Often expenses that are considered vital at the local level are not seen as such by the center . Sometimes the funds are given with so many restrictions as to how they might be spent that it is hard for the local government to put them to use .  
Such is the case with Chinpao Shan 's Tsao Ji-chang , who makes his complex very clear . " Most mainlanders have a wily nature : great at talking , loving to argue but not liking hard work ; they are very suitable for thinking up ideas and moving their mouths , but their sincerity is limited . They often put profit before right , and let the boss lose out . "  
The hard-won joys of bird photographyPhotographing the black-faced spoonbill is arduous work . To avoid disturbing the birds , one must set up a hide in their habitat . Crouching in the camouflaged tent or wading through the black fetid mud with the cold seawater chilling one to the bone , exposed to the force of the bitter northeast wind , is something which is hard to describe with mere words to someone who has not experienced it himself .  
We had been raised and educated in China , " Yuan says , and they began to feel that being Chinese gave them a lot beyond obvious differences in custom . " For instance , it made us loyal and sincere , hard working , persevering . . . I hope my child has learned these traits in addition to a basic understanding of morality . "  
Kinmen kaoliang , king of liquorsWhen it comes to the subject of what gifts to take back home , one is sure to think of Kinmen kaoliang . Since Kinmen 's state-owned distillery was obliged to stop selling its products directly to the public to avoid engaging in unfair competition with private enterprise , Kinmen 's pure , silky-smooth aged sorghum spirit has been in short supply , causing its price to rocket . In recent times especially , it has been hard to get hold of at any price .  
On the contrary , installation is very volatile and highly inviting of the audience 's active participation . Plus it is very hard to preserve , and thus it is inherently anti-market and by nature given to protest . He selected the form since it suits his sarcastic and critical works of art .  
Land is state property , and most people live in homes owned by their work units , so that these can not serve as collateral for " start-up capital . " Another reason why private enterprise is having a hard time burgeoning is because " government policy is tilted in favor of foreign and Taiwan investors . " It is still up in the air whether or not the mainland can duplicate Taiwan 's development experience .  
His works are first baked unglazed at 1200 . Such a temperature is perfect for effecting a warm , smooth , touchable quality . lf the temperature were higher , the clay would be far too hard ; at a lower temperature , the clay would crumble . After his pottery is fired unglazed , it is smoked with firewood . Then he chooses a complementary material derived from a natural element , such as metal , wood , stone or glass ( representing water ) to combine with the pottery .  
With this objective in mind , the factory ownership accepts fewer orders , begins to take a loss on manufacturing , stops paying annual bonuses , begins shifting workers to unpalatable jobs ( for example , by closing down some of the especially unprofitable lines and shifting the workers to new jobs they will find hard to adjust to , so that they leave " voluntarily " ) , or transfers workers to other factories far away . . . these are all frequently seen " strategies . "  
It was hard for Chinese actresses to get parts and those that we did get all depicted stereotyped Chinese women . Even these were in scarce supply . " The way she saw it , for Chinese and American actors alike , a good audition would n't mean you would get the part . You 'd have to rely on that aura you projected , that special something extra .  
The disadvantaged of the disadvantagedAustralia 's public television has a regular program displaying government-sponsored documentaries which are filmed by their indigenous peoples . In the United States , many reservations have community programs produced and hosted by native Americans . But Taiwan 's public television news department is recruiting reporters whose aboriginal identity is a prerequisite . This is a rarity not only in Taiwan ; throughout the whole world it would be hard to find a comparable experience .  
The elder President Chiang was very hard on himself and very frugal . He did n't care whether his clothes and furniture were worn out , but he was strict about cleanliness and order . " Back then Chiang Kai-shek would often wear his white gloves , and he would run his finger over furniture when he passed by . He would judge how well the custodial staff had executed their duties by the extent of dust on his gloves .  
It is not hard to discover that most people with a hunched posture have oversensitive nerves . If they eat foods with mixed sweet and savory flavors , this will irritate the internal organs , throwing their function into disorder . In this situation the foods eaten can not be properly digested and absorbed , and the person 's body type will develop towards one with a protruding lower or upper abdomen . (  
Taiwan firms are now defined as " special domestic investors " by the PRC , and they enjoy somewhat greater privileges and incentives than foreign firms . However , as the mainland makes the transition to a less protected market , it may be hard for Taiwan firms to hold on to the advantages that come with being one of the " local boys . " In the future they will have to compete with non-Chinese companies from the same starting point .  
Of course , everyone has their own version of the story , and it is hard to say who is right or wrong . But Li , looking at things from the point of view of enterprise development , feels that democratization in Taiwan is divorced from the rule of law , that the media is biased , that local elected officials stir up the population to win favor , and that the government - - though willing to help - - is unable to do anything . All these keep investors from moving forward . "  
Last year there was a string of incidents of women who murdered their abusive husbands , sexual harassment on college campuses , and rape . Many women reporters were deeply distressed by the superficial " spin " put on these stories by their newspapers , which deliberately treated the stories as " having pornographic overtones " or as cases of " the war between the sexes . " They had to fight hard to get more balanced reports into the papers .  
In the past , the SEF distinguished between negotiations at the levels of chairman , secretary-general , and vice-secretary-general , and the SEF official of a given level would only negotiate with a mainland counterpart at the same level . Now , in order to increase flexibility , there will not be hard and fast distinctions between the levels . Moreover , in the past there were only negotiations on limited issue areas . Now there will also be sub-units discussing economic and cultural affairs . "  
After a period of groping , it is not too hard to get accustomed to the convenience of electronic bulletin boards . But the truly worrisome part is still to come . Simply looking at the vast stream of information could make a person dizzy . But we all may be wondering , if I do n't get on the Net soon , am I going to fall behind the times ? (  
After having seen many such examples , NGO leaders are not unaware that criticizing is easier than doing the actual work . " The government is n't going to ask me to come serve in the public sector . If they did ask me , I 'm afraid it would n't be easy to do a good job , " admits one leader of an educational reform group . Once he switched roles from offense to defense , it would also be hard for him to escape " being vulnerable to attack . "  
But today , when there is a greater emphasis on morality and humane treatment of other living beings , many countries are hard at work creating animal protection laws in the hope that in addition to wild animals , the pets with whom people have ever closer relationships , livestock and other animals that serve economic functions can also have legal protection . Humans will never stop eating and using animals , but some of the pain and hardship can be eliminated from how they use them . Such laws could also prevent unnecessary abuse .  
It 's hard to know a dog 's heartHuang Hui-pi states emphatically that the entire process of managing street dogs , including sterilization , mercy killing and monitoring commercial breeders , requires the assistance of veterinarians . Nevertheless , the training process of veterinary medicine lacks a fitting understanding of canine population expansion .  
Folk popular , doctor disdainedBecause the Taiwanese medical establishment now follows mainstream Western medicine , many doctors say that hypnosis is " a mysterious art that is impossible to understand and hard to make sense of . " They regard such folk practices as spells , charms to calm people shocked by ghosts , and the trances of jitongs , as just plain superstitious and ridiculous . And as for meditation , yoga and Zen contemplation , these they view as the realm of religion , completely distinct from the domain of science .  
First , on the basis of Delft 's experience with red stoneware , he improved the kiln design to produce a higher firing temperature and made a hard red stoneware similar to Yixing ware . But sadly this still fell some way short of the pure white porcelain which the elector craved after day and night .  
At the most basic level , people can get away with this when representing deceased heroes of the past for whom there is no photographic record . But for modern subjects whose photos are available , such inferior work is an insult to viewers , bringing to mind the expression , " It 's easy to portray a ghost , hard to portray a man . "  
" In the past , society was very closed , and it was hard to get information , so people really respected their professors , " says Lin Chin-chuan . Now we live amidst an information explosion , with rapid development of all forms of media . Teachers are no longer the only source of knowledge . Naturally the paternalistic , god-like authority they enjoyed in the past has declined , and it has become necessary for them relate to students on a more personal level .  
Chen Chuo-ming , head of the Changhua Normal University , says that in the Chinese tradition teachers were supposed to have been able to teach both the material and the man . Teachers trained for ten years , and after this hard labor and sacrifice , not only did they acquire knowledge , they acquired a strong character as well , and this was reflected in their essays and lessons . But modern training for professors creates researchers only specialized in one particular area .  
We are surrounded by good things to eat in our prosperous society , and the need to carry heavy things , walk long distances , or perform manual labor is greatly reduced . Our bodies take in more energy than they expend , and while the food is easy to eat , it 's hard to get rid of . So it 's difficult to avoid accumulating fat .  
For a while now , Li Wen-ling , an elementary school teacher , has led her entire class in reading the classics during activity period . Because this was n't common in schools when she started , she had to play the hard and lonely role of pioneer . In addition to a few parents who looked askance on the activity , her students would ask why they had to recite when other kids did n't and would use the classical Chinese they had learned in class to attack her in their essay books .  
It might be a standard reaction to suspect you are dealing with a bad guy . But if you suspect the majority of people might harm you , then it 's a sign of having mental problems . ( For example , many people constantly dwell on such ideas as " society is unforgiving , " or " people 's hearts are crooked and mean " and use this as an excuse to force their kids to struggle hard . )  
For instance , some concepts governing the traditional use of herbal medicines , such as Chinese medical differentiation between " hot " and " cold " ingredients , are hard to verify with modern scientific instruments .  
An abnormal excess of male over female births in recent demographic statistics is causing many people to be concerned that in future , men will be hard put to find a mate . Others joke that families with daughters will be in great demand .  
Wang argues that the ideal situation would be to establish " resource classes for hyperactive children . " Hyperactive children having a hard time adjusting could first stay in these resource classes until they showed improved functioning and learning impairments were eliminated . Then , accompanied by a special-ed teacher , they could transfer to a regular class . The special-ed teacher would continue to provide guidance until the child had adjusted .  
Up to the time that they removed the Zheng clan from power in Taiwan , some members of the Qing court held that they should just let the island be , describing it as " an undeveloped place with little tax revenue that is separated from the mainland by a strait and hard to administer . " They did n't even think it should be included in maps of China proper .  
" It 's hard to say . It may be that only close relatives were buried in the home , while ' evil spirits ' [ such as those killed in war ] might have been buried farther away from dwellings , " posits Liu . He adds , " Modern people always feel that people from the distant past were ' uncivilized . ' In fact , in terms of life rituals , it may very well be that they were more rigorous and clear-cut than moderns . "  
Chiang Kuan-feng feels that on this occasion the issuing of invitations was " broad and deep . " Equal attention was given to the central government and the localities ; professional , religious , and social groups were all included ; and even overseas Chinese were given as fair a distribution of RSVPs as possible . As for how many people could or would come , it was hard to say . The only thing to do was keep calling the contact people for each group and ask , " What will your attendance rate be ? "  
It is just like scholars who stayed in their poorly heated rooms studying for ten years - - by passing the exams , they then set themselves up for life and did n't have to work hard again . The idea of setting up something eternal by a short term effort emphasizes the idea of a panacea . The most important thing emphasized is that whatever has been most recently learned is great learning , useful learning . Everything else is thrown away .  
Of course , people outside the CEPD are worried that all this might come to naught . The CEPD may work hard to coordinate among all agencies produce ideas to move Taiwan up in the rankings , but there might be no real improvement in competitiveness . However , given that the detailed evaluations of an institution at the level of the IMDI are not just based on on-paper responses , but rather all have objective standards of evaluation , the responsibilities of the CEPD should be very concrete .  
Given that everyone is exposed to the mass media today , it is hard to ensure that the views and statements that senior citizens express about the past have not been guided by the current context . " It is very possible that , given a certain atmosphere in society , the interviewee knows very well what the interviewer is aiming at , and just tells him or her what they want to hear , " cautions Wang Ming-ko , an associate researcher at the Institute of History and Philology at the Academia Sinica .  
Rather , starting with ancient Greece , I reread the Western philosophers . I worked hard at standing in their shoes . The process was very difficult , for I discovered that things which in the past I had been educated to accept as true and reasonable gradually became petty and untrustworthy .  
In fact , direct sales takes hard work , and requires a complete commitment of one 's whole person ( intellectual , physical , and emotional ) , time , and maybe even family ( with parents and siblings brought into the sales network ) . Results are only likely to be visible after three to five years , and it 's a one-in-a-million shot that one can grit one 's teeth and hang in until becoming a big player .  
Given the resounding success of percussion today , it is hard to imagine that ten years ago this field of music was entirely neglected in Taiwan . At that time people generally though of percussion music as cacophonous , incapable of being melodic , and not the kind of thing to be put on in elegant halls .  
It 's not that I 'm hard to scare ( God has given me an adrenal gland , which is His way of telling me to be scared ) . It 's just that I react slowly to authority , and although I am afraid , neither being assassinated , nor being arrested , nor being jumped in a dark alley is a threat to me anymore , because how many more years do I have to live anyway ?  
As the silt rises higher behind the Shih-men Dam and its water storage capacity diminishes , it becomes ever more prone to drying up , flooding and turbidity . In the drought two years ago , an Earth God temple which had been drowned back when the reservoir was first filled with water came up for air , and the lake 's familiar expanse of water became a shortcut for gravel trucks which raced upstream across the hard , cracked mud of its dry bed .  
Lumps of hard black stuff with metal legs , containing many tiny crystals . For a number of years now , these unlikely looking little objects-integrated circuits ( ICs ) , the most typical of semiconductor products-have surpassed petroleum and gold to rank firmly in first place by total value among products imported into Taiwan .  
One noteworthy , and rather unexpected thing , is that this clean-room air which is " 1000 times more pure than outside air " - in which even filtrable viruses find it hard to survive-does not make one feel refreshed and energetic . On the contrary , after a short period you feel stifled and dizzy . You really have to admire those women production line workers who spend 12 hours a day in there .  
Those who oppose it say " there is no room for public stations . " It is hard to guarantee that any TV station funded by the government will not become the government 's mouthpiece . After it starts broadcasting , the annual cost of NT $ 2.4 billion might very well become a financial burden on the government , not to mention that , being surrounded by dozens of highly competitive channels , PTV will have a hard time surviving .  
" At that time , we were only students , but living deep in the mountains , life was so hard for the Ssumakussu people . They brought out the best of all they had for us , and looking at their honest and simple faces , while we were very moved , we also felt ashamed and uneasy , " says Ma . " Who were they ?  
In the past , people rushed to plant trees as short-term cash crops , but did not develop the economic potential of native trees , nor was there any long term plan for nursery raising and planting of native tree species . Today we must work hard to make up for this lacuna , otherwise if non-native species are planted as cash crops , the final result may be the same as with pine wilt disease : that we will benefit from neither the introduced nor our native species . Reshuffling the cards  
Kan adds an even more ridiculous case of how hard it has been to change men 's attitudes . In ROC criminal law , rape is defined as a " crime damaging to social morality . " In other words , according to the legal interpretation , the real evil in rape is that it offends the requirement for women to remain chaste and virtuous . As for the woman , it seems that the violation of her person is secondary !  
When ball games become staged , players are victims too . While pro baseball players may have better financial prospects than other ROC athletes , the golden years of their prime last only about a decade , and many find the chance to earn some extra money in their youth hard to pass up . They make easy prey for the underworld , which brings with it violence , threats and bribery . Once having started down that slippery slope , it 's hard to turn back .  
Since the market is now up , and many provincial assemblymen who had previously opposed the plan have changed their attitudes as a result of the proposal to freeze the provincial government 's functions , the plan is moving forward again . It 's just that the sudden influx of stock will be a blow to share prices of existing stocks , and it will be hard to return financial stocks to their former level of hundreds of dollars per share .  
However , new mayor Chen Shui-bian concluded that it 's better to get the pain over with for the long-term betterment of the city as a whole . Taipei is , after all , densely populated , and open , green space is increasingly to be valued . Moreover , the mayor does not want to be seen as someone who just " talks a good game " but does nothing when it comes to hard choices about improving the city and enforcing the law . Thus he adopted a firm attitude and proceeded with the demolition .  
Chambers could see how the formal garden was a travesty of nature . Yet the style of Brown , by which it was being replaced , blindly followed nature and lacked any sense of taste . It was , in fact , hard to distinguish from the wilderness . Consisting of a few trees planted on a large grassy slope with a winding narrow path , people were spending a lot of money to produce not much more than an extravagant meadow .  
Cleveland was originally a center of machinery and steel . When the city fell on hard times , 30 local entrepreneurs formed a " roundtable " to find a way out of the mess . After four years of extensive discussions , they designed a strategic plan for the direction of future city development .  
Starting in 1984 , this group was able to harness the collective energies of government and industry to promote and complete more than 10 public works projects , and through corporate self-awareness and community supervision were able to gradually improve the quality of the environment . After 10 years of hard work , the city had completely remade itself and become a model of urban renaissance .  
On this point , Chen Chien-te argues that considering the level of funding and the size of the center 's staff , the light beams have been coming on line pretty fast . Still , to meet researchers ' needs , apart from doing all they can to make the light beams more powerful , they are also negotiating with the Japanese synchrotron center to co-fund three hard X-ray beams at the Japanese center that would be specially designated for use by Taiwan researchers .  
The world has indeed progressed . The hasty passing of half a century has seen an improvement in material conditions , people live longer and have more to eat . Yet the most contagious disease of the late twentieth century has become " hard work . "  
In his thinking , the peasants have no month of rest and the life of the fields is one of exhausting hard labor . Yet he also saw the pleasure of rural life , when the peasants have finished work and " the children who were picking melons laugh and wash their feet at the water 's edge as the sun goes down , telling outrageous stories before the evening wind picks up . " This was a simple kind of leisure that the sophisticated literati were unable to appreciate .  
An ad hoc task force comprising both civilian and military investigators is now hard at work on the case , but has discovered signs that many documents have either been lost or falsified . Many worrisome questions remain unanswered : How many people are involved ? How high up does the case reach ?  
Although not a father myself , I can still imagine the excitement , anxiety and even fear which the prospect of a first child 's arrival arouses in parents-to-be , so to some extent I was mentally prepared . But when on the evening of 6 April last year I hurried to the delivery room at National Taiwan University Hospital , I found it hard to associate the Lina I saw lying helplessly on a bed , her belly covered with the tubes and wires of medical instruments , with her usual everyday self .  
For the mass of ordinary people , who are impatient and full of worldly desires , the idea of heaven as an essentially illusory mental state achieved by self-cultivation is abstruse and complex , and the continuous , unrelenting effort required to enter such a state is both hard to understand and hard to achieve . Thus it is understandable that a " heaven " in which religious concepts are simplified and popularized is preferred by proselytizers .  
" He has melded cultural affirmation and ethnic self-respect with literary practice to create a purely Chinese literary form , " says Ng Kim Chew . " This provides solace to his personal sensibilities , both literary and ethnic . " There are few who can compare to ECM writers living in Taiwan in terms of how hard they work , either . Li Yung-ping was once an assistant professor in the department of foreign languages and literatures at National Sun Yat-sen University .  
According to First International Computers ' Jeff Hsue , who has also traveled to the States himself to interview applicants , Taiwan 's ability to design and produce products is hard to beat . But he says that few Taiwanese firms are involved in taking product design to a higher level , whether it be through technological developments , preliminary research or even fundamental academic research , because of the difficulties and risks involved .  
Kuo says that it is impossible to see how Diamond Stage had real respect for these low-status people . Most of the time in the " social concern segments " was spent in bantering among the hosts ( who got their start doing vulgar " dinner shows " ) and the guest star . Was it supposed to express respect just because the hosts bowed and said something like " that looked like hard work " at the end ?  
At dawn , as the first sliver of the sun 's disc rises out of the sea , its rays strike the specially designed large windows of " Lion 's Kingdom . " Inside , several thousand stone lions have passed the night in lonely silence , but suddenly their round , staring eyes sparkle and come alive . As the exhibition room turns from darkness to light , the contours of their bodies , cold and hard in the blackness , become clear-cut and vital .  
Chen Hao-yung of the NIPM says that once a virus develops into an urban virus it becomes very hard to eradicate . Viruses are very simple in structure , and as long as they have live cells to act as their hosts they can continue to reproduce . Hence cities , which have dense human populations and also harbor large numbers of rodents and other pests , are perfect breeding grounds for viruses .  
He compares the rage for the beads to the scams involving the charlatan Buddhist master Song Chi-li who sold doctored photographs of light emanating from his head or the enormous sums spent on Buddha pedestals by the Taiqimen sect . " Strange beasts , " he says , " come out during times of social crisis . " Modern people , with their numerous desires , are hard to satisfy and often lack peace and happiness .  
When she came to Taipei three years ago , she did not choose a foreign firm , in which internal communication is normally done in English . Rather , she entered a local urban planning firm , in which only Chinese was spoken , and learned her Chinese the hard way .  
The year before last the show " Splendors of Imperial China " was well received by the American academic and cultural communities , and afterwards many nations extended invitations to the National Palace Museum . The French government worked especially hard to meet the Musuem 's needs , even passing a new law designating measures to protect foreign art works on exhibition there . Now , 63 years after part of the National Palace Museum collection first went to Europe for a show in London in 1935 , works from the museum are going to Paris .  
Dusk is falling , and having completed a hard day 's work , everyone is relaxing in front of the television in their warm homes , when scenes of hurricane-devastated neighbourhoods appear on the screen . " These are our friends , " intones the familiar voice of Jason Hu , Minister of Foreign Affairs . In what turns out to be the voice-over of an advertisement , he appeals for a helping hand to be extended to long-term friends of the ROC ravaged by Hurricane Mitch .  
On a whiteboard on the wall , we see the words : " The wise are always good at caring for people , so that none is abandoned ; always good at caring for things , so that nothing is thrown away . . . . " This aphoristic couplet , although written in classical Chinese , is not hard to understand , and with the practical illustrations just given by the speaker , no wonder the listeners are all nodding vigorously .  
A long table was filled with all kinds of dishes : deep-fried mahua ( dough twists ) , gangzitou ( hard wheatcakes ) , wheat-flour porridge , puffed-rice cakes , lardy rice , roasted sweet potatoes , cold noodles , huibing ( soft wheatcakes cut up and cooked in soup ) , dough drop soup , rice gruel with mung beans . . . .  
In the lore of Chinese medicine , Shen Nong is credited with having discovered countless medicines by trying out various herbs on himself , but even he would have to be amazed at the willingness of people in modern Taiwan to experiment on themselves . Many people think of cancer as a death sentence . If they are unlucky enough to be hit , they become desperate and will risk any kind of treatment , however unorthodox . In fact , this is not hard to understand .  
It required " a grade one vocational qualification [ equivalent to a degree from a junior college of that time ] and a grade two academic qualification [ equivalent to a degree from a three-year technical high school of that time ] . Preparing for the test was difficult . Days were hard after you went to work too , both in the training period and when you actually were working . If you did n't have an interest in machinery , it would have been hard to take any pleasure in the work , " says Cheng .  
Just as the archeologists were beginning to calm down after the discovery of pit # 1 , the adrenaline started pumping again . As before , the soil was rammed hard , and once again , one stunning item after another was unearthed-over 60 elephant tusks , numerous delicate and complex bronze zun and lei ( an urn-shaped wine vessel ) , bronze heads bedecked in a wide assortment of finery , and a huge bronze mask measuring over 130 cm from side to side .  
Miraculously , however , Hsiung recovered the next day . " I learned about death before dying , " comments Hsiung . To keep the specter of recurrent illness at bay these last 40 years , he has trained hard at taijiquan . It was only once he began to feel that he had really learned something that he branched into dance instruction .  
Saying it wants to block any rampant spread of gambling , the Executive Yuan has decided to propose additional amendments in the next legislative session . However , it will certainly meet strong opposition from the conglomerates and legislators who fought so hard to have the gambling rider passed .  
Modern doctors have to pass exams to get into medical school , and study hard for many years before they can begin their professional lives . It is not easy to become an indigenous shaman either . One must be selected by the ancestral souls . Although one may go on her own to become an acolyte to a practicing shaman , there 's no guarantee that she will " graduate " and win " certification . "  
Taiwan is working hard to attain diplomatic and economic breakthroughs and hoping to gain a deeper understanding of the West . Beset with ethnic and environmental problems , popular culture reigns supreme .  
Evidently some people have found chess so addictive that they have neither slept nor rested , and there is a saying to the effect that " thoughts of spring make it hard to sleep , but chess can help pass a clear night . " No wonder some ancient chess aficionados declared that unless they were in contact with chess , their chi ( energy flow ) and pulse would become irregular and unsteady , and their brains would atrophy .

For many years we have worked hard to put into practice Deng Xiaoping 's thinking of common prosperity .  Having gained a certain economic strength , we began to carry out the " project of common prosperity " and , relying mainly upon the financial departments at the city level for many consecutive years , raised funds totaling 1.88-billion yuan and put them into the relatively backward areas of the city in a bid to improve their infrastructure facilities , industrial layout , and cultural and educational conditions , thereby bringing about the coordinated development of various localities .

As all types of economic targets are large in number and wide in scope ; are interrelated with one another ; and are under the control of different departments , some of which are also large in size ; are exposed to a large extent ; and are highly vulnerable owing to their state of production , operation , or utilization in peace time , it is difficult and costly to protect them .  Also it is unrealistic to protect them in an all-round way and hard to raise their protection efficiency .

This successful exercise , with a landing operation as its backdrop , has showed clearly that the multidimensional combat ability of our army is being enhanced today , as it not only has the means to cope with hard offensives launched by the enemy with such high-tech weapons as cruise missile and armed helicopter ; but also has the right measures to counter soft assaults , such as network attacks , which base on high technologies means .

We urge the mass media workers to feel proud of their lofty mission of safeguarding world peace , sow the seed of tolerance and friendliness among the people by means of their hard work every day , and make impartial and objective reports , especially reports on the religious situation in various countries , in order to promote mutual understanding among the people .

All these need to be overcome with hard efforts in the practical work in the future .  
With the ideological and political quality of the party rank and file and party cadres being enhanced , they will have a strong sense of fighting against corruption and keeping themselves clean and honest in performing official duties .

Third , cadre appointments must be based on the principle of incorruptibility .

This has solved missile launchers ' difficulty in taking aim and launching missiles because of the disturbance by winds and waves while working on the sea , and formulated a complete set of methods for combat and training .

With regard to strengthening mutual trust and cooperation in the military sphere , although Sergeyev 's visit has avoided another storm arising in bilateral military cooperation ties on account of the espionage affair , the hard ice that has long formed between the two countries can hardly undergo a complete thaw in one or two visits , and " a still more difficult path lies ahead . "  
In the past decade , with the implementation of President Jiang Zemin 's instruction on " working hard to build revolutionized , modernized and regularized anti-chemical warfare units , " our country 's anti-chemical warfare units have basically formed a new fighting system marked by the new generation of " ordinance for anti-chemical warfare " and has achieved significant progress in solving major and difficult problems .

This is a hard battle and a declaration of an all-out war against the dark and evil forces .

The resultant good performance often conceals some stark marketing realities and lowers the businesses ' guard .  The operators would find it very hard to keep a cool head to ponder over existing inadequacies and hidden perils .  This is very detrimental to the long-term , lasting development of these businesses .  
The broad masses of transferred military cadres , on the other hand , should preserve and carry forward the fine tradition of the people 's army , serve the interests of the whole , support the reform program , and show understanding and sympathy for the difficulties experienced by the state and local authorities in trying to settle them .  They should take the initiative to obey the arrangements made by the organization and work hard at their new posts to make fresh contributions to the cause of socialist modernization .  
The party and state 's ample rewards to scientific and technological personnel and the hard working and enterprising spirit of the awarded scientists will certainly and utterly inspire the national pride and self-confidence of numerous scientific and technological workers as well as the people throughout the country .

Luo Gan said : Over the past year , the procuratorial organs throughout the country conscientiously studied and worked hard to practice General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents , " continued to set strict demands on their work and the performance of their law enforcement duties , and obviously enhanced the level of fairness in law enforcement and improved the social image of the procuratorial personnel . 
In the new situation and in face of new challenges , we should have a firm grip of the party 's basic line of taking economic construction as a center , seize chances , quicken the tempo of development , exert ourselves to make the country prosperous , and immerse ourselves into hard work .  Only by so doing will we be able to narrow our gap with developed countries .  
We must persistently strive to meet the requirements of the " three represents " and without wavering carry forward the party 's fine tradition and work style .  We must do a better job in carrying forward our party 's work style of seeking truth from facts , integrating theory with practice , establishing close ties with the people , carrying out criticism and self-criticism , being modest and prudent , guarding against arrogance and rashness , and working hard .  
This was the case especially during the " 96-2 " exercise , which was staged under clear-cut stress involving units from different services and arms .

He pointed out : Generally speaking , the living conditions of the people in our country have been greatly improved and have reached the level of being comparatively well-off .  However , due to various factors , the living conditions of the masses in some areas have been improved at a relatively slow speed , a small number of people among urban and rural residents are still facing more difficulties in their livelihood .  Some people even find it hard to get sufficient food .  
In his speech , Deputy Wang Ke said : In doing the PLA 's logistic work , we must take the initiative to serve the needs of overall national economic construction .

Speaking on building stronger contingents of procuratorial personnel and improving their competency and law enforcing efficiency , Han Zhubin said : The National Procuratorial College , during the course of studying and implementing the important " three represents " thinking and working hard to improve the political awareness and professional competency of procuratorial personnel , trained more than 200 procuratorial officers before they were promoted to serve as chief procurators .  By the end of the year , local procuratorates also had trained one-third of their procuratorial officers on a rotational basis .  
Competition in the aspect of agricultural development comes more often from the foreign market than from the domestic market .  As far as hundreds of millions of peasants are concerned , it is rather difficult to increase their incomes by simply relying on growing crops .  Having insufficient stamina , township enterprises , which flourished some years ago , find it hard to become a major channel for increasing peasants ' incomes in a short period of time .  
During the Tenth Five-Year Plan , the city of Lhasa will take advantage of the construction of the Tibetan railroad to speed up the readjustment of the industrial structure , actively develop new products that have a special plateau flavor and are sought after on the market , and will work hard to try to make its way into markets outside the autonomous region .  It will enhance the vitality of the local economy and achieve leapfrog-style social and economic development . "  
Judged from what has been reflected by the grassroots , right now there are too many inspections , conferences , social etiquette , and functions of all kinds , and they are very time-consuming and high-class .  Consequently , huge manpower and material resources have been wasted .  All levels of leading cadres , who find it hard to cope with , have poured out endless grievances .  
should firmly and unremittingly tackle problems like impure thinking or erroneous styles among personnel concerned ; and should attach great importance to professional training for judges or procurators at the grassroots level by ensuring the greatest support for them in this regard , and by choosing and assigning the best teachers for them as well .  In order to heighten overall quality of judges or procurators , we must work hard for several years to come .  
They pointed out : The key to building a contingent of highly qualified personnel for political and legal work lies in personnel .  We must firmly control entry and ensure smooth exit and must work hard to build a contingent of clean and honest personnel known for a firm political stand , professional proficiency , a fine style , and moral integrity .  
At the same time , we will rely on our own efforts , work hard and perseveringly , combine our own efforts with the solicitude of the central authorities and the support of people across the country ; we will emancipate our minds , adopt new ideas , and accelerate economic and social development in Tibet through ideological , scientific , technological , and institutional innovations .  
Under the conditions of reform , opening up , and developing the market economy , party cadres must make greater effort to build up their party spirit , adopt a correct attitude toward power , position , interests , have the ability to resist the corrosive influence of various decadent ideas , and set a good example in working hard , living thriftily , and performing official duties honestly and uncorruptly .

For me and many other overseas Chinese living here , Taipei is such a distant place that it 's hard to sense what it must be like , how it 's changed from quiet and tranquility to bustling crowds and prosperity .

"  
Kuo Li-hsin , a lecturer in the Department of Broadcasting and Television of National Chengchih University , argues that at this point it 's hard to say what negative or positive value it will have , but if the audience is just satisfied with this outlet , and abandons normal channels of political participation , such as lowering willingness to vote , then " this might not be such a good thing for political participation itself , " he points out , raising an alternate possibility .  
Having seen his friend die with his own eyes , Chiang was grief stricken , but that very afternoon he still had to fly over the presidential offices and form a perfect " 60 " in the blue sky to celebrate the country 's 60th anniversary .

Lee Tung-liang , a Changhua County Councilor and a leader in the anti-Dupont environmental movement , says that if the water quality does not improve he is thinking about calling on the farmers to let all their land go to waste , and appeal to the county magistrate .

It is said that when some companies have formed alliances with foreign enterprises , even the plans produced by the partners have been so hard to get to grips with that the contract documents are just left to drafted by the opposite parties before they are signed . The result is that , if later on it is discovered that the technological exchange or financial conditions have not been met as planned , then it is too late to escape .  
So many years later , my memories of duck herding are faint , but a few scenes often come to mind - - sleeping at night on a hard pile of rice straw , the chirping of crickets , a pleasant cool feeling . . . or at night when ducks and people were asleep , and only the insects disturbed the peace .  
Vuu Khai Thanh , initiator of what was then the Binhtien Imex Cooperative Society , relied on hard work and struggle , and the advantages of distributing low-priced goods with insignificant labor costs to Southeast Asia . In 1989 , he received the first license to be issued by the government permitting a private enterprise to engage in direct foreign trade . It was only this that landed him the opportunity to leave the country for an observation tour and go to Taiwan to find technological and management partners , thus speeding up the expansion of the business .  
Two months ago a Canadian artist , J . Fenwick Lansdowne , held an exhibition in Taiwan on the theme of Chinese rare birds . His lively and fine depictions of Chinese birds and their habitats has led many people , including some ecologists , to exclaim : " The Chinese have not been good at giving realistic renderings of birds and their habitats , which is something they should strive hard to do in the future . "  
Realism easy - - art from life hard : Today native culture is increasingly receiving more attention , and people are concerned about indigenous bird species . In science , great emphasis is placed on exact breeds and species , and painters strive to portray Mikado pheasants or other precise species of birds . What must be aspired to in painting birds , apart from aesthetic enjoyment , must still be to let spectators understand birds at a glance . The challenge for artists is very great . "  
And on sweltering summer days , people gather here to enjoy the cool shade .

There are fewer and fewer kids coming along each year now : Two years ago the school still counted 37 heads , with 24 remaining last year , and only an even dozen this year . It 's hard to run a school without students : Leaving aside for a moment the question of economic efficiency , in terms of the quality of instruction , what impact does the small number of students have on learning ?  
This is what makes it possible to read / write such resounding symphonies of overt and covert complex meaning and humor not only into poetry and fiction , which make use of " abstract " expressive techniques such as form and sound or people and events ( whose meaning is so hard to clearly define ) , but even into works of literary criticism .  
On the heels of economic reform , the mainland has been pushing hard to increase its foreign exchange , and so the Pu'er tea grown in Yunnan , where most production is centered , has gradually become familiar to Westerners .

For those cities and counties with less developed economies , or with severe population outflow , the redistribution of funds is of course the best possible plan . But the money is not there just for the asking . Often expenses that are considered vital at the local level are not seen as such by the center . Sometimes the funds are given with so many restrictions as to how they might be spent that it is hard for the local government to put them to use .  
Such is the case with Chinpao Shan 's Tsao Ji-chang , who makes his complex very clear . " Most mainlanders have a wily nature : great at talking , loving to argue but not liking hard work ; they are very suitable for thinking up ideas and moving their mouths , but their sincerity is limited . They often put profit before right , and let the boss lose out . "  
The hard-won joys of bird photographyPhotographing the black-faced spoonbill is arduous work . To avoid disturbing the birds , one must set up a hide in their habitat . Crouching in the camouflaged tent or wading through the black fetid mud with the cold seawater chilling one to the bone , exposed to the force of the bitter northeast wind , is something which is hard to describe with mere words to someone who has not experienced it himself .  
We had been raised and educated in China , " Yuan says , and they began to feel that being Chinese gave them a lot beyond obvious differences in custom . " For instance , it made us loyal and sincere , hard working , persevering . . . I hope my child has learned these traits in addition to a basic understanding of morality . "  
Kinmen kaoliang , king of liquorsWhen it comes to the subject of what gifts to take back home , one is sure to think of Kinmen kaoliang . Since Kinmen 's state-owned distillery was obliged to stop selling its products directly to the public to avoid engaging in unfair competition with private enterprise , Kinmen 's pure , silky-smooth aged sorghum spirit has been in short supply , causing its price to rocket . In recent times especially , it has been hard to get hold of at any price .  
On the contrary , installation is very volatile and highly inviting of the audience 's active participation . Plus it is very hard to preserve , and thus it is inherently anti-market and by nature given to protest . He selected the form since it suits his sarcastic and critical works of art .  
Land is state property , and most people live in homes owned by their work units , so that these can not serve as collateral for " start-up capital . " Another reason why private enterprise is having a hard time burgeoning is because " government policy is tilted in favor of foreign and Taiwan investors . " It is still up in the air whether or not the mainland can duplicate Taiwan 's development experience .  
His works are first baked unglazed at 1200 . Such a temperature is perfect for effecting a warm , smooth , touchable quality . lf the temperature were higher , the clay would be far too hard ; at a lower temperature , the clay would crumble . After his pottery is fired unglazed , it is smoked with firewood . Then he chooses a complementary material derived from a natural element , such as metal , wood , stone or glass ( representing water ) to combine with the pottery .  
With this objective in mind , the factory ownership accepts fewer orders , begins to take a loss on manufacturing , stops paying annual bonuses , begins shifting workers to unpalatable jobs ( for example , by closing down some of the especially unprofitable lines and shifting the workers to new jobs they will find hard to adjust to , so that they leave " voluntarily " ) , or transfers workers to other factories far away . . . these are all frequently seen " strategies . "  
It was hard for Chinese actresses to get parts and those that we did get all depicted stereotyped Chinese women . Even these were in scarce supply . " The way she saw it , for Chinese and American actors alike , a good audition would n't mean you would get the part . You 'd have to rely on that aura you projected , that special something extra .  
The disadvantaged of the disadvantagedAustralia 's public television has a regular program displaying government-sponsored documentaries which are filmed by their indigenous peoples . In the United States , many reservations have community programs produced and hosted by native Americans . But Taiwan 's public television news department is recruiting reporters whose aboriginal identity is a prerequisite . This is a rarity not only in Taiwan ; throughout the whole world it would be hard to find a comparable experience .  
The elder President Chiang was very hard on himself and very frugal . He did n't care whether his clothes and furniture were worn out , but he was strict about cleanliness and order . " Back then Chiang Kai-shek would often wear his white gloves , and he would run his finger over furniture when he passed by . He would judge how well the custodial staff had executed their duties by the extent of dust on his gloves .  
It is not hard to discover that most people with a hunched posture have oversensitive nerves . If they eat foods with mixed sweet and savory flavors , this will irritate the internal organs , throwing their function into disorder . In this situation the foods eaten can not be properly digested and absorbed , and the person 's body type will develop towards one with a protruding lower or upper abdomen . (  
Taiwan firms are now defined as " special domestic investors " by the PRC , and they enjoy somewhat greater privileges and incentives than foreign firms . However , as the mainland makes the transition to a less protected market , it may be hard for Taiwan firms to hold on to the advantages that come with being one of the " local boys . " In the future they will have to compete with non-Chinese companies from the same starting point .  
Of course , everyone has their own version of the story , and it is hard to say who is right or wrong . But Li , looking at things from the point of view of enterprise development , feels that democratization in Taiwan is divorced from the rule of law , that the media is biased , that local elected officials stir up the population to win favor , and that the government - - though willing to help - - is unable to do anything . All these keep investors from moving forward . "  
Last year there was a string of incidents of women who murdered their abusive husbands , sexual harassment on college campuses , and rape . Many women reporters were deeply distressed by the superficial " spin " put on these stories by their newspapers , which deliberately treated the stories as " having pornographic overtones " or as cases of " the war between the sexes . " They had to fight hard to get more balanced reports into the papers .  
In the past , the SEF distinguished between negotiations at the levels of chairman , secretary-general , and vice-secretary-general , and the SEF official of a given level would only negotiate with a mainland counterpart at the same level . Now , in order to increase flexibility , there will not be hard and fast distinctions between the levels . Moreover , in the past there were only negotiations on limited issue areas . Now there will also be sub-units discussing economic and cultural affairs . "  
After a period of groping , it is not too hard to get accustomed to the convenience of electronic bulletin boards . But the truly worrisome part is still to come . Simply looking at the vast stream of information could make a person dizzy . But we all may be wondering , if I do n't get on the Net soon , am I going to fall behind the times ? (  
After having seen many such examples , NGO leaders are not unaware that criticizing is easier than doing the actual work . " The government is n't going to ask me to come serve in the public sector . If they did ask me , I 'm afraid it would n't be easy to do a good job , " admits one leader of an educational reform group . Once he switched roles from offense to defense , it would also be hard for him to escape " being vulnerable to attack . "  
But today , when there is a greater emphasis on morality and humane treatment of other living beings , many countries are hard at work creating animal protection laws in the hope that in addition to wild animals , the pets with whom people have ever closer relationships , livestock and other animals that serve economic functions can also have legal protection . Humans will never stop eating and using animals , but some of the pain and hardship can be eliminated from how they use them . Such laws could also prevent unnecessary abuse .  
It 's hard to know a dog 's heartHuang Hui-pi states emphatically that the entire process of managing street dogs , including sterilization , mercy killing and monitoring commercial breeders , requires the assistance of veterinarians . Nevertheless , the training process of veterinary medicine lacks a fitting understanding of canine population expansion .  
Folk popular , doctor disdainedBecause the Taiwanese medical establishment now follows mainstream Western medicine , many doctors say that hypnosis is " a mysterious art that is impossible to understand and hard to make sense of . " They regard such folk practices as spells , charms to calm people shocked by ghosts , and the trances of jitongs , as just plain superstitious and ridiculous . And as for meditation , yoga and Zen contemplation , these they view as the realm of religion , completely distinct from the domain of science .  
First , on the basis of Delft 's experience with red stoneware , he improved the kiln design to produce a higher firing temperature and made a hard red stoneware similar to Yixing ware . But sadly this still fell some way short of the pure white porcelain which the elector craved after day and night .  
At the most basic level , people can get away with this when representing deceased heroes of the past for whom there is no photographic record . But for modern subjects whose photos are available , such inferior work is an insult to viewers , bringing to mind the expression , " It 's easy to portray a ghost , hard to portray a man . "  
" In the past , society was very closed , and it was hard to get information , so people really respected their professors , " says Lin Chin-chuan . Now we live amidst an information explosion , with rapid development of all forms of media . Teachers are no longer the only source of knowledge . Naturally the paternalistic , god-like authority they enjoyed in the past has declined , and it has become necessary for them relate to students on a more personal level .  
Chen Chuo-ming , head of the Changhua Normal University , says that in the Chinese tradition teachers were supposed to have been able to teach both the material and the man . Teachers trained for ten years , and after this hard labor and sacrifice , not only did they acquire knowledge , they acquired a strong character as well , and this was reflected in their essays and lessons . But modern training for professors creates researchers only specialized in one particular area .  
We are surrounded by good things to eat in our prosperous society , and the need to carry heavy things , walk long distances , or perform manual labor is greatly reduced . Our bodies take in more energy than they expend , and while the food is easy to eat , it 's hard to get rid of . So it 's difficult to avoid accumulating fat .  
For a while now , Li Wen-ling , an elementary school teacher , has led her entire class in reading the classics during activity period . Because this was n't common in schools when she started , she had to play the hard and lonely role of pioneer . In addition to a few parents who looked askance on the activity , her students would ask why they had to recite when other kids did n't and would use the classical Chinese they had learned in class to attack her in their essay books .  
It might be a standard reaction to suspect you are dealing with a bad guy . But if you suspect the majority of people might harm you , then it 's a sign of having mental problems . ( For example , many people constantly dwell on such ideas as " society is unforgiving , " or " people 's hearts are crooked and mean " and use this as an excuse to force their kids to struggle hard . )  
For instance , some concepts governing the traditional use of herbal medicines , such as Chinese medical differentiation between " hot " and " cold " ingredients , are hard to verify with modern scientific instruments .  
An abnormal excess of male over female births in recent demographic statistics is causing many people to be concerned that in future , men will be hard put to find a mate . Others joke that families with daughters will be in great demand .  
Wang argues that the ideal situation would be to establish " resource classes for hyperactive children . " Hyperactive children having a hard time adjusting could first stay in these resource classes until they showed improved functioning and learning impairments were eliminated . Then , accompanied by a special-ed teacher , they could transfer to a regular class . The special-ed teacher would continue to provide guidance until the child had adjusted .  
Up to the time that they removed the Zheng clan from power in Taiwan , some members of the Qing court held that they should just let the island be , describing it as " an undeveloped place with little tax revenue that is separated from the mainland by a strait and hard to administer . " They did n't even think it should be included in maps of China proper .  
" It 's hard to say . It may be that only close relatives were buried in the home , while ' evil spirits ' [ such as those killed in war ] might have been buried farther away from dwellings , " posits Liu . He adds , " Modern people always feel that people from the distant past were ' uncivilized . ' In fact , in terms of life rituals , it may very well be that they were more rigorous and clear-cut than moderns . "  
Chiang Kuan-feng feels that on this occasion the issuing of invitations was " broad and deep . " Equal attention was given to the central government and the localities ; professional , religious , and social groups were all included ; and even overseas Chinese were given as fair a distribution of RSVPs as possible . As for how many people could or would come , it was hard to say . The only thing to do was keep calling the contact people for each group and ask , " What will your attendance rate be ? "  
It is just like scholars who stayed in their poorly heated rooms studying for ten years - - by passing the exams , they then set themselves up for life and did n't have to work hard again . The idea of setting up something eternal by a short term effort emphasizes the idea of a panacea . The most important thing emphasized is that whatever has been most recently learned is great learning , useful learning . Everything else is thrown away .  
Of course , people outside the CEPD are worried that all this might come to naught . The CEPD may work hard to coordinate among all agencies produce ideas to move Taiwan up in the rankings , but there might be no real improvement in competitiveness . However , given that the detailed evaluations of an institution at the level of the IMDI are not just based on on-paper responses , but rather all have objective standards of evaluation , the responsibilities of the CEPD should be very concrete .  
Given that everyone is exposed to the mass media today , it is hard to ensure that the views and statements that senior citizens express about the past have not been guided by the current context . " It is very possible that , given a certain atmosphere in society , the interviewee knows very well what the interviewer is aiming at , and just tells him or her what they want to hear , " cautions Wang Ming-ko , an associate researcher at the Institute of History and Philology at the Academia Sinica .  
Rather , starting with ancient Greece , I reread the Western philosophers . I worked hard at standing in their shoes . The process was very difficult , for I discovered that things which in the past I had been educated to accept as true and reasonable gradually became petty and untrustworthy .  
In fact , direct sales takes hard work , and requires a complete commitment of one 's whole person ( intellectual , physical , and emotional ) , time , and maybe even family ( with parents and siblings brought into the sales network ) . Results are only likely to be visible after three to five years , and it 's a one-in-a-million shot that one can grit one 's teeth and hang in until becoming a big player .  
Given the resounding success of percussion today , it is hard to imagine that ten years ago this field of music was entirely neglected in Taiwan . At that time people generally though of percussion music as cacophonous , incapable of being melodic , and not the kind of thing to be put on in elegant halls .  
It 's not that I 'm hard to scare ( God has given me an adrenal gland , which is His way of telling me to be scared ) . It 's just that I react slowly to authority , and although I am afraid , neither being assassinated , nor being arrested , nor being jumped in a dark alley is a threat to me anymore , because how many more years do I have to live anyway ?  
As the silt rises higher behind the Shih-men Dam and its water storage capacity diminishes , it becomes ever more prone to drying up , flooding and turbidity . In the drought two years ago , an Earth God temple which had been drowned back when the reservoir was first filled with water came up for air , and the lake 's familiar expanse of water became a shortcut for gravel trucks which raced upstream across the hard , cracked mud of its dry bed .  
Lumps of hard black stuff with metal legs , containing many tiny crystals . For a number of years now , these unlikely looking little objects-integrated circuits ( ICs ) , the most typical of semiconductor products-have surpassed petroleum and gold to rank firmly in first place by total value among products imported into Taiwan .  
One noteworthy , and rather unexpected thing , is that this clean-room air which is " 1000 times more pure than outside air " - in which even filtrable viruses find it hard to survive-does not make one feel refreshed and energetic . On the contrary , after a short period you feel stifled and dizzy . You really have to admire those women production line workers who spend 12 hours a day in there .  
Those who oppose it say " there is no room for public stations . " It is hard to guarantee that any TV station funded by the government will not become the government 's mouthpiece . After it starts broadcasting , the annual cost of NT $ 2.4 billion might very well become a financial burden on the government , not to mention that , being surrounded by dozens of highly competitive channels , PTV will have a hard time surviving .  
" At that time , we were only students , but living deep in the mountains , life was so hard for the Ssumakussu people . They brought out the best of all they had for us , and looking at their honest and simple faces , while we were very moved , we also felt ashamed and uneasy , " says Ma . " Who were they ?  
In the past , people rushed to plant trees as short-term cash crops , but did not develop the economic potential of native trees , nor was there any long term plan for nursery raising and planting of native tree species . Today we must work hard to make up for this lacuna , otherwise if non-native species are planted as cash crops , the final result may be the same as with pine wilt disease : that we will benefit from neither the introduced nor our native species . Reshuffling the cards  
Kan adds an even more ridiculous case of how hard it has been to change men 's attitudes . In ROC criminal law , rape is defined as a " crime damaging to social morality . " In other words , according to the legal interpretation , the real evil in rape is that it offends the requirement for women to remain chaste and virtuous . As for the woman , it seems that the violation of her person is secondary !  
When ball games become staged , players are victims too . While pro baseball players may have better financial prospects than other ROC athletes , the golden years of their prime last only about a decade , and many find the chance to earn some extra money in their youth hard to pass up . They make easy prey for the underworld , which brings with it violence , threats and bribery . Once having started down that slippery slope , it 's hard to turn back .  
Since the market is now up , and many provincial assemblymen who had previously opposed the plan have changed their attitudes as a result of the proposal to freeze the provincial government 's functions , the plan is moving forward again . It 's just that the sudden influx of stock will be a blow to share prices of existing stocks , and it will be hard to return financial stocks to their former level of hundreds of dollars per share .  
However , new mayor Chen Shui-bian concluded that it 's better to get the pain over with for the long-term betterment of the city as a whole . Taipei is , after all , densely populated , and open , green space is increasingly to be valued . Moreover , the mayor does not want to be seen as someone who just " talks a good game " but does nothing when it comes to hard choices about improving the city and enforcing the law . Thus he adopted a firm attitude and proceeded with the demolition .  
Chambers could see how the formal garden was a travesty of nature . Yet the style of Brown , by which it was being replaced , blindly followed nature and lacked any sense of taste . It was , in fact , hard to distinguish from the wilderness . Consisting of a few trees planted on a large grassy slope with a winding narrow path , people were spending a lot of money to produce not much more than an extravagant meadow .  
Cleveland was originally a center of machinery and steel . When the city fell on hard times , 30 local entrepreneurs formed a " roundtable " to find a way out of the mess . After four years of extensive discussions , they designed a strategic plan for the direction of future city development .  
Starting in 1984 , this group was able to harness the collective energies of government and industry to promote and complete more than 10 public works projects , and through corporate self-awareness and community supervision were able to gradually improve the quality of the environment . After 10 years of hard work , the city had completely remade itself and become a model of urban renaissance .  
On this point , Chen Chien-te argues that considering the level of funding and the size of the center 's staff , the light beams have been coming on line pretty fast . Still , to meet researchers ' needs , apart from doing all they can to make the light beams more powerful , they are also negotiating with the Japanese synchrotron center to co-fund three hard X-ray beams at the Japanese center that would be specially designated for use by Taiwan researchers .  
The world has indeed progressed . The hasty passing of half a century has seen an improvement in material conditions , people live longer and have more to eat . Yet the most contagious disease of the late twentieth century has become " hard work . "  
In his thinking , the peasants have no month of rest and the life of the fields is one of exhausting hard labor . Yet he also saw the pleasure of rural life , when the peasants have finished work and " the children who were picking melons laugh and wash their feet at the water 's edge as the sun goes down , telling outrageous stories before the evening wind picks up . " This was a simple kind of leisure that the sophisticated literati were unable to appreciate .  
An ad hoc task force comprising both civilian and military investigators is now hard at work on the case , but has discovered signs that many documents have either been lost or falsified . Many worrisome questions remain unanswered : How many people are involved ? How high up does the case reach ?  
Although not a father myself , I can still imagine the excitement , anxiety and even fear which the prospect of a first child 's arrival arouses in parents-to-be , so to some extent I was mentally prepared . But when on the evening of 6 April last year I hurried to the delivery room at National Taiwan University Hospital , I found it hard to associate the Lina I saw lying helplessly on a bed , her belly covered with the tubes and wires of medical instruments , with her usual everyday self .  
For the mass of ordinary people , who are impatient and full of worldly desires , the idea of heaven as an essentially illusory mental state achieved by self-cultivation is abstruse and complex , and the continuous , unrelenting effort required to enter such a state is both hard to understand and hard to achieve . Thus it is understandable that a " heaven " in which religious concepts are simplified and popularized is preferred by proselytizers .  
" He has melded cultural affirmation and ethnic self-respect with literary practice to create a purely Chinese literary form , " says Ng Kim Chew . " This provides solace to his personal sensibilities , both literary and ethnic . " There are few who can compare to ECM writers living in Taiwan in terms of how hard they work , either . Li Yung-ping was once an assistant professor in the department of foreign languages and literatures at National Sun Yat-sen University .  
According to First International Computers ' Jeff Hsue , who has also traveled to the States himself to interview applicants , Taiwan 's ability to design and produce products is hard to beat . But he says that few Taiwanese firms are involved in taking product design to a higher level , whether it be through technological developments , preliminary research or even fundamental academic research , because of the difficulties and risks involved .  
Kuo says that it is impossible to see how Diamond Stage had real respect for these low-status people . Most of the time in the " social concern segments " was spent in bantering among the hosts ( who got their start doing vulgar " dinner shows " ) and the guest star . Was it supposed to express respect just because the hosts bowed and said something like " that looked like hard work " at the end ?  
At dawn , as the first sliver of the sun 's disc rises out of the sea , its rays strike the specially designed large windows of " Lion 's Kingdom . " Inside , several thousand stone lions have passed the night in lonely silence , but suddenly their round , staring eyes sparkle and come alive . As the exhibition room turns from darkness to light , the contours of their bodies , cold and hard in the blackness , become clear-cut and vital .  
Chen Hao-yung of the NIPM says that once a virus develops into an urban virus it becomes very hard to eradicate . Viruses are very simple in structure , and as long as they have live cells to act as their hosts they can continue to reproduce . Hence cities , which have dense human populations and also harbor large numbers of rodents and other pests , are perfect breeding grounds for viruses .  
He compares the rage for the beads to the scams involving the charlatan Buddhist master Song Chi-li who sold doctored photographs of light emanating from his head or the enormous sums spent on Buddha pedestals by the Taiqimen sect . " Strange beasts , " he says , " come out during times of social crisis . " Modern people , with their numerous desires , are hard to satisfy and often lack peace and happiness .  
When she came to Taipei three years ago , she did not choose a foreign firm , in which internal communication is normally done in English . Rather , she entered a local urban planning firm , in which only Chinese was spoken , and learned her Chinese the hard way .  
The year before last the show " Splendors of Imperial China " was well received by the American academic and cultural communities , and afterwards many nations extended invitations to the National Palace Museum . The French government worked especially hard to meet the Musuem 's needs , even passing a new law designating measures to protect foreign art works on exhibition there . Now , 63 years after part of the National Palace Museum collection first went to Europe for a show in London in 1935 , works from the museum are going to Paris .  
Dusk is falling , and having completed a hard day 's work , everyone is relaxing in front of the television in their warm homes , when scenes of hurricane-devastated neighbourhoods appear on the screen . " These are our friends , " intones the familiar voice of Jason Hu , Minister of Foreign Affairs . In what turns out to be the voice-over of an advertisement , he appeals for a helping hand to be extended to long-term friends of the ROC ravaged by Hurricane Mitch .  
On a whiteboard on the wall , we see the words : " The wise are always good at caring for people , so that none is abandoned ; always good at caring for things , so that nothing is thrown away . . . . " This aphoristic couplet , although written in classical Chinese , is not hard to understand , and with the practical illustrations just given by the speaker , no wonder the listeners are all nodding vigorously .  
A long table was filled with all kinds of dishes : deep-fried mahua ( dough twists ) , gangzitou ( hard wheatcakes ) , wheat-flour porridge , puffed-rice cakes , lardy rice , roasted sweet potatoes , cold noodles , huibing ( soft wheatcakes cut up and cooked in soup ) , dough drop soup , rice gruel with mung beans . . . .  
In the lore of Chinese medicine , Shen Nong is credited with having discovered countless medicines by trying out various herbs on himself , but even he would have to be amazed at the willingness of people in modern Taiwan to experiment on themselves . Many people think of cancer as a death sentence . If they are unlucky enough to be hit , they become desperate and will risk any kind of treatment , however unorthodox . In fact , this is not hard to understand .  
It required " a grade one vocational qualification [ equivalent to a degree from a junior college of that time ] and a grade two academic qualification [ equivalent to a degree from a three-year technical high school of that time ] . Preparing for the test was difficult . Days were hard after you went to work too , both in the training period and when you actually were working . If you did n't have an interest in machinery , it would have been hard to take any pleasure in the work , " says Cheng .  
Just as the archeologists were beginning to calm down after the discovery of pit # 1 , the adrenaline started pumping again . As before , the soil was rammed hard , and once again , one stunning item after another was unearthed-over 60 elephant tusks , numerous delicate and complex bronze zun and lei ( an urn-shaped wine vessel ) , bronze heads bedecked in a wide assortment of finery , and a huge bronze mask measuring over 130 cm from side to side .  
Miraculously , however , Hsiung recovered the next day . " I learned about death before dying , " comments Hsiung . To keep the specter of recurrent illness at bay these last 40 years , he has trained hard at taijiquan . It was only once he began to feel that he had really learned something that he branched into dance instruction .  
Saying it wants to block any rampant spread of gambling , the Executive Yuan has decided to propose additional amendments in the next legislative session . However , it will certainly meet strong opposition from the conglomerates and legislators who fought so hard to have the gambling rider passed .  
Modern doctors have to pass exams to get into medical school , and study hard for many years before they can begin their professional lives . It is not easy to become an indigenous shaman either . One must be selected by the ancestral souls . Although one may go on her own to become an acolyte to a practicing shaman , there 's no guarantee that she will " graduate " and win " certification . "  
Taiwan is working hard to attain diplomatic and economic breakthroughs and hoping to gain a deeper understanding of the West . Beset with ethnic and environmental problems , popular culture reigns supreme .  
Evidently some people have found chess so addictive that they have neither slept nor rested , and there is a saying to the effect that " thoughts of spring make it hard to sleep , but chess can help pass a clear night . " No wonder some ancient chess aficionados declared that unless they were in contact with chess , their chi ( energy flow ) and pulse would become irregular and unsteady , and their brains would atrophy .  
Nevertheless , it was hard to resist . Souls locked up for the decade of the Cultural Revolution had lost interest in so-called revolutionary songs that " put politics in command . " Some mainland Chinese with overseas connections brought Teresa Teng 's music into the PRC . Her delicate and warm voice radiated feelings of intimacy , love , and nostalgia , touching the natural feelings that had been suppressed for so long .  
Grandma Wu was adopted into the Wu family at age ten . Within half a year both of her adoptive parents died , and at age 11 she slipped and fell in the sugar cane fields , poking her left eye out . Orphaned and blind in one eye , a hard life lay in store for her , but she made the best of a bad situation .  
Wu Hui-mei , a teacher at Chengcheng Junior High also sees many shortcomings in multiple-track admissions . She says the top schools are very competitive and hard to get into , whereas vocational senior high schools are easy to get into and often short of students . The result is that the schools in the middle end up getting overloaded .  
" When people think about students at star schools they think in terms of students who get good grades , but being a high academic achiever is not the same thing as being gifted , " says Cheng . At Kaohsiung High , which is the most selective school in the Kaohsiung-Pingtung testing zone , quite a few of the students find the textbooks hard to follow . They are so difficult and obscure because their editors designed them to meet the needs of a small group of truly gifted students .  
Lee Juh-feng , a New Party Legislative Yuan member who twice lost in Kinmen County administrator elections , says that although clans perform many positive functions in Kinmen society , the dominance of clans over the exercise of political power has meant that people from minor clans frequently can only play the role of junior ally or balancer and find it hard to rise to prominence themselves . The impact this has had on Kinmen is as severe as the influence of ethnic identity on Taiwan .  
On the steep slope of a tea plantation , two Kuhl 's brown frogs , with teeth protruding from their lower cheeks , are engaged in an instinctive struggle over territory ; it is hard to say who is coming out ahead .  
" In the township of Puli , for example , every single public structure collapsed , including the town hall , the police station , and the schools . That 's hard to believe . Public structures house the very agencies that are supposed to work for our safety . They should be the last buildings to fall , not the first , " says Wang , who adds that the government was only worried about tearing down and clearing away destroyed buildings after the quake , very possibly destroying evidence of fraudulent construction practices in the process .  
Consider the fact that it depends on the central government for less than 10% of its revenues , while the average for Taiwan 's local governments as a whole stands at about 50% . Taipei City can almost make ends meet through its own tax revenues , but other cities are heavily reliant on the central government , and they are trapped in a vicious cycle in which slow economic development makes it difficult for them to broaden their tax base no matter hard they try .  
An article published in 1932 by the Association for Promoting Taiwan 's Scenic Beauty describes the rigors of the road building task . In places the rock was very hard and highly fragmented , making it unsuitable for blasting with gunpowder . " Police squad leader Shibata tied a thick rope around his body and had himself lowered down the mountainside like a bottle on a string . First he cut a foothold wide enough to stand on with one foot , and then gradually enlarged it . "  
In defiance of the stereotypes that many have about those who are hard of hearing , the " Beyond the Summit Leadership Camp for the Hearing-Impaired " was developed and planned by people who are hearing-impaired themselves . Emphasizing scientific and technological training , it employs simultaneous interpretation as well as the virtual technologies of the Internet to help the hearing-impaired create a realm where there are no obstacles to communication .  
Yeh Wen-chi emphasizes that the natural history of each dragonfly species is unique , and it is hard to generalize . For instance , the protected giant spiketail only breeds once in three years . It does not fit the general pattern of insects which live fleeting lives and may produce several generations a year .  
But most farmers and laborers ca n't draw and paint . Born to a poor farming family in hard times , he had God-given artistic talent .
