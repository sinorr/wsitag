In the past the market for shark meat was never well " developed , " and this led to the tragedy of sharks having the fins cut from their living bodies and being thrown back into the sea .  
This is when the problems began . Firstly , when the temple was demolished , the parts were sold off cheap as scrap material , and the demolition was done extremely roughly . The exquisitely carved spirit niche was cut in half , and large wooden structural elements without carvings , such as beams and columns , were thrown away altogether .  
" A lot of people in society have something to say , " affirms Liu Ta-chwan , network director for Chiao Tung University 's computer center . What gives the Net a superior edge over the conventional broadcast media is that radio talk shows have inherent time limitations , and they can cut callers off if they do n't like what is being said . The BBS is different . " It is basically very fair , because the capacity is unlimited . "  
Old local gazetteers report the existence of " black gulches " to both the west and east of Penghu . The former-nicknamed " the Larger Sea " - - separated Penghu from Fujian Province , while the latter ( " the Lesser Sea " ) marked the boundary between Penghu and Taiwan . It was vital for ships trying to cut across these " gulches " to catch a strong wind in the right direction , otherwise they would be carried away by the current and placed in severe danger if they should hit a typhoon .  
In a disordered wooden box , he had packed away things that were dug up by a backhoe when his family was rebuilding their house . Among these objects were pieces of " Taiwanese jade , " of a milky yellow with a tint of gray , and streaked with curving veins , about the size of NT $ 10 coins , but thicker . Some people conjectured that they were ancient coins . Others suggested they were pieces of jade cut away to make earrings .  
I think the fact that China had no huge concentrated structures is definitely related to the trend in thought of a longing for nature . China also has had its high structures , but these buildings are all stretched out on a level , and are not built upward or toward great size . After all , people are a part of nature , and we must remain connected to nature , and can not be cut off . Once you are cut off , people have so many special needs that they will inevitably pay a price .  
Recently another incident was big news : a Maori activist was caught trying to cut down the Monterey pine on One Tree Hill , which was planted last century by British settlers . The New Zealand government spent over NZ $ 10,000 to save the tree , but the Maori finally received a suspended sentence because the court was understanding of his feelings about history .  
Spreading out the map of Taiwan , we see how the Tanshui River system spreads across northern Taiwan like a gigantic hand . Of its two major tributaries , the Pei-shih River in the north is cut off halfway by the high Feitsui Dam , while the Tahan River to the south is blocked by the Shih-men Dam . These structures have created two enormous artificial lakes , which supply one of life 's most basic necessities to a third of Taiwan 's population .  
As for the railway museum , five years ago the TRA set up a museum planning team to find suitable locations , " but all of the NT $ 5 million which we had budgeted was cut by the provincial assembly . They thought it was more appropriate for museums to be planned by cultural and educational departments , " says Chen Te-pei , spreading his hands in a gesture of frustration .  
The landlord refused at first to accept the re-survey result , and hired a private firm of his own . The outcome was the same-his land was cut by about half . It is inferred that when using the triangulation method to measure the original lot , the workmen perhaps neglected to divide by two when calculating the area .  
There used to be a primeval forest here , but it was cut down in the Japanese occupation era and replaced with acacia trees for making charcoal , devil trees for making wooden sandals , and Chinese sweetgum for scenery . These varieties have grown tall here , making for a beautiful wooded area .  
He also described a demonstration of a sword 's quality : at one stroke it cut clean through 10 large nails hammered into a wooden upright of a building , yet its edge was quite undulled . With an effort the blade could be bent almost double , but when released it snapped back as straight as a bowstring .  
A little color will make your features more prominent , your skin color better . . . ' " After spending NT $ 1,500 to have her hair cut short and dyed a not very obvious coffee color , she thinks it was expensive , but " the results were pretty good " because " lots of people ca n't tell I had it done . "  
It is said that his main contribution was to cut down the large trees that shaded the grand avenues for the nouveaux riches , level the dwellings that had stood between them , smooth off the hill tops to make them into gentle slopes , and turn the rectangular lakes and canals into irregular expanses of water and small streams . Then he would make a snaking path on the expanse of grass and let loose a flock of sheep of just the right number .  
Still , by the end of the Qing , the Manchurian noblewoman 's qipao , cut in a very tight fit and appearing noble and graceful , was gradually accepted by women in general . It came to be seen as typically " Chinese dress , " and even Western women have admired it .  
Chinese have always encouraged those whose marriages are in trouble to stay together . Nevertheless , while divorce is certainly not desirable , it is the main way to bring unfortunate marriages to an end . It is an essential form of protection for both sexes . The problem is , when a marriage hits the rocks , can the male and female players agree to cut the knot as smoothly as they tied it ?  
In later years , although Taiwan had made tremendous progress relative to its situation 25 years before , the difficulties it faced in raising funds overseas were proportional to those it faced in surviving internationally , and this created more problems for the center . Moreover , domestically , the island was entering the democratic era . Most citizens , including the legislators who held the purse-strings , did n't understand the importance of the center and its contribution to the world . Consequently , the budget was cut repeatedly .  
Hsichih is a typical example of rapid city development where urban planning failed to give sufficient attention to water resources , where cultivated hillside land was seriously reduced by construction of homes , and where sections of river in Nankang and Hsichih were reclaimed by being filled in and built upon . This latter process cut out bends of the lower sections of the Keelung River in Taipei City , straightening it without consideration to the drainage problems that would be created in upstream at Hsichih and Keelung .  
These included " fish souls , " made from the lips cut from live sturgeon ; " Xi Shi 's bosom , " made with white fat from pufferfish bellies and named after a famous beauty ; and the " gold soup and jade slices " served by Mrs . Song outside Qiantang Gate , which comprised a thick wild rice stem soup and sliced raw common carp and crucian carp .  
After years of research on " split-brain " epileptics ( epileptics whose corpus collosum-a neural structure linking the two sides of the brain-has been cut to limit seizures to one side of their brain ) , Sperry discovered that the left brain is responsible for language , logical thinking and analysis . The right brain , on the other hand , seems to be involved with images , imagination and intuition .  
A long table was filled with all kinds of dishes : deep-fried mahua ( dough twists ) , gangzitou ( hard wheatcakes ) , wheat-flour porridge , puffed-rice cakes , lardy rice , roasted sweet potatoes , cold noodles , huibing ( soft wheatcakes cut up and cooked in soup ) , dough drop soup , rice gruel with mung beans . . . .  
In the early days they paid little attention to decor-in fact the more ramshackle the premises , the less they cost . Before they had electric ovens , they would bake the shaobing in makeshift furnaces made from a large earthenware water pot set inside an oil drum with the top cut off . They would light a charcoal fire inside the pot , and when the coals were glowing and the pot was hot they would stick the shaobing against the inside of the pot to bake .  
The Hsinchu Science-Based Industrial Park , which was being planned at that time , included provision for bilingual schools and American-style residential communities . This was also the period when diplomatic ties with the US were cut , which aroused resentment in Taiwan and led some Taiwanese abroad to return home as an expression of solidarity .  
On September 25 , the Executive Yuan met in extraordinary session to invoke emergency powers , define the boundaries of the disaster area and , for a limited period , suspend various laws and regulations that limit the central government 's discretionary authority over public expenditures , land appropriation , government procurement , and the use of material and equipment belonging to government agencies . The aim was to cut through red tape which could potentially obstruct disaster relief and reconstruction work .  
The Philippine negation of the sovereignty of the Republic of China on Taiwan offended the ROC 's national honor and caused a public outcry here . In the following two months , the Philippines unilaterally cut Taiwan 's weekly passenger quota to 3,000 and sent notice that it would terminate the aviation accord as of October 1 . With dialogue breaking down , Taiwan finally announced the suspension of air links on October 1 . It stated that negotiations for a new aviation agreement could only begin after the old accord had been recognized and respected .  
While she was in the US , it became clear that the United States would soon sever official diplomatic relations with the Republic of China . This event was to have enormous impact upon Taiwanese politics , and Lu was spurred to get involved in politics herself in order to use political power to correct the ills of society . In order to struggle for women 's rights and democracy , she cut her studies short and returned to Taiwan in 1978 to run for the National Assembly .  
But a human race that has lost contact with tradition would be like an orchid cut off from its roots . That would leave an unfillable void at the heart of life . The cold feeling of alienation that has grown up in our urban civilization makes itself obvious to us in many ways . Fortunately , not everyone is seduced by our glittering society .  
This film returns time and again to images of patriotic slogans on local walls , highlighting the helpless feeling of knowing that the island one calls home has been chosen to serve as a battlefield . Homesick 2000 Meters shows how near the cities of Kinmen and Xiamen are across the water , yet how far apart their residents live due to political reality . The empty scenes in this documentary highlight the longing for home of a people cut off from their roots .  
Pan has spent more than 1000 days in the last six years roaming through Taiwan 's mountains in pursuit of frogs . It 's not just anyone who is cut out for this pursuit , for frogs are especially active at night , when most people are in dreamland . He explores dark forests , deep valleys , and remote watercourses , searching for the 31 species of frogs and toads in Taiwan . He has become the first nature lover to make a complete record of the geographic distribution and life histories of Taiwan 's frogs .  
" The two easiest places to make a living in Taiwan back then were Chiufen in the north ( with its gold mine in Chinkuashih ) and Chishan in the south , " says Ku , who recalls that a kilo of bananas sold for NT $ 6 . One only needed to cut down a single bunch of bananas weighing 30 kilos to take in NT $ 180 , the equivalent of an entire week 's pay back then for the average working woman .  
In July the city and the central government quarreled over how much money the city would be allotted in the national budget , and the city 's share was cut by NT $ 6 billion . Then in October the Executive Yuan lowered the population requirement for self-governing status , and Taichung City joined Taipei and Kaohsiung as a special self-administered municipality . Various other large cities and counties also hope to achieve this so as to enjoy the same status as Taipei .  
In Professor Tseng 's opinion , " It 's not easy to create a more transparent formula . Due to current political realities , the proportion of the Tax Redistribution Fund allocated to the wealthier local governments ca n't be cut too drastically . Disputes are inevitable , but if this constant arguing yields a better system , then it will have been worth the trouble . "  
An article published in 1932 by the Association for Promoting Taiwan 's Scenic Beauty describes the rigors of the road building task . In places the rock was very hard and highly fragmented , making it unsuitable for blasting with gunpowder . " Police squad leader Shibata tied a thick rope around his body and had himself lowered down the mountainside like a bottle on a string . First he cut a foothold wide enough to stand on with one foot , and then gradually enlarged it . "  
As for the Taiwan red cypress-merihi in Japanese-it is even more magnificent in appearance than the Taiwan yellow cypress . But the Taiwan red cypress 's trunk is often divided , and because it mostly grows in wet river valleys the heartwood is prone to be eaten away by bacteria , producing strangely tangled hollow trees . The crown is also broad and difficult to cut .  
Fish noodles are a special type of noodle particular to China 's southeast coastal region . They are made from four parts cornstarch and six parts eel , drum , and other high-grade fish . The mass is then rolled , pressed , cut , and dried in the sun .  
Years ago , the Japanese built the Mienyueh branch of the Alishan Mountain Railway to gain access to the cypress forests for logging . As the engineers cut their way along mountainsides and hacked out tunnels , they exposed large areas of steep rock face shaded by dense jungle above , and thus unwittingly produced excellent conditions for pleiones to grow .  
Apart from a more diverse choice of agricultural produce , customs duties on imported motor vehicles will be cut by 30% , and many large supermarket chains have already signed agreements with mainland Chinese manufacturers to import large quantities of products such as electrical appliances at bargain prices . In a time of economic recession , consumers will be able to enjoy the same standard of consumption while spending less .  
Director Stanley Kwan cut certain inflammatory portions of the original work , employing a plain narrative style to tell the story in a matter-of-fact way . In the absence of the exhibitionist language seen in earlier works of Kwan 's , Wen Tien-hsiang qualifies the final version as " accessible without being low-brow . "  
Tzeng Ren-yow remarks , " Over the last two or three years , attention has been focused on flooding . " However , Tzeng himself is far more concerned about the coming drought . " Droughts are more costly than floods . Fields lie fallow ; reservoirs run short of water ; factories have their water cut off ; there is little water for residential use ; rivers become less able to cleanse themselves . . . .  
To modern people , divorced from sacred experience and cut off from traditional rituals , Liuh suggests that you can reconstruct your own personal altar , a corner where you can find peace and quiet , undisturbed , where you can listen to your own spirit and connect with the universe , a place where you belong and can always return on your journey through life .  
Lin remarks that a 40% cut for the franchisor is reasonable since Wayoung started out as a material supplier , specializing in importing activated charcoal reverse osmosis filters , which are the key component for purifying water .  
Take a model of a fishing boat : The hull is white , with reflective beads attached as fishing lamps . Underneath the boat , transparent light blue acrylic has been cut to simulate ocean waves , and white cotton serves as the foam at the crests of the waves .  
Chen Yuh-jean says there is no need for frustration . World Heritage guidelines place special importance on the agreement and cooperation of local residents . " So long as people are enlightened about the real value of the old Mountain Line , " he says , speaking of one of the sites less likely to make the final cut , " and preserve its historical and cultural value and develop only economic activities that are compatible with those values , then ten years from now it may find itself at the top of the list . "  
The 23-kilometer-long old Mountain Line was built in 1908 , early in the Japanese colonial era . Trains on this line began by winding through the precipices of Sanyi Rural Township , and from there cut through mountains and crossed rivers . This was the last north-south line in western Taiwan to be completed , and the most difficult stretch of track from an engineering point of view , with nine tunnels and three bridges .  
The mid-1990s saw a crisis in the local paint industry as production costs increased in Taiwan . Most traditional paint factories closed or moved overseas , while those that remained were forced to make layoffs or cut back salaries .  
Efforts to cut back on plastic waste shifted into a higher gear on January 1 with a measure restricting the use of plastic bags and plastic ( including expanded polystyrene , i.e . " styrofoam " ) disposable eating utensils . This marks the second phase of implementation of a policy that was first introduced on a more limited scale last July , when the government clamped down on the use of such items by government agencies , membership supermarkets for military personnel , and public and private schools .  
The public has been largely supportive of the new policy , but it has been noted that there are also big problems with the paper products now being used as an alternative by many retail establishments . To cut costs , 90% of all makers of paper food containers in Taiwan print on the products with substandard ink . To spruce up their products and make them more resistant to wear and tear , many buyers ask paper-goods makers to coat their products with a thin plastic film , which makes the product unrecyclable .  
It is a great pity , but as the number of graduation credits required to graduate from the vocational system has declined over the years , and with no rules indicating the minimum number of credits to be earned from practical work , related classes have come under pressure . As a result , many private schools have chosen to cut subjects that involve physical work or extra financing , which ensures students are given fewer and fewer opportunities to familiarize themselves with actual physical operations .  
In the half year that he worked on the project , he raised rabbits and rats in his workshop , would go to the Niuhsu area of Beikang in order to shoot pictures of water buffalo , visited the zoo to gaze at monkeys , perused encyclopedias to gain a better understanding of animal behavior , and then labored on the cut tin pieces on his work table , which were hammered into shape , inlaid with ornamentation and welded without casting .  
After finding the right tool , and keeping in mind that " it 's all a matter of controlling the force , " after countless broken eggs due to squeezing or pushing too hard , Kuan Chun-mai eventually developed his own creative " knife withdrawal technique " whereby an even , well distributed pressure is applied when withdrawing the knife point from the cut . The principle is roughly similar to the " cue withdrawal technique " used in billiards .  
Huang Ming-che cut an impressive figure among his generation of young painters , the more so because through his engagement with Western masters close to his own sensibility , he continuously rediscovered where he needed to go . Without turning his back on his unique artistic qualities , Huang had the courage to accept other artists ' strong points . He gradually developed his own style and found new techniques to express it . His painting style evolved from Taiwanese localism to sentimentalism .  
Because of US bombing raids during World War II , the Japanese instituted a policy of dispersal . When Chiu was six the whole family was moved to his maternal grandmother 's house in Tunghsiao Township , Miaoli County . American and Japanese planes would frequently engage in dogfights overhead , and each time the aerial battles finished , the local residents would go to the waterside in search of aluminum and plexiglas . The pieces of aluminum could be cut and trimmed into rice spatulas , and the plexiglas could be turned into toys .  
He displayed his deep understanding of life 's mysteries in his carving Intermingling Grief and Joy , in which an entire body , save the head , appeared to be melting . For the face , he carved his own image , with teary eyes , the top of his skull cut open , and a lotus blossom seemingly inserted in the opening . It clearly conveyed the great joy of transcendence of self that he had experienced at that moment .  
But neglected all along was the Aborigines ' viewpoint and what they had to say , " points out Sun Ta-chuan . He gives an example : developing the water resources of the mountain regions was for the benefit of those downstream , while the Aborigines living upstream were frequently without potable water . When the mountain regions were included in national parks , the Aborigines were forced to leave the area , losing their original living space and sacred territory , and they were cut off from their traditional cultural roots .  
He cited examples such as Vienna , where a referendum was held to stop a downtown university from cutting down six trees , and Hawaii , the first place in the US to legislate to protect its urban foliage by passing a law that required permission to cut or move any tree over eight feet tall , whether in a private garden or a public park .  
But even if he was often scatterbrained and had a dull look in his eyes off the field , he was extraordinary when he took the mound , almost never disappointing Coach Huang . With a 145-km / h fastball coming off his hand , a slow breaking ball that cut a huge arc on its way to the plate , and a tricky slider , hitters on the opposing teams could see Wu 's pitches dance their way to the plate , but one after another they failed to get a bat on the ball .  
" They are always so happy , though , just because I 'm doing the shopping and preparing meals for them , " Day says . Filial piety is n't difficult ; one just needs to cater to another 's pleasures . His father , for example , loves to eat a traditional salted pork dish , so Day practiced until he learned the techniques for making it , mastering each step , from choosing the right cut of meat to the actual cooking and dressing of the meat .  
Whenever heavy weather approaches , Taiwan 's beautiful landscape is increasingly marred by fear . The typhoon also flooded the city of Sanchung , Taipei County for the first time in over 30 years , after contractors cut corners in the construction of a subway line . The government now faces a compensation bill of NT $ 2 billion . The incident holds lessons for us all .  
due to the international sanctions , yugoslavia 's cross border transportation , trade , and inflows of foreign capital and technology have all been cut off , forcing a large number of researchers to go abroad and paralyzing the country 's scientific and technological research system  
Reforms this year included a substantial cut in corporate taxes , sharp reduction in import tariffs on capital goods and industrial inputs , financial sector liberalization and full currency convertibility on the current account .  
We also stress the need to complete without delay comprehensive and verifiable treaties to ban nuclear-weapon tests and to cut off the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices .  
At the outset of this statement , I should like to express our deepest sympathy to the delegation and Government of France and to the families of the two valiant and honourable members of the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) whose valuable lives were cut short at such an early age by the merciless and cold-blooded actions of professional killers , whoever they may be .  
We are taking stock of negative , devastating and genocide effects of sanctions on the health of the people of Yugoslavia and demonstrate in an expert way , corroborated by arguments , to what extent the sanctions have held us back in the implementation of the health care of the population , how much damage , pain and evil was inflicted and how many innocent lives were cut off as a result .  
NULLThe themes should be selected in the light of the principal objectives of the dialogue : to promote broader and deeper understanding of issues of a global or transboundary nature that cut across individual , regional or group interests .  
The economic crisis faced by LDCs has further undermined health conditions in many countries as living standards have fallen , health services have been cut owing to budgetary pressures , and the availability of imported medicines and other medical supplies has dwindled .  
The immediate effects of the beginning of the war in 1991 were as follows : the tourist market was depressed as a result of the lack of security ; many hotels and private accommodations were occupied by displaced persons and refugees ; commercial and communication links were immediately cut from the north ; and routes inland towards Bosnia and Herzegovina were blocked .

Pakistan 's case , the tariffs applicable to certain products which were his country 's principal exports had been cut by less than one third ; in textiles , the waiver from GATT rules had been extended for another 10 years ; in agriculture subsidies for production and exports had been approved with the promise of reforms at some vague moment in the future ; and the measures taken in the area of services had had a negative impact on countries with abundant skilled manpower , such as Pakistan .  
The destruction , massacres and immeasurable suffering in Lebanon reported by the mass media , which show human bodies that have been cut up and mutilated , is unequivocal proof of the barbaric nature of the aggression taking place at the hands of the Israelis .  
The economic crisis faced by LDCs has further undermined health conditions in many countries as living standards have fallen , health services have been cut owing to budgetary pressures , and the availability of imported medicines and other medical supplies has dwindled .  
The cease-fire broke down on 29 April when an attempted meeting of the Council of State , attended by Chairman Sankawulo together with Councilmen Taylor and Kromah , was cut short after fighting erupted between ULIMO-J and NPFL / ULIMO-K forces near the executive mansion .  NULLThe fighting rapidly escalated overnight into some of the worst fighting witnessed since the start of the civil war in December 1989 .  
Steps to cut total transport costs will be of real significance to the growth of the Central Asian economies , whether they come about by developing new alternative routes , increasing competition on all routes , improving the quality and efficiency of transport infrastructure and services , or cooperative efforts to reduce waste and inefficiency by installing the most advanced international concepts of transit transport facilitation .  
In my view , the three sessions of the open _ ended informal Presidential consultations , each devoted to such issues as nuclear disarmament , a fissile material cut _ off treaty and anti _ personnel landmines , were useful and contributed to moving the overall process of the CD forward .  
The intensive consultations led by your distinguished predecessor Ambassador Yung Sun showed that within these two fields there are at least three issues commanding quite broad support , namely the fissile material cut _ off , nuclear disarmament and the complex issue of anti _ personnel landmines . 
The consultations proved to be useful , allowing me to see better where delegations stand as far as their positions on three important issues are concerned : namely , on nuclear disarmament , the fissile material cut _ off treaty and anti _ personnel landmines , as well as , in some cases , on other issues of major interest to them . 
A number of members of the Committee expressed concern that in the current situation of dwindling financial resources throughout the United Nations system , there was a tendency in many organizations to cut the funding for public information activities , as public information work was difficult to define in quantitative terms .  
So if we are not able to solve the daunting issue of nuclear disarmament in one great stroke now , let us attend to what is feasible and in doing so add another valuable facet , namely a treaty on fissile material cut _ off ( FMCT ) , to this multifaceted edifice .  
The administrative component of UNMOT would be strengthened to support the larger Mission , as would its communications , road and air transport and other facilities , bearing in mind the mountainous terrain and the bad state of repair of the roads , many of which are cut off as a result of damage or will be impassable for several months in winter .  
The Secretary-General had , in his previous report ( A / 50 / 480 ) , suggested that themes be selected in the light of the principal objectives of the dialogue ; that is , to promote broader and deeper understanding of issues of a global or transboundary nature that cut across individual , regional or group interests .  
It was suggested that such opportunities may be found in the sectors where developing countries have ( i ) natural and geographical advantages ; ( ii ) an education and training basis to provide skilled workers ; ( iii ) the competitive advantage provided by lower wages ; and ( iv ) the possibility to cut the cost of services further , utilizing the communication and transport technology .  
A growing number of countries on our continent , including my own country , Ethiopia , have taken decisive measures to liberalize their economies , to cut Government spending , to institute sound macroeconomic policies and to enhance the role of the private sector and civil society .  
The Committee agreed that the independence and extensive experience of its members in a wide range of development-related fields provided it with a comparative advantage as a forum for the discussion and review of emerging development issues facing developing countries , particularly where such issues were cross-sectoral or cut across the responsibilities of various international bodies or agencies .  
Fortunately the 1995 Conference of NPT States parties has helped to identify the way forward by adopting the Principles and objectives for non _ proliferation and disarmament , in which the section on Nuclear disarmament sets out the importance to the international community of three specific objectives : the completion of negotiations for a comprehensive test _ ban treaty no later than 1996 ; the immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off treaty ; and systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally .  
We also remain hopeful that on the basis of the continued commitments of member States of the Conference to the shared goals of global disarmament it will be able to resolve the many difficult issues on its agenda , including the contentious issue of a fissile cut _ off .  
Trying to evade the cut _ off negotiations , which constitute an essential stage , would mean remaining at the stage of declamatory phrases or placing oneself in the final perspective of nuclear disarmament in the framework of general and complete disarmament : in either case , no concrete progress can be expected in the near future .  
In order to cut the main links between the insurgent groups and the civilian population , SLORC has forced entire communities living in the border area between Myanmar and Thailand to move to relocation sites which are subject to tight military control .  
Germany has already stated its priorities for this work programme : the immediate start of negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off and on an effective , legally binding international agreement to ban anti _ personnel mines .  
The measures to prevent and control the phenomenon , which need to be elaborated and implemented at the national and international levels , cut across the economic , social , cultural , political and legal fields .  
Having accomplished its work on the CTBT , the CD must continue to play its role in non _ proliferation and nuclear disarmament by starting , without further delay , its overdue work on a treaty to prohibit the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , otherwise referred to as the cut _ off convention ( FMCT ) .  
For our part , I can confirm that the United Kingdom would like to see the agenda of the Conference on Disarmament reflect our key priorities on the disarmament agenda , and for the record I confirm that on the nuclear side , our top priority is the urgent negotiation and conclusion of a fissile material cut _ off treaty , and on the conventional side , our top priority is to work towards the global ban on APLs to complement the Ottawa treaty , which we hope will be opened for signature this December . 
We heard one such unfortunate remark at last week 's plenary when it was asserted that the five declared nuclear Powers want the CD to discuss only small items such as anti _ personnel landmines and a fissile material cut _ off treaty .  
While a multilateral and effectively verifiable agreement to cease future production of fissile material may be possible now , it is our strong view that the cut _ off treaty should not try comprehensively to address existing stocks .  
We are aware of an existing view that the cut _ off of future fissile material production is a non-proliferation issue unrelated to nuclear disarmament .  
We are very close to agreement as regards agenda item 1 , although we remain profoundly disturbed by the lack of any reference _ however fleeting _ to fissile material cut _ off , a subject of earlier consensus in this Conference .  
The decisions of the Constitutional Court clearly show that , in the Colombian legal system , military jurisdiction is of a special and exceptional nature and may handle the offences committed only when the punishable acts have a clear _ cut , close and direct link with official duties .  
That the historical piecemeal approach to natural disasters needed to be replaced with an integrated approach one that would cut across natural hazards and would include planning , preparedness , prevention , warnings , relief and rehabilitation , and that a broader appreciation of the positive relationship between disaster reduction and economic and social development goals was required .  
The European Union believes that a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable fissile material cut _ off treaty constitutes , after the CTBT , a major step towards the achievement of both the nuclear non _ proliferation and nuclear disarmament objectives envisaged in the NPT document on principles and objectives .  
But I will repeat one clear and uncontested truth : a cut _ off treaty will make a substantial , vital and practical contribution to advancing the goal of global nuclear disarmament .  
In selecting the theme for the high-level dialogue , the Assembly may wish to recall that the Secretary-General had suggested that themes be selected in the light of the principal objectives of the dialogue , that is , to promote broader and deeper understanding of issues of a global or transboundary nature that cut across individual , regional or group interests .  
The first mans genitals were cut off completely , and he was abandoned alongside his comrade who had died by having his heart torn out ; dying in the forest , he was later rescued but was left with irreparable physical damage .  
Within a year , the combined current account of these five countries has changed from a deficit of about $ 25-billion in 1997 to a surplus of almost $ 72-billion in 1998.4 This dramatic turnaround reflected factors due to a sharp cut in external finance , cuts in imports , and recently significant increases in exports . 
According to a survey undertaken some time ago among the National Councils of Catholic Bishops by the Opera Pia , a Catholic Church society for the ageing , nearly all societies reported overt or underlying marginalization of the aged that cut across the economic , psychological and social aspects of their lives .  
However , the full knowledge of the advantages of nuclear energy and of the economic and social situation of most countries , in particular of the developing countries , has not prevented some developed countries from maintaining attitudes counter to the objectives of the IAEA trying to cut technical assistance programmes , decreasing their contributions to the fund created for such purposes or selectively putting conditions on the funds use .  
Non-discrimination is the overriding principle of international human rights law and thus applies to civil and political , as well as to economic , social and cultural rights , as well as to the rights of the child which cut across these two categories .

" A resident named Peng , born and raised in Yushan , who now lives beneath the Sun City course , says that Sun City carved away numerous hill tops that were previously forest rarely visited by people .  
Han Chinese migrants to Taiwan who tried these mats were all enthusiastic about them , so many women started making them . The addition of hand-woven patterns started a real fashion for the mats , making them a much-sought-after commodity , and high officials and rich folk going to the capital also looked on " dragon and phoenix mats " as ideal gifts to present to superiors . The rushes began to be specially cultivated instead of just being cut from the wild .  
For instance , some factories only carve all kinds of Bodhidarma figures , while others specialize in human figures , or birds and animals , and so on . " Collective creation on a production line " is also a widespread method . To take a religious statue as an example , after the rough wooden blank has been cut out , the carving of its face , hands , curves and background , the application of gold leaf and other operations are all the responsibility of different specialists .  
When employers cut and runThe method of calculating severance pay is that workers are entitled to receive one month 's average wages for each full year worked . So-called " average wages " is the average amount of money earned over the previous six months , including basic salary , overtime pay , and fixed subsidies .  
But because not all fishes ' fins have the " honor " of being one of the " eight treasures , " no other fish can help sharks spread their risk . For sharks ' situation is just the opposite of other fish , whose flesh is dear but whose fins are cheap . In the past the market for shark meat was never well " developed , " and this led to the tragedy of sharks having the fins cut from their living bodies and being thrown back into the sea .  
This is when the problems began . Firstly , when the temple was demolished , the parts were sold off cheap as scrap material , and the demolition was done extremely roughly . The exquisitely carved spirit niche was cut in half , and large wooden structural elements without carvings , such as beams and columns , were thrown away altogether .  
" A lot of people in society have something to say , " affirms Liu Ta-chwan , network director for Chiao Tung University 's computer center . What gives the Net a superior edge over the conventional broadcast media is that radio talk shows have inherent time limitations , and they can cut callers off if they do n't like what is being said . The BBS is different . " It is basically very fair , because the capacity is unlimited . "  
Old local gazetteers report the existence of " black gulches " to both the west and east of Penghu . The former-nicknamed " the Larger Sea " - - separated Penghu from Fujian Province , while the latter ( " the Lesser Sea " ) marked the boundary between Penghu and Taiwan . It was vital for ships trying to cut across these " gulches " to catch a strong wind in the right direction , otherwise they would be carried away by the current and placed in severe danger if they should hit a typhoon .  
In a disordered wooden box , he had packed away things that were dug up by a backhoe when his family was rebuilding their house . Among these objects were pieces of " Taiwanese jade , " of a milky yellow with a tint of gray , and streaked with curving veins , about the size of NT $ 10 coins , but thicker . Some people conjectured that they were ancient coins . Others suggested they were pieces of jade cut away to make earrings .  
I think the fact that China had no huge concentrated structures is definitely related to the trend in thought of a longing for nature . China also has had its high structures , but these buildings are all stretched out on a level , and are not built upward or toward great size . After all , people are a part of nature , and we must remain connected to nature , and can not be cut off . Once you are cut off , people have so many special needs that they will inevitably pay a price .  
Recently another incident was big news : a Maori activist was caught trying to cut down the Monterey pine on One Tree Hill , which was planted last century by British settlers . The New Zealand government spent over NZ $ 10,000 to save the tree , but the Maori finally received a suspended sentence because the court was understanding of his feelings about history .  
Spreading out the map of Taiwan , we see how the Tanshui River system spreads across northern Taiwan like a gigantic hand . Of its two major tributaries , the Pei-shih River in the north is cut off halfway by the high Feitsui Dam , while the Tahan River to the south is blocked by the Shih-men Dam . These structures have created two enormous artificial lakes , which supply one of life 's most basic necessities to a third of Taiwan 's population .  
As for the railway museum , five years ago the TRA set up a museum planning team to find suitable locations , " but all of the NT $ 5 million which we had budgeted was cut by the provincial assembly . They thought it was more appropriate for museums to be planned by cultural and educational departments , " says Chen Te-pei , spreading his hands in a gesture of frustration .  
The landlord refused at first to accept the re-survey result , and hired a private firm of his own . The outcome was the same-his land was cut by about half . It is inferred that when using the triangulation method to measure the original lot , the workmen perhaps neglected to divide by two when calculating the area .  
There used to be a primeval forest here , but it was cut down in the Japanese occupation era and replaced with acacia trees for making charcoal , devil trees for making wooden sandals , and Chinese sweetgum for scenery . These varieties have grown tall here , making for a beautiful wooded area .  
He also described a demonstration of a sword 's quality : at one stroke it cut clean through 10 large nails hammered into a wooden upright of a building , yet its edge was quite undulled . With an effort the blade could be bent almost double , but when released it snapped back as straight as a bowstring .  
A little color will make your features more prominent , your skin color better . . . ' " After spending NT $ 1,500 to have her hair cut short and dyed a not very obvious coffee color , she thinks it was expensive , but " the results were pretty good " because " lots of people ca n't tell I had it done . "  
It is said that his main contribution was to cut down the large trees that shaded the grand avenues for the nouveaux riches , level the dwellings that had stood between them , smooth off the hill tops to make them into gentle slopes , and turn the rectangular lakes and canals into irregular expanses of water and small streams . Then he would make a snaking path on the expanse of grass and let loose a flock of sheep of just the right number .  
Still , by the end of the Qing , the Manchurian noblewoman 's qipao , cut in a very tight fit and appearing noble and graceful , was gradually accepted by women in general . It came to be seen as typically " Chinese dress , " and even Western women have admired it .  
Chinese have always encouraged those whose marriages are in trouble to stay together . Nevertheless , while divorce is certainly not desirable , it is the main way to bring unfortunate marriages to an end . It is an essential form of protection for both sexes . The problem is , when a marriage hits the rocks , can the male and female players agree to cut the knot as smoothly as they tied it ?  
In later years , although Taiwan had made tremendous progress relative to its situation 25 years before , the difficulties it faced in raising funds overseas were proportional to those it faced in surviving internationally , and this created more problems for the center . Moreover , domestically , the island was entering the democratic era . Most citizens , including the legislators who held the purse-strings , did n't understand the importance of the center and its contribution to the world . Consequently , the budget was cut repeatedly .  
Hsichih is a typical example of rapid city development where urban planning failed to give sufficient attention to water resources , where cultivated hillside land was seriously reduced by construction of homes , and where sections of river in Nankang and Hsichih were reclaimed by being filled in and built upon . This latter process cut out bends of the lower sections of the Keelung River in Taipei City , straightening it without consideration to the drainage problems that would be created in upstream at Hsichih and Keelung .  
These included " fish souls , " made from the lips cut from live sturgeon ; " Xi Shi 's bosom , " made with white fat from pufferfish bellies and named after a famous beauty ; and the " gold soup and jade slices " served by Mrs . Song outside Qiantang Gate , which comprised a thick wild rice stem soup and sliced raw common carp and crucian carp .  
After years of research on " split-brain " epileptics ( epileptics whose corpus collosum-a neural structure linking the two sides of the brain-has been cut to limit seizures to one side of their brain ) , Sperry discovered that the left brain is responsible for language , logical thinking and analysis . The right brain , on the other hand , seems to be involved with images , imagination and intuition .  
A long table was filled with all kinds of dishes : deep-fried mahua ( dough twists ) , gangzitou ( hard wheatcakes ) , wheat-flour porridge , puffed-rice cakes , lardy rice , roasted sweet potatoes , cold noodles , huibing ( soft wheatcakes cut up and cooked in soup ) , dough drop soup , rice gruel with mung beans . . . .  
In the early days they paid little attention to decor-in fact the more ramshackle the premises , the less they cost . Before they had electric ovens , they would bake the shaobing in makeshift furnaces made from a large earthenware water pot set inside an oil drum with the top cut off . They would light a charcoal fire inside the pot , and when the coals were glowing and the pot was hot they would stick the shaobing against the inside of the pot to bake .  
The Hsinchu Science-Based Industrial Park , which was being planned at that time , included provision for bilingual schools and American-style residential communities . This was also the period when diplomatic ties with the US were cut , which aroused resentment in Taiwan and led some Taiwanese abroad to return home as an expression of solidarity .  
On September 25 , the Executive Yuan met in extraordinary session to invoke emergency powers , define the boundaries of the disaster area and , for a limited period , suspend various laws and regulations that limit the central government 's discretionary authority over public expenditures , land appropriation , government procurement , and the use of material and equipment belonging to government agencies . The aim was to cut through red tape which could potentially obstruct disaster relief and reconstruction work .  
The Philippine negation of the sovereignty of the Republic of China on Taiwan offended the ROC 's national honor and caused a public outcry here . In the following two months , the Philippines unilaterally cut Taiwan 's weekly passenger quota to 3,000 and sent notice that it would terminate the aviation accord as of October 1 . With dialogue breaking down , Taiwan finally announced the suspension of air links on October 1 . It stated that negotiations for a new aviation agreement could only begin after the old accord had been recognized and respected .  
While she was in the US , it became clear that the United States would soon sever official diplomatic relations with the Republic of China . This event was to have enormous impact upon Taiwanese politics , and Lu was spurred to get involved in politics herself in order to use political power to correct the ills of society . In order to struggle for women 's rights and democracy , she cut her studies short and returned to Taiwan in 1978 to run for the National Assembly .  
But a human race that has lost contact with tradition would be like an orchid cut off from its roots . That would leave an unfillable void at the heart of life . The cold feeling of alienation that has grown up in our urban civilization makes itself obvious to us in many ways . Fortunately , not everyone is seduced by our glittering society .  
This film returns time and again to images of patriotic slogans on local walls , highlighting the helpless feeling of knowing that the island one calls home has been chosen to serve as a battlefield . Homesick 2000 Meters shows how near the cities of Kinmen and Xiamen are across the water , yet how far apart their residents live due to political reality . The empty scenes in this documentary highlight the longing for home of a people cut off from their roots .  
Pan has spent more than 1000 days in the last six years roaming through Taiwan 's mountains in pursuit of frogs . It 's not just anyone who is cut out for this pursuit , for frogs are especially active at night , when most people are in dreamland . He explores dark forests , deep valleys , and remote watercourses , searching for the 31 species of frogs and toads in Taiwan . He has become the first nature lover to make a complete record of the geographic distribution and life histories of Taiwan 's frogs .  
" The two easiest places to make a living in Taiwan back then were Chiufen in the north ( with its gold mine in Chinkuashih ) and Chishan in the south , " says Ku , who recalls that a kilo of bananas sold for NT $ 6 . One only needed to cut down a single bunch of bananas weighing 30 kilos to take in NT $ 180 , the equivalent of an entire week 's pay back then for the average working woman .  
In July the city and the central government quarreled over how much money the city would be allotted in the national budget , and the city 's share was cut by NT $ 6 billion . Then in October the Executive Yuan lowered the population requirement for self-governing status , and Taichung City joined Taipei and Kaohsiung as a special self-administered municipality . Various other large cities and counties also hope to achieve this so as to enjoy the same status as Taipei .  
In Professor Tseng 's opinion , " It 's not easy to create a more transparent formula . Due to current political realities , the proportion of the Tax Redistribution Fund allocated to the wealthier local governments ca n't be cut too drastically . Disputes are inevitable , but if this constant arguing yields a better system , then it will have been worth the trouble . "  
An article published in 1932 by the Association for Promoting Taiwan 's Scenic Beauty describes the rigors of the road building task . In places the rock was very hard and highly fragmented , making it unsuitable for blasting with gunpowder . " Police squad leader Shibata tied a thick rope around his body and had himself lowered down the mountainside like a bottle on a string . First he cut a foothold wide enough to stand on with one foot , and then gradually enlarged it . "  
As for the Taiwan red cypress-merihi in Japanese-it is even more magnificent in appearance than the Taiwan yellow cypress . But the Taiwan red cypress 's trunk is often divided , and because it mostly grows in wet river valleys the heartwood is prone to be eaten away by bacteria , producing strangely tangled hollow trees . The crown is also broad and difficult to cut .  
Fish noodles are a special type of noodle particular to China 's southeast coastal region . They are made from four parts cornstarch and six parts eel , drum , and other high-grade fish . The mass is then rolled , pressed , cut , and dried in the sun .  
Years ago , the Japanese built the Mienyueh branch of the Alishan Mountain Railway to gain access to the cypress forests for logging . As the engineers cut their way along mountainsides and hacked out tunnels , they exposed large areas of steep rock face shaded by dense jungle above , and thus unwittingly produced excellent conditions for pleiones to grow .  
Apart from a more diverse choice of agricultural produce , customs duties on imported motor vehicles will be cut by 30% , and many large supermarket chains have already signed agreements with mainland Chinese manufacturers to import large quantities of products such as electrical appliances at bargain prices . In a time of economic recession , consumers will be able to enjoy the same standard of consumption while spending less .  
Director Stanley Kwan cut certain inflammatory portions of the original work , employing a plain narrative style to tell the story in a matter-of-fact way . In the absence of the exhibitionist language seen in earlier works of Kwan 's , Wen Tien-hsiang qualifies the final version as " accessible without being low-brow . "  
Tzeng Ren-yow remarks , " Over the last two or three years , attention has been focused on flooding . " However , Tzeng himself is far more concerned about the coming drought . " Droughts are more costly than floods . Fields lie fallow ; reservoirs run short of water ; factories have their water cut off ; there is little water for residential use ; rivers become less able to cleanse themselves . . . .  
To modern people , divorced from sacred experience and cut off from traditional rituals , Liuh suggests that you can reconstruct your own personal altar , a corner where you can find peace and quiet , undisturbed , where you can listen to your own spirit and connect with the universe , a place where you belong and can always return on your journey through life .  
Lin remarks that a 40% cut for the franchisor is reasonable since Wayoung started out as a material supplier , specializing in importing activated charcoal reverse osmosis filters , which are the key component for purifying water .  
Take a model of a fishing boat : The hull is white , with reflective beads attached as fishing lamps . Underneath the boat , transparent light blue acrylic has been cut to simulate ocean waves , and white cotton serves as the foam at the crests of the waves .  
Chen Yuh-jean says there is no need for frustration . World Heritage guidelines place special importance on the agreement and cooperation of local residents . " So long as people are enlightened about the real value of the old Mountain Line , " he says , speaking of one of the sites less likely to make the final cut , " and preserve its historical and cultural value and develop only economic activities that are compatible with those values , then ten years from now it may find itself at the top of the list . "  
The 23-kilometer-long old Mountain Line was built in 1908 , early in the Japanese colonial era . Trains on this line began by winding through the precipices of Sanyi Rural Township , and from there cut through mountains and crossed rivers . This was the last north-south line in western Taiwan to be completed , and the most difficult stretch of track from an engineering point of view , with nine tunnels and three bridges .  
The mid-1990s saw a crisis in the local paint industry as production costs increased in Taiwan . Most traditional paint factories closed or moved overseas , while those that remained were forced to make layoffs or cut back salaries .  
Efforts to cut back on plastic waste shifted into a higher gear on January 1 with a measure restricting the use of plastic bags and plastic ( including expanded polystyrene , i.e . " styrofoam " ) disposable eating utensils . This marks the second phase of implementation of a policy that was first introduced on a more limited scale last July , when the government clamped down on the use of such items by government agencies , membership supermarkets for military personnel , and public and private schools .  
The public has been largely supportive of the new policy , but it has been noted that there are also big problems with the paper products now being used as an alternative by many retail establishments . To cut costs , 90% of all makers of paper food containers in Taiwan print on the products with substandard ink . To spruce up their products and make them more resistant to wear and tear , many buyers ask paper-goods makers to coat their products with a thin plastic film , which makes the product unrecyclable .  
It is a great pity , but as the number of graduation credits required to graduate from the vocational system has declined over the years , and with no rules indicating the minimum number of credits to be earned from practical work , related classes have come under pressure . As a result , many private schools have chosen to cut subjects that involve physical work or extra financing , which ensures students are given fewer and fewer opportunities to familiarize themselves with actual physical operations .  
In the half year that he worked on the project , he raised rabbits and rats in his workshop , would go to the Niuhsu area of Beikang in order to shoot pictures of water buffalo , visited the zoo to gaze at monkeys , perused encyclopedias to gain a better understanding of animal behavior , and then labored on the cut tin pieces on his work table , which were hammered into shape , inlaid with ornamentation and welded without casting .  
After finding the right tool , and keeping in mind that " it 's all a matter of controlling the force , " after countless broken eggs due to squeezing or pushing too hard , Kuan Chun-mai eventually developed his own creative " knife withdrawal technique " whereby an even , well distributed pressure is applied when withdrawing the knife point from the cut . The principle is roughly similar to the " cue withdrawal technique " used in billiards .  
Huang Ming-che cut an impressive figure among his generation of young painters , the more so because through his engagement with Western masters close to his own sensibility , he continuously rediscovered where he needed to go . Without turning his back on his unique artistic qualities , Huang had the courage to accept other artists ' strong points . He gradually developed his own style and found new techniques to express it . His painting style evolved from Taiwanese localism to sentimentalism .  
Because of US bombing raids during World War II , the Japanese instituted a policy of dispersal . When Chiu was six the whole family was moved to his maternal grandmother 's house in Tunghsiao Township , Miaoli County . American and Japanese planes would frequently engage in dogfights overhead , and each time the aerial battles finished , the local residents would go to the waterside in search of aluminum and plexiglas . The pieces of aluminum could be cut and trimmed into rice spatulas , and the plexiglas could be turned into toys .  
He displayed his deep understanding of life 's mysteries in his carving Intermingling Grief and Joy , in which an entire body , save the head , appeared to be melting . For the face , he carved his own image , with teary eyes , the top of his skull cut open , and a lotus blossom seemingly inserted in the opening . It clearly conveyed the great joy of transcendence of self that he had experienced at that moment .  
But neglected all along was the Aborigines ' viewpoint and what they had to say , " points out Sun Ta-chuan . He gives an example : developing the water resources of the mountain regions was for the benefit of those downstream , while the Aborigines living upstream were frequently without potable water . When the mountain regions were included in national parks , the Aborigines were forced to leave the area , losing their original living space and sacred territory , and they were cut off from their traditional cultural roots .  
He cited examples such as Vienna , where a referendum was held to stop a downtown university from cutting down six trees , and Hawaii , the first place in the US to legislate to protect its urban foliage by passing a law that required permission to cut or move any tree over eight feet tall , whether in a private garden or a public park .  
But even if he was often scatterbrained and had a dull look in his eyes off the field , he was extraordinary when he took the mound , almost never disappointing Coach Huang . With a 145-km / h fastball coming off his hand , a slow breaking ball that cut a huge arc on its way to the plate , and a tricky slider , hitters on the opposing teams could see Wu 's pitches dance their way to the plate , but one after another they failed to get a bat on the ball .  
" They are always so happy , though , just because I 'm doing the shopping and preparing meals for them , " Day says . Filial piety is n't difficult ; one just needs to cater to another 's pleasures . His father , for example , loves to eat a traditional salted pork dish , so Day practiced until he learned the techniques for making it , mastering each step , from choosing the right cut of meat to the actual cooking and dressing of the meat .  
Whenever heavy weather approaches , Taiwan 's beautiful landscape is increasingly marred by fear . The typhoon also flooded the city of Sanchung , Taipei County for the first time in over 30 years , after contractors cut corners in the construction of a subway line . The government now faces a compensation bill of NT $ 2 billion . The incident holds lessons for us all .  
due to the international sanctions , yugoslavia 's cross border transportation , trade , and inflows of foreign capital and technology have all been cut off , forcing a large number of researchers to go abroad and paralyzing the country 's scientific and technological research system  
Reforms this year included a substantial cut in corporate taxes , sharp reduction in import tariffs on capital goods and industrial inputs , financial sector liberalization and full currency convertibility on the current account .  
We also stress the need to complete without delay comprehensive and verifiable treaties to ban nuclear-weapon tests and to cut off the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices .  
At the outset of this statement , I should like to express our deepest sympathy to the delegation and Government of France and to the families of the two valiant and honourable members of the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) whose valuable lives were cut short at such an early age by the merciless and cold-blooded actions of professional killers , whoever they may be .  
We are taking stock of negative , devastating and genocide effects of sanctions on the health of the people of Yugoslavia and demonstrate in an expert way , corroborated by arguments , to what extent the sanctions have held us back in the implementation of the health care of the population , how much damage , pain and evil was inflicted and how many innocent lives were cut off as a result .  
NULLThe themes should be selected in the light of the principal objectives of the dialogue : to promote broader and deeper understanding of issues of a global or transboundary nature that cut across individual , regional or group interests .  
The economic crisis faced by LDCs has further undermined health conditions in many countries as living standards have fallen , health services have been cut owing to budgetary pressures , and the availability of imported medicines and other medical supplies has dwindled .  
The immediate effects of the beginning of the war in 1991 were as follows : the tourist market was depressed as a result of the lack of security ; many hotels and private accommodations were occupied by displaced persons and refugees ; commercial and communication links were immediately cut from the north ; and routes inland towards Bosnia and Herzegovina were blocked . 
The immediate effects of the beginning of the war in 1991 were as follows : the tourist market was depressed as a result of the lack of security ; many hotels and private accommodations were occupied by displaced persons and refugees ; commercial and communication links were immediately cut from the north ; and routes inland towards Bosnia and Herzegovina were blocked . 
Pakistan 's case , the tariffs applicable to certain products which were his country 's principal exports had been cut by less than one third ; in textiles , the waiver from GATT rules had been extended for another 10 years ; in agriculture subsidies for production and exports had been approved with the promise of reforms at some vague moment in the future ; and the measures taken in the area of services had had a negative impact on countries with abundant skilled manpower , such as Pakistan .  
The destruction , massacres and immeasurable suffering in Lebanon reported by the mass media , which show human bodies that have been cut up and mutilated , is unequivocal proof of the barbaric nature of the aggression taking place at the hands of the Israelis .  
The economic crisis faced by LDCs has further undermined health conditions in many countries as living standards have fallen , health services have been cut owing to budgetary pressures , and the availability of imported medicines and other medical supplies has dwindled .  
The cease-fire broke down on 29 April when an attempted meeting of the Council of State , attended by Chairman Sankawulo together with Councilmen Taylor and Kromah , was cut short after fighting erupted between ULIMO-J and NPFL / ULIMO-K forces near the executive mansion .  NULLThe fighting rapidly escalated overnight into some of the worst fighting witnessed since the start of the civil war in December 1989 .  
Steps to cut total transport costs will be of real significance to the growth of the Central Asian economies , whether they come about by developing new alternative routes , increasing competition on all routes , improving the quality and efficiency of transport infrastructure and services , or cooperative efforts to reduce waste and inefficiency by installing the most advanced international concepts of transit transport facilitation .  
In my view , the three sessions of the open _ ended informal Presidential consultations , each devoted to such issues as nuclear disarmament , a fissile material cut _ off treaty and anti _ personnel landmines , were useful and contributed to moving the overall process of the CD forward .  
The intensive consultations led by your distinguished predecessor Ambassador Yung Sun showed that within these two fields there are at least three issues commanding quite broad support , namely the fissile material cut _ off , nuclear disarmament and the complex issue of anti _ personnel landmines . 
The consultations proved to be useful , allowing me to see better where delegations stand as far as their positions on three important issues are concerned : namely , on nuclear disarmament , the fissile material cut _ off treaty and anti _ personnel landmines , as well as , in some cases , on other issues of major interest to them . 
A number of members of the Committee expressed concern that in the current situation of dwindling financial resources throughout the United Nations system , there was a tendency in many organizations to cut the funding for public information activities , as public information work was difficult to define in quantitative terms .  
So if we are not able to solve the daunting issue of nuclear disarmament in one great stroke now , let us attend to what is feasible and in doing so add another valuable facet , namely a treaty on fissile material cut _ off ( FMCT ) , to this multifaceted edifice .  
The administrative component of UNMOT would be strengthened to support the larger Mission , as would its communications , road and air transport and other facilities , bearing in mind the mountainous terrain and the bad state of repair of the roads , many of which are cut off as a result of damage or will be impassable for several months in winter .  
The Secretary-General had , in his previous report ( A / 50 / 480 ) , suggested that themes be selected in the light of the principal objectives of the dialogue ; that is , to promote broader and deeper understanding of issues of a global or transboundary nature that cut across individual , regional or group interests .  
It was suggested that such opportunities may be found in the sectors where developing countries have ( i ) natural and geographical advantages ; ( ii ) an education and training basis to provide skilled workers ; ( iii ) the competitive advantage provided by lower wages ; and ( iv ) the possibility to cut the cost of services further , utilizing the communication and transport technology .  
A growing number of countries on our continent , including my own country , Ethiopia , have taken decisive measures to liberalize their economies , to cut Government spending , to institute sound macroeconomic policies and to enhance the role of the private sector and civil society .  
The Committee agreed that the independence and extensive experience of its members in a wide range of development-related fields provided it with a comparative advantage as a forum for the discussion and review of emerging development issues facing developing countries , particularly where such issues were cross-sectoral or cut across the responsibilities of various international bodies or agencies .  
Fortunately the 1995 Conference of NPT States parties has helped to identify the way forward by adopting the Principles and objectives for non _ proliferation and disarmament , in which the section on Nuclear disarmament sets out the importance to the international community of three specific objectives : the completion of negotiations for a comprehensive test _ ban treaty no later than 1996 ; the immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off treaty ; and systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally .  
We also remain hopeful that on the basis of the continued commitments of member States of the Conference to the shared goals of global disarmament it will be able to resolve the many difficult issues on its agenda , including the contentious issue of a fissile cut _ off .  
Trying to evade the cut _ off negotiations , which constitute an essential stage , would mean remaining at the stage of declamatory phrases or placing oneself in the final perspective of nuclear disarmament in the framework of general and complete disarmament : in either case , no concrete progress can be expected in the near future .  
In order to cut the main links between the insurgent groups and the civilian population , SLORC has forced entire communities living in the border area between Myanmar and Thailand to move to relocation sites which are subject to tight military control .  
Germany has already stated its priorities for this work programme : the immediate start of negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off and on an effective , legally binding international agreement to ban anti _ personnel mines .  
The measures to prevent and control the phenomenon , which need to be elaborated and implemented at the national and international levels , cut across the economic , social , cultural , political and legal fields .  
Having accomplished its work on the CTBT , the CD must continue to play its role in non _ proliferation and nuclear disarmament by starting , without further delay , its overdue work on a treaty to prohibit the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , otherwise referred to as the cut _ off convention ( FMCT ) .  
For our part , I can confirm that the United Kingdom would like to see the agenda of the Conference on Disarmament reflect our key priorities on the disarmament agenda , and for the record I confirm that on the nuclear side , our top priority is the urgent negotiation and conclusion of a fissile material cut _ off treaty , and on the conventional side , our top priority is to work towards the global ban on APLs to complement the Ottawa treaty , which we hope will be opened for signature this December . 
We heard one such unfortunate remark at last week 's plenary when it was asserted that the five declared nuclear Powers want the CD to discuss only small items such as anti _ personnel landmines and a fissile material cut _ off treaty .  
While a multilateral and effectively verifiable agreement to cease future production of fissile material may be possible now , it is our strong view that the cut _ off treaty should not try comprehensively to address existing stocks .  
We are aware of an existing view that the cut _ off of future fissile material production is a non-proliferation issue unrelated to nuclear disarmament .  
We are very close to agreement as regards agenda item 1 , although we remain profoundly disturbed by the lack of any reference _ however fleeting _ to fissile material cut _ off , a subject of earlier consensus in this Conference .  
The decisions of the Constitutional Court clearly show that , in the Colombian legal system , military jurisdiction is of a special and exceptional nature and may handle the offences committed only when the punishable acts have a clear _ cut , close and direct link with official duties .  
That the historical piecemeal approach to natural disasters needed to be replaced with an integrated approach one that would cut across natural hazards and would include planning , preparedness , prevention , warnings , relief and rehabilitation , and that a broader appreciation of the positive relationship between disaster reduction and economic and social development goals was required .  
The European Union believes that a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable fissile material cut _ off treaty constitutes , after the CTBT , a major step towards the achievement of both the nuclear non _ proliferation and nuclear disarmament objectives envisaged in the NPT document on principles and objectives .  
But I will repeat one clear and uncontested truth : a cut _ off treaty will make a substantial , vital and practical contribution to advancing the goal of global nuclear disarmament .
