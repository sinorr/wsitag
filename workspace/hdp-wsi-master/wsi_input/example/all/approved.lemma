Taking the Taiwan Provincial Government for example , in terms of the hiring and firing of personnel , currently the provincial governor is appointed by the central government , and changes in the directors of the departments in the provincial administration must be approved by the Executive Yuan . The " province " is actually just the agent for implementing central level policies everywhere but in the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung ( which are directly under the central government ) . Naturally , this more or less guts the powers reserved to local governments .  
This is still far removed from Chen Tingnan 's ideal for a " county cabinet , " in which all top administrators come and go with the executive , need not be approved by the provincial government , and are not bound by the civil service regulations on qualifications but are seen as political appointees . But at least it 's some improvement .  
In the " Conference on Hakka Culture , " part of this year 's arts and cultural festival , a report written by a Hakka man in praise of Hakka women was suddenly criticized by Huang Yu-hsiu , an associate professor of foreign languages at National Taiwan University , as " having a male chauvinist pig viewpoint and objectifying women .

Most observers approved of Siew 's decisive handling of the case as maintaining the team spirit of the cabinet .

The park was originally approved to release a maximum of 28,200 kiloliters of treated effluent per day . But in October and November of last year , the electronics industry was booming and the volume of effluent increased rapidly . Treated waste water from the park hit a record high of over 72,000 kiloliters . And recently average daily discharge has been running at around 53,000 kiloliters .  
According to regulations , when the volume of effluent exceeds the approved maximum by 10% , a report of this fact and an application to increase the approved maximum must be submitted . But the approval process takes six months and the volume of waste water was continuing to grow at an explosive rate . As such , the park was unable to avoid exceeding the stipulated volume .  
Vincent Siew particularly emphasizes that educational reform is a firm policy of the Executive Yuan . It has already approved the " Educational Reform Stimulus Package " drafted by the Ministry of Education .

In 1994 , when the political scientist Peng Ming-min returned from three decades of exile abroad ( he had fled after calling for Taiwanese independence ) , Hsiao returned from his interview with Peng at CKS International Airport to find that his piece had to be approved by three different levels of management before being aired . The experience left him feeling that this was far from the ideal of press freedom .  
We have all undergone rigorous professional training , and of course we know that buildings need to fit in with the urban landscape . In addition to being accepted by the owners , the designs for our super-skyscrapers were all approved by the relevant urban authorities , with very close attention given to questions about their height , and whether or not they would fit in with the surrounding environment . In New York for example , whatever you build is going to be tall , and no-one thinks there 's anything strange about that .  
Did you know that , of the more than 400 foreign funds approved in Taiwan , more than 140 had an average annual return in excess of 15% over the last three years ?

However , an even greater breakthrough is the way the integrated curriculum redefines the " textbook . " In future both the approved textbooks now used in elementary schools , and the standard textbooks used in junior high , may be relegated from their leading classroom role to a supporting role , for " diverse teaching materials " and " school-developed courses " are another big change introduced by the new curriculum .  
Also , in line with the general trend in education reform toward diversification of teaching materials , the integrated curriculum not only abolishes the current requirement for junior high schools to use the standard textbooks published by the National Institute for Compilation and Translation , allowing them to use any approved textbook instead , but it also allows county and city governments , schools , and teachers to produce their own teaching materials , and particularly encourages schools to form " curriculum development committees " to devise course content .  
The townships are in an even more embarrassing financial condition , with many of them relying on supplementary allocations for more than 90% of their expenditures .

If the Ma amendments had gone through , although funding to localities would have increased , the deep cuts to the central government 's coffers would have meant that numerous previously approved ( or even partially built ) local projects such as sewers and rapid transit would not have been able to go forward . The impact would have been enormous .  
It was a serious blow to anti-nuclear activists when the Legislative Yuan approved funding for construction of the 4NPP seven years ago . These activists and the DPP responded by becoming determined to totally revolutionize energy policy and public opinion . In the 2000 presidential election , the DPP won the office of the presidency , and to fulfill its campaign promises , conducted a reevaluation of the 4NPP and subsequently announced the suspension of its construction . This move , however , provoked a major constitutional crisis , pitting the president against the opposition-controlled legislature .

Cancellation of " provision for unscheduled meetings approved in the course of the biennium " will likely be of marginal benefit and may be disruptive , since such meetings are usually scheduled taking into account already existing conference services capacity and are quite often called to consider programmes of work , budgetary , financial and other important matters .

Regarding the financial aspects of this project , it is anticipated that although the revised project cost of construction will exceed the amount approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 45 / 248 A of 21 December 1990 , the additional requirement , excluding claims , could be covered , with the approval of the General Assembly , by interest earned on the construction-in-progress funds and , therefore , no additional appropriation would be required under the regular budget beyond the amount of $ 107,576,900 originally approved .  
As indicated in paragraph 12 of the Secretary-General 's report , the contingency fund , approved at 0.75 per cent of the overall level of resources for the first outline , has been maintained at that level for all subsequent ones ; it has always proved to be adequate to accommodate additional expenditures derived from legislative mandates not provided for in the proposed programme budget , as defined in resolutions 41 / 213 of 19 December 1986 and subsequent resolutions on the subject . 
Yugoslavia has privatized some 90 per cent of the public housing stock and the issues now being addressed include maintenance of the existing housing stock , legalization of housing developments which are not in accordance with the approved plans , engaging local authorities in solving the housing problems of vulnerable groups , review of standards and norms and improving the database on housing .  
The representative of UNEP informed the Committee that the projected expenditures for 1998-1999 under those objects were based on anticipated contributions of $ 75-million , as approved by the Governing Council at its nineteenth session , while the amounts indicated under the same objects for 1996-1997 were based on reduced actual contributions amounting to $ 62.5-million .  
By section I , paragraph 12 of its decision 19 / 22 , the Council approved an extraordinary additional appropriation of Fund resources in 1998-1999 of up to $ 1-million for the management and administrative support costs budget , $ 500,000 of which would be earmarked for the costs associated with the anticipated special session in the event that they were not covered by the United Nations regular budget .  
Notes with concern that the overall low level of contributions to the Environment Fund received and pledged for the biennium 1996-1997 not only has fallen short of the Governing Council 's estimates by a significant margin but also will not enable the programme of activities approved by the Governing Council for the biennium 1996-1997 to be fully implemented ;  
Decides to establish , within the approved overall budget level for the current biennium , a working group consisting of five intergovernmental experts , appointed on the basis of equitable geographical representation after consultations with the regional groups , to meet for two periods of five working days prior to the fifty _ fourth session of the Commission , with a mandate to :  
The representative of UNEP informed the Committee that the projected expenditures for 1998-1999 under these objects were based on anticipated contributions of $ 75-million , as approved by the Governing Council at its nineteenth session , while the amounts indicated under the same objects for 1996-1997 were based on reduced actual contributions amounting to $ 62.5-million .  
Takes note with satisfaction of the document entitled Anti-drug strategy in the hemisphere , 2 / approved by the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission of the Organization of American States at its twentieth regular session , held at Buenos Aires in October 1996 , and signed at Montevideo in December 1996 ; 3 .  Urges the international community to take due account of the anti _ drug strategy in the hemisphere as a significant contribution to the strengthening of the Global Programme of Action adopted by the General Assembly at its seventeenth special session .  
The balance of the temporary assistance funding ( $ 634,900 ) , the same level as approved for the biennium 1996-1997 , will provide for : ( a ) administrative and technical support during the implementation of the United Nations Integrated Management Information System ( IMIS ) and the further implementation of remaining phases of the Fund 's computer project ; ( b ) assistance during peak workload periods , and ( c ) replacements of staff on maternity and extended sick leaves . 
We request you to intervene with the Government of the United States with a view to halting these provocative actions and the obstacles being raised to the implementation of the memorandum of understanding between Iraq and the United Nations , and in order to ensure that the articles approved by the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) are delivered and that such actions are not repeated , as they constitute a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the precepts of international law .  
Because of a range of technical problems and the rate at which applications have been approved by the Security Council Committee , medical commodities have not reached Iraq in a coordinated or complementary manner , and most have been destined for hospitals and specialized facilities rather than primary health care centres .  
Concerted efforts are therefore required by all forces that believe in peace so as to thwart those hostile to peace and prepare on an urgent basis for the resumption of negotiations on all tracks in accordance with the terms of reference accepted by international consensus , approved by all the parties concerned without exception and based on the steps taken thus far with the blessing of the peoples of the region . 
Stresses that contracts for the purchase of humanitarian supplies submitted in accordance with resolution 1111 ( 1997 ) must be limited to items which appear on the list of supplies annexed to the second distribution plan prepared by the Government of Iraq and approved by the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 8 ( a ) ( ii ) of resolution 986 ( 1995 ) , or appropriate amendments to the plan must be requested prior to purchasing items not on the annexed list ;  
In addition , an extraordinary appropriation of $ 1-million was approved by the Governing Council , comprising $ 500,000 for studies requested by the Governing Council for activities directly related to the implementation of improved management and administrative practices by UNEP , and $ 500,000 for the costs associated with the anticipated special session of the Governing Council in the event that these costs are not covered by the regular budget of the United Nations .  
The Economic and Social Council , at its 1997 substantive session , had approved a set of agreed conclusions recognizing that the creation and preservation of stable international conditions and the democratization of international relations were among the main elements of a favourable environment for development .  
Decisions by substantive legislative bodies requesting new publication ( s ) , subsequent to those approved in the programme budget , should be taken only after the careful review of , among other things , information on the potential for duplication and financial implications , and a time-frame should be incorporated .  
Effective follow-up requires ( a ) that the reports be given active and serious consideration by the legislative organs of the participating organizations , with the benefit of specific and timely comments on them by the secretariats , and ( b ) that there is expeditious implementation of the approved recommendations contained in them , with full reporting on the implementation measures taken and analysis of the resulting impact .  
Once a report is considered by the legislative organs and decisions taken on the report as a whole and on specific recommendations , the executive heads of the concerned organizations will ensure expeditious implementation of approved / accepted recommendations ( see para . 19 below ) and full reporting on measures taken to the appropriate legislative organs .  
Requests the Executive Director to continue the activities of the Disaster Management Programme , within the approved work programme of the next biennium , in collaboration and coordination with Member States , concerned partners and relevant United Nations organizations , as a contribution of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) to the implementation of the Habitat Agenda at the local , national , regional and global levels , and to conduct periodic evaluations of those activities as a contribution to programme development ;  
I also consider it important to note that , at its substantive session of 1995 , the Economic and Social Council approved the report of the Commission on Sustainable Development on the work of its third session , in which , in its discussion of progress in implementing Agenda 21 , the Commission recognized that mountain ecosystems and environments are of crucial importance as rich and unique centres of biological and cultural diversity , water stores and sources of minerals . 
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
Paragraph 12 of the report elaborated on the implications of preparing budgets on a full-cost basis , and pointed out that " each budget , whether regular , peacekeeping or support account , should show the complete staffing picture for each organizational unit under review " , and that positions approved by the General Assembly " must be filled in the traditional manner in full compliance with all existing personnel policies and procedures , including the need to maintain geographical balance " .  
While gratis personnel had played a valuable role in advancing the implementation of approved activities , particularly in the current climate of budgetary constraint , his delegation concurred with the Advisory Committee 's view that gratis personnel should not be sought solely for financial reasons but should be recruited to enhance the efficiency of the United Nations by bringing experts with needed skills and experience into the organizational fold .  
Requests the Secretary-General and the executive heads of the United Nations organizations and programmes to ensure selection of consultants on a more competitive basis and to keep the instances of recourse to sole candidates to a strict minimum , each such case being formally approved at an appropriate level of authority , on an exceptional basis , prior to engagement ;  
Requests the Secretary-General and the executive heads of the United Nations organizations and programmes to ensure selection of consultants on a more competitive basis and to keep the instances of recourse to sole candidates to a strict minimum , each such case being formally approved at an appropriate level of authority , on an exceptional basis , prior to engagement ;  
Variances may occur to the actual physical distribution as a result of changes in cropping patterns , varying food demands , weather restrictions , location of weed , insect and disease infestations , future machinery malfunctions that were not foreseen , the number of contracts approved and / or blocked , plus seasonal machinery activities ( e.g . the majority of harvesters move to the south for the early harvest and migrate north as the crops ripen and become ready for harvest ) .  
At its 67th meeting , on 16 April 1997 , the Commission , taking into account its heavy schedule of work , as well as the need to give adequate consideration to all the items on the agenda , and recalling that in previous years the Economic and Social Council had approved the Commission 's request for additional meetings for its thirty _ seventh to fifty _ third sessions , decided , without a vote :  
In this connection , some Governments have argued that the acceptance of gratis personnel performing mandated activities would not , therefore , involve additional financial liability for the Organization since support costs have already been included in the budgets ; this argument is valid only if the gratis personnel are to be considered a substitute for staff to be recruited against authorized posts for the implementation of the approved activities .  
This has been interpreted to mean that the resources approved by the Assembly must be used for staff and non-staff costs as indicated in the relevant budgets and that resources can not be spent from assessed budgets , whether from the regular budget or the budgets of the international tribunals , peacekeeping operations or the peacekeeping support account , in order to utilize voluntary contributions provided by a few donor Governments .  
The question of the applicability of administrative or programme support costs for type II gratis personnel has arisen because heretofore voluntary contributions have related primarily to supplementary or non-assessed activities , but in the context of type II gratis personnel , voluntary contributions are currently linked to activities that have been specified and approved by the General Assembly in the relevant assessed budgets , both regular and peacekeeping .  
In 1996 , 58 per cent - or $ 551-million of total income - was received as general resources which UNICEF allocated to Board approved programmes supporting children and women , guided by a needs-based formula ( size of child population , under-five mortality rate , per capita gross national product ( GNP ) ) .  
The occupation of East Timor , systematically condemned by the relevant bodies of the United Nations , makes abusive and illegitimate any and all attempts to appropriate the genuine collective will of the Timorense People that does not pass through a free process of self-determination , approved by the relevant mechanisms and organs of the United Nations . The Secretary-General has been following with concern reports of recent violent incidents in East Timor which have resulted in loss of life and are causing considerable human suffering .  
The Ministers reviewed the activities of CPLP , with special focus on the plan of action of the Executive Secretariat , as approved by the Ministerial Meeting held in New York on 26 September 1996 , and they reaffirmed their confidence in CPLP as a privileged instrument for consolidating , developing and enhancing their common historical ties , on the basis of the shared principles of peace , democracy , social justice and economic progress . 
While his delegation supported the reform of the Economic and Social Council , the reform process would not solve all the problems facing the international community , since institutional reforms must be complemented by a sound resource base for implementing approved strategic and financial plans .  
Stresses that contracts for the purchase of humanitarian supplies submitted in accordance with resolution 1111 ( 1997 ) must be limited to items which appear on the list of supplies annexed to the second distribution plan prepared by the Government of Iraq and approved by the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 8 ( a ) ( ii ) of resolution 986 ( 1995 ) , or appropriate amendments to the plan must be requested prior to purchasing items not on the annexed list ;  
If the Council approved his recommendations , the Secretary-General intended to dispatch a technical team to the mission area during the first half of October 1997 to reassess the resources required for the deployment of MINURSO at full strength and would revert to the Council in November , with a comprehensive report including a detailed plan , timetable and financial implications for the holding of the referendum of self-determination and fulfilment of the United Nations objectives in Western Sahara . 
The Committee points out that the deferral of approved projects in alterations / improvements and major maintenance , although resulting in reduced spending during the current biennium , does not necessarily generate " real " savings for the Organization ; on the contrary , the more time that is lost for the completion of such projects , the more expensive they may become .  
Under the original proposal for the forthcoming biennium , the total number of posts would be reduced from 10,012 , the number approved for the current biennium , to 8,839 , and that number might be as low as 8,695 if Member States accepted the proposed reforms .  
The Committee agreed with the view of ICAO , as stated in the report , regarding replacement of the aircraft , access to technical support and spare parts as required for the effective initial stage of operation , and approved the Libyan request in principle .  
The Controller had informed the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions in a letter dated 26 September 1997 that the cost of a few additional officers specialized in political , civil and legal affairs would be provided under general temporary assistance ( equivalent to 1 P-5 , 2-P-4 , 2 General Service and 1 Field Service ) from within approved resources .  
The cost of three additional staff under general temporary assistance ( equivalent to 1-D-2 , 1 General Service and 1 local ) were absorbed within approved resources , as reported to the Advisory Committee in a letter from the Controller dated 11 February 1998 .  
The Seventh Meeting of States Parties in 1997 approved in principle the ongoing need during the first five years to appropriate a sum of $ 60,000 per year to meet the operational costs and $ 60,000 per year for the " start-up costs " of the library , i.e . , resources for the acquisition of basic reference material , including major treaties , official documents and important journals and periodicals , with back copies , as appropriate .  
Human rights are understood to be the civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and the third generation of human rights set forth in the Constitution , the laws and the treaties in force , together with those contained in the declarations and principles approved by the United Nations or the Organization of American States ( PDDH Act , art .  2 ) .  
The programme budget for the biennium 19961997 , as approved by the General Assembly , stated that the efforts of the international community were still focused on weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear ones , but were becoming increasingly concerned with the growth and proliferation of various types of conventional weapons ( A / 50 / 6 / Rev . 1,3 para .  2.81 ) .  The programme budget for the biennium 19981999 maintains the same approach .  
Syria supported the recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions ( A / 51 / 813 ) with regard to the need for transparency in the budget for such positions , the need to retain the traditional manner of filling approved positions , and the use of gratis personnel only in the limited and exceptional circumstances outlined in the report .  
At its 60th meeting , on 28 April 1999 , the Commission on Human Rights , taking into account its heavy schedule of work , as well as the need to give adequate consideration to all the items on its agenda , and recalling that in previous years the Economic and Social Council had approved the Commission 's requests for additional meetings for its thirty _ seventh to fifty _ fifth session , decided , without a vote : 
For oil spare parts and equipment under phase IV , 546 applications valued at $ 286,438,462 have been received by the Secretariat as at 31 March 1999 , of which 398 valued at $ 237,683,875 have been approved , 92 valued at $ 28,491,493 have been placed on hold , none were pending with the Committee , and 8 were declared null and void .  
Under phase V , 46 applications for oil spare parts valued at $ 27,754,787 have been received by the Secretariat , of which 6 valued at $ 609,420 have been approved , 6 valued at $ 5,896,027 have been placed on hold , 6 valued at $ 2,574,350 were pending before the Committee , and none were declared null and void .  
Lessons identified through the two independent internal and external assessments of the UNDAF pilot phase and the policy guidance provided in General Assembly resolution 53 / 192 , as well as comments by agencies of the United Nations system , formed the basis for the revision of the UNDAF guidelines and shaped the modalities for the gradual extension of the UNDAF exercise to other countries , approved in April 1999 .  
Requests its Bureau , in cooperation with the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme , to adjust the provisional agenda for the twelfth session , as approved at the eleventh session , taking fully into account the results of the eleventh session , as well as developments relevant to technical cooperation among developing countries throughout the world , including at the United Nations and other important international forums .  
Upon departure for extended official travel or for approved leave involving absence from duty for two or more pay days , at duty stations where salaries are paid bimonthly , or a minimum period of seventeen days , including one pay day , at duty stations where salaries are paid monthly , in the amount that would fall due for payment during the anticipated period of absence ;  
Requests its Bureau , in cooperation with the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme , to adjust the provisional agenda for the twelfth session , as approved at the eleventh session , taking fully into account the results of the eleventh session , as well as developments relevant to technical cooperation among developing countries throughout the world , including at the United Nations and other important international forums .  
It was noted that the proposed programme of work for 20002001 was the first programme formulated on the basis of the cumulative reform efforts of the Commission , which included the conference structure as determined by the Commission in 1997 , the programme structure as revised and approved by the General Assembly in 1998 and the subsequent organizational structure as presented in the proposed programme budget for 20002001 .  
The States parties to the present Covenant undertake to have respect for the liberty of parents and , when applicable , legal guardians to choose for their children schools , other than those established by the public authorities , which conform to such minimum educational standards as may be laid down or approved by the State and to ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions .  
In 1982 , the Basic People 's Congresses ( the legislative mechanism ) approved the new educational structure with a view to redesigning the educational system by introducing technical and artistic education linked with vocational training at the basic and intermediate stages , the aim being to meet the needs of the national economy for a workforce with technical and vocational qualifications .  
In its 1998 report to the General Assembly , the Board agreed with the view taken by the Committee of Actuaries that the administrative expenses to be included in the valuations should be based on the level of resources required to administer the Fund ( excluding investment costs which are a charge against investment income ) , as contained in its approved budgets , rather than by establishing a predetermined ratio between the administrative expenses and the level of pensionable remuneration .  
At its 1999 meeting , the Committee of Actuaries recommended that the provision to be included in the next actuarial valuation should be based on the approved budget for the biennium 20002001 , with the consequent percentage of pensionable remuneration being determined to two decimal places , rounded upward .  
Following the World Solar Summit , held at Harare in September 1996 , organized under the guidance of the World Solar Commission , a 10-year programme aimed at the wider use of all sources of environmentally sound , renewable energies , as well as at improving the quality of life , notably in the rural areas of developing countries , was prepared and subsequently approved by the World Solar Commission in June 1997 .  
At the same meeting , following a statement by the representative of the Secretariat , the Commission acting as preparatory body approved and recommended to the General Assembly the provisional agenda and organizational arrangements contained in document E / CN . 17 / 1999 / PC / CRP . 1 for adoption at the special session , as amended ( see chap .  V , sect .  
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 3 of the report ( DP / 1999 / 40 ) and the interim financial statements for the year ended 31 December 1998 that UNOPS brought the level of its operational reserve from $ 17.6-million at 31 December 1997 to $ 19.9-million at 31 December 1998 , which is the approved level of 4 per cent of the combined expenditure on administrative and project budgets of the prior year ( $ 499.7-million ) in accordance with Executive Board decision 97 / 21 of 18 September 1997 .  
In Guatemala and Honduras , the Government of Sweden has approved multi-year governance programmes with UNDP worth over US $ 50-million , aimed at supporting the creation and strengthening of new democratic institutions , including human rights institutions , the courts , public defenders offices and other governmental and non-governmental institutions working for restoration of the rule of law , increased access to justice and respect for human rights .  
The awarding authority must , in each case , satisfy itself that the contract proposed has been examined and approved by the legal , financial and other officers as appropriate , that adequate tenders be requested , that , all other conditions being equal , the lowest price or bid be accepted and that the contract proposed is overall in accordance with the Agencys best interests .  
While welcoming the Government 's proposed modest increase in the target caloric value of the food basket to 2,200 kilocalories per person per day , in view of the additional funds available , the Secretary-General recommends that the caloric value of the food basket should be increased at the minimum to 2,300 kilocalories per person per day country-wide , which was the level approved for the enhanced distribution plan for phase IV ( S / 1998 / 446 ) .  
Providing organizations the opportunity to indicate whether they could absorb the costs of the activities being requested within current and / or successive programmes of work and budget , or whether such activities could only be carried out if additional financing was provided , would avoid the risk of diversion of resources or staff time from the programme of work and budget approved by its governing bodies , while contributing to more consistent and coherent governance by Member States .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 53 / 206 of 18 December 1998 , decided that a provision of $ 86,200,000 should be included for special political missions related to peace and security expected to be extended or approved during the course of the biennium 2000-2001 .  Provisions for such missions had previously been included in the budget section for peacekeeping operations .  
With regard to the future disposition of the special account and the unencumbered balance , the Advisory Committee recommends that , on an exceptional basis , the special account be maintained and the unspent balance retained until all the activities and programmes outlined in the report of the Secretary-General of 13 May 1998 ( A / 52 / 898 and Corr . 1 ) and approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 53 / 3 are completed .  
Acceptability - the form and substance of education , including curricula and teaching methods , have to be acceptable ( e.g . relevant , culturally appropriate and of good quality ) to students and , in appropriate cases , parents ; this is subject to the educational objectives required by article 13 ( 1 ) and such minimum educational standards as may be approved by the State ( see art .  13 ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ) ;  
The establishment or maintenance , for religious or linguistic reasons , of separate educational systems or institutions offering an education which is in keeping with the wishes of the pupils parents or legal guardians , if participation in such systems or attendance at such institutions is optional and if the education provided conforms to such standards as may be laid down or approved by the competent authorities , in particular for education of the same level ;  
The establishment or maintenance of private educational institutions , if the object of the institutions is not to secure the exclusion of any group but to provide educational facilities in addition to those provided by the public authorities , if the institutions are conducted in accordance with that object , and if the education provided conforms with such standards as may be laid down or approved by the competent authorities , in particular for education of the same level .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 53 / 206 of 18 December 1998 , decided that a provision of $ 86,200,000 should be included for special political missions related to peace and security expected to be extended or approved during the course of the biennium 2000-2001 .  Provisions for such missions had previously been included in the budget section for peacekeeping operations .  
At its eighteenth session ( 17-28 May 1999 ) , the Board of Trustees of the Fund had recommended that , for the period June 1999 to May 2000 , grants of approximately US $ 5.1-million ( A / 54 / 177 , para . 16 ) should be awarded to medical , psychological , psychiatric , economic , social , humanitarian and legal assistance programmes , which were approved in June 1999 by the High Commissioner for Human Rights on behalf of the Secretary-General ( paras . 18 and 21 ) .  
The activities of the Agency in that area have been strengthened by the adoption of additional standards for the safe management and transportation of radioactive waste and for the security of nuclear power stations , which were approved by the Board of Governors , as well as by the adoption of resolutions in the General Conference on the radiological protection of patients , the safety of transport of radioactive materials and the security of radiation sources .  
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions , in paragraphs 37 and 44 of its report dated 3 April 1997 ( A 51-851 and Corr . 1 ) indicated that the actual amount to be approved by the General Assembly would depend on the decision it took on the financing of separation payments for locally employed civilians , bearing in mind that UNFICYP was funded on a voluntary basis prior to 16 June 1993 .  
The Russian Federation has made progress in putting together a comprehensive programme for destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile , including the identification of destruction sites , the technology needed for destruction , protection of the environment , the agencies responsible and the overall financial requirements , which has been approved by President Yeltsin . A draft law , which will establish the legal framework for destruction , has received its first hearing in the Duma .  
With regard to the improvement in the functioning of the Unit in the context of shared responsibility , as laid down in General Assembly resolution 50-233 , he said that in that resolution the General Assembly had encouraged the Unit to continue to take the necessary steps to achieve a punctual and systematic follow-up of its recommendations as approved by the legislative organs of participating organizations .  
At its fifty _ fourth session , the Commission , in resolution 1998-7 , approved the text of the draft declaration on the right and responsibility of individuals , groups and organs of society to promote and protect universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms , as contained in the annex to that resolution , and decided to consider the question at its fifty _ fifth session .  
They stressed that the principle of refraining from the use or threat of force or any other means of coercion or compulsion set forth in the Charter was binding , must be observed by all States and entailed a categorical prohibition on the use of any military-coercive action or any other type of action such as blockades , embargoes or other measures not approved by the international community.Exceptions to that prohibition are clearly and expressly stated in the Charter itself .  
Operations approved in 1999 reflect the planned shift in emphasis from emergency reconstruction to ensuring the sustainability of economic institutions and sound macroeconomic management , as well as the medium - to longer-term viability of policies aimed at stimulating private investment , banking reform and privatization .  
However , taking into consideration the unsatisfactory nutritional situation in Iraq and the necessity to provide a full food basket on a monthly basis , I have recommended to the Government of Iraq that the caloric value of the food basket should be increased to at least 2 , 300 kilocalories per person per day throughout the country ( see S 1999-1053 , annex I ) , which was the level approved for the enhanced distribution plan for phase IV ( see S 1998-446 ) .  
A contrary view was that , if the parties agreed to use a higher standard than that approved by applicable law ( assuming applicable law to reflect the terms of article 7 of the Model Law ) , it would not be covered by the current draft of article 3 .  
Decides also that the measures imposed by paragraph 6 above shall not apply to supplies of nonlethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian use , as approved in advance by the Committee established by paragraph 8 below ;

A [ multiproject ] [ standardized ] baseline for a given project type and specific geographic area , which will use a performance standard approved by the [ executive board ] and contained in the [ UNFCCC Article 6 reference manual ] [ appendix B ] .  
With a view to promoting the implementation of article 22 of the Unified Economic Agreement , concerning the coordination of financial , monetary and banking policies , enhanced cooperation between monetary institutions and central banks and the endeavour to adopt a single currency and thus complete the process of economic integration , the Council approved a common peg for the currencies of member States as a preliminary step towards the achievement of this goal .  
It had expressed regret , however , that full information on the preliminary estimate of resources was not available in the proposed budget outline , despite the fact that in its resolution 53 / 206 , the General Assembly had requested that provisions should be made in the budget outline for expenditures for special political missions related to peace and security expected to be extended or approved in the course of the biennium .  
The measures provided for under subparagraphs ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) of the present decree do not apply to supplies of non-lethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian or protective purposes , related technical assistance or training approved in advance by the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267 ( 1999 ) or to protective clothing , including flak jackets and military helmets imported into Afghanistan by United Nations personnel , representatives of the media and the staff of humanitarian organizations for their personal use only .  
With regard to additional requirements under mission subsistence allowance , while the approved budget assumed that 10 per cent of international staff would be entitled to the higher rate established for Cape Sierra Hotel , the actual number of staff accommodated at the hotel was higher than the original projections .  
In 1997 , the General Assembly recommended that the Commissions approved programme of work on sustainable development indicators result in a practicable and agreed set of indicators , suited to country-specific conditions , including a limited number of aggregated indicators .  
Emphasizes the important need for initiatives on foreign debt , in particular in the expanded Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and the decision of the Paris Club to go beyond the Naples terms , to be extended , expedited , implemented completely and made more flexible , and at the same time notes with concern the rigidity of the eligibility criteria approved by the international creditor community in the context of those initiatives , which is becoming a source of greater concern in the light of the latest symptoms of the international financial crisis ;  
Two other repeated problems noted by internal audits were : ( a ) senior country office staff routinely approved purchase orders in the absence of a written delegation of authority from the resident representative and ( b ) lack of proper segregation of duties in procurement functions .  
Emphasizes the important need for initiatives on foreign debt , in particular in the expanded Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and the decision of the Paris Club to go beyond the Naples terms , to be extended , expedited , implemented completely and made more flexible , and at the same time notes with concern the rigidity of the eligibility criteria approved by the international creditor community in the context of those initiatives , which is becoming a source of greater concern in the light of the latest symptoms of the international financial crisis ;

One former national legislator , setting his sights on Lu Tao 's undersea environs , has in vested hundreds of millions of NT dollars to import a submersible and two semi-submersibles . Although the operating license has not yet been approved , the three vividly colored submarines are already parked in Nanliao Harbor , and the captains and maintenance crews are in Green Island just waiting for the word .  
Because the Japanese military imposed strict order , any photography that included topographic features , military bases , or indeed any photo whose field of vision extended downward more than 45 degrees had to be approved by the military police .

Taking the Taiwan Provincial Government for example , in terms of the hiring and firing of personnel , currently the provincial governor is appointed by the central government , and changes in the directors of the departments in the provincial administration must be approved by the Executive Yuan . The " province " is actually just the agent for implementing central level policies everywhere but in the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung ( which are directly under the central government ) . Naturally , this more or less guts the powers reserved to local governments .  
This is still far removed from Chen Tingnan 's ideal for a " county cabinet , " in which all top administrators come and go with the executive , need not be approved by the provincial government , and are not bound by the civil service regulations on qualifications but are seen as political appointees . But at least it 's some improvement .  
In the " Conference on Hakka Culture , " part of this year 's arts and cultural festival , a report written by a Hakka man in praise of Hakka women was suddenly criticized by Huang Yu-hsiu , an associate professor of foreign languages at National Taiwan University , as " having a male chauvinist pig viewpoint and objectifying women .

Moreover , it was not just anybody who could take a Japanese name - - only civil servants , teachers , village mayors , or local notables were eligible even to apply , and the application had to be reviewed and approved - - so that , in a way , the Japanese turned the unpalatable change in surnames into a kind of honor comparable to the traditional imperial surname .

Most observers approved of Siew 's decisive handling of the case as maintaining the team spirit of the cabinet .

The park was originally approved to release a maximum of 28,200 kiloliters of treated effluent per day . But in October and November of last year , the electronics industry was booming and the volume of effluent increased rapidly . Treated waste water from the park hit a record high of over 72,000 kiloliters . And recently average daily discharge has been running at around 53,000 kiloliters .  
According to regulations , when the volume of effluent exceeds the approved maximum by 10% , a report of this fact and an application to increase the approved maximum must be submitted . But the approval process takes six months and the volume of waste water was continuing to grow at an explosive rate . As such , the park was unable to avoid exceeding the stipulated volume .  
Vincent Siew particularly emphasizes that educational reform is a firm policy of the Executive Yuan . It has already approved the " Educational Reform Stimulus Package " drafted by the Ministry of Education .

"  
" The three main stations are too constrained in their political coverage , " he explains . In 1994 , when the political scientist Peng Ming-min returned from three decades of exile abroad ( he had fled after calling for Taiwanese independence ) , Hsiao returned from his interview with Peng at CKS International Airport to find that his piece had to be approved by three different levels of management before being aired . The experience left him feeling that this was far from the ideal of press freedom .  
We have all undergone rigorous professional training , and of course we know that buildings need to fit in with the urban landscape . In addition to being accepted by the owners , the designs for our super-skyscrapers were all approved by the relevant urban authorities , with very close attention given to questions about their height , and whether or not they would fit in with the surrounding environment . In New York for example , whatever you build is going to be tall , and no-one thinks there 's anything strange about that .  
Did you know that , of the more than 400 foreign funds approved in Taiwan , more than 140 had an average annual return in excess of 15% over the last three years ?

However , an even greater breakthrough is the way the integrated curriculum redefines the " textbook . " In future both the approved textbooks now used in elementary schools , and the standard textbooks used in junior high , may be relegated from their leading classroom role to a supporting role , for " diverse teaching materials " and " school-developed courses " are another big change introduced by the new curriculum .  
Also , in line with the general trend in education reform toward diversification of teaching materials , the integrated curriculum not only abolishes the current requirement for junior high schools to use the standard textbooks published by the National Institute for Compilation and Translation , allowing them to use any approved textbook instead , but it also allows county and city governments , schools , and teachers to produce their own teaching materials , and particularly encourages schools to form " curriculum development committees " to devise course content .  
The townships are in an even more embarrassing financial condition , with many of them relying on supplementary allocations for more than 90% of their expenditures . The fact that local governments are entirely dependent on financial support from higher up the chain of government , and that all expenditure has to be approved at a higher level too , makes the entire concept of local self-rule a farce .  
If the Ma amendments had gone through , although funding to localities would have increased , the deep cuts to the central government 's coffers would have meant that numerous previously approved ( or even partially built ) local projects such as sewers and rapid transit would not have been able to go forward . The impact would have been enormous .  
It was a serious blow to anti-nuclear activists when the Legislative Yuan approved funding for construction of the 4NPP seven years ago . These activists and the DPP responded by becoming determined to totally revolutionize energy policy and public opinion . In the 2000 presidential election , the DPP won the office of the presidency , and to fulfill its campaign promises , conducted a reevaluation of the 4NPP and subsequently announced the suspension of its construction . This move , however , provoked a major constitutional crisis , pitting the president against the opposition-controlled legislature .  
Dai Jingzhang , medical director of the TCM Clinic , says that Germany has very stringent standards governing the inspection of Chinese herbal medicines .

Non-environmental related activities in plans of work for exploration .  With regard to the non-environment parameters of the contents of a plan of work for exploration , the review also revealed that , based on considerations such as annual periodic reports of the registered pioneer investors , it would be very useful to come to a common understanding on their achievements and to establish reasonable performance targets during the 15-year period of an approved plan of work for exploration .  
But beyond those concrete achievements , the fact that all the Council 's decisions have been adopted by consensus , that all the Commissioners have also been appointed by consensus and that all their recommendations are unanimous and also approved by the Council by consensus , always without a vote , gives the Commission outstanding legal , political and moral authority . 
Many of the countries that currently tacitly approved illegal migration to meet labour shortages needed to ensure that real demand for imported labour was met through legal channels which afforded protection to the migrants and recognized their genuine rights .

Thus the public research budget , which was only 32.9-million dinars in 1992 , had increased by 1995 to 57.9-million dinars .  
Cancellation of " provision for unscheduled meetings approved in the course of the biennium " will likely be of marginal benefit and may be disruptive , since such meetings are usually scheduled taking into account already existing conference services capacity and are quite often called to consider programmes of work , budgetary , financial and other important matters .  
While OIOS does not question the noble purpose of the seminars as the General Assembly has approved them , the issue of the efficient and effective use of funds for continuing to hold the seminars at a time of financial crisis for the Organization is worth objective and independent consideration .  
The Inspectors note that the questions raised and recommendations made in the report are similar in nature to those contained in the JIU report entitled " Staffing of the United Nations peace-keeping and related missions ( civilian component ) " ( JIU / REP / 93 / 6 , annex ) which , although not referenced in the report , was welcomed by the Secretary-General as a valuable and timely contribution to both the planning and management aspects of field operations and approved by the General Assembly .  
At its forty-ninth session , the General Assembly decided to appropriate , on an exceptional basis , $ 4,473,000 under section 21 on the understanding that the posts requested by the Secretary-General for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights , the Centre for Human Rights and the human rights presence in Cambodia had been approved on a temporary basis and that all posts would be subject to a detailed review by the Advisory Committee and the Assembly at the earliest opportunity at the resumed forty-ninth session .  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
In August 1993 , it approved a proposal presented by SAMCOMM , following a meeting of riparian States in Bucharest , that vessels , both powered or non-powered , which carried no goods or commodities , excluding packing material intended for reuse ( empty reels , pallets , etc . ) , could transit without specific prior authorization of the Committee , provided that all movements were notified to the SAMs teams by shipping operators and that the vessels were subject to monitoring before entry to and exit from the Danube portion between Vidin / Calafat and Mohacs .  
The Committee approved , on the basis of suggestions from the States concerned , a strictly limited number of road and rail border crossing points , which henceforth represented the exclusive transit points for passage of freight and rolling stock into and out of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( press releases SC / 5615 and SC / 5646 ) , monitored by national authorities in cooperation with the SAMs .  
In November 1995 , the Committee approved , on an exceptional basis , taking into account prevailing humanitarian conditions in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , the export of 186.5-million cubic metres of natural gas per month from the Russian Federation for an initial period of two months , on condition that it would revert to the matter in the case of interruptions or delays in the delivery of natural gas to Sarajevo for other than technical reasons .  
The Executive Director shall prepare a biennial budget , based on the approved outline of the Fund , sufficient to cover all anticipated core and programme support activities in a form consistent with relevant United Nations budgetary regulations , rules , policies and practices .  
Consideration of policies and procedures for the acceptance of gratis personnel can not be separated from the overall financial situation of the Organization and the present environment of increasing demands coupled with growing budgetary constraints , leading programme managers to seek and accept offers of gratis personnel in order to offset declining authorized resources in the implementation of the approved work programme .  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
Regarding the financial aspects of this project , it is anticipated that although the revised project cost of construction will exceed the amount approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 45 / 248 A of 21 December 1990 , the additional requirement , excluding claims , could be covered , with the approval of the General Assembly , by interest earned on the construction-in-progress funds and , therefore , no additional appropriation would be required under the regular budget beyond the amount of $ 107,576,900 originally approved .  
As indicated in paragraph 12 of the Secretary-General 's report , the contingency fund , approved at 0.75 per cent of the overall level of resources for the first outline , has been maintained at that level for all subsequent ones ; it has always proved to be adequate to accommodate additional expenditures derived from legislative mandates not provided for in the proposed programme budget , as defined in resolutions 41 / 213 of 19 December 1986 and subsequent resolutions on the subject . 
Yugoslavia has privatized some 90 per cent of the public housing stock and the issues now being addressed include maintenance of the existing housing stock , legalization of housing developments which are not in accordance with the approved plans , engaging local authorities in solving the housing problems of vulnerable groups , review of standards and norms and improving the database on housing .  
The representative of UNEP informed the Committee that the projected expenditures for 1998-1999 under those objects were based on anticipated contributions of $ 75-million , as approved by the Governing Council at its nineteenth session , while the amounts indicated under the same objects for 1996-1997 were based on reduced actual contributions amounting to $ 62.5-million .  
By section I , paragraph 12 of its decision 19 / 22 , the Council approved an extraordinary additional appropriation of Fund resources in 1998-1999 of up to $ 1-million for the management and administrative support costs budget , $ 500,000 of which would be earmarked for the costs associated with the anticipated special session in the event that they were not covered by the United Nations regular budget .  
Notes with concern that the overall low level of contributions to the Environment Fund received and pledged for the biennium 1996-1997 not only has fallen short of the Governing Council 's estimates by a significant margin but also will not enable the programme of activities approved by the Governing Council for the biennium 1996-1997 to be fully implemented ;  
Decides to establish , within the approved overall budget level for the current biennium , a working group consisting of five intergovernmental experts , appointed on the basis of equitable geographical representation after consultations with the regional groups , to meet for two periods of five working days prior to the fifty _ fourth session of the Commission , with a mandate to :  
The representative of UNEP informed the Committee that the projected expenditures for 1998-1999 under these objects were based on anticipated contributions of $ 75-million , as approved by the Governing Council at its nineteenth session , while the amounts indicated under the same objects for 1996-1997 were based on reduced actual contributions amounting to $ 62.5-million .  
Takes note with satisfaction of the document entitled Anti-drug strategy in the hemisphere , 2 / approved by the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission of the Organization of American States at its twentieth regular session , held at Buenos Aires in October 1996 , and signed at Montevideo in December 1996 ; 3 .  Urges the international community to take due account of the anti _ drug strategy in the hemisphere as a significant contribution to the strengthening of the Global Programme of Action adopted by the General Assembly at its seventeenth special session .  
The balance of the temporary assistance funding ( $ 634,900 ) , the same level as approved for the biennium 1996-1997 , will provide for : ( a ) administrative and technical support during the implementation of the United Nations Integrated Management Information System ( IMIS ) and the further implementation of remaining phases of the Fund 's computer project ; ( b ) assistance during peak workload periods , and ( c ) replacements of staff on maternity and extended sick leaves . 
We request you to intervene with the Government of the United States with a view to halting these provocative actions and the obstacles being raised to the implementation of the memorandum of understanding between Iraq and the United Nations , and in order to ensure that the articles approved by the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) are delivered and that such actions are not repeated , as they constitute a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the precepts of international law .  
Because of a range of technical problems and the rate at which applications have been approved by the Security Council Committee , medical commodities have not reached Iraq in a coordinated or complementary manner , and most have been destined for hospitals and specialized facilities rather than primary health care centres .  
Concerted efforts are therefore required by all forces that believe in peace so as to thwart those hostile to peace and prepare on an urgent basis for the resumption of negotiations on all tracks in accordance with the terms of reference accepted by international consensus , approved by all the parties concerned without exception and based on the steps taken thus far with the blessing of the peoples of the region . 
Stresses that contracts for the purchase of humanitarian supplies submitted in accordance with resolution 1111 ( 1997 ) must be limited to items which appear on the list of supplies annexed to the second distribution plan prepared by the Government of Iraq and approved by the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 8 ( a ) ( ii ) of resolution 986 ( 1995 ) , or appropriate amendments to the plan must be requested prior to purchasing items not on the annexed list ;  
In addition , an extraordinary appropriation of $ 1-million was approved by the Governing Council , comprising $ 500,000 for studies requested by the Governing Council for activities directly related to the implementation of improved management and administrative practices by UNEP , and $ 500,000 for the costs associated with the anticipated special session of the Governing Council in the event that these costs are not covered by the regular budget of the United Nations .  
The Economic and Social Council , at its 1997 substantive session , had approved a set of agreed conclusions recognizing that the creation and preservation of stable international conditions and the democratization of international relations were among the main elements of a favourable environment for development .  
Decisions by substantive legislative bodies requesting new publication ( s ) , subsequent to those approved in the programme budget , should be taken only after the careful review of , among other things , information on the potential for duplication and financial implications , and a time-frame should be incorporated .  
Effective follow-up requires ( a ) that the reports be given active and serious consideration by the legislative organs of the participating organizations , with the benefit of specific and timely comments on them by the secretariats , and ( b ) that there is expeditious implementation of the approved recommendations contained in them , with full reporting on the implementation measures taken and analysis of the resulting impact .  
Once a report is considered by the legislative organs and decisions taken on the report as a whole and on specific recommendations , the executive heads of the concerned organizations will ensure expeditious implementation of approved / accepted recommendations ( see para . 19 below ) and full reporting on measures taken to the appropriate legislative organs .  
Requests the Executive Director to continue the activities of the Disaster Management Programme , within the approved work programme of the next biennium , in collaboration and coordination with Member States , concerned partners and relevant United Nations organizations , as a contribution of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) to the implementation of the Habitat Agenda at the local , national , regional and global levels , and to conduct periodic evaluations of those activities as a contribution to programme development ;  
I also consider it important to note that , at its substantive session of 1995 , the Economic and Social Council approved the report of the Commission on Sustainable Development on the work of its third session , in which , in its discussion of progress in implementing Agenda 21 , the Commission recognized that mountain ecosystems and environments are of crucial importance as rich and unique centres of biological and cultural diversity , water stores and sources of minerals . 
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
Paragraph 12 of the report elaborated on the implications of preparing budgets on a full-cost basis , and pointed out that " each budget , whether regular , peacekeeping or support account , should show the complete staffing picture for each organizational unit under review " , and that positions approved by the General Assembly " must be filled in the traditional manner in full compliance with all existing personnel policies and procedures , including the need to maintain geographical balance " .  
While gratis personnel had played a valuable role in advancing the implementation of approved activities , particularly in the current climate of budgetary constraint , his delegation concurred with the Advisory Committee 's view that gratis personnel should not be sought solely for financial reasons but should be recruited to enhance the efficiency of the United Nations by bringing experts with needed skills and experience into the organizational fold .  
Requests the Secretary-General and the executive heads of the United Nations organizations and programmes to ensure selection of consultants on a more competitive basis and to keep the instances of recourse to sole candidates to a strict minimum , each such case being formally approved at an appropriate level of authority , on an exceptional basis , prior to engagement ;  
Requests the Secretary-General and the executive heads of the United Nations organizations and programmes to ensure selection of consultants on a more competitive basis and to keep the instances of recourse to sole candidates to a strict minimum , each such case being formally approved at an appropriate level of authority , on an exceptional basis , prior to engagement ;  
Variances may occur to the actual physical distribution as a result of changes in cropping patterns , varying food demands , weather restrictions , location of weed , insect and disease infestations , future machinery malfunctions that were not foreseen , the number of contracts approved and / or blocked , plus seasonal machinery activities ( e.g . the majority of harvesters move to the south for the early harvest and migrate north as the crops ripen and become ready for harvest ) .  
At its 67th meeting , on 16 April 1997 , the Commission , taking into account its heavy schedule of work , as well as the need to give adequate consideration to all the items on the agenda , and recalling that in previous years the Economic and Social Council had approved the Commission 's request for additional meetings for its thirty _ seventh to fifty _ third sessions , decided , without a vote :  
In this connection , some Governments have argued that the acceptance of gratis personnel performing mandated activities would not , therefore , involve additional financial liability for the Organization since support costs have already been included in the budgets ; this argument is valid only if the gratis personnel are to be considered a substitute for staff to be recruited against authorized posts for the implementation of the approved activities .  
This has been interpreted to mean that the resources approved by the Assembly must be used for staff and non-staff costs as indicated in the relevant budgets and that resources can not be spent from assessed budgets , whether from the regular budget or the budgets of the international tribunals , peacekeeping operations or the peacekeeping support account , in order to utilize voluntary contributions provided by a few donor Governments .  
The question of the applicability of administrative or programme support costs for type II gratis personnel has arisen because heretofore voluntary contributions have related primarily to supplementary or non-assessed activities , but in the context of type II gratis personnel , voluntary contributions are currently linked to activities that have been specified and approved by the General Assembly in the relevant assessed budgets , both regular and peacekeeping .  
In 1996 , 58 per cent - or $ 551-million of total income - was received as general resources which UNICEF allocated to Board approved programmes supporting children and women , guided by a needs-based formula ( size of child population , under-five mortality rate , per capita gross national product ( GNP ) ) .  
The occupation of East Timor , systematically condemned by the relevant bodies of the United Nations , makes abusive and illegitimate any and all attempts to appropriate the genuine collective will of the Timorense People that does not pass through a free process of self-determination , approved by the relevant mechanisms and organs of the United Nations . The Secretary-General has been following with concern reports of recent violent incidents in East Timor which have resulted in loss of life and are causing considerable human suffering .  
The Ministers reviewed the activities of CPLP , with special focus on the plan of action of the Executive Secretariat , as approved by the Ministerial Meeting held in New York on 26 September 1996 , and they reaffirmed their confidence in CPLP as a privileged instrument for consolidating , developing and enhancing their common historical ties , on the basis of the shared principles of peace , democracy , social justice and economic progress . 
While his delegation supported the reform of the Economic and Social Council , the reform process would not solve all the problems facing the international community , since institutional reforms must be complemented by a sound resource base for implementing approved strategic and financial plans .  
Stresses that contracts for the purchase of humanitarian supplies submitted in accordance with resolution 1111 ( 1997 ) must be limited to items which appear on the list of supplies annexed to the second distribution plan prepared by the Government of Iraq and approved by the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 8 ( a ) ( ii ) of resolution 986 ( 1995 ) , or appropriate amendments to the plan must be requested prior to purchasing items not on the annexed list ;  
If the Council approved his recommendations , the Secretary-General intended to dispatch a technical team to the mission area during the first half of October 1997 to reassess the resources required for the deployment of MINURSO at full strength and would revert to the Council in November , with a comprehensive report including a detailed plan , timetable and financial implications for the holding of the referendum of self-determination and fulfilment of the United Nations objectives in Western Sahara . 
The Committee points out that the deferral of approved projects in alterations / improvements and major maintenance , although resulting in reduced spending during the current biennium , does not necessarily generate " real " savings for the Organization ; on the contrary , the more time that is lost for the completion of such projects , the more expensive they may become .  
Under the original proposal for the forthcoming biennium , the total number of posts would be reduced from 10,012 , the number approved for the current biennium , to 8,839 , and that number might be as low as 8,695 if Member States accepted the proposed reforms .  
The Committee agreed with the view of ICAO , as stated in the report , regarding replacement of the aircraft , access to technical support and spare parts as required for the effective initial stage of operation , and approved the Libyan request in principle .  
The Controller had informed the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions in a letter dated 26 September 1997 that the cost of a few additional officers specialized in political , civil and legal affairs would be provided under general temporary assistance ( equivalent to 1 P-5 , 2-P-4 , 2 General Service and 1 Field Service ) from within approved resources .  
The cost of three additional staff under general temporary assistance ( equivalent to 1-D-2 , 1 General Service and 1 local ) were absorbed within approved resources , as reported to the Advisory Committee in a letter from the Controller dated 11 February 1998 .  
The Seventh Meeting of States Parties in 1997 approved in principle the ongoing need during the first five years to appropriate a sum of $ 60,000 per year to meet the operational costs and $ 60,000 per year for the " start-up costs " of the library , i.e . , resources for the acquisition of basic reference material , including major treaties , official documents and important journals and periodicals , with back copies , as appropriate .  
Human rights are understood to be the civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and the third generation of human rights set forth in the Constitution , the laws and the treaties in force , together with those contained in the declarations and principles approved by the United Nations or the Organization of American States ( PDDH Act , art .  2 ) .  
The programme budget for the biennium 19961997 , as approved by the General Assembly , stated that the efforts of the international community were still focused on weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear ones , but were becoming increasingly concerned with the growth and proliferation of various types of conventional weapons ( A / 50 / 6 / Rev . 1,3 para .  2.81 ) .  The programme budget for the biennium 19981999 maintains the same approach .  
Syria supported the recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions ( A / 51 / 813 ) with regard to the need for transparency in the budget for such positions , the need to retain the traditional manner of filling approved positions , and the use of gratis personnel only in the limited and exceptional circumstances outlined in the report .  
At its 60th meeting , on 28 April 1999 , the Commission on Human Rights , taking into account its heavy schedule of work , as well as the need to give adequate consideration to all the items on its agenda , and recalling that in previous years the Economic and Social Council had approved the Commission 's requests for additional meetings for its thirty _ seventh to fifty _ fifth session , decided , without a vote : 
For oil spare parts and equipment under phase IV , 546 applications valued at $ 286,438,462 have been received by the Secretariat as at 31 March 1999 , of which 398 valued at $ 237,683,875 have been approved , 92 valued at $ 28,491,493 have been placed on hold , none were pending with the Committee , and 8 were declared null and void .  
Under phase V , 46 applications for oil spare parts valued at $ 27,754,787 have been received by the Secretariat , of which 6 valued at $ 609,420 have been approved , 6 valued at $ 5,896,027 have been placed on hold , 6 valued at $ 2,574,350 were pending before the Committee , and none were declared null and void .  
Lessons identified through the two independent internal and external assessments of the UNDAF pilot phase and the policy guidance provided in General Assembly resolution 53 / 192 , as well as comments by agencies of the United Nations system , formed the basis for the revision of the UNDAF guidelines and shaped the modalities for the gradual extension of the UNDAF exercise to other countries , approved in April 1999 .  
Requests its Bureau , in cooperation with the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme , to adjust the provisional agenda for the twelfth session , as approved at the eleventh session , taking fully into account the results of the eleventh session , as well as developments relevant to technical cooperation among developing countries throughout the world , including at the United Nations and other important international forums .  
Upon departure for extended official travel or for approved leave involving absence from duty for two or more pay days , at duty stations where salaries are paid bimonthly , or a minimum period of seventeen days , including one pay day , at duty stations where salaries are paid monthly , in the amount that would fall due for payment during the anticipated period of absence ;  
Requests its Bureau , in cooperation with the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme , to adjust the provisional agenda for the twelfth session , as approved at the eleventh session , taking fully into account the results of the eleventh session , as well as developments relevant to technical cooperation among developing countries throughout the world , including at the United Nations and other important international forums .  
It was noted that the proposed programme of work for 20002001 was the first programme formulated on the basis of the cumulative reform efforts of the Commission , which included the conference structure as determined by the Commission in 1997 , the programme structure as revised and approved by the General Assembly in 1998 and the subsequent organizational structure as presented in the proposed programme budget for 20002001 .  
The States parties to the present Covenant undertake to have respect for the liberty of parents and , when applicable , legal guardians to choose for their children schools , other than those established by the public authorities , which conform to such minimum educational standards as may be laid down or approved by the State and to ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions .  
In 1982 , the Basic People 's Congresses ( the legislative mechanism ) approved the new educational structure with a view to redesigning the educational system by introducing technical and artistic education linked with vocational training at the basic and intermediate stages , the aim being to meet the needs of the national economy for a workforce with technical and vocational qualifications .  
In its 1998 report to the General Assembly , the Board agreed with the view taken by the Committee of Actuaries that the administrative expenses to be included in the valuations should be based on the level of resources required to administer the Fund ( excluding investment costs which are a charge against investment income ) , as contained in its approved budgets , rather than by establishing a predetermined ratio between the administrative expenses and the level of pensionable remuneration .  
At its 1999 meeting , the Committee of Actuaries recommended that the provision to be included in the next actuarial valuation should be based on the approved budget for the biennium 20002001 , with the consequent percentage of pensionable remuneration being determined to two decimal places , rounded upward .  
Following the World Solar Summit , held at Harare in September 1996 , organized under the guidance of the World Solar Commission , a 10-year programme aimed at the wider use of all sources of environmentally sound , renewable energies , as well as at improving the quality of life , notably in the rural areas of developing countries , was prepared and subsequently approved by the World Solar Commission in June 1997 .  
At the same meeting , following a statement by the representative of the Secretariat , the Commission acting as preparatory body approved and recommended to the General Assembly the provisional agenda and organizational arrangements contained in document E / CN . 17 / 1999 / PC / CRP . 1 for adoption at the special session , as amended ( see chap .  V , sect .  
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 3 of the report ( DP / 1999 / 40 ) and the interim financial statements for the year ended 31 December 1998 that UNOPS brought the level of its operational reserve from $ 17.6-million at 31 December 1997 to $ 19.9-million at 31 December 1998 , which is the approved level of 4 per cent of the combined expenditure on administrative and project budgets of the prior year ( $ 499.7-million ) in accordance with Executive Board decision 97 / 21 of 18 September 1997 .  
In Guatemala and Honduras , the Government of Sweden has approved multi-year governance programmes with UNDP worth over US $ 50-million , aimed at supporting the creation and strengthening of new democratic institutions , including human rights institutions , the courts , public defenders offices and other governmental and non-governmental institutions working for restoration of the rule of law , increased access to justice and respect for human rights .  
The awarding authority must , in each case , satisfy itself that the contract proposed has been examined and approved by the legal , financial and other officers as appropriate , that adequate tenders be requested , that , all other conditions being equal , the lowest price or bid be accepted and that the contract proposed is overall in accordance with the Agencys best interests .  
While welcoming the Government 's proposed modest increase in the target caloric value of the food basket to 2,200 kilocalories per person per day , in view of the additional funds available , the Secretary-General recommends that the caloric value of the food basket should be increased at the minimum to 2,300 kilocalories per person per day country-wide , which was the level approved for the enhanced distribution plan for phase IV ( S / 1998 / 446 ) .  
Providing organizations the opportunity to indicate whether they could absorb the costs of the activities being requested within current and / or successive programmes of work and budget , or whether such activities could only be carried out if additional financing was provided , would avoid the risk of diversion of resources or staff time from the programme of work and budget approved by its governing bodies , while contributing to more consistent and coherent governance by Member States .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 53 / 206 of 18 December 1998 , decided that a provision of $ 86,200,000 should be included for special political missions related to peace and security expected to be extended or approved during the course of the biennium 2000-2001 .  Provisions for such missions had previously been included in the budget section for peacekeeping operations .  
With regard to the future disposition of the special account and the unencumbered balance , the Advisory Committee recommends that , on an exceptional basis , the special account be maintained and the unspent balance retained until all the activities and programmes outlined in the report of the Secretary-General of 13 May 1998 ( A / 52 / 898 and Corr . 1 ) and approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 53 / 3 are completed .  
Acceptability - the form and substance of education , including curricula and teaching methods , have to be acceptable ( e.g . relevant , culturally appropriate and of good quality ) to students and , in appropriate cases , parents ; this is subject to the educational objectives required by article 13 ( 1 ) and such minimum educational standards as may be approved by the State ( see art .  13 ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ) ;  
The establishment or maintenance , for religious or linguistic reasons , of separate educational systems or institutions offering an education which is in keeping with the wishes of the pupils parents or legal guardians , if participation in such systems or attendance at such institutions is optional and if the education provided conforms to such standards as may be laid down or approved by the competent authorities , in particular for education of the same level ;  
The establishment or maintenance of private educational institutions , if the object of the institutions is not to secure the exclusion of any group but to provide educational facilities in addition to those provided by the public authorities , if the institutions are conducted in accordance with that object , and if the education provided conforms with such standards as may be laid down or approved by the competent authorities , in particular for education of the same level .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 53 / 206 of 18 December 1998 , decided that a provision of $ 86,200,000 should be included for special political missions related to peace and security expected to be extended or approved during the course of the biennium 2000-2001 .  Provisions for such missions had previously been included in the budget section for peacekeeping operations .  
At its eighteenth session ( 17-28 May 1999 ) , the Board of Trustees of the Fund had recommended that , for the period June 1999 to May 2000 , grants of approximately US $ 5.1-million ( A / 54 / 177 , para . 16 ) should be awarded to medical , psychological , psychiatric , economic , social , humanitarian and legal assistance programmes , which were approved in June 1999 by the High Commissioner for Human Rights on behalf of the Secretary-General ( paras . 18 and 21 ) .  
The activities of the Agency in that area have been strengthened by the adoption of additional standards for the safe management and transportation of radioactive waste and for the security of nuclear power stations , which were approved by the Board of Governors , as well as by the adoption of resolutions in the General Conference on the radiological protection of patients , the safety of transport of radioactive materials and the security of radiation sources .  
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions , in paragraphs 37 and 44 of its report dated 3 April 1997 ( A 51-851 and Corr . 1 ) indicated that the actual amount to be approved by the General Assembly would depend on the decision it took on the financing of separation payments for locally employed civilians , bearing in mind that UNFICYP was funded on a voluntary basis prior to 16 June 1993 .  
The Russian Federation has made progress in putting together a comprehensive programme for destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile , including the identification of destruction sites , the technology needed for destruction , protection of the environment , the agencies responsible and the overall financial requirements , which has been approved by President Yeltsin . A draft law , which will establish the legal framework for destruction , has received its first hearing in the Duma .  
With regard to the improvement in the functioning of the Unit in the context of shared responsibility , as laid down in General Assembly resolution 50-233 , he said that in that resolution the General Assembly had encouraged the Unit to continue to take the necessary steps to achieve a punctual and systematic follow-up of its recommendations as approved by the legislative organs of participating organizations .  
At its fifty _ fourth session , the Commission , in resolution 1998-7 , approved the text of the draft declaration on the right and responsibility of individuals , groups and organs of society to promote and protect universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms , as contained in the annex to that resolution , and decided to consider the question at its fifty _ fifth session .  
They stressed that the principle of refraining from the use or threat of force or any other means of coercion or compulsion set forth in the Charter was binding , must be observed by all States and entailed a categorical prohibition on the use of any military-coercive action or any other type of action such as blockades , embargoes or other measures not approved by the international community.Exceptions to that prohibition are clearly and expressly stated in the Charter itself .  
Operations approved in 1999 reflect the planned shift in emphasis from emergency reconstruction to ensuring the sustainability of economic institutions and sound macroeconomic management , as well as the medium - to longer-term viability of policies aimed at stimulating private investment , banking reform and privatization .  
However , taking into consideration the unsatisfactory nutritional situation in Iraq and the necessity to provide a full food basket on a monthly basis , I have recommended to the Government of Iraq that the caloric value of the food basket should be increased to at least 2 , 300 kilocalories per person per day throughout the country ( see S 1999-1053 , annex I ) , which was the level approved for the enhanced distribution plan for phase IV ( see S 1998-446 ) .  
A contrary view was that , if the parties agreed to use a higher standard than that approved by applicable law ( assuming applicable law to reflect the terms of article 7 of the Model Law ) , it would not be covered by the current draft of article 3 .  
Decides also that the measures imposed by paragraph 6 above shall not apply to supplies of nonlethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian use , as approved in advance by the Committee established by paragraph 8 below ;  
Decides also that the measures imposed by paragraph 6 above shall not apply to supplies of nonlethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian use , as approved in advance by the Committee established by paragraph 8 below ;
