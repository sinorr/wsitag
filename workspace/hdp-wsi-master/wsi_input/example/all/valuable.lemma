" When Namgyal must tell people that what they supposed was a valuable old dZi bead is just a well-crafted reproduction , even he cushions the blow by saying that they can always ask a master to invest it with spiritual power so that it will become just as effective as a true old dZi bead .

The railway cars alone have thus becomes a valuable tourist resource .  
Because of my personal interest in collecting , I 've spent over 20 years doing field research . I 've come in contact with a lot of extremely valuable first-hand materials and seen many aspects of our past that do n't get mentioned in formal historiography . As a result , I 've come to feel strongly that history does n't really come alive unless you approach it from a lot of different angles and look at historical development as something pushed forward by an entire people .

But he was so nervous that when he took his music scores out of his knapsack , he knocked over a vase that was standing on a tea table .
