We must firmly redress the erroneous tendency to neglect ideological and political work and to " pay more attention to material progress than to cultural and ideological progress " in some places and departments ; develop a stronger sense of responsibility and urgency ; and conscientiously pay attention to and step up the effort to solve a series of major issues facing the effort to strengthen and improve ideological and political work , from the perspective of consolidating the party 's status as a ruling party and accomplishing the party 's historical mission .  
It has been proven by historical experiences that without the heartfelt endorsement and vigorous support of the broad masses of people , our Party could not possibly have developed from a weak and small beginning into a strong and large force and displayed decisive historical roles in putting an end to the situation of China being carved up by foreign powers and laboring people being oppressed and exploited by reactionary ruling classes and in the struggles of changing the look of poverty and backwardness in China .  
ensure social stability at the grassroots level , ensure the security of grassroots political power , and ensure normal local economic and social development .  By achieving these we will make new and greater contributions to the acceleration of the development of democracy and the legal system at the grassroots level , to the implementation of the basic strategy of ruling the country by law , and to the accelerated construction of a socialist state ruled by law .  
In 1972 , the heads of state of the United States and the Soviet Union had no alternative but held talks to sign the " Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty " , which explicitly restricted both sides in the establishment of an anti-ballistic missile defense system , thus ruling out the possibility that one side could launch a nuclear attack without being punished .  This was acclaimed by the international community .  
Under the conditions of promoting reform and opening up and being in the ruling position , our party must constantly resist all kinds of corrosive influence and culture .  Therefore , to the broad masses of party members and cadres , it is particularly important to strengthen the building of spiritual civilization and continuously raise their ideological , moral , scientific and cultural qualities .  
On 4 December 1999 , the court of final appeal of the special administrative region unanimously gave the ruling that the interpretation by the NPC Standing Committee is legal and in keeping with the constitution .  All those who really are concerned about the future prosperity and stability of Hong Kong held that Hong Kong 's judicial independence has not changed in the least by the interpretation .  
As an organic whole , the concept of the " three represents " has put forward the need for the " elimination of exploitation and polarization " as the basic social problem to be solved during the development of socialist society , which is required by the Marxist ruling party in its strategy for social development .  
The world is still not free from disturbance .  In face of the complicated situation in which international relations are undergoing profound adjustments , opportunities and challenges coexist , political parties of all countries , including the ruling , participating , and opposition parties , are keeping eyes on the 21st century in a bid to explore a development strategy that better fits the trend of the times and their respective reality .  
In additional to the meeting between leaders of the highest level of China and the DPRK , our party has continued to maintain high-level contacts with the Vietnamese and the Laos parties .  We also organized two important theoretical discussion activities with the Vietnamese parties , which contributed to improving friendly relations between the ruling parties of the socialist countries .  
refining and distilling the ruling party 's " governing " policy and historical mission of developing productive forces and culture and realizing the people 's interests in such a way as to make them the ruling party 's fundamental guiding principle on " administering the party " has answered the important historical questions of " what kind of party we should build and how we should build our party " ; all this has raised Marxist party building theory to a higher level .  
Since the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy , we have been paying full attention to regulating people 's conduct with legal means in order to meet the requirements of developing the socialist market economy .  Meanwhile , rule by law has been defined as a basic strategy for ruling the country .  
Thereby , the key to consolidating and developing the current gratifying situation , realizing objectives in the Outline of the 10th Five-Year Plan , and fulfilling the three major historical tasks in the new century hinges on further implementing the important thinking of the " three represents " as put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin . Besides , the party should achieve its ideological and organizational construction , improve its work styles , and ceaselessly improve its leadership , its ruling level , and its capability of resisting corruption and preventing peaceful evolution .  
We should profoundly understand the great significance of studying , and practicing the important thinking on " three represents " from the level of " the foundation of building the party , the basis of ruling the country , and the source of strength , " vigorously step up ideological and political building , and ensure that the important thinking on " three represents " is truly implemented in building national defense and the armed forces .  
Korea 's ruling party and opposition parties also issued a statement specifically saying that they unanimously and strongly blamed Japan for planning to pass this history textbook , and achieving the evil goal of twisting history and whitewashing their past barbaric behavior towards Asian people .  They also demanded that the Korean government marshall all its forces to take a decisive counteraction toward Japan .  
We must , from the political high plane of " consolidating the ruling position of our party and guaranteeing the lengthy and peaceful reign of our country " gain a correct understanding of the great importance that lies in our effort to uphold the fundamental principle that the party commands the gun ; and must see to it that the awareness of the army soul can strike deep roots in the hearts of every officer and man .  
We must uphold the guideline of grasping things with both hands , with both hands firm , combine ruling the country according to law with ruling the country with ethics , follow the orientation for progress of advanced culture , and make efforts to enhance the ideological and moral standard and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation .  
Developing socialist democracy must be combined with making socialist democracy a systematic and legalized affair ; we must follow the law , strictly enforce the law , pursue violations of law , and also integrate ruling the country according to law with ruling the country with ethics , so as to ensure that all work in the state proceeds in smooth fashion , ensure good economic and social order , and ensure the civil rights and legitimate interests of the masses .  
The " three advantages " criterion constitutes the standard for us to judge all our work in carrying out China 's reform and opening-up program and developing the socialist modernization drive .  In this way , the thinking on " three represents " helps set the goals for party building in the new period , and expand the historical mission of the Communist Party of China in the new period .  It also provides a theoretical guidance to the ruling party for further strengthening its cultural , social , and economic foundations .  
The ruling Japanese Liberal Democratic Party is not lacking in rightwing forces hostile to China ; they do not want to see a reunified and strong China , and still harbor covetous ambitions regarding Taiwan , China 's sacred territory , hence they look with great favor on Lee Teng-hui , who fondly remembers Japan 's colonial rule over Taiwan , and have supported Lee Teng-hui 's visit with coordinated action .  This has fully revealed the conspiracy of Japanese rightwing forces in wallowing in the mire with Taiwan independence forces and stepping up their merger .  
The list of US arms sales to Taiwan has been generally decided .  Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan held that safeguarding national security is the consistent stand of the ruling and opposition parties .  He also stressed that Taiwan must not pay attention to the " theory that weapons alone decide the outcome of war . "  He said that obtaining weapons does not necessarily mean ensuring national defense security , and national defense security alone is not equivalent to national security and that real national security must have political support , which means stable cross-strait relations .  
As a matter of fact , that a rightwing politician like Koizumi can become the president of a ruling party and the prime minister of Japan and that an extreme rightwing politician like Shintaro Ishihara could be elected Tokyo Governor a few years ago have precisely reflected that the rightist trend is gaining momentum in Japan 's political arena .  
The following overall appraisals of Taiwan under the DPP " green ruling party " over the past year can be made : The political situation is chaotic , cross-strait relations continue to be tense , the economy is slipping tremendously , there is social unrest , and Taiwan not only has not " moved up , " it has instead continually " sunk downwards . "  
Since Chen Shui-bian , a member of the Democratic Progressive Party , assumed the high post of president by winning less than 40 percent of the votes a year ago , Taiwan has suffered from political chaos and an economic downturn , with its unemployment rate jumping to a new 16-year high .  Both the ruling and the opposition parties have been trying their utmost to break through an encirclement at the year-end legislative elections .  
In short , " the armed forces to be with no party affiliation " , " nonpoliticization of the armed forces " , and " nationalization of the armed forces " preached by the Western hostile forces are three poisonous swords , and their sinister intentions are to make our party " lose " its absolute leadership over the armed forces and " lose " its ruling position , to make our state " lose " its socialist nature , and to make our people 's army " lose " its political nature .  
The dominant position of public ownership , the nature of state power of people 's democracy , and the CPC 's ruling position have determined that the ideological reflection of such economic and political relationships can only be the use of Marxism as the party 's and the state 's guiding ideology .  
The party needs to realize the most extensive great unity with all allied forces not only when the party is weak but also when the party has grown stronger , not only when the party is fighting to seize the political power but also when the party is holding the ruling status , not only when the party is carrying out revolution but also when the party is engaged in construction and reforms .  
Zheng Bijian said that in studying and understanding the important explication of " three represents , " it is imperative for us to further focus our understanding and actions on the issue of the advanced nature of the party and on the question of how the party , beginning from ideological building , organizational building , work-style building , and system building , can build itself into a genuine Marxist ruling party that always stays ahead of the trend of the times and that are completely consolidated ideologically , politically , and organizationally .  
Why has our Party been able to have become eminent among various political forces in modern Chinese society , turned from small to big and from weak to strong , developed from only more than 50 people at the very beginning to the biggest ruling party in the world with more than 64-million Party members , and achieved these brilliant achievements ? 
They said : The important thinking on " three represents " set forth by General Secretary Jiang Zemin provides the foundation underlying our efforts for building the party , is the cornerstone for exercising the ruling power , and is also the source of our party 's strength .  It inherits and develops the Marxist party-building theory , embodies the ideological line of emancipating minds and seeking truth from facts , embodies our party 's character and fundamental principle , and embodies the spirit of theoretical innovation and advancing with the times .  
Participants held that the important thinking of " three represents " has let the basic demands of maintaining the advanced nature of the party and enabling it to always serve as a strong leadership core in building socialism with Chinese characteristics run through the theories and practice of building the ruling party , and clearly put forward a series of important new requirements for the party to strengthen itself in the new century .  
Being an integrated concept , " three represents " has a distinguished advanced feature , and embodies a scientific spirit of innovation , a broad worldwide vision , a firm principle for the development of the party .  This thinking is the foundation underlying all our efforts to build the party , is the cornerstone for exercising the ruling power , and is also the source of our party 's strength .  
In the course of leading the whole party and the people of the entire country to continuously advance the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the party Central Committee , with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , has persistently integrated the basic tenets of Marxism with the practice of the modernization drive in the contemporary China and has constantly deepened the understanding of party building of the ruling party and the law governing the socialist modernization drive .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important " 1 July " speech indicates that the important " three represents " thinking has become a complete theoretical system , that our party 's understanding of the objective laws governing the building of our party as a ruling party has reached a new level , and that the development of the Marxist theory on party building has developed to a new stage .  
Through study , further improve the capability for observing and handling issues from a political perspective , achieve a profound understanding of the spirit of advancing with the passage of time , work hard to adapt to the profound changes in the party ' s tasks and ruling environment , and change outdated ideas , practices , and working mechanisms .  
It is understood that in the view of the top Chinese leadership , the core of the " three represents " thinking ( the CPC represents the developing needs of China 's advanced social productive forces , the forward direction of advanced Chinese culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people ) lies in : Demanding the CPC continue preserving its advanced nature , winning popular support , and maintaining and consolidating its position as a ruling party under the new historical conditions .  
Each country has its own national condition and should build and perfect its ruling party system in the light of its national reality ; the key lies in helping economic development and political stability and helping to safeguard and realize the people 's fundamental interests .  
while in Japan , the three-party ruling coalition is divided in opinion , 21 mass organizations have staged demonstrations in protest , and another 14 religious bodies have issued objection statements .  However Koizumi turned a deaf ear to all this , and was bent on having his own way on the issue of paying homage to the Yasukuni Shrine ; and his thickheaded performance has made him excel all his predecessors .  
Each country has its own national condition and should build and perfect its ruling party system in the light of its national reality ; the key lies in helping economic development and political stability and helping to safeguard and realize the people 's fundamental interests .  
The important thinking on " three represents , " the party-building theory for a communist party and especially a communist party in a ruling position , and the thesis on combining the long-term struggle objective of the communist party with the contemporary historical tasks are all important theoretical subjects related to all branches of culture and social sciences .  The theoretical research work of the academy must deal with every issue and every link through in-depth study and understanding .  
Faced with the challenge of a new century , the fiscal budget announced yesterday farsightedly called for " taking advantage of global economic integration " and " firmly grasping excellent opportunities in the hinterland to open the door to prosperity " and this has reflected new thinking and a new style in a period of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong .  
The military pointed out that the result of the presidential poll , which led to a change of the ruling party , aroused discontent from military cadres , most of whom are Kuomintang members .  For this reason , Defense Minister Tang Fei and Chief of General Staff Tang Yao-ming both made speeches at the meeting , hoping that the three armed services will submit to the election outcome and focus on stabilizing the situation and reassuring the public .

The CPC as the ruling party and our country as a socialist state under the leadership of the Communist Party must never allow the continued existence and development of such barbarous , decadent , backward , and ugly social evils .  
The " political power machine " which the KMT built while it was ruling the mainland was not completely destroyed during the KMT-CPC civil war , and after arriving in Taiwan it was concentrated , mended , and reformed into what is now this deformed " political power machine " which is " a province but not a province , not a state but claiming to be a state , and neither fish nor fowl . "  After taking up power , Chen Shui-bian can hardly resolve this problem for the time being .  
Right now , our party is ruling in a large nation with a population of more than 1.2 billion , Jiang Zemin pointed out .  Without a large number of leading cadres that combine political integrity with professional ability , it is definitely impossible to lead the people of all nationalities throughout the country to push forward our arduous cause of modernization under the complex international and domestic situation .  
Hu Jintao , member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee and vice president , stressed during a recent inspection trip in Tianjin : Strengthening the building of urban communities is a natural requirement of a well-coordinated economic and social development in cities ; and is also of a great significance to deepening reform , promoting the country 's economic growth , improving the quality of life for the masses , maintaining social stability , and consolidating the ruling position of our party .  
Taiwan says that the " National Reunification Council " is an advisory group that was set up under " the existing reunification consensus , " while the " Supra-Party Group Conference " " has recognized that the ( one-China ) consensus was subject to problems and even antagonism , so has jointly faced up to the future by setting up a mechanism to unite and congeal the views of both ruling and opposition parties , to rebuild the consensus . "  
It is precisely because of the unceasing strengthening and improvement of its own development that the CPC has always maintained plentiful vitality and exuberant fighting spirit .  As a result , from a small party of a few dozen members early in the 20th century it gradually developed into a ruling party that had led the Chinese people in becoming masters of their own destiny .  
In accordance with the anti-dumping legal procedures , the State Economic and Trade Commission gave an initial ruling to the case on 13 April 2000 after conducting comprehensive investigations and considering the replies given by the Japanese and ROK governments and enterprises involved in the case .  The ruling maintained that there was essential damage on domestic industries , which was caused by dumping .  
According to relevant stipulations , if the two interested parties apply , investigation organs must give an opportunity for both sides to express their opinions face to face .  Therefore , the industrial damage investigation and adjudication committees of the State Economic and Trade Commission decided to hold the current public hearing into the ruling of industrial damage .  
Li Mingyu , a standing committee member , noted : the implementation of the strategy of ruling the country by law is demanding higher and higher standards for the quality of judges and procurators .  Placing stress on the academic requirements on judges and procurators , the current amendments have addressed just to the right issue , which suits the need for development of the legal system in our country .  
The government and the opposition parties are engaged in wave after wave of defensive and offensive battles centering on the issues , such as mainland policy , economic policy , and coalition cabinet .  Moreover , there are divergent voices within the ruling authorities and the DPP and the stock market has been sluggish for a long time .  These situations have to do with the current chaotic and uncertain cross-strait situation .  
2 .  Making administrative affairs transparent is a key link to promoting legal administration , realizing the basic plan for ruling the country according to law , and building a socialist country ruled by law .  
Making no mention whatsoever about the Taiwan authorities ' defeat in their internal struggles with the Mainland for the ruling power in China and in the external struggles for China 's representation , he simply characterizes the two sides of the strait as two independent sovereign countries since Taiwan was separated from the Mainland in 1949 .  
The opposition parties have been continuously bombarding the National Reunification Council , and the outlook for the " Chen-Lien Meeting " has changed .  Subsequently the roundtable of political parties may be in the dilemma of breaking up .  Moreover , discontent within the DPP as the minority ruling party is continuing to brew , with the grudge directed at the financial and economic cabinet members .  
4 ) Speed up the process of making the leading and ruling systems more scientific , democratic , and institutionalized ; perfect the supervisory mechanisms of the party , the masses , and the media so that those with the motive to commit craft can not do so .  
Lien Chan noted that the KMT already formed a sound mainland-work mechanism when it was a ruling party .  Under this mechanism , he said , the NUC has , since its establishment , carried out its functions of integrating the opinions of the majority of people , safeguarding Taiwan 's security , and stabilizing the situation in the Taiwan Strait . The organization can play an active and positive role in promoting constructive interaction between the two sides of the strait , he added .  
Under the system of multiparty cooperation led by the CPC , the democratic parties unite and cooperate with the ruling party in exerting for the cause of building socialism .  Together , they have created a stable environment for liberating and developing the productive forces and maintaining the sustainable development of the economy , thus enabling China to make achievements of world interest in economic construction .  
Ding Guangen said : Building civilized communities is urgently needed for enhancing the ideological and political work and building a spiritual civilization , for gearing up our urban construction and management , for improving the living environment of residents and safeguarding social and political stability , and for building close party-mass ties and consolidating the foundation of our party as a ruling party .  
In particular , since the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee , the party central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has set forth comprehensive and profound theses on cadre supervision around the two historical themes of enhancing the party 's leading and ruling capability and enhancing the party 's ability to resist corruption and degeneration and overcome risks , and has set forth explicit guidelines , basic principles , targets , and requirements for cadre supervision work in the new period .  
The grave corruption issue has greatly damaged the Chinese ruling party and government reputation , adversely affected the smooth progress of reform , opening up , and economic construction , and threatened social and political stability .  
This " Proposal " which outlines the grand blueprint for China 's modernization drive in the 21st century is the phasal guideline for the ruling party to realize its dream of making the country strong and prosperous in the new century .  It is a historic document guiding China 's economic and social development in the next five years .  It is therefore of great and far-reaching significance .  
More than five months have passed since the Democratic Progressive Party [ DPP ] became the ruling party in Taiwan . During this period , Taiwan 's situation has not improved as the general public expected .  On the contrary , there have been continuous political storms , chaos , and contradictions , as well as a growing feeling of insecurity among the public .  
The opposition parties believe that Taiwan 's leader puts undue emphasis on ideology , defies public opinion , undermines established systems , and tramples on the consultation and mutual trust mechanism between the ruling and opposition parties .  They believe that as a result of this , the economy is depressed , the unemployment rate is rising , the stock market is dropping , and the people 's wealth is sharply diminishing .  
Jiang Zemin said : Since the formation of the new Cambodian government , the two major ruling parties have , proceeding from the fundamental national and ethnic interests , cooperated unifiedly and worked hard to consolidate national reconciliation , developed the economy , actively developed foreign relations , and made tremendous achievements in domestic and foreign affairs work .  
The election this year was held at a time when the US economy is prospering for the ninth successive year , the social environment is relatively stable , and the United States has maintained its strong international status .  According to convention , this domestic and foreign situation should benefit the ruling Democratic Party instead of the opposition Republican Party .  
The Chinese Government and people are speeding up reforms of the economic and political systems , putting into effect an economic and social development strategy geared to the 21st century , and practicing an administrative strategy of ruling the country according to law and building a state with legal system .  All this is in the final analysis aimed at fundamentally and continually improving the state of human rights in China .  
Bush will certainly feel uneasy sitting in the Oval Office because he lost the popular vote to Gore by 500,000 votes , fought a 36-day battle over vote recounts , emerged from more than 40 fierce lawsuits by way of a US Supreme Court " ruling , " and endured continual derision , jabs , and " knocks " from Democrats and the media even before taking office .  Moreover , signs of a weak administration are appearing in numerous places .  
This important idea is a brilliant summary of our party 's basic strategy of leading the people to rule the country and bring peace and stability to it , an incisive summation of all experiences in ruling a country , which was gained by China and other countries in ancient times and today , and a new contribution to the Marxist theory of state , which is of momentous and far-reaching significance to promoting China 's reform , development , and stability in the new century and achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .  
People of all sectors of Taiwan have pointed out that the Chen Shui-bian government has bent on pursuing Taiwan independence and has been unable to adhere to a correct policy , resulting in conflicts between Taiwan 's ruling and opposition parties , social confrontations , economic recession , deteriorating social order , financial and economic crises , and political instability , and even the government has been unable to practice its policies .  
In spite of strenuous efforts in implementing the CFA judgment , the implementation difficulties encountered in the past few months ; the population problems triggered by the ruling ; as well as the far-reaching impact on our society and economy have left us with no alternative but to contemplate repeatedly the true legislative intent of the relevant provisions of the Basic Law , with a view to resolving the crisis brought about by the CFA judgment .  
There is no reason to believe that the relevant CFA judgement is not consistent with the true legislative intent .  We also accept the CFA ruling which holds that the arrangement under the existing legislation that only persons born outside Hong Kong of female Hong Kong permanent residents are eligible for ROA is discriminatory and inconsistent with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .  
Both exchanges ' ruling bodies believe that the market reform as proposed by the Financial Secretary of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is vital to the future development of Hong Kong 's financial services industry and that it will be critical to maintain and strengthen further Hong Kong 's position as a global financial centre in the increasingly competitive international securities and derivatives market .  
In the case concerned , the CFA has only elaborated on the related provisions of the Law Amendment and Reform ( Consolidation ) Ordinance but did not alter the mechanism for calculating damages .  Basing on this , we are of the opinion that the ruling should be supported since it can provide the grief and poverty stricken dependents of the deceased with a more reasonable compensation which can help relieve their hardships .  
Future historians will note that : ' The ruling Kuomintang in this election adopted a pluralistic nominating policy and stable , moderate , reform-minded attitudes ; this strategy enabled the party to mobilize the country 's stability-seeking " silent majority " in a unified and systematic fashion and thereby obtain a glorious victory .  
Because of many years of a stable social environment and many years in the role of ruling party , a trend of " party bureaucratization " was inevitably formed . From now on , we must choose cadres from among the general public , and evaluate cadres on the basis of their actual service work , correct misconceptions on the part of cadres , and set cadres with incorrect attitudes straight .  
It only lowers art to the status of a decorative product for the enjoyment of the upper and middle classes , identifying itself with the tangible and intangible rules of the ruling class . " So Chung calls for raising public awareness over reform within the system .  
Its stumbling reform measures have given rise to such adverse side effects as graft , corruption , and soaring prices at the same time as they whetted the ardent hopes of the people for complete reform , resulting in the mass movements in Tienanmen Square . - - The bloody suppression in Tienanmen Square not only exposed the true nature of the Communists ' tyrannous regime , it also pointed up the internal contradictions among the political ruling class .  
The election also showed what might be a weakness in the KMT policy of priming its most elite members for central government offices , out of the desire to put the best brain power in decision-making positions concerning overall public policies . It now is evident that , while the ruling party focused its efforts on central government offices and overlooked the recruitment of candidates that can win in local elections , the DPP has launched its most elite manpower at the local level , especially in races for county magistrates and city mayors .  
Too much water for the pot : Such frequent switching was not really surprising considering there were 403 candidates fighting over 161 seats . With such a narrow chance of getting elected , even the well-oiled machine of the ruling Kuomintang ( KMT ) party was unable to smooth over the competing demands of its candidates .  
One candidate campaigning on an anti-Taiwanese independence ticket stirred up quite a bit of conflict when he went about the southern district of Taipei City " paying his respects " to his opponents . Even veteran ruling party whip Yao Eng-chi , nominated by the ruling party as candidate for Taitung County , did not exempt himself from the local customs and went to demonstrate at the Central Election Commission when his political views were misrepresented on the official election roster .  
In recent years , land speculation , a dramatic rise in the price of housing , stock speculation , and a string of scandals involving major public works pro-jects and purchasing have sullied the R . O . C . ' s political and economic environment . Political factions and financial consortiums have pushed their interests close to the center of power in the ruling party . These have laid the seeds of the people 's discontent . Everywhere one sees petitions for reform .  
Sixty years later , opium was being sold in huge quantities , and the tottering Qing dynasty , ruling an increasingly impoverished and decadent populace , could stand it no more : They decided to strictly ban opium , and burned existing stocks . The result was the Opium War , which launched a century of national humiliation for China .  
Even as the NA experiences the growing pains of competitive politics , the era of rule by the Chiang family has been receding farther back into memory . Recently Chiang Wei-kuo proposed moving the temporary graves of the two Chiang presidents ( Kai-shek and Ching-kuo ) to mainland China . This proposal launched the Chiang family back into the public eye and sparked turbulence on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and in ruling and opposition parties in Taiwan .  
Up on the hilltop , though , we find that a bitter wind is blowing-this is not the place of warm sunshine and gentle breezes that it appears from afar . The lone Monterey pine which stands there , the symbol of white ruling power , is scarred at the base of its trunk with a sawcut made by a Maori activist .  
Various parties have speculated on different possible causes , including engine stoppage and hijacking . Others have even suggested that the plane was victim of an artillery shot fired during recent military exercises . However , on the day of the crash the military called off area exercises due to rain , ruling out this last possibility . But until the aircraft 's black box is recovered , there is no way of really knowing what happened .  
On the heels of legal rulings that granted mothers greater rights to the custody of children and wives equal rights to a couple 's shared assets , Taiwan 's women 's groups in April of this year celebrated another victory when a decision by the Grand Council of Justices granted wives " the freedom to choose their place of residence . " The ruling represented another major step on the road toward equal rights in the ROC .  
Not conceding defeat , she filed a final appeal for a constitutional ruling . According to statistics in the yearbook of the Judicial Yuan , intentional abandonment is the most common grounds for divorce , accounting for more than half of all cases , many of which hinge upon the wife not living at her husband 's official residence .  
Apart from affirming the principle of sexual equality , this ruling also stressed that the constitution protects the freedom to choose one 's own residence . " Family relationships , freedom to choose one 's residence , and equality of the sexes , all of which are protected by the constitution , are interrelated , and among the inalienable rights of an individual , " wrote the China Times in an editorial . " It is essential that both husband and wife respect each other 's dignity . "  
The Daoists " assigned " those who attained immortality to beautiful Kunlun , and with the admixture of some popular imagination the Queen Mother of the West , who in ancient times had been a tribal leader , was also transformed from a hideous monster with a panther 's tail and tiger 's teeth into a beautiful woman in her thirties , ruling over the Fairyland of Kunlun .  
In another flagrant violation of procedure , a prosecutor once asked a suspect to place his foot into a footprint in order to check whether it matched . Says the police official , " It would have been devastating if this destruction of the evidence had led to a ruling of not guilty for lack of evidence . " It is n't just the general public that has a fuzzy understanding of how to conduct a proper investigation ; even some law enforcement professionals have problems !  
In the 1980s , in a China undergoing reform and liberalization and stressing intellectual liberation and the May Fourth spirit of enlightenment , eminent mainland scholar Wang Yuanhua responded to an overseas scholars ' assertion that the radical thinking of May Fourth Movement figures was expressed in " all-round rejection of tradition " with the following words : " What the May Fourth Movement was up against was a feudalism which had been the ruling ideology for thousands of years . . . . Hence to rebel against it required a much greater effort . "  
From today 's perspective we see that although the government has maintained a continuous , unbroken hold on Taiwan , it long since underwent significant changes : from the tight control over the country in the early years , when the national leader was supreme , to the no-holds-barred democracy of today ; from a reverential attachment to Confucian orthodoxy and the complete rejection of any notion that the leadership could content itself with ruling just a small fragment of the original country , to today 's chaotic national identity .  
On 24 March the Council of Grand Justices , which had been asked to examine the constitutionality of the assembly 's extension of its own term of office , ruled that the measure was invalid . Central Election Commission acting chairman Huang Shih-cheng has stated that if the Grand Justices ' ruling is confirmed , elections to the National Assembly will be held immediately , and can be expected to be completed before the assembly 's original mandate expires on 20 May .  
During the months leading up to the presidential election in March , non-cable TV stations China Television Company ( CTV ) , Taiwan Television ( TTV ) , and China Television System ( CTS ) were roundly criticized for biased and unbalanced reporting . There were reports that a senior executive at one of these stations actually issued an order to go all out in support of the ruling party . He reportedly said , " For the next three months , we do n't want you paying any attention to the ratings . "  
" The KMT lost because it was divided and because of the ' black gold ' issue , and not on account of its administrative track record , " says KMT legislator Chen Shei-saint . Viewed alongside the performance of the world 's other perennial ruling parties , the KMT 's record has been pretty good , with brisk economic growth in spite of environmental protests and the difficulties of industrial upgrading .  
One major problem that has come to light is the chaotic state of Taiwan 's financial system . The KMT government was forever being criticized for allowing the intrusion of politics into the financial arena-the collusion between big money , organized crime , and political forces that is referred to as " black and gold ruling in tandem . "  
The ruling party itself adopted her causes-democracy , freedom , and the ROC 's return to the United Nations-as its own . She found herself in the mainstream , and became one of the most influential members of the opposition party . She served in the national legislature , was invited to serve as a national policy advisor to the president , and was elected to two consecutive terms as county commissioner in Taoyuan . Before her second term was half finished , Chen Shui-bian selected her as his vice-presidential running mate .  
We will soon seek a consensus among the ruling and opposition parties , academia and the public so as to carry on with educational reforms and build a healthy , proactive , lively and innovative educational system , which will allow Taiwan to cultivate an uninterrupted stream of top-notch talents amid the fierce international competition .  
Shen Fu-hsiung , of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , has suggested that the legislature ought to go at least one term without hiding behind its legislative immunity . Bolstered by strong support from the administration and the public , prosecutors are continuing full-speed ahead with the campaign , and share prices have proven sensitive to the new political climate .  
I 'm more fortunate than my predecessors because I do n't have to deal with any pressure from within my own party or from powerful politicians . I 'm not faced with any major interference or resistance , and I enjoy the support of the people . An issue of due process Q : After George Chang , the DPP mayor of Tainan , was called in for questioning about the possible receipt of kickbacks , many people expressed deep disappointment , and said that the new ruling party is just as corrupt as the old one .  
The case has elicited the concern of human rights groups around the world . The London headquarters of Amnesty International , which describes the convictions as " the judicial ruling of an uncivilized nation , " has organized several support campaigns for the three men , and last May sent representatives to Taiwan , where they called a press conference and stated , " If Taiwan 's government intends to make human rights a trump card of its foreign policy , it should first grant clemency to the Hsichih trio . "  
On November 20 , the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) marked its sixth month as the ruling party , but because of a long series of political disturbances during the last half year , the Chen administration 's attempt to run a " government of the whole people " crumbled , and instead it formed a minority government . Thus , the cabinet has consistently found itself a " new hand behind the wheel . " Major policies naturally have not been fully implemented , engendering an aura of dejection , and dour expectations for the economy .  
Yu Shyi-kun , Secretary-General of the Presidential Office , stated that the president would respect the ruling of the Grand Justices , but said the language of the ruling does not appear to require a Cabinet reshuffle . The various opposition caucuses in the legislature issued a joint statement arguing that in describing the decision to suspend construction of the plant as " procedurally flawed , " the Grand Justices had in effect declared the Cabinet 's unilateral action illegal , and the Cabinet 's action has naturally lost legal validity for that reason .  
Last March the Grand Justices rendered a constitutional interpretation when the ruling and opposition parties were wrangling over a proposed term extension for all members of the National Assembly . The justices ruled that the decision making process violated the National Assembly 's rules of order and went against the principle that all decisions must be open and transparent . After the term extension was declared invalid , retaliatory constitutional amendments were proposed in the National Assembly to abolish the Council of Grand Justices and strip the justices of their lifetime stipends .  
Plans for the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant have triggered an intense struggle between opponents of nuclear power and those more concerned about industrial development . A constitutional ruling by the Council of Grand Justices appears to have moved the debate back to square one , with the ruling and opposition parties slugging it out once again .

At the same time , however , it seems clear that after the first transfer of power between political parties ever to take place in the 55 years since the Republic of China moved its capital to Taiwan , both the ruling and opposition parties are still learning how to play their proper roles . Taiwan 's democratic system will gradually mature amidst the unprecedented political changes taking place today in Taiwan .  
Lin Pao-chun says , " Before Historical Records , Chinese military strategy had absorbed the idea of ruling with compassion , and the highest objective of the student of the martial arts was to eliminate the violence in his own heart . Lin expands on this point , stating that in the ethos of the knight-errant , magnanimity was more important than fighting skill . Moreover , knights-errant were expected to be ethical , moral , honorable , decorous and patriotic , as well as protecting the common folk .  
When the KMT was voted out of the presidency last year after a half century in power , many worried that the Republic of China had come to an end , but our national identity is only clearer now that the Taiwan-oriented DPP has come to power . The ROC comprises the territory of Taiwan , Penghu , Kinmen , and Matsu . Only a ruling party free of historical baggage can take the bold surgical steps needed to rid the country of long-festering tumors .  
Putting high hopes on this election , four days before the vote President Chen Shui-bian put forward five main principles for his proposed " National Security Alliance " : to agree on national identity , achieve a breakthrough in cross-strait relations , promote democratic reforms , spark economic development , and eliminate social and political cleavages . He had hoped to achieve a consensus on these points between ruling and opposition parties .  
Because of Yu 's clear status as a " friendly critic " of the government , the ruling party always treated Yu with great respect . Yu long held a seat on the KMT 's Central Standing Committee . Many years ago while visiting family in mainland China , Yu was received as a VIP by Jiang Zemin . During their meeting , Yu forcefully expressed his position on the inappropriateness of the " one country , two systems " model , recommending instead a " China confederation " model .  
In late January , Legislative Yuan member Apollo Chen held a press conference to plead the case for giving permanent residency rights to Doris Brougham and other foreigners who long ago put down roots in Taiwan . Both ruling and opposition parties agreed that the issue was worthy of prompt attention , and later President Chen Shui-bian and interior minister Yu Cheng-hsien also publicly expressed their support .  
Vice President Lu stressed that this initiative was undertaken in support of President Chen 's " go south " policy , aimed at opening up new horizons for Taiwanese business investment in Southeast Asia . Further , she expressed her gratitude to Indonesia 's ruling and opposition parties and to members of its private sector for extending their hand of friendship and courageously embracing Taiwan 's expressions of goodwill in defiance of a powerful country 's bullying bluster .  
In an unexpected development in this connection , to escape debt obligations a major shareholder in a venture-capital firm who has close ties with the ruling DPP has alleged the existence of a complex network of interlocking party and business funds involving illicit kickbacks to members of several different parties .  
In particular , the 23 November demonstration on the streets of Taipei by 120,000 farmers and fishermen drew the attention of the whole nation . It stole much of the thunder from the first round of live TV debates between the Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral candidates , which had taken place shortly beforehand . The lack of coordination between the presidential office and the cabinet , the voices of dissent against the central government from within the ruling DPP and the continuing political fallout from the cabinet reshuffle will inevitably impact the Taipei and Kaohsiung elections .  
Under the WTO regime , Japan again lost in arbitration over complaints brought by foreign countries . WTO rulings are more enforceable , so within 15 months of the ruling Japan raised taxes on sake and somewhat lowered tariffs on imports of hard liquor . Nonetheless , by hemming and hawing , Japan put off raising taxes on sake for more than a decade .  
With the public in an uproar and politicians scrambling to distance themselves from corruption , the Legislative Yuan 's Home and Nations Committee completed its initial review of the political contributions law , and the ruling and opposition parties were expecting to get the bill through the third and final reading during the recently concluded legislative session . But progress screeched to a halt when one of the opposition parties unexpectedly turned against the legislation .  
DPP legislator Eugene Jao suggested that public hearings be held during the upcoming legislative session to solicit the views of the public concerning how to achieve passage of a political contributions law . Since the ruling and opposition parties have already been working to hammer out a mutually acceptable bill , Jao feels that there is still hope for the coming session .  
Premier Yu Shyi-kun declared that the ruling party would handle the protest in a gentle , transparent , and open manner , and expressed understanding and respect for any lawsuits that the pan-blue camp might bring with regard to the election . But he also emphasized that everything would have to proceed according to legal procedures .  
In his statement , the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ecuador failed to explain that the Protocol of Peace , Friendship and Limits signed on 29 January 1942 by Peru and Ecuador is the international treaty that set the definitive frontier between our two countries and that the arbitral ruling made by Captain Bras D \ x { 71f0 } s de Aguiar of Brazil on 15 July 1945 resolved the disagreements on the demarcation of the frontier , which had already been delineated .  
In many Latin American countries , the paradox of overabundant legislation and overemphasized democracy contrasting with the fragmentation of society , deep economic inequalities and the low level of political participation suggests that the ruling \ x { 5e68 } ite is attempting to overcome the weak integration of society by developing the legal framework of a democratic state of law addressing the whole people .  
In a judgement rendered on 21 April 1982 , the Supreme Court of Justice , ruling on appeal , declared void a provision on bank employees ' labour contracts which gave married male employees the unreserved right to a domestic subsidy , while allowing the subsidy to married female employees only under severely restricted conditions . 
The Inter _ American Court of Human Rights , for example , in a ground _ breaking ruling , found that amnesty for the perpetrators of serious human rights violations was incompatible with the right of every individual to a fair hearing before an impartial and independent court .  
Reflecting the requirements of the situation prevailing at the time , the respected leader Comrade Kim Il Sung , in his speech on 6 August 1971 , advanced the policy of new , wide-ranging negotiations whereby we were ready to come into contact at any time with all political parties including the ruling " Democratic Republican Party " , social organizations and individual personages of south Korea . 
As already reported , the recent incident is , in essence , a part of the current reckless provocation moves of the south Korean chief executive to look for a way out of a most serious ruling crisis in a shocking incident and to delay his doomed life .  
However , backed by international legal experts , including the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe , the President refused to accept the Court 's ruling and insisted on parliamentary elections , to be held in mid _ October 1997 .  15 .  Nationwide municipal elections were scheduled for 13 and 14 September 1997 , just subsequent to the drafting of the present report .  
The Inter _ American Court of Human Rights , for example , in a ground _ breaking ruling , found that amnesty for the perpetrators of serious human rights violations was incompatible with the right of every individual to a fair hearing before an impartial and independent court .  
In addition , the Special Rapporteurs attention was drawn to the fact that all major daily newspapers are very closely tied to companies connected to political parties in the ruling Government , which makes the Malaysian press dependent upon the Government .  
The courts in a number of civil law States had ruled that any such agreement must be subject to domestic administrative law , and one of the practical consequences of that ruling was that Governments were unwilling to agree to submit disputes to arbitration , since the law itself provided specific remedies , penalties and rights .  
Considering the care that has been shown by the ruling party to grant citizenship , and thus voting rights , to the " diaspora " ( ethnic Croats who live abroad ) , the Special Rapporteur places special emphasis on the rights of all those who qualify for Croatian citizenship , irrespective of ethnicity , and especially refugees , to claim citizenship in a timely manner , thus enabling them to participate in the forthcoming Croatian elections .  
He recalls that the election observer mission of the OSCE concluded that the presidential elections of 15 June 1997 may have been free but were not fair , and did not meet minimum democratic standards because the State-owned media - particularly television - showed favouritism towards the ruling party .  
Not at issue before the superior appellate court was 1 ) the holding by the lower court that a notice of lack of conformity made within 7 to 17 days was in time , given that the goods in question concerned meat that was frozen , not fresh ( article 39 CISG ) ; and 2 ) the ruling that , as the CISG does not expressly deal with the burden of proof , such lacuna must be filled by interpretation of the Convention .  Abstracts published in German : [ 1998 ] Schweizerische Juristen-Zeitung 146 ;  
This infamous decree lunatic , ludicrous and amply reflective of a pre-planned , diabolical scheme by the ruling Pakistani junta , the main force behind the Talibanization of the region is aimed at the annihilation of the historical and cultural identity of Afghanistan .  
Given this situation , which was strange to say the least , the Front Populaire Ivoirien ( FPI , socialist opposition ) candidate , Mr . Laurent Gbagbo , who , like many of his fellow citizens , interpreted this unexplained silence as a manoeuvre on the part of the chief of the ruling junta , appealed to him and , in an effort to spare the Ivorian people a fate similar to that of Yugoslavia , urged him not to thwart the democratic process .  
The ruling is a positive sign , in that it was objective and made a point of stating that the investigation of the facts must continue , but at the same time it demonstrated the impunity surrounding such acts , in that the authorities responsible for the investigation were unable to gather sufficient evidence to prosecute the real culprits .  
We must firmly redress the erroneous tendency to neglect ideological and political work and to " pay more attention to material progress than to cultural and ideological progress " in some places and departments ; develop a stronger sense of responsibility and urgency ; and conscientiously pay attention to and step up the effort to solve a series of major issues facing the effort to strengthen and improve ideological and political work , from the perspective of consolidating the party 's status as a ruling party and accomplishing the party 's historical mission .  
It has been proven by historical experiences that without the heartfelt endorsement and vigorous support of the broad masses of people , our Party could not possibly have developed from a weak and small beginning into a strong and large force and displayed decisive historical roles in putting an end to the situation of China being carved up by foreign powers and laboring people being oppressed and exploited by reactionary ruling classes and in the struggles of changing the look of poverty and backwardness in China .  
ensure social stability at the grassroots level , ensure the security of grassroots political power , and ensure normal local economic and social development .  By achieving these we will make new and greater contributions to the acceleration of the development of democracy and the legal system at the grassroots level , to the implementation of the basic strategy of ruling the country by law , and to the accelerated construction of a socialist state ruled by law .  
In 1972 , the heads of state of the United States and the Soviet Union had no alternative but held talks to sign the " Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty " , which explicitly restricted both sides in the establishment of an anti-ballistic missile defense system , thus ruling out the possibility that one side could launch a nuclear attack without being punished .  This was acclaimed by the international community .  
Under the conditions of promoting reform and opening up and being in the ruling position , our party must constantly resist all kinds of corrosive influence and culture .  Therefore , to the broad masses of party members and cadres , it is particularly important to strengthen the building of spiritual civilization and continuously raise their ideological , moral , scientific and cultural qualities .  
On 4 December 1999 , the court of final appeal of the special administrative region unanimously gave the ruling that the interpretation by the NPC Standing Committee is legal and in keeping with the constitution .  All those who really are concerned about the future prosperity and stability of Hong Kong held that Hong Kong 's judicial independence has not changed in the least by the interpretation .  
As an organic whole , the concept of the " three represents " has put forward the need for the " elimination of exploitation and polarization " as the basic social problem to be solved during the development of socialist society , which is required by the Marxist ruling party in its strategy for social development .  
The world is still not free from disturbance .  In face of the complicated situation in which international relations are undergoing profound adjustments , opportunities and challenges coexist , political parties of all countries , including the ruling , participating , and opposition parties , are keeping eyes on the 21st century in a bid to explore a development strategy that better fits the trend of the times and their respective reality .  
In additional to the meeting between leaders of the highest level of China and the DPRK , our party has continued to maintain high-level contacts with the Vietnamese and the Laos parties .  We also organized two important theoretical discussion activities with the Vietnamese parties , which contributed to improving friendly relations between the ruling parties of the socialist countries .  
refining and distilling the ruling party 's " governing " policy and historical mission of developing productive forces and culture and realizing the people 's interests in such a way as to make them the ruling party 's fundamental guiding principle on " administering the party " has answered the important historical questions of " what kind of party we should build and how we should build our party " ; all this has raised Marxist party building theory to a higher level .  
Since the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy , we have been paying full attention to regulating people 's conduct with legal means in order to meet the requirements of developing the socialist market economy .  Meanwhile , rule by law has been defined as a basic strategy for ruling the country .  
Thereby , the key to consolidating and developing the current gratifying situation , realizing objectives in the Outline of the 10th Five-Year Plan , and fulfilling the three major historical tasks in the new century hinges on further implementing the important thinking of the " three represents " as put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin . Besides , the party should achieve its ideological and organizational construction , improve its work styles , and ceaselessly improve its leadership , its ruling level , and its capability of resisting corruption and preventing peaceful evolution .  
We should profoundly understand the great significance of studying , and practicing the important thinking on " three represents " from the level of " the foundation of building the party , the basis of ruling the country , and the source of strength , " vigorously step up ideological and political building , and ensure that the important thinking on " three represents " is truly implemented in building national defense and the armed forces .  
Korea 's ruling party and opposition parties also issued a statement specifically saying that they unanimously and strongly blamed Japan for planning to pass this history textbook , and achieving the evil goal of twisting history and whitewashing their past barbaric behavior towards Asian people .  They also demanded that the Korean government marshall all its forces to take a decisive counteraction toward Japan .  
We must , from the political high plane of " consolidating the ruling position of our party and guaranteeing the lengthy and peaceful reign of our country " gain a correct understanding of the great importance that lies in our effort to uphold the fundamental principle that the party commands the gun ; and must see to it that the awareness of the army soul can strike deep roots in the hearts of every officer and man .  
We must uphold the guideline of grasping things with both hands , with both hands firm , combine ruling the country according to law with ruling the country with ethics , follow the orientation for progress of advanced culture , and make efforts to enhance the ideological and moral standard and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation .  
Developing socialist democracy must be combined with making socialist democracy a systematic and legalized affair ; we must follow the law , strictly enforce the law , pursue violations of law , and also integrate ruling the country according to law with ruling the country with ethics , so as to ensure that all work in the state proceeds in smooth fashion , ensure good economic and social order , and ensure the civil rights and legitimate interests of the masses .  
The " three advantages " criterion constitutes the standard for us to judge all our work in carrying out China 's reform and opening-up program and developing the socialist modernization drive .  In this way , the thinking on " three represents " helps set the goals for party building in the new period , and expand the historical mission of the Communist Party of China in the new period .  It also provides a theoretical guidance to the ruling party for further strengthening its cultural , social , and economic foundations .  
The ruling Japanese Liberal Democratic Party is not lacking in rightwing forces hostile to China ; they do not want to see a reunified and strong China , and still harbor covetous ambitions regarding Taiwan , China 's sacred territory , hence they look with great favor on Lee Teng-hui , who fondly remembers Japan 's colonial rule over Taiwan , and have supported Lee Teng-hui 's visit with coordinated action .  This has fully revealed the conspiracy of Japanese rightwing forces in wallowing in the mire with Taiwan independence forces and stepping up their merger .  
The list of US arms sales to Taiwan has been generally decided .  Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan held that safeguarding national security is the consistent stand of the ruling and opposition parties .  He also stressed that Taiwan must not pay attention to the " theory that weapons alone decide the outcome of war . "  He said that obtaining weapons does not necessarily mean ensuring national defense security , and national defense security alone is not equivalent to national security and that real national security must have political support , which means stable cross-strait relations .  
As a matter of fact , that a rightwing politician like Koizumi can become the president of a ruling party and the prime minister of Japan and that an extreme rightwing politician like Shintaro Ishihara could be elected Tokyo Governor a few years ago have precisely reflected that the rightist trend is gaining momentum in Japan 's political arena .  
The following overall appraisals of Taiwan under the DPP " green ruling party " over the past year can be made : The political situation is chaotic , cross-strait relations continue to be tense , the economy is slipping tremendously , there is social unrest , and Taiwan not only has not " moved up , " it has instead continually " sunk downwards . "  
Since Chen Shui-bian , a member of the Democratic Progressive Party , assumed the high post of president by winning less than 40 percent of the votes a year ago , Taiwan has suffered from political chaos and an economic downturn , with its unemployment rate jumping to a new 16-year high .  Both the ruling and the opposition parties have been trying their utmost to break through an encirclement at the year-end legislative elections .  
In short , " the armed forces to be with no party affiliation " , " nonpoliticization of the armed forces " , and " nationalization of the armed forces " preached by the Western hostile forces are three poisonous swords , and their sinister intentions are to make our party " lose " its absolute leadership over the armed forces and " lose " its ruling position , to make our state " lose " its socialist nature , and to make our people 's army " lose " its political nature .  
The dominant position of public ownership , the nature of state power of people 's democracy , and the CPC 's ruling position have determined that the ideological reflection of such economic and political relationships can only be the use of Marxism as the party 's and the state 's guiding ideology .  
The party needs to realize the most extensive great unity with all allied forces not only when the party is weak but also when the party has grown stronger , not only when the party is fighting to seize the political power but also when the party is holding the ruling status , not only when the party is carrying out revolution but also when the party is engaged in construction and reforms .  
Zheng Bijian said that in studying and understanding the important explication of " three represents , " it is imperative for us to further focus our understanding and actions on the issue of the advanced nature of the party and on the question of how the party , beginning from ideological building , organizational building , work-style building , and system building , can build itself into a genuine Marxist ruling party that always stays ahead of the trend of the times and that are completely consolidated ideologically , politically , and organizationally .  
Why has our Party been able to have become eminent among various political forces in modern Chinese society , turned from small to big and from weak to strong , developed from only more than 50 people at the very beginning to the biggest ruling party in the world with more than 64-million Party members , and achieved these brilliant achievements ? 
They said : The important thinking on " three represents " set forth by General Secretary Jiang Zemin provides the foundation underlying our efforts for building the party , is the cornerstone for exercising the ruling power , and is also the source of our party 's strength .  It inherits and develops the Marxist party-building theory , embodies the ideological line of emancipating minds and seeking truth from facts , embodies our party 's character and fundamental principle , and embodies the spirit of theoretical innovation and advancing with the times .  
Participants held that the important thinking of " three represents " has let the basic demands of maintaining the advanced nature of the party and enabling it to always serve as a strong leadership core in building socialism with Chinese characteristics run through the theories and practice of building the ruling party , and clearly put forward a series of important new requirements for the party to strengthen itself in the new century .  
Being an integrated concept , " three represents " has a distinguished advanced feature , and embodies a scientific spirit of innovation , a broad worldwide vision , a firm principle for the development of the party .  This thinking is the foundation underlying all our efforts to build the party , is the cornerstone for exercising the ruling power , and is also the source of our party 's strength .  
In the course of leading the whole party and the people of the entire country to continuously advance the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the party Central Committee , with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , has persistently integrated the basic tenets of Marxism with the practice of the modernization drive in the contemporary China and has constantly deepened the understanding of party building of the ruling party and the law governing the socialist modernization drive .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important " 1 July " speech indicates that the important " three represents " thinking has become a complete theoretical system , that our party 's understanding of the objective laws governing the building of our party as a ruling party has reached a new level , and that the development of the Marxist theory on party building has developed to a new stage .  
Through study , further improve the capability for observing and handling issues from a political perspective , achieve a profound understanding of the spirit of advancing with the passage of time , work hard to adapt to the profound changes in the party ' s tasks and ruling environment , and change outdated ideas , practices , and working mechanisms .  
It is understood that in the view of the top Chinese leadership , the core of the " three represents " thinking ( the CPC represents the developing needs of China 's advanced social productive forces , the forward direction of advanced Chinese culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people ) lies in : Demanding the CPC continue preserving its advanced nature , winning popular support , and maintaining and consolidating its position as a ruling party under the new historical conditions .  
Each country has its own national condition and should build and perfect its ruling party system in the light of its national reality ; the key lies in helping economic development and political stability and helping to safeguard and realize the people 's fundamental interests .  
while in Japan , the three-party ruling coalition is divided in opinion , 21 mass organizations have staged demonstrations in protest , and another 14 religious bodies have issued objection statements .  However Koizumi turned a deaf ear to all this , and was bent on having his own way on the issue of paying homage to the Yasukuni Shrine ; and his thickheaded performance has made him excel all his predecessors .  
Each country has its own national condition and should build and perfect its ruling party system in the light of its national reality ; the key lies in helping economic development and political stability and helping to safeguard and realize the people 's fundamental interests .  
The important thinking on " three represents , " the party-building theory for a communist party and especially a communist party in a ruling position , and the thesis on combining the long-term struggle objective of the communist party with the contemporary historical tasks are all important theoretical subjects related to all branches of culture and social sciences .  The theoretical research work of the academy must deal with every issue and every link through in-depth study and understanding .  
Faced with the challenge of a new century , the fiscal budget announced yesterday farsightedly called for " taking advantage of global economic integration " and " firmly grasping excellent opportunities in the hinterland to open the door to prosperity " and this has reflected new thinking and a new style in a period of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong .  
The military pointed out that the result of the presidential poll , which led to a change of the ruling party , aroused discontent from military cadres , most of whom are Kuomintang members .  For this reason , Defense Minister Tang Fei and Chief of General Staff Tang Yao-ming both made speeches at the meeting , hoping that the three armed services will submit to the election outcome and focus on stabilizing the situation and reassuring the public .

The CPC as the ruling party and our country as a socialist state under the leadership of the Communist Party must never allow the continued existence and development of such barbarous , decadent , backward , and ugly social evils .  
The " political power machine " which the KMT built while it was ruling the mainland was not completely destroyed during the KMT-CPC civil war , and after arriving in Taiwan it was concentrated , mended , and reformed into what is now this deformed " political power machine " which is " a province but not a province , not a state but claiming to be a state , and neither fish nor fowl . "  After taking up power , Chen Shui-bian can hardly resolve this problem for the time being .  
Right now , our party is ruling in a large nation with a population of more than 1.2 billion , Jiang Zemin pointed out .  Without a large number of leading cadres that combine political integrity with professional ability , it is definitely impossible to lead the people of all nationalities throughout the country to push forward our arduous cause of modernization under the complex international and domestic situation .  
Hu Jintao , member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee and vice president , stressed during a recent inspection trip in Tianjin : Strengthening the building of urban communities is a natural requirement of a well-coordinated economic and social development in cities ; and is also of a great significance to deepening reform , promoting the country 's economic growth , improving the quality of life for the masses , maintaining social stability , and consolidating the ruling position of our party .  
Taiwan says that the " National Reunification Council " is an advisory group that was set up under " the existing reunification consensus , " while the " Supra-Party Group Conference " " has recognized that the ( one-China ) consensus was subject to problems and even antagonism , so has jointly faced up to the future by setting up a mechanism to unite and congeal the views of both ruling and opposition parties , to rebuild the consensus . "  
It is precisely because of the unceasing strengthening and improvement of its own development that the CPC has always maintained plentiful vitality and exuberant fighting spirit .  As a result , from a small party of a few dozen members early in the 20th century it gradually developed into a ruling party that had led the Chinese people in becoming masters of their own destiny .  
In accordance with the anti-dumping legal procedures , the State Economic and Trade Commission gave an initial ruling to the case on 13 April 2000 after conducting comprehensive investigations and considering the replies given by the Japanese and ROK governments and enterprises involved in the case .  The ruling maintained that there was essential damage on domestic industries , which was caused by dumping .  
According to relevant stipulations , if the two interested parties apply , investigation organs must give an opportunity for both sides to express their opinions face to face .  Therefore , the industrial damage investigation and adjudication committees of the State Economic and Trade Commission decided to hold the current public hearing into the ruling of industrial damage .  
Li Mingyu , a standing committee member , noted : the implementation of the strategy of ruling the country by law is demanding higher and higher standards for the quality of judges and procurators .  Placing stress on the academic requirements on judges and procurators , the current amendments have addressed just to the right issue , which suits the need for development of the legal system in our country .  
The government and the opposition parties are engaged in wave after wave of defensive and offensive battles centering on the issues , such as mainland policy , economic policy , and coalition cabinet .  Moreover , there are divergent voices within the ruling authorities and the DPP and the stock market has been sluggish for a long time .  These situations have to do with the current chaotic and uncertain cross-strait situation .  
2 .  Making administrative affairs transparent is a key link to promoting legal administration , realizing the basic plan for ruling the country according to law , and building a socialist country ruled by law .  
Making no mention whatsoever about the Taiwan authorities ' defeat in their internal struggles with the Mainland for the ruling power in China and in the external struggles for China 's representation , he simply characterizes the two sides of the strait as two independent sovereign countries since Taiwan was separated from the Mainland in 1949 .  
The opposition parties have been continuously bombarding the National Reunification Council , and the outlook for the " Chen-Lien Meeting " has changed .  Subsequently the roundtable of political parties may be in the dilemma of breaking up .  Moreover , discontent within the DPP as the minority ruling party is continuing to brew , with the grudge directed at the financial and economic cabinet members .  
4 ) Speed up the process of making the leading and ruling systems more scientific , democratic , and institutionalized ; perfect the supervisory mechanisms of the party , the masses , and the media so that those with the motive to commit craft can not do so .  
Lien Chan noted that the KMT already formed a sound mainland-work mechanism when it was a ruling party .  Under this mechanism , he said , the NUC has , since its establishment , carried out its functions of integrating the opinions of the majority of people , safeguarding Taiwan 's security , and stabilizing the situation in the Taiwan Strait . The organization can play an active and positive role in promoting constructive interaction between the two sides of the strait , he added .  
Under the system of multiparty cooperation led by the CPC , the democratic parties unite and cooperate with the ruling party in exerting for the cause of building socialism .  Together , they have created a stable environment for liberating and developing the productive forces and maintaining the sustainable development of the economy , thus enabling China to make achievements of world interest in economic construction .  
Ding Guangen said : Building civilized communities is urgently needed for enhancing the ideological and political work and building a spiritual civilization , for gearing up our urban construction and management , for improving the living environment of residents and safeguarding social and political stability , and for building close party-mass ties and consolidating the foundation of our party as a ruling party .  
In particular , since the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee , the party central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has set forth comprehensive and profound theses on cadre supervision around the two historical themes of enhancing the party 's leading and ruling capability and enhancing the party 's ability to resist corruption and degeneration and overcome risks , and has set forth explicit guidelines , basic principles , targets , and requirements for cadre supervision work in the new period .  
The grave corruption issue has greatly damaged the Chinese ruling party and government reputation , adversely affected the smooth progress of reform , opening up , and economic construction , and threatened social and political stability .  
This " Proposal " which outlines the grand blueprint for China 's modernization drive in the 21st century is the phasal guideline for the ruling party to realize its dream of making the country strong and prosperous in the new century .  It is a historic document guiding China 's economic and social development in the next five years .  It is therefore of great and far-reaching significance .  
More than five months have passed since the Democratic Progressive Party [ DPP ] became the ruling party in Taiwan . During this period , Taiwan 's situation has not improved as the general public expected .  On the contrary , there have been continuous political storms , chaos , and contradictions , as well as a growing feeling of insecurity among the public .  
The opposition parties believe that Taiwan 's leader puts undue emphasis on ideology , defies public opinion , undermines established systems , and tramples on the consultation and mutual trust mechanism between the ruling and opposition parties .  They believe that as a result of this , the economy is depressed , the unemployment rate is rising , the stock market is dropping , and the people 's wealth is sharply diminishing .  
Jiang Zemin said : Since the formation of the new Cambodian government , the two major ruling parties have , proceeding from the fundamental national and ethnic interests , cooperated unifiedly and worked hard to consolidate national reconciliation , developed the economy , actively developed foreign relations , and made tremendous achievements in domestic and foreign affairs work .  
The election this year was held at a time when the US economy is prospering for the ninth successive year , the social environment is relatively stable , and the United States has maintained its strong international status .  According to convention , this domestic and foreign situation should benefit the ruling Democratic Party instead of the opposition Republican Party .  
The Chinese Government and people are speeding up reforms of the economic and political systems , putting into effect an economic and social development strategy geared to the 21st century , and practicing an administrative strategy of ruling the country according to law and building a state with legal system .  All this is in the final analysis aimed at fundamentally and continually improving the state of human rights in China .  
Bush will certainly feel uneasy sitting in the Oval Office because he lost the popular vote to Gore by 500,000 votes , fought a 36-day battle over vote recounts , emerged from more than 40 fierce lawsuits by way of a US Supreme Court " ruling , " and endured continual derision , jabs , and " knocks " from Democrats and the media even before taking office .  Moreover , signs of a weak administration are appearing in numerous places .  
This important idea is a brilliant summary of our party 's basic strategy of leading the people to rule the country and bring peace and stability to it , an incisive summation of all experiences in ruling a country , which was gained by China and other countries in ancient times and today , and a new contribution to the Marxist theory of state , which is of momentous and far-reaching significance to promoting China 's reform , development , and stability in the new century and achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .  
People of all sectors of Taiwan have pointed out that the Chen Shui-bian government has bent on pursuing Taiwan independence and has been unable to adhere to a correct policy , resulting in conflicts between Taiwan 's ruling and opposition parties , social confrontations , economic recession , deteriorating social order , financial and economic crises , and political instability , and even the government has been unable to practice its policies .  
In spite of strenuous efforts in implementing the CFA judgment , the implementation difficulties encountered in the past few months ; the population problems triggered by the ruling ; as well as the far-reaching impact on our society and economy have left us with no alternative but to contemplate repeatedly the true legislative intent of the relevant provisions of the Basic Law , with a view to resolving the crisis brought about by the CFA judgment .  
There is no reason to believe that the relevant CFA judgement is not consistent with the true legislative intent .  We also accept the CFA ruling which holds that the arrangement under the existing legislation that only persons born outside Hong Kong of female Hong Kong permanent residents are eligible for ROA is discriminatory and inconsistent with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .  
Both exchanges ' ruling bodies believe that the market reform as proposed by the Financial Secretary of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is vital to the future development of Hong Kong 's financial services industry and that it will be critical to maintain and strengthen further Hong Kong 's position as a global financial centre in the increasingly competitive international securities and derivatives market .  
In the case concerned , the CFA has only elaborated on the related provisions of the Law Amendment and Reform ( Consolidation ) Ordinance but did not alter the mechanism for calculating damages .  Basing on this , we are of the opinion that the ruling should be supported since it can provide the grief and poverty stricken dependents of the deceased with a more reasonable compensation which can help relieve their hardships .  
Future historians will note that : ' The ruling Kuomintang in this election adopted a pluralistic nominating policy and stable , moderate , reform-minded attitudes ; this strategy enabled the party to mobilize the country 's stability-seeking " silent majority " in a unified and systematic fashion and thereby obtain a glorious victory .  
Because of many years of a stable social environment and many years in the role of ruling party , a trend of " party bureaucratization " was inevitably formed . From now on , we must choose cadres from among the general public , and evaluate cadres on the basis of their actual service work , correct misconceptions on the part of cadres , and set cadres with incorrect attitudes straight .  
It only lowers art to the status of a decorative product for the enjoyment of the upper and middle classes , identifying itself with the tangible and intangible rules of the ruling class . " So Chung calls for raising public awareness over reform within the system .  
Its stumbling reform measures have given rise to such adverse side effects as graft , corruption , and soaring prices at the same time as they whetted the ardent hopes of the people for complete reform , resulting in the mass movements in Tienanmen Square . - - The bloody suppression in Tienanmen Square not only exposed the true nature of the Communists ' tyrannous regime , it also pointed up the internal contradictions among the political ruling class .  
The election also showed what might be a weakness in the KMT policy of priming its most elite members for central government offices , out of the desire to put the best brain power in decision-making positions concerning overall public policies . It now is evident that , while the ruling party focused its efforts on central government offices and overlooked the recruitment of candidates that can win in local elections , the DPP has launched its most elite manpower at the local level , especially in races for county magistrates and city mayors .  
Too much water for the pot : Such frequent switching was not really surprising considering there were 403 candidates fighting over 161 seats . With such a narrow chance of getting elected , even the well-oiled machine of the ruling Kuomintang ( KMT ) party was unable to smooth over the competing demands of its candidates .  
One candidate campaigning on an anti-Taiwanese independence ticket stirred up quite a bit of conflict when he went about the southern district of Taipei City " paying his respects " to his opponents . Even veteran ruling party whip Yao Eng-chi , nominated by the ruling party as candidate for Taitung County , did not exempt himself from the local customs and went to demonstrate at the Central Election Commission when his political views were misrepresented on the official election roster .  
In recent years , land speculation , a dramatic rise in the price of housing , stock speculation , and a string of scandals involving major public works pro-jects and purchasing have sullied the R . O . C . ' s political and economic environment . Political factions and financial consortiums have pushed their interests close to the center of power in the ruling party . These have laid the seeds of the people 's discontent . Everywhere one sees petitions for reform .  
Sixty years later , opium was being sold in huge quantities , and the tottering Qing dynasty , ruling an increasingly impoverished and decadent populace , could stand it no more : They decided to strictly ban opium , and burned existing stocks . The result was the Opium War , which launched a century of national humiliation for China .  
Even as the NA experiences the growing pains of competitive politics , the era of rule by the Chiang family has been receding farther back into memory . Recently Chiang Wei-kuo proposed moving the temporary graves of the two Chiang presidents ( Kai-shek and Ching-kuo ) to mainland China . This proposal launched the Chiang family back into the public eye and sparked turbulence on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and in ruling and opposition parties in Taiwan .  
Up on the hilltop , though , we find that a bitter wind is blowing-this is not the place of warm sunshine and gentle breezes that it appears from afar . The lone Monterey pine which stands there , the symbol of white ruling power , is scarred at the base of its trunk with a sawcut made by a Maori activist .  
Various parties have speculated on different possible causes , including engine stoppage and hijacking . Others have even suggested that the plane was victim of an artillery shot fired during recent military exercises . However , on the day of the crash the military called off area exercises due to rain , ruling out this last possibility . But until the aircraft 's black box is recovered , there is no way of really knowing what happened .  
On the heels of legal rulings that granted mothers greater rights to the custody of children and wives equal rights to a couple 's shared assets , Taiwan 's women 's groups in April of this year celebrated another victory when a decision by the Grand Council of Justices granted wives " the freedom to choose their place of residence . " The ruling represented another major step on the road toward equal rights in the ROC .  
Not conceding defeat , she filed a final appeal for a constitutional ruling . According to statistics in the yearbook of the Judicial Yuan , intentional abandonment is the most common grounds for divorce , accounting for more than half of all cases , many of which hinge upon the wife not living at her husband 's official residence .  
Apart from affirming the principle of sexual equality , this ruling also stressed that the constitution protects the freedom to choose one 's own residence . " Family relationships , freedom to choose one 's residence , and equality of the sexes , all of which are protected by the constitution , are interrelated , and among the inalienable rights of an individual , " wrote the China Times in an editorial . " It is essential that both husband and wife respect each other 's dignity . "  
The Daoists " assigned " those who attained immortality to beautiful Kunlun , and with the admixture of some popular imagination the Queen Mother of the West , who in ancient times had been a tribal leader , was also transformed from a hideous monster with a panther 's tail and tiger 's teeth into a beautiful woman in her thirties , ruling over the Fairyland of Kunlun .  
In another flagrant violation of procedure , a prosecutor once asked a suspect to place his foot into a footprint in order to check whether it matched . Says the police official , " It would have been devastating if this destruction of the evidence had led to a ruling of not guilty for lack of evidence . " It is n't just the general public that has a fuzzy understanding of how to conduct a proper investigation ; even some law enforcement professionals have problems !  
In the 1980s , in a China undergoing reform and liberalization and stressing intellectual liberation and the May Fourth spirit of enlightenment , eminent mainland scholar Wang Yuanhua responded to an overseas scholars ' assertion that the radical thinking of May Fourth Movement figures was expressed in " all-round rejection of tradition " with the following words : " What the May Fourth Movement was up against was a feudalism which had been the ruling ideology for thousands of years . . . . Hence to rebel against it required a much greater effort . "  
From today 's perspective we see that although the government has maintained a continuous , unbroken hold on Taiwan , it long since underwent significant changes : from the tight control over the country in the early years , when the national leader was supreme , to the no-holds-barred democracy of today ; from a reverential attachment to Confucian orthodoxy and the complete rejection of any notion that the leadership could content itself with ruling just a small fragment of the original country , to today 's chaotic national identity .  
On 24 March the Council of Grand Justices , which had been asked to examine the constitutionality of the assembly 's extension of its own term of office , ruled that the measure was invalid . Central Election Commission acting chairman Huang Shih-cheng has stated that if the Grand Justices ' ruling is confirmed , elections to the National Assembly will be held immediately , and can be expected to be completed before the assembly 's original mandate expires on 20 May .  
During the months leading up to the presidential election in March , non-cable TV stations China Television Company ( CTV ) , Taiwan Television ( TTV ) , and China Television System ( CTS ) were roundly criticized for biased and unbalanced reporting . There were reports that a senior executive at one of these stations actually issued an order to go all out in support of the ruling party . He reportedly said , " For the next three months , we do n't want you paying any attention to the ratings . "  
" The KMT lost because it was divided and because of the ' black gold ' issue , and not on account of its administrative track record , " says KMT legislator Chen Shei-saint . Viewed alongside the performance of the world 's other perennial ruling parties , the KMT 's record has been pretty good , with brisk economic growth in spite of environmental protests and the difficulties of industrial upgrading .  
One major problem that has come to light is the chaotic state of Taiwan 's financial system . The KMT government was forever being criticized for allowing the intrusion of politics into the financial arena-the collusion between big money , organized crime , and political forces that is referred to as " black and gold ruling in tandem . "  
The ruling party itself adopted her causes-democracy , freedom , and the ROC 's return to the United Nations-as its own . She found herself in the mainstream , and became one of the most influential members of the opposition party . She served in the national legislature , was invited to serve as a national policy advisor to the president , and was elected to two consecutive terms as county commissioner in Taoyuan . Before her second term was half finished , Chen Shui-bian selected her as his vice-presidential running mate .  
We will soon seek a consensus among the ruling and opposition parties , academia and the public so as to carry on with educational reforms and build a healthy , proactive , lively and innovative educational system , which will allow Taiwan to cultivate an uninterrupted stream of top-notch talents amid the fierce international competition .  
Shen Fu-hsiung , of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , has suggested that the legislature ought to go at least one term without hiding behind its legislative immunity . Bolstered by strong support from the administration and the public , prosecutors are continuing full-speed ahead with the campaign , and share prices have proven sensitive to the new political climate .  
I 'm more fortunate than my predecessors because I do n't have to deal with any pressure from within my own party or from powerful politicians . I 'm not faced with any major interference or resistance , and I enjoy the support of the people . An issue of due process Q : After George Chang , the DPP mayor of Tainan , was called in for questioning about the possible receipt of kickbacks , many people expressed deep disappointment , and said that the new ruling party is just as corrupt as the old one .  
The case has elicited the concern of human rights groups around the world . The London headquarters of Amnesty International , which describes the convictions as " the judicial ruling of an uncivilized nation , " has organized several support campaigns for the three men , and last May sent representatives to Taiwan , where they called a press conference and stated , " If Taiwan 's government intends to make human rights a trump card of its foreign policy , it should first grant clemency to the Hsichih trio . "  
On November 20 , the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) marked its sixth month as the ruling party , but because of a long series of political disturbances during the last half year , the Chen administration 's attempt to run a " government of the whole people " crumbled , and instead it formed a minority government . Thus , the cabinet has consistently found itself a " new hand behind the wheel . " Major policies naturally have not been fully implemented , engendering an aura of dejection , and dour expectations for the economy .  
Yu Shyi-kun , Secretary-General of the Presidential Office , stated that the president would respect the ruling of the Grand Justices , but said the language of the ruling does not appear to require a Cabinet reshuffle . The various opposition caucuses in the legislature issued a joint statement arguing that in describing the decision to suspend construction of the plant as " procedurally flawed , " the Grand Justices had in effect declared the Cabinet 's unilateral action illegal , and the Cabinet 's action has naturally lost legal validity for that reason .  
Last March the Grand Justices rendered a constitutional interpretation when the ruling and opposition parties were wrangling over a proposed term extension for all members of the National Assembly . The justices ruled that the decision making process violated the National Assembly 's rules of order and went against the principle that all decisions must be open and transparent . After the term extension was declared invalid , retaliatory constitutional amendments were proposed in the National Assembly to abolish the Council of Grand Justices and strip the justices of their lifetime stipends .  
Plans for the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant have triggered an intense struggle between opponents of nuclear power and those more concerned about industrial development . A constitutional ruling by the Council of Grand Justices appears to have moved the debate back to square one , with the ruling and opposition parties slugging it out once again .

At the same time , however , it seems clear that after the first transfer of power between political parties ever to take place in the 55 years since the Republic of China moved its capital to Taiwan , both the ruling and opposition parties are still learning how to play their proper roles . Taiwan 's democratic system will gradually mature amidst the unprecedented political changes taking place today in Taiwan .  
Lin Pao-chun says , " Before Historical Records , Chinese military strategy had absorbed the idea of ruling with compassion , and the highest objective of the student of the martial arts was to eliminate the violence in his own heart . Lin expands on this point , stating that in the ethos of the knight-errant , magnanimity was more important than fighting skill . Moreover , knights-errant were expected to be ethical , moral , honorable , decorous and patriotic , as well as protecting the common folk .  
When the KMT was voted out of the presidency last year after a half century in power , many worried that the Republic of China had come to an end , but our national identity is only clearer now that the Taiwan-oriented DPP has come to power . The ROC comprises the territory of Taiwan , Penghu , Kinmen , and Matsu . Only a ruling party free of historical baggage can take the bold surgical steps needed to rid the country of long-festering tumors .  
Putting high hopes on this election , four days before the vote President Chen Shui-bian put forward five main principles for his proposed " National Security Alliance " : to agree on national identity , achieve a breakthrough in cross-strait relations , promote democratic reforms , spark economic development , and eliminate social and political cleavages . He had hoped to achieve a consensus on these points between ruling and opposition parties .  
Because of Yu 's clear status as a " friendly critic " of the government , the ruling party always treated Yu with great respect . Yu long held a seat on the KMT 's Central Standing Committee . Many years ago while visiting family in mainland China , Yu was received as a VIP by Jiang Zemin . During their meeting , Yu forcefully expressed his position on the inappropriateness of the " one country , two systems " model , recommending instead a " China confederation " model .  
In late January , Legislative Yuan member Apollo Chen held a press conference to plead the case for giving permanent residency rights to Doris Brougham and other foreigners who long ago put down roots in Taiwan . Both ruling and opposition parties agreed that the issue was worthy of prompt attention , and later President Chen Shui-bian and interior minister Yu Cheng-hsien also publicly expressed their support .  
Vice President Lu stressed that this initiative was undertaken in support of President Chen 's " go south " policy , aimed at opening up new horizons for Taiwanese business investment in Southeast Asia . Further , she expressed her gratitude to Indonesia 's ruling and opposition parties and to members of its private sector for extending their hand of friendship and courageously embracing Taiwan 's expressions of goodwill in defiance of a powerful country 's bullying bluster .  
In an unexpected development in this connection , to escape debt obligations a major shareholder in a venture-capital firm who has close ties with the ruling DPP has alleged the existence of a complex network of interlocking party and business funds involving illicit kickbacks to members of several different parties .  
In particular , the 23 November demonstration on the streets of Taipei by 120,000 farmers and fishermen drew the attention of the whole nation . It stole much of the thunder from the first round of live TV debates between the Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral candidates , which had taken place shortly beforehand . The lack of coordination between the presidential office and the cabinet , the voices of dissent against the central government from within the ruling DPP and the continuing political fallout from the cabinet reshuffle will inevitably impact the Taipei and Kaohsiung elections .  
Under the WTO regime , Japan again lost in arbitration over complaints brought by foreign countries . WTO rulings are more enforceable , so within 15 months of the ruling Japan raised taxes on sake and somewhat lowered tariffs on imports of hard liquor . Nonetheless , by hemming and hawing , Japan put off raising taxes on sake for more than a decade .  
With the public in an uproar and politicians scrambling to distance themselves from corruption , the Legislative Yuan 's Home and Nations Committee completed its initial review of the political contributions law , and the ruling and opposition parties were expecting to get the bill through the third and final reading during the recently concluded legislative session . But progress screeched to a halt when one of the opposition parties unexpectedly turned against the legislation .  
DPP legislator Eugene Jao suggested that public hearings be held during the upcoming legislative session to solicit the views of the public concerning how to achieve passage of a political contributions law . Since the ruling and opposition parties have already been working to hammer out a mutually acceptable bill , Jao feels that there is still hope for the coming session .  
Premier Yu Shyi-kun declared that the ruling party would handle the protest in a gentle , transparent , and open manner , and expressed understanding and respect for any lawsuits that the pan-blue camp might bring with regard to the election . But he also emphasized that everything would have to proceed according to legal procedures .  
In his statement , the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ecuador failed to explain that the Protocol of Peace , Friendship and Limits signed on 29 January 1942 by Peru and Ecuador is the international treaty that set the definitive frontier between our two countries and that the arbitral ruling made by Captain Bras D \ x { 71f0 } s de Aguiar of Brazil on 15 July 1945 resolved the disagreements on the demarcation of the frontier , which had already been delineated .  
In many Latin American countries , the paradox of overabundant legislation and overemphasized democracy contrasting with the fragmentation of society , deep economic inequalities and the low level of political participation suggests that the ruling \ x { 5e68 } ite is attempting to overcome the weak integration of society by developing the legal framework of a democratic state of law addressing the whole people .  
In a judgement rendered on 21 April 1982 , the Supreme Court of Justice , ruling on appeal , declared void a provision on bank employees ' labour contracts which gave married male employees the unreserved right to a domestic subsidy , while allowing the subsidy to married female employees only under severely restricted conditions . 
The Inter _ American Court of Human Rights , for example , in a ground _ breaking ruling , found that amnesty for the perpetrators of serious human rights violations was incompatible with the right of every individual to a fair hearing before an impartial and independent court .  
Reflecting the requirements of the situation prevailing at the time , the respected leader Comrade Kim Il Sung , in his speech on 6 August 1971 , advanced the policy of new , wide-ranging negotiations whereby we were ready to come into contact at any time with all political parties including the ruling " Democratic Republican Party " , social organizations and individual personages of south Korea . 
As already reported , the recent incident is , in essence , a part of the current reckless provocation moves of the south Korean chief executive to look for a way out of a most serious ruling crisis in a shocking incident and to delay his doomed life .  
However , backed by international legal experts , including the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe , the President refused to accept the Court 's ruling and insisted on parliamentary elections , to be held in mid _ October 1997 .  15 .  Nationwide municipal elections were scheduled for 13 and 14 September 1997 , just subsequent to the drafting of the present report .  
The Inter _ American Court of Human Rights , for example , in a ground _ breaking ruling , found that amnesty for the perpetrators of serious human rights violations was incompatible with the right of every individual to a fair hearing before an impartial and independent court .  
In addition , the Special Rapporteurs attention was drawn to the fact that all major daily newspapers are very closely tied to companies connected to political parties in the ruling Government , which makes the Malaysian press dependent upon the Government .  
The courts in a number of civil law States had ruled that any such agreement must be subject to domestic administrative law , and one of the practical consequences of that ruling was that Governments were unwilling to agree to submit disputes to arbitration , since the law itself provided specific remedies , penalties and rights .  
Considering the care that has been shown by the ruling party to grant citizenship , and thus voting rights , to the " diaspora " ( ethnic Croats who live abroad ) , the Special Rapporteur places special emphasis on the rights of all those who qualify for Croatian citizenship , irrespective of ethnicity , and especially refugees , to claim citizenship in a timely manner , thus enabling them to participate in the forthcoming Croatian elections .  
He recalls that the election observer mission of the OSCE concluded that the presidential elections of 15 June 1997 may have been free but were not fair , and did not meet minimum democratic standards because the State-owned media - particularly television - showed favouritism towards the ruling party .  
Not at issue before the superior appellate court was 1 ) the holding by the lower court that a notice of lack of conformity made within 7 to 17 days was in time , given that the goods in question concerned meat that was frozen , not fresh ( article 39 CISG ) ; and 2 ) the ruling that , as the CISG does not expressly deal with the burden of proof , such lacuna must be filled by interpretation of the Convention .  Abstracts published in German : [ 1998 ] Schweizerische Juristen-Zeitung 146 ;  
This infamous decree lunatic , ludicrous and amply reflective of a pre-planned , diabolical scheme by the ruling Pakistani junta , the main force behind the Talibanization of the region is aimed at the annihilation of the historical and cultural identity of Afghanistan .  
Given this situation , which was strange to say the least , the Front Populaire Ivoirien ( FPI , socialist opposition ) candidate , Mr . Laurent Gbagbo , who , like many of his fellow citizens , interpreted this unexplained silence as a manoeuvre on the part of the chief of the ruling junta , appealed to him and , in an effort to spare the Ivorian people a fate similar to that of Yugoslavia , urged him not to thwart the democratic process .  
The ruling is a positive sign , in that it was objective and made a point of stating that the investigation of the facts must continue , but at the same time it demonstrated the impunity surrounding such acts , in that the authorities responsible for the investigation were unable to gather sufficient evidence to prosecute the real culprits .
