By the 1995 fiscal year , not only had the surplus been exhausted , the government debt had reached more than NT $ 1.2 trillion . If the debts of the provincial , municipal , and local governments are added in , the country is now running at over NT $ 2 trillion in the red . This means that , on average , each of Taiwan 's 21 million people is responsible for more than NT $ 100-000 of national debt !

Taipower was constantly running deficits , and at that point was criticized by the MOEA for wasteful investment . The margin reserve then began to decline as demand increased , until it reached only 4.7% during peak-demand hours last summer .  
Nevertheless , according to Chang Le-chi 's description , NGOs always want to keep their image of " being afraid of becoming politically sullied . " They stand somewhat aloof from authorities . They even purposefully maintain a safe distance from political figures with similar ideas , and they forbid currently unployed essential staff from running for public office , to prevent opportunists from turning social activism into a springboard for amassing personal political resources . "  
It 's just too bad that Du Fu did n't mention the dogs running around at the feet of the beautiful women . These canine companions might have been wearing red silk handkerchiefs or their entire bodies might even have been dyed the same color as their mistresses ' clothes .  
Thus although the center has been running for over a year , the number attending has always stayed around 20 to 30 . Birds of passageThe old people who are most in need of daycare are those with restricted mobility or in poor health . But the shortage of medical and nursing staff in Taiwan , the high cost of providing such care and the fact that it is not covered by the National Health Insurance scheme mean that hospitals around the country have little inclination to set up daycare centers or residential nursing homes .  
Off to the right , light green squares are inlaid amidst dark verdant patches of mango trees and sparkling streams running through gorges . This is where we plan to land . Off to the left , the little spot of white amidst the puffs of smoke and dense green is Saichia Village . When you lift your gaze to the horizon , your field of vision takes in Kaoshu , Chishan , and Pingtung .  
This is the time of year when the weather is affected by cold high-pressure areas from the continent . These create sharp differences in temperature , generating strong upward currents . Also , humidity is low , and there is less concern about rain caused by hot air currents running into cold air at high altitudes .  
Two years ago , the " seven wolves of NTNU " incident shed light on the long running , but heretofore unpublicized , problem of sexual harassment of female students by male professors . The incident has certainly served as a warning to many professors of questionable morals . But there has been some spillover affecting " innocent " instructors .  
For instance , there is the two-storey " shoebox , " faced with ceramic tiles on the outside and with a concrete rice yard ; or the villa-style " manor house " with sloping roofs , arcaded outside walkways upstairs , and round columns running down to the ground from the second floor , surrounded by a high wall .

But one aspect is confusing : last year , Taiwan 's foreign trade performance was outstanding , with both exports and imports breaking the US $ 100 bn barrier to set all-time records ; also , the trade surplus rose for the first time after falling for four years running , and exceeded US $ 8 bn .  
But there are plenty of negative examples which can serve as a warning : in the late 1970s under the Carter administration , the United States ' budget deficit increased massively and inflation went into double figures for several years running . Unemployment rose sharply and economic growth stagnated , creating the dreadful problem of " stagflation . "  
The characters evolved from the elongated curved lines of the early zhuan ( seal ) script , to the square , flat style of li ( clerical ) script , to the simplified but ordered cao ( " free-flowing " or cursive ) script , up to the writing systems of today , the kai ( standard ) script and the xing ( " running " or semicursive ) script , stylistically set midpoint between cao and kai .  
At 5:55 am , five minutes before the race begins , a white Honda Civic pulls up in front of the front gate . A group of people swiftly get out and rush toward the starting line . Right then , from either side , the pack of teenage girls that have already been waiting for a long time impulsively rushes forward , but half way there , workers shout at them , " Back up , back up ! They 're about to start running , you 'll be knocked over . "  
Second , Lu Hsiu-lien offered strong personal credentials : a strong academic record , a clean and fresh image , a background as a leader in the women 's movement , and her imprisonment as an early democratic activist back in the early 1980s . She also showed a far-reaching boldness for running the county for " four years and nine months " ( i.e . the nine-month replacement term plus an expected victory in the regular year-end contest ) .  
" She 's a very special person , " says Li Huan-hsin , general manager of E . Excel 's Taiwan branch .

Furthermore , " Evergreen 's container fleet is young , and its efficiency grows when modern dock equipment is available . "  
Back then , the region had " poor people and few financial resources , bandits running amok , and backward culture .

Kaohsiung 's major source of running water comes from the Kaoping River , but agricultural pollution ( both in the form of pesticides and livestock waste ) and illegal dumping of garbage have seriously eroded the quality of Kaoping River water , which has received low water-quality designations for several years running .  
" I keep mulling over this thought : Has this natural , simple , non-calculating character of the common man been lost under the capitalist system with its private ownership of property ? When these three people begin to specialize , they will become more adept at running the restaurant and become more calculating . Will the three of them be as happy then as they are now ? "  
The park was originally approved to release a maximum of 28,200 kiloliters of treated effluent per day .

He remarked , " The eyebrows are blue , and the lips are red . "  
A cutaway view of central Taiwan 's geological structure in east-west cross section reveals that the mountain ranges , plains , and foothills sit atop an extravagantly folded layer of rock cloven by numerous reverse faults . The resulting surface topography brings to mind the image of roof tiles , starting with the " eaves " in the west and running up the western face of the mountains to the peak .  
Perhaps even more surprising would have been the sight of numbers of women , some bearing offerings on the way to the Buddhist temple , some peddling medicine , some running little restaurants .

As the fall of the Southern Tang loomed , Li remained unaware of just how near the enemy had drawn until the Song troops had Jinling totally encircled .

She said that she never expected that her party membership would be revoked . The astonishing cross-partisan pairings of the Soong-Chang and Hsu-Chu tickets-both presidential candidates stepping outside party ranks to launch independent campaigns and choosing running mates completely different from themselves-on the one hand shows that they are above not only party politics , but also provincial background and the issue of unification vs . independence . On the other hand , it also shows that they hoped to maximize the complementarity of their tickets to attract votes from as wide a political spectrum as possible .  
Lien also stated that all political party assets would be put into a blind trust , and that political parties would never again engage in running businesses for a profit .

"  
In 1996 , President Lee Teng-hui was far ahead of his rivals all the way , and the election was lopsided .

It is impossible right now to say who might win , and will probably remain so right up to the finish .  
It must also be remembered that DPP party members are the chief executives in the large majority of Taiwan 's cities and counties . Now that the DPP also controls executive power at the central level , the political map will have a green line running from localities to the center .  
The ruling party itself adopted her causes-democracy , freedom , and the ROC 's return to the United Nations-as its own . She found herself in the mainstream , and became one of the most influential members of the opposition party . She served in the national legislature , was invited to serve as a national policy advisor to the president , and was elected to two consecutive terms as county commissioner in Taoyuan . Before her second term was half finished , Chen Shui-bian selected her as his vice-presidential running mate .  
At the time the country was already running into financial difficulties , and social welfare expenditures were growing rapidly .

" During this period his running script was no longer as lean as it had been , " says Ho Chuan-hsing . " It began slanting rightwards and spreading out a little . Overall , his characters became more free and unconstrained , with swooping spaces where the brush was running dry of ink . He had well and truly shaken off the earlier fixation with exquisite perfection . "  
According to Gu Weiqin , another relative involved with the running of Mingda , " The only advantage for Mingda was that Yangzhou University had been around for a long time and had a very good reputation .

A graduate from the Chinese Department of Fudan University in Shanghai , Gu Weiqin is a former department head at a vocational school in Nanchang , capital of Jiangxi Province .  
Thus , while the first shots fired for financial reform may look good , those on the inside can not help but worry that the government will quickly run out of ammunition . Yet there would still remain more than 300 other community financial institutions which have been running at a loss for a considerable time , not to mention the state-run and private banks of a much larger scale whose bad debts are shockingly high . The govern-ment 's ability to reform the financial system is going to face some pretty ruthless tests .

The more important question concerns how to achieve lateral and vertical integration between the content of different textbooks as quickly as possible . Curriculum development committees at schools everywhere have all zeroed in on this problem . Teachers may start running into problems when the science teacher in third and fourth grades uses textbooks from Nani Books , for example , while the science teacher in fifth and sixth grades uses something from Hanlin . Or students may find that some of the content in their science textbooks is repeated in social studies .  
The students frolic on the wooden floors in sneakers , running , jumping , sitting , lying down .

He started with relatively simple water and electricity meters .  
After millions of years of wind and sea erosion , many of the pillars on the basalt islands have been worn down and are now covered with mud .

Only by approaching cliffs near the edge of the sea or visiting uninhabited peripheral islands can one clearly see the basalt columns with their vertical fractures running from top to bottom .  
One of his happier finds was a map of Formosa created in 1940 by a famous cartographer . It was an extremely important find , for this was the very map that became the standard for subsequent cartography on Taiwan . Surprisingly , van der Aalsvoort found it tucked away , old and tattered , between the pages of a book . He said it was like running across a nugget of pure gold in a tossed salad .

These schools provide a support base for the museum , helping to recover personnel and other costs . The museum provides the ideological foundation for the classes , the education being based on the ideas espoused by the gallery and put into practice in the classes .

At my children 's school , too , there are many truly dedicated teachers who put a lot of effort into running more flexible classes and communicating with parents , making them a part of their children 's education .

The characters evolved from the elongated curved lines of the early zhuan ( seal ) script , to the square , flat style of li ( clerical ) script , to the simplified but ordered cao ( " free-flowing " or cursive ) script , up to the writing systems of today , the kai ( standard ) script and the xing ( " running " or semicursive ) script , stylistically set midpoint between cao and kai .  
At 5:55 am , five minutes before the race begins , a white Honda Civic pulls up in front of the front gate . A group of people swiftly get out and rush toward the starting line . Right then , from either side , the pack of teenage girls that have already been waiting for a long time impulsively rushes forward , but half way there , workers shout at them , " Back up , back up ! They 're about to start running , you 'll be knocked over . "  
Second , Lu Hsiu-lien offered strong personal credentials : a strong academic record , a clean and fresh image , a background as a leader in the women 's movement , and her imprisonment as an early democratic activist back in the early 1980s . She also showed a far-reaching boldness for running the county for " four years and nine months " ( i.e . the nine-month replacement term plus an expected victory in the regular year-end contest ) .  
" She 's a very special person , " says Li Huan-hsin , general manager of E . Excel 's Taiwan branch .

" The Colon Free Trade Zone , the world 's longest running and most successful free trade zone , handled US $ 10 billion in transshipment trade in 1995 , a figure equivalent to Taiwan 's total yearly trade with Southeast Asia .  
" The advantage of building docks yourself is that it allows for easier administrative control , and you can reduce costs , " an Evergreen representative says . The company has experience running docks in many different places , and thus they have trained staff who know the tricks of the trade and are better able to meet varying demands . Furthermore , " Evergreen 's container fleet is young , and its efficiency grows when modern dock equipment is available . "  
Back then , the region had " poor people and few financial resources , bandits running amok , and backward culture . " Chiang first dealt with the local bandits , organizing four large public security squads , and he personally went out to the countryside to oversee efforts to quell bandit activities . Then , he moved to lay public roads , so as to facilitate transportation throughout the area .  
Kaohsiung 's major source of running water comes from the Kaoping River , but agricultural pollution ( both in the form of pesticides and livestock waste ) and illegal dumping of garbage have seriously eroded the quality of Kaoping River water , which has received low water-quality designations for several years running .  
" I keep mulling over this thought : Has this natural , simple , non-calculating character of the common man been lost under the capitalist system with its private ownership of property ? When these three people begin to specialize , they will become more adept at running the restaurant and become more calculating . Will the three of them be as happy then as they are now ? "  
The park was originally approved to release a maximum of 28,200 kiloliters of treated effluent per day . But in October and November of last year , the electronics industry was booming and the volume of effluent increased rapidly . Treated waste water from the park hit a record high of over 72,000 kiloliters . And recently average daily discharge has been running at around 53,000 kiloliters .  
Amidst the excitement and fury of a new tide of literary activity , 26-year-old Wang Anyi published The Falling Rain , a romantic short story about Wenwen walking through the rain in hopes of running across a boy she had once happened to meet . According to Sung Ju-shan , " Under the communist regime , with its stress on historical materialism , no one had ever before published a story that focused on the emotions of an adolescent girl .  
And when Taichung police cracked down on illegal drinking establishments , one station focused entirely on the response of the bars ' " public relations girls , " running a six-minute report in which the camera spent most of its time aimed at the girls ' thighs and skimpy tops .  
These unfamiliar strangers from the distant past left everyone speechless . Day and night , the archeologists dug feverishly for more ancient relics . About a month after the discovery of pit # 1 , another brick worker came running with the news that he had dug up two more heads some 30 meters away . He remarked , " The eyebrows are blue , and the lips are red . "  
A cutaway view of central Taiwan 's geological structure in east-west cross section reveals that the mountain ranges , plains , and foothills sit atop an extravagantly folded layer of rock cloven by numerous reverse faults . The resulting surface topography brings to mind the image of roof tiles , starting with the " eaves " in the west and running up the western face of the mountains to the peak .  
Perhaps even more surprising would have been the sight of numbers of women , some bearing offerings on the way to the Buddhist temple , some peddling medicine , some running little restaurants . It does n't quite square with the familiar image of the ladies of that era as delicate little creatures , tottering about on their " three-inch golden lilies " ( bound feet ) and never stepping beyond the confines of the house .  
As the fall of the Southern Tang loomed , Li remained unaware of just how near the enemy had drawn until the Song troops had Jinling totally encircled . In the end he walked out the city gates together with his ministers of state to proffer his final surrender wearing only a simple white gown , a stark symbol of surrender akin in Chinese culture to the act of running up a white flag .  
She said that she never expected that her party membership would be revoked . The astonishing cross-partisan pairings of the Soong-Chang and Hsu-Chu tickets-both presidential candidates stepping outside party ranks to launch independent campaigns and choosing running mates completely different from themselves-on the one hand shows that they are above not only party politics , but also provincial background and the issue of unification vs . independence . On the other hand , it also shows that they hoped to maximize the complementarity of their tickets to attract votes from as wide a political spectrum as possible .  
Lien also stated that all political party assets would be put into a blind trust , and that political parties would never again engage in running businesses for a profit . Lien 's " third wave of reform " has six major objectives , including achievement of " clean and competent government , " " a justice system dedicated to true justice , " " a greater role for the national legislature and an overhaul of the National Assembly , " and " the preservation of basic human rights . "  
In 1996 , President Lee Teng-hui was far ahead of his rivals all the way , and the election was lopsided . This year , the most prominent feature of the campaign is exactly the opposite : The three main candidates are running neck-and-neck , and the election battle is fierce . It is impossible right now to say who might win , and will probably remain so right up to the finish .  
It must also be remembered that DPP party members are the chief executives in the large majority of Taiwan 's cities and counties . Now that the DPP also controls executive power at the central level , the political map will have a green line running from localities to the center .  
The ruling party itself adopted her causes-democracy , freedom , and the ROC 's return to the United Nations-as its own . She found herself in the mainstream , and became one of the most influential members of the opposition party . She served in the national legislature , was invited to serve as a national policy advisor to the president , and was elected to two consecutive terms as county commissioner in Taoyuan . Before her second term was half finished , Chen Shui-bian selected her as his vice-presidential running mate .  
At the time the country was already running into financial difficulties , and social welfare expenditures were growing rapidly . Based on her solid financial and tax background and her incredible ability with figures , she came to serve as the gate-keeper . In 1995 , she became the first female director of the DNT , and within less than half a year she was named as director of the FTC .  
" Taipei is struggling to catch up with Tokyo , Singapore and Hong Kong , and it has cities like Shanghai , Beijing , and Bangkok running fast on its heels , " says Chen . Chen points out that with the PRC lavishing resources on Shanghai , the city was able to complete its highway and put its electric cables underground in just two years . It was even able to lay down an entire fiber optic network .  
And a month earlier the Executive Yuan handed the legislature a draft amendment to the Election and Recall Law that is designed to block mob-affiliated individuals from running for public office . It is hoped that the combination of executive and legislative measures will finally drive " black gold " out of Taiwanese politics . Cracking down on crime and stamping out " black gold " politics remains a central plank of the new government 's platform .  
" During this period his running script was no longer as lean as it had been , " says Ho Chuan-hsing . " It began slanting rightwards and spreading out a little . Overall , his characters became more free and unconstrained , with swooping spaces where the brush was running dry of ink . He had well and truly shaken off the earlier fixation with exquisite perfection . "  
According to Gu Weiqin , another relative involved with the running of Mingda , " The only advantage for Mingda was that Yangzhou University had been around for a long time and had a very good reputation . A diploma from Yangzhou University carried considerable cachet , and was more attractive to students . A graduate from the Chinese Department of Fudan University in Shanghai , Gu Weiqin is a former department head at a vocational school in Nanchang , capital of Jiangxi Province .  
Thus , while the first shots fired for financial reform may look good , those on the inside can not help but worry that the government will quickly run out of ammunition . Yet there would still remain more than 300 other community financial institutions which have been running at a loss for a considerable time , not to mention the state-run and private banks of a much larger scale whose bad debts are shockingly high . The govern-ment 's ability to reform the financial system is going to face some pretty ruthless tests .  
The combined population of countries running socialist economies either now or in the past comes to over 3 billion , or 44% of the world 's total population . The major socialist economies include mainland China ( 1.2 billion ) , India ( 1 billion ) , and the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe ( 0.3 billion ) . Since the collapse of socialism , the massive labor pool of these nations has gradually been incorporated into the global capitalist economy .  
Many of the rocks from mudslides in Chungliao have also been left to lie . People there are used to disaster , and to mud .

When Kao was a youngster he dreamed of running like Pasuya , a figure in Tsou myth that could run as fast as a sparrow flies . Kao had learned the story from his father . " I worshipped my father , who had received traditional tribal training as a hunter ! "  
However , the creation of a happier learning environment in elementary school is now running up against the hard reality of regular examinations and competitive pressures to advance in junior high school , which still operates along more traditional lines .  
The more important question concerns how to achieve lateral and vertical integration between the content of different textbooks as quickly as possible . Curriculum development committees at schools everywhere have all zeroed in on this problem . Teachers may start running into problems when the science teacher in third and fourth grades uses textbooks from Nani Books , for example , while the science teacher in fifth and sixth grades uses something from Hanlin . Or students may find that some of the content in their science textbooks is repeated in social studies .  
The students frolic on the wooden floors in sneakers , running , jumping , sitting , lying down . Students are relaxed and there 's a certain kind of warm atmosphere that they might not even find in their own homes . The classrooms at Yung'an are not divided into a single room per class , as at regular schools .  
It 's not a listed company and its founders are n't well known members of Taiwan 's technological aristocracy . Nevertheless , it has won the Ministry of Economic Affair 's " Symbol of Excellence Award " for seven years running by pursuing its own strategy of integrating the up - , mid - , and downstream segments of the sensor industry and establishing a firm market base .  
At the end of the 1980s , when speculative fever was running rampant and the stock market was reaching all-time highs , Li intuitively understood that the Taiwanese economy was in for big change , so he sold his plumbing and electrical business to his brother . On the introduction of a friend , he , at the ripe old age of 53 , moved into an entirely new field , making instruments and gauges . He started with relatively simple water and electricity meters .  
After millions of years of wind and sea erosion , many of the pillars on the basalt islands have been worn down and are now covered with mud . More recently , human activity has made it difficult to distinguish what is so interesting about these basalt islands . Only by approaching cliffs near the edge of the sea or visiting uninhabited peripheral islands can one clearly see the basalt columns with their vertical fractures running from top to bottom .  
One of his happier finds was a map of Formosa created in 1940 by a famous cartographer . It was an extremely important find , for this was the very map that became the standard for subsequent cartography on Taiwan . Surprisingly , van der Aalsvoort found it tucked away , old and tattered , between the pages of a book . He said it was like running across a nugget of pure gold in a tossed salad .  
Not long after the founding of the cultural and historical workshop , Chuang Ming-yi 's own mother fell ill with cancer . During the two years of running back and forth between the mountain town and hospitals , Chuang developed a deep understanding of life and death .  
The final major focus is miniature fuel cells . We expect that by 2006 we can develop mobile phone batteries that will run for 50 days on standby , and notebook computer batteries that will run for 12 hours . When you go and sit in a cafe to write an urgent report and go online to find information via a wireless Internet connection , you wo n't have to worry about your computer running out of power .  
So what is the current situation in the broadcast media in Taiwan ? The extent of involvement of political actors is indeed serious . Recently the Government Information Office announced the results of an investigation into the running of electronic media by holders of public office . It shows that among 366 such media outlets , 67 elected or executive branch officials are board members , managers , stockholders , or founders .  
But over the past few years Taiwan railroads have suddenly experienced a retro revival and have become quite the fashion .

Train tickets from the auspiciously named " Eternal Peace and Vigor " route have sold in the tens of thousands . Convenience stores began selling boxed lunch prepared just the way they used to be served on trains .  
At 5 a.m . on June 13 , to the accompaniment of sonorous beiguan music , priests at the temple began to make a report to Heaven about the jiao , explaining the reasons for it and its scheduled itinerary . For three days running , from early in the morning to late at night , the sound of festive beiguan music with suona horns and gongs , as well as the loud and clear chanting of the Daoist priests , drifted from the main hall .  
The soft-spoken Lee studied sociology at university , and for more than 20 years has built his career around social work . In the 1990s , while running an Ilan halfway house , he also began training as a counselor to better help people deal with psychological disorders . Lee then returned to his hometown of Tungshan in 1997 and established a counseling center . In 1999 , Tungshan attempted to hold an election for the position of executive director , but no one wanted to run .  
Attentive visitors can also learn some of the many stories the guesthouses have to tell . For example , the exceptionally stylish Garden of Rushes has a beautiful garden , an elegantly decorated interior , and a marvelously graceful innkeeper who looks as if she had just stepped out of one of Chiung Yao 's romances . But the kicker is that the garden , which features a small bridge over running water , was designed and built by the innkeeper and her husband in their spare time .  
Apart from the structural damage to the campus , there was great social turmoil throughout Taiwan with virtually every industry hurting and inflation running rampant . As the population suffered , a dark cloud of discontent gathered .

Although pressure for economic reform is gaining momentum in the international community , the PRC authorities see control of information as the final line of defense , and thus keep a tight grasp on it . However , this is already being put to the test by Western and Japanese companies , through running their own advertising fronts and licensing out their titles , staking their claims before the complete lifting of restrictions , and using their massive capital bases to secure their positions .  
Wu had made separate molds for the orchids ' centers and five petals , so he invited an expert in " running water " welding to put them together . After six hours , the petals were only halfway assembled . The expert said that he really thought they should use traditional welding flux , but Wu Ching was determined and refused . After the expert left , Wu worked and studied for five hours before finally finishing one orchid .  
These schools provide a support base for the museum , helping to recover personnel and other costs . The museum provides the ideological foundation for the classes , the education being based on the ideas espoused by the gallery and put into practice in the classes . Lin has been running these two organizations for years now in her effort to try and free people 's artistry from the shackles it has been placed in , and to let children be able to sample the emotional qualities inherent in real art .  
Changhua City has a long history , but now it seems to have hit a wall , unable to get beyond its current population level or its geographical limitations , stuck running second to Taichung . But the past was different . Old Changhua once held the spotlight , especially its train station . A popular rest stop in the long north-south train journey , the station made a huge impression on all who visited it , and was the pride of Changhua .  
At my children 's school , too , there are many truly dedicated teachers who put a lot of effort into running more flexible classes and communicating with parents , making them a part of their children 's education . These teachers have a four-pronged goal for their students : emotional development , life skills , personal growth , and fundamental academic knowledge . Their achievements show that if they work together , the trio of school , teacher , and parents can be a formidable one , and one which opens the door to truly excellent education .
