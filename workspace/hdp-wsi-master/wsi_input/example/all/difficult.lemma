Chen Jianwen , the researcher responsible for this research explained that X-ray computerized tomography ( CT ) is usually used in clinical medicine to determine the pathology of a biological tissue .  Nonetheless , compared with a normal tissue , the difference of absorbing the X-ray by an initial cancerous tissue is extremely small , making it impossible to reflect the absorption on an image .  Thus , it is very difficult to diagnose an initial stage cancer .  
Guangzhou Military Region is using test beds as the vanguard to lead its advance .  It is using its focus on difficult points and attacking key problems to promote all-around progress .  It is gradually making S &amp; T training for troops standardized and scientific , and it has seen clear improvements in the quality of unit military training and in the level of combat power of its units .  
It is also worth mentioning that the private companies under Chen ostensibly included some joint ventures with Hong Kong businesses , some joint ventures with banks , and also some joint ventures with the Yuhu Prefectural Government . As such , public ownership were intermixed with private ownership to give people many false impressions and make it difficult for people to discern their nature off-hand .  This was to make it easy for them to profit from confusion and to slip away unpunished in the event of an exposure of their offenses .  
If the departments concerned can work in close cooperation , coordinate their actions and produce some tangible results in these activities , it will be conducive to promoting the solution of major and difficult issues that the masses feel very strongly about , thus making the effects of ideological and political work felt deep in the heart of the masses , improving the quality of the population as civilized people , and making the urban and rural areas more civilized .  
Yunnan deputy Wang Shikun [ 3769-0013-0981 ] said : The Standing Committee put supervision in an important position last year .  The law-enforcement inspection which centered round the state 's central tasks , the actual implementation of the law as well as key and difficult problems of great concern to the masses played a positive role in promoting the practice of doing things and exercising administration according to law in the local governments .  
Many deputies and committee members said that in the course of reform , opening up , and establishing a socialist market economy system , pluralistic trends have emerged in economic components and interests , ways of social life , and social organizational forms ; high technology has developed rapidly , new changes have occurred in people 's ideological concepts and value orientation , there are more social hot spots and difficult points , all kinds of ideas and cultures stir each other , and certain new situations and problems have arisen in social life .  
and the foundation of unity and stability has been further strengthened .  At the same time , with the continual deepening of reform and opening , there have emerged diverse economic elements and economic interests as well as diverse lifestyles and organizational forms in society , resulting in new changes in the economic structure and social relationships .  As a result , we are faced with many complicated issues entailing both benefits and harms and have encountered many tough and difficult contradictions .  
Similarly , if today 's new and promising actors and actresses with potential can not find opportunities to exercise or display themselves , it would be difficult for them to spring up , become outstanding successors of the military 's rank of actors and actresses and truly become pillars of the military 's work in the literary and artistic field .  
In the face of new changes taking place in the domestic and international situation and new development in ideological education for young people , we feel deeply that Comrade Jiang Zemin 's speech has a clear objective , that it targets at the current problems , and that it is of great practical meaning , and it has made us realize even more the urgency and difficult nature of young people 's ideological education .  
Before Clinton left for his South Asia visit , US Secretary of State Albright stated outright that India has an enormous middle class - a group of consumers with immense power who are difficult to ignore .  Developing trade and economic cooperation with India will bring the United States enormous economic benefits .  
The party committee of this brigade learned from its investigations that alongside the deepening and development of reform and opening up , some cadres and soldiers were lacking in a necessary mental preparation for the impacts that had been exerted on their personal interests by certain reform polices of the state and the army ; and when faced with practical problems , such as the layoff of their family members and an increasingly difficult situation in the resettlement of demobilized armymen , these cadres and soldiers would usually feel puzzled and would develop doubts and misgivings .  
As Taiwan Island is a narrow and small area , its military targets are relatively concentrated .  Moreover , Taiwan is close to the mainland , these relatively concentrated targets , in time of war , are susceptible to attacks from all directions and in various forms , and will be destroyed very quickly .  It is difficult to conserve the strength for the second attack and decisive battle .  
The success of the exercise fully reflected the great achievements of the air force logistics system in seriously implementing Chairman Jiang Zemin 's strategic thinking on strengthening the army through science and technology , persisting in taking as their goal winning a high-tech local war , and actively launching mass science and technology training , closely centering on the focal and difficult points in logistics in actual combat .  
If we only reckon up dead accounts , it will be very difficult to do a good job in fiscal work , and we may stifle it to death , which will have a direct impact on the economic and political results of financial expenditure , on economic and social development , and on the expansion of sources of finance and the strengthening of the state 's finances .  
If the US Government could be introspective regarding their failure , it would not be difficult to discover that the politicizing of human rights is wishful thinking , and has already caused a lot of countries in the world , especially developing countries , to be strongly disapproving .  And it is also an obstacle to all kinds of economic development by the United Nations . This affects dialogue and cooperation about human rights between all member countries .  
As of date , the unit has established medical , transportation , ordnance , maintenance , telecommunications , and other groups to engage in supporting campaigns and studying methods of operations .  It has exerted great efforts to tackle the most difficult scientific and technical problems and decided on more than 10 topics of study .  The 30-plus theses it published have attracted the attention of academic departments and higher-level administrative departments .  
We must , through vigorous ideological-political work , enable Marxism to firmly control the ideological and cultural fields and make it difficult for all kinds of reactionary , decadent , and backward political viewpoint , ideology , and life style to gain a foothold and spread .  
The " three-three 's system " of raising money for basic subsistence payments to workers laid off from the SOEs has been difficult to implement fully .  There are some laid-off workers who have not received a sufficient basic subsistence allowance , while there are other laid-off workers who have no basic subsistence support because the enterprises have ceased production , and there are occasional incidents in which groups in society appeal to higher authorities or impede public order .  
Zhu Rongji stated that , only if the entire country makes a concerted effort from top to bottom to establish a better social security system will this difficult but grand undertaking definitely be able to succeed , making it possible for us to promote great advances in the reform of China 's socialist market economy system and lay an even firmer foundation for achieving the great goal of national modernization .  
However , the FRY also took advantage of the battlefield environment , including the complex topography of the country , the dense vegetation , and the extremely variable weather conditions to make it difficult for NATO 's reconnaissance and bombing to be effective , and they actually destroyed or damaged numerous U.S . planes , including an F-117 stealth fighter .  
Over a long period of time , our military academies have integrated basic education with professional training .  As a result , our military academies have been vacillating between building a solid foundation for their students and meeting the need of students ' first job after their graduation .  This practice has made it difficult to enhance students ' quality and achieve economic performance of scale .  
Piracy has seriously disturbed the economic and cultural operational orders in the country and worsened the environment for national cultural industries ' survival , thus causing a massive drain on state revenues and causing cultural business units ' failure to gain an advantageous position in competition amid world economic integration by making it difficult for them to achieve effective accumulation and rapidly expand their industrial scale .  
Against such a backdrop , we should give full play to the armed forces ' fine traditions and encourage team efforts to solve problems together .  To achieve research breakthroughs , we should form many cooperative collectives with top-notched scientists as the cores .  This means that we should choose a large number of authoritative , reputable , innovative scientists with supervisory ability to head these collectives and organize and coordinate all quarters to tackle difficult technological issues and carry out large , strategic , frontline , and exploratory projects .  
It must be noted that with the end of the economy of shortage , low-standard surpluses are reflected in most fields of merchandise , that our economic structure does not meet the needs of the new macroeconomic situation , and that if the economic structure is not promptly readjusted and optimized , it will be difficult to maintain sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development .  
Ours is a huge country with very low starting point .  And with difficult tasks ahead , it would be very difficult for us to face with complex contradictions , to organize and guide hundreds and millions of people to plunge into fierce competition in the new century , to realize our grand goals , and to find a foothold for the Chinese nation if we do not have a large number of the " solid rock " leading cadres who are trusted and supported by the masses .  
Leading cadres should take the lead in studying the " Three Represents " , should publicize and disseminate the " Three Represents " through their personal fruitful experiences , and should go deep down to the grassroots units , instructing them face to face , explaining the difficult points and unclear points , inspiring and guiding them , and assisting the Party members and broad numbers of officers and soldiers in grassroots units in their effectively studying and satisfactorily carrying out the important thinking of the " Three Represents " .  
Although it is still difficult to set a standard for quantification of economic globalization , viewed from the angle of nature , at least the following three characteristics are important .  The global distribution of key economic elements has become very convenient and rapid ;  
China is a country with dense population and little cultivated land .  For a considerably long period of time , it will be difficult to change the basic trend in which population is increasing , and cultivated land is decreasing .  We must regard the protection of cultivated land as one of the major affairs affecting the national economy and the people 's livelihood as well as the country 's sustainable development , and must never slacken efforts in grasping it at any time .  
As all types of economic targets are large in number and wide in scope ; are interrelated with one another ; and are under the control of different departments , some of which are also large in size ; are exposed to a large extent ; and are highly vulnerable owing to their state of production , operation , or utilization in peace time , it is difficult and costly to protect them .  Also it is unrealistic to protect them in an all-round way and hard to raise their protection efficiency .  
and should conduct emergency repair-oriented professional or technical training and comprehensive simulated training so as to strengthen our capability of handling an emergency situation or conducting an emergency repair under the complex , difficult , or dangerous conditions during a war and ensure that certain economic targets , which are damaged to a certain extent , will be quickly repaired and restored to normal operation in a timely fashion , thus reducing damages and avoiding further damages .  
The Guangzhou Military Region , which is located on the forefront of reform and opening up , has always been carrying out ideological and political work with emphasis on studying and solving new situation and problems under the conditions of reform , opening up and the development of a socialist market economy , on studying and solving main , difficult , hot and doubtful problems faced by various units at present , and on summing up and promoting effective experiences in army building in the new period with good results .  
In future local wars , the boundaries between strategy , operation , and tactics are vague , making the identification of operation and strategic networks even more difficult .  Strategic information , operation information , and tactical information will flow orderly in an integrated network environment , and display the characteristics of close inter-linked and integration .  
Specifically , it is necessary to achieve actual effects in correcting the guiding ideology for work and overcoming the formalism , in enhancing the unit 's level of training the military with science and technology , in strengthening the ideological and political building of the unit , and in resolving the hot and difficult issues which have confounded the grass-roots level over a long period of time .  
The lake was more than 1,000 meters wide between its southern and northern banks .  Though it was by no means difficult for someone carrying nothing to cross the lake , it was indeed far from easy for the " special combat " soldiers , who were each carrying equipment as heavy as or more than 20 kilograms , to do the same .  
During recent years , they " sharpened " themselves with the tasks of dealing with the priorities and difficulties in information operations and electronic countermeasures , established more than 20 tasks to tackle difficult problems in science-technology military training , including acquiring new knowledge , mastering new equipment , studying new military tactics and training high-quality personnel .  Through taking specific measures such as fixing the training content , measures , levels , and steps , they institutionalized and standardized science-technology military training .  
" It is difficult to draw a human being but it is easy to draw a ghost " .  This is how the Chinese describe tricks aimed at deceiving people with fabricated stories , meaning that it is difficult to deceive people with what is real or can be seen but easy to lead people astray with what is absurd or preposterous .  
Currently we regulate and control the money supply mainly by controlling the total credit of state-owned commercial banks and we have not yet adopted indirect regulation and control means in real terms in this regard .  After China enters the WTO , changes in money supply and swings in interests in international markets will have a direct impact on China 's domestic financial market and money supply and they will make it more difficult to regulate and control money supply .  Consequently , China 's existing macroscopic financial regulation and control will face challenges .  
Moreover , the group army has also smoothed out and studied or tackled through its training exercises on the sea some difficult issues laid bare during several joint combat exercises held over the past few years , which have involved the units of various arms , including the group army itself .  
It was disclosed that the entire system is likely to cost as much as $ 60-billion upon completion .  However , no one is yet sure if the system will serve as " a seamless heavenly robe " free of problems upon completion .  Moreover , as modern science and technology are still developing at lightning speed , it is difficult to tell if the NMD system will end up as a heap of waste material in future .  
It has made one innovation after another and has developed " tools for cooking and distributing hot foods " , " water filters for camp and field training " , " mobile barracks on vehicles " , and " oil heaters for cold areas on plateaus " .  It has laid a solid foundation for solving difficult problems that restrain long distance mobile support for the armed forces .  
The efforts to seek truth and practical results have made each and every flower of reform in the scientific and technological military training bear the fruit of enhancing the troops ' ability of " winning in war " .  Some difficult questions concerning fighting under high-tech conditions have been effectively solved .  
All the achievements in military theory research presented this time deal with major practical questions concerning preparation for military struggle and furthering of scientific and technological military training , with focus on key and difficult questions concerning combined-arms joint operations , air assault and air defense .  They are the result of thorough exploration of the characteristics and law of fighting and scientific and technological military training under the high-tech conditions .  They serve specific purposes , and they are highly directive and feasible , reflecting the latest achievements made by the PLA in military theory research .  
In this way , they have effectively solved the difficult problem of insufficient sustained supporting strength for the airborne troops , and the airborne troops now have reliable " mobile warehouses " .  This indicates the airborne troops have taken a historical leap forward from being able to air-drop troops alone to being able to conduct combined operations .  
It is necessary to adhere to the policy of having priorities , focusing on developing high-tech equipment that is truly effective on future battlefields , while continually improving the overall technology level of existing armaments and accelerating renovation and updating efforts , so as to prevent the emergence of a " generational gap " between our side and any enemy , a gap that is difficult to remedy .  
In light of characteristics of a hi-tech war in future , the unit had decided to hold in an unfamiliar water area a training exercise centered on several highly difficult training topics , such as rapid camouflage on the sea , protecting itself against an enemy 's electronic jamming , countering an enemy 's hi-tech reconnaissance , and so on .  
People have come to see that as a regional vehicle for promoting an open trade and an economic and technological cooperation , APEC has been moving at an extremely slow pace in exercising its latter function , and is now unable to meet the economic development needs of its member states in this aspect ; as for its former function , due to an unduly fast speed in the past , APEC has now found it difficult to take another step forward .  
With regard to strengthening mutual trust and cooperation in the military sphere , although Sergeyev 's visit has avoided another storm arising in bilateral military cooperation ties on account of the espionage affair , the hard ice that has long formed between the two countries can hardly undergo a complete thaw in one or two visits , and " a still more difficult path lies ahead . "  
In the past decade , with the implementation of President Jiang Zemin 's instruction on " working hard to build revolutionized , modernized and regularized anti-chemical warfare units , " our country 's anti-chemical warfare units have basically formed a new fighting system marked by the new generation of " ordinance for anti-chemical warfare " and has achieved significant progress in solving major and difficult problems .  Our country has in the main formed a new type of anti-chemical warfare training system with a new generation of training program .  
Party committees and governments in all localities included the warmth-giving activities in their overall work arrangements .  In the whole country , 358,000 leading cadres at all levels set up fixed connection with 45,000 enterprises encountering business difficulties and 629,000 worker families living in difficult condition for helping and supporting them .  This further advanced the process of constantly carrying out the warmth-giving activities and institutionalizing such activities on the basis of taking them as regular social activities .  
In light of the operational characteristics of missile vessels and the technical and tactical levels of their attacks , it intensified training in such difficult areas as twin planes ' minimum altitude attacks and interception .  
In early winter , a certain naval submarine detachment conducted a highly difficult , all-directional live ammunition combat drill in the surging waters of the East China Sea . During the exercise , one submarine after another used deep submerging and other new tactics to successively break the multiple defense lines formed by the " enemy 's " destroyers and convoy ships .  After infiltrating into the " enemy 's " position , the submarines waited for opportunities to attack the enemy targets .  
The new century has only just begun , and with the surging tide of economic globalization , the new arms race about which people are continually concerned is exhibiting a growing momentum which is difficult to check .  It is not easy to be optimistic about the prospects for arms control .  This has cast a dark shadow over the world 's military security .  
The emergence of key and difficult problems makes some new demands on the organizational structure , the internal division of effort , the means and methods , and the scope of application of ideological and political work , and in the mutual relationships among these things .  How to draw new boundaries and achieve new standardization of these things , and make them form up an integrated whole which is full of vitality , is an important aspect of strengthening and improving ideological and political work in the new situation .  
The resolution of key and difficult problems certainly does not lie in shouting slogans more loudly .  It lies in starting out with a recognition of reality , revolving around real problems of widespread concern to the broad masses of officers and soldiers , thinking of practical moves , taking real action , and working steadily and surely to solve the problems .  
Japan recently published its " Medium-term Reorganization and Equipment Plan for the Defense Force for 2001-2005 . "  It is not difficult to see from this that , to fit in with its strategic goal of becoming a major political power , Japan is now making efforts to develop in the direction of becoming a strong military power , and will build the Japanese Self-defense Force into a new defense force with stronger capability , faster reaction , and more capable of dealing with " peripheral events . "  
The military , as an armed group responsible for carrying out special political tasks , should not only be ready to physically fight in battlefields to complete urgent , difficult , dangerous and heavy tasks given by the Party and the people , but also live through various tests and make mental and physical contributions to the reform and construction .  
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have now entered a critical stage , and the unfinished final position negotiations involve the most complex and sensitive issues ; it is difficult to take one step forward , which requires tremendous efforts on both sides .  
" Small , remote , scattered and directly administered " military units work in such posts as telecom , piloting , scientific and technological studies and logistics supply , and carry out such tasks as fighting , training , military duties and logistics supply .  Most of these units call for high technological levels , shouldering important responsibilities , work in crucial posts , and play a vital role in grassroots construction .  These units are also a difficult issue to handle in grassroots construction .  
Equipped with such a portable tent , a patrol or inspection team is capable of taking a rest or staying in an area at any time , should it fail to reach a destination in time or encounter bad weather , and this has also enhanced the regiment 's control over some key areas or sandy areas , to which access is difficult .  
In the process of accelerating and advancing military modernization , if our military 's party members uphold obsolete ideas and concepts , lack high scientific and technological attainment , and lack the ability to skillfully use modern weapons and armaments and to give appropriate commands in modern wars , it will be difficult for these party members to embody the advanced nature of the party members and make great achievements in the military 's reform and construction .  
It is very difficult see the embodiment of the advanced nature in party members like these .  Promoting this educational campaign for maintaining the advanced nature of party members is of great significance for implementing the requirement of focusing the minds of party members on the correct theory , spurring the real work of the military , solving existing problems in the contingent of party members , advancing the military 's party-building in the new period and pushing forward the military modernization construction .  
Some analyses say that the PRC fighter intentionally struck the American craft , thinking to force the US plane to land on Chinese soil .  Some people also say that the American plane made a sudden turn toward the Jian-8 as though it were a bicycle moving forward of its own volition .  It is difficult to grasp the distances at which fighter planes pass at high speeds , where a tiny slip can mean a crash and death to the crew .  
Corruption is a hotbed for breeding criminal syndicates and the evil forces .  Behind all the criminal syndicates cracked by the public security organs , there are always well-connected networks and " protective umbrellas " that are complicated and difficult to deal with .  
Base leaders and official personnel will be deeply involved in on-site training , directing the troops in drawing up concrete training plans , scientifically arranging the contents of training , conducting strict inspections and supervising the organization and implementation of training .  They will participate in researching and attacking difficult key problems , comprehensively coordinating the relations among all the troops participating in the training , providing relevant assurances to the troops , and making a preliminary exploration of the use of large-scale training bases to organize joint training for different branches of the armed forces .  
Compared to ordinary fighters , the unmanned Stealth fighter is more suited to carrying out highly difficult missions , such as long-range surprise attacks on enemy targets with dense air defenses , sneak attacks on enemy biological and chemical weapon bases , and interception of cruise missiles , and so on .  
The western region 's garrisons have formulated some concrete implementation measures , but society 's low overall scientific and technological standards have made it very difficult in practice for the troops to develop an awareness for science and technology , to coordinate science and technology to tackle the tough problems , and to introduce and propagate the successful results .  
They even slept near the door to fence off cold winds for their comrades .  In peaceful times , Party members took the lead in answering the call of the Party , executing Party lines and completing urgent , difficult , dangerous and heavy tasks .  
Reportedly , although many proposals on adjusting China 's foreign policy have been sent to Zhongnanhai , as a leadership change at the upcoming 16th party congress is not far away , Jiang Zemin hopes to accomplish the transfer of power in a stable political environment , so the difficult policy issues will be left up to his successor .  Therefore , China will continue to maintain its existing foreign policy for the time being , and will continue to behave in a manner of " hiding its strength and biding its time " in international affairs .  
National model workers Li Huangxi , Bao Qian , Wang Yiqiang , Sun Haijun , Zhang Ruimin successively spoke on such subjects as striving to be new-type industrial workers in the new era , carrying forward the spirit of doing pioneering work against difficult conditions , rebuilding beautiful natural environment , and enhancing the enterprise 's international competitive power .  
He stated that the science and technology hall is an important place for people to acquire scientific and technical knowledge , understand science and technology , and exchange S &amp; T knowledge and results , as well as being a base for primary and middle-school students to engage in quality education , so we should make full use of existing facilities , enhancing the content of the exhibits and also doing a good job of making the briefings and lectures lively and explaining difficult concepts in simple terms .  
To find a way out of the difficult position , create a peaceful and stable external environment , reinvigorate the economy , and make the country prosperous and powerful , the DPRK is endeavoring to implement an omnidirectional foreign policy , with the stress on developing the relations with EU member states and has sent delegations one after another to EU member states , and thus laid a foundation for improvement of bilateral political and economic relations .  
In recent years , a submarine chaser group of the East Sea Fleet has successfully accomplished dozens of urgent , difficult , dangerous , and arduous tasks , such as emergency and disaster rescue , locating shipwrecks , and going on patrol at sea .  It has won the title of advanced unit in military training from the higher authorities for many years in a row and is known as " hunters " of the East China Sea .  
In the boundless vast sea of clouds and the vast sky filled with gun smoke , Fu Shaoyin and the young fellows of the " blue army " detachment placed the " red army " in a difficult position time and again with their nimble and skillful technical tactics as well as rapid , cunning , and stubborn striking power .  
In order to gain the initiative in maneuver operations at night , this regiment actively organized pilots to conduct night maneuvers at unfamiliar airports , aviation routes , airspace and environment ; laid ambushes ; and made long-distance raids and carried out other difficult training subjects in an effort to vigorously improve the quality of flights as well as the organizational planning and command coordination ability of commanders , and tempered their mentality , technology , and other comprehensive qualities .  
There are two reasons why the United States has decided to give up its strategy of " winning two local wars breaking out simultaneously . "  First , the United States has been feeling that its military strength and transport capability are inadequate and its financial resources are insufficient , making it difficult to continue to hit others using two fists at the same time .  
Only evaluating " horses " will be tantamount to give the power of initiative on personnel training to history , making the difficult process of personnel training a process of living or dying without external interference .  When there is an urgent need , there will be shortages of needed personnel , and it then becomes necessary to pick the taller ones among short people .  
Try and imagine , the moment a rocket lifts off from earth and shoots into the sky , the tremendous sense of accomplishment and happiness that surges in the hearts of every person involved in space flight when seeing the ever shrinking difference between the level of China 's space flight technology and the most advanced international levels and when seeing the ever increasing international position of China as a result of this is something that is difficult for the ordinary person to understand .  
At a regular press conference held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today , Zhu Bangzao , spokesman of the ministry , said while asserting the necessity of paying attention to international coordination and developing friendly relations with all countries in Asia , Japan 's leader has insisted on visiting the Yasukuni Shrine , which houses memorial tablets of Japanese Class-A war criminals .  We find it difficult to understand this .  
This requires that this party be composed of advanced people who have a common ideal , strict discipline and close relations with the people and the masses and that this party be able to struggle in an unswerving manner despite the extremely difficult and dangerous environment .  
As noted in " The Decision on the Party 's Few Historical Issues Since the Founding of New China " , " Generally speaking , having relatively successfully conducted such a complex , difficult and profound social revolution in such a large country with hundreds of millions of people and having accelerated the development of the national economy including agriculture and industry is really a great historical victory " .  
Governments at all levels and various government departments should make the basic interests of the masses of people the starting point of all work and take effective measures to solve difficult problems of universal concern to the masses of people .  At present , we should do the following three tasks well : first , it is necessary to effectively strengthen public security work and to go all out to safeguard social and political stability .  
Then , aside from assigning the personnel with doctorate or master 's degrees to units with modern equipment and positions that require scientific and technical expertise , the region also gave them important military assignments to accomplish , or assigned them to oversee projects of tackling difficult operational and training problems .  
He said : Russia and the United States are shouldering the special responsibility of safeguarding world peace and stability and building a new international security framework .  All this needs efforts to conduct close bilateral cooperation and international cooperation .  Any unilateral action may make solutions for modern social problems difficult .  
As the situation of regional development has been changing and non-stop various international forces have been involved in the region , the unique ethnic , cultural conditions and the difficult regional security issues of the Eurasian area have been plaguing each country of the region .  
In the period of the democratic revolution , his main contribution was to combine the universal truth of Marxism with China 's specific conditions and set forth the theory of new democracy , which resolved the question of how to take the path of the Russians , and thus resolved a major difficult issue in the course of Sinicizing Marxism .  
second , it is even more difficult to do this because we are confronted with the new situation characterized by the new scientific and technological revolution in the 21st century and the fierce competition worldwide , with a serious challenge from our double mission to achieve China 's modernization , and with the magnificent task of building a socialist material civilization and a socialist spiritual civilization .  
They are unwilling to delve into reality , to get down and mix with the masses , and to conduct difficult and detailed investigative research .  Even if they do try this , it is just a gourd dropping into a well : it seems to sink , but then it just floats on the surface .  These organizations report good news , but not anything that might be worrying , or they report a lot of good news and little that is bad .  
To triumph in future sea battles under a high-tech environment , in recent years officers and men of the logistical department of the East China Sea Fleet base have centered on the most complex and difficult situations , combined theoretical study and training on the sea , and boldly reformed and innovated logistical measures to stage splendid performances in logistical support on the sea .  
They have also dispatched the fleet to the sea to conduct test training in different sea areas and under different weather conditions .  They have successively completed more than 30 difficult training courses , including replenishment in rocky areas at night , round-the-clock comprehensive supplies from all directions , replenishment in strong waves and winds , and joint logistical replenishment tasks by military and civilian vessels .  
In recent years , the base 's relevant departments have repeatedly organized rapid mobilization of maritime medical teams from its hospital and urgently dispatched them for training in sea rescue , with some of them participating in the highly difficult joint ship-airplane rescue drills .  
Thus far , pilots of this flight squadron have independently fulfilled the highly difficult tasks of two planes flying parallel at night , landing under the guidance of airport lights , and flying at night in extremely complicated weather .  As a result , the night flexible operation capacity of this squadron has been enhanced greatly .  
However , if Western developed countries continue to turn a blind eye to the global wide gap between the rich and the poor , large quantity of unemployment , and ecological damage , and if they continue to turn a deaf ear to the voice of developing countries and ordinary people , President Bush perhaps will see more miserable tragedies in greater numbers , and it will also be difficult for the United States not to get involved .  
Lianyungang and other localities have brought into full play the role of high-tech facilities of military bases in the field of coastal defense surveillance and have built and improved a multilevel surveillance and intelligence network for the sea and coastal regions ( including islands ) .  This has enhanced the coastal defense monitoring capability in ocean and territorial airspace , not merely restricted to coastal beaches , thus solving the difficult problem in coastal defense management .  
Since the introduction of the reform and opening-up program , our army has firmly implemented the Party 's basic line , and supported reform with actual deeds .  It has correctly dealt with difficult problems such as helping officers and men transfer to civilian jobs , become decommissioned , and settle down , and assisting their family members find jobs .  It has successfully fulfilled the task of reshuffling and streamlining the army , actively participated in and supported the local economic construction projects , and resolutely strengthened unity and stability in the country .  
In the 80 years since its founding , the CPC has grown from a small and weak force to a big and strong one .  It has defeated formidable enemies in extremely difficult conditions and kept forging ahead in a tortuous course of exploration , accumulating very rich experiences .  
Officials of the senior presidential office and the Executive Yuan admitted frankly that direct shipping between the two sides of the strait constitutes the most difficult part in the current plan to comprehensively open up cross-strait economic and trade exchanges , but the initial plan will still designate six domestic ports as the cargo handling ports for cross-strait shipping .  
Following the continuous implementation of the proactive fiscal policy in depth , China had witnessed a major turnaround in economic development in 2000 .  The annual GDP grew 8 percent in 2000 .  The state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises had notably improved their economic performances .  China had basically achieved its goal to lift difficult enterprises out of their economic trouble .  Its exports increased by 28 percent and fiscal revenues reached 1.338-trillion yuan , a growth of 193.6-billion yuan over that in 1999 .  Its financial operation remained stable .  
The Military Region Air Force not only further increased the frequency of no-notice attacks , it also made them more difficult and intense .  When it selected air routes , it broke free of the previous method of using high altitudes and the same routes .  It made a point to select low altitudes , extra low altitudes , and new air routes , to minimize radar warning time as much as possible .  
Governments at all levels should show deep care for the people , always care about the well-being of the working masses living in difficult conditions , fully rely on the masses , rely on the community management organizations , do careful and meticulous work , find out the concrete conditions of the people living in difficult conditions , effectively arrange the necessary funds needed by the issuance of minimum livelihood allowances through adjusting the structure of financial revenue and expenditure .  
It should be pointed out that Junichiro Koizumi has never distinguished between " those who made sacrifices " and other " dead people . "  He emphatically said in his statement : " Facing those war dead who charged forward without any hesitation regarding the future of the motherland in the difficult times , I once again realize that Japan 's peace and prosperity today is built on the basis of their valuable sacrifices . .  
actively organize and encourage both army troops and militia reserves to plunge themselves in the current large-scale development of the country 's western region ; take up urgent , difficult , dangerous , and heavy tasks on our own initiative ; and strive for dual effects of promoting economic development and consolidating the defense building in line with the principle of manufacturing products for both peacetime and wartime use and for both military and civilian use .  
In accordance with the requirements of actual combat , the division has vigorously developed and strengthened its training .  It conducted successfully for the first time a tactical bombing training program in the small hours of the morning .  It has increased the proportion and intensity of training in highly difficult programs such as landing in adverse weather and through the use of marking lights .  
However , because of the poor quality of the pilots of the communist troops , it was impossible for them to understand more difficult tactics .  Therefore , the communist troops developed a set of pithy formula , which the pilots recited whenever they were followed by a rattlesnake missile .  After reciting the formula , they turned a sharp angle to try to shake off the missile .  
Today , Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wu Dawei said here that in the past few months of this year , with the occurrence of such events as the historical issue , Lee Teng-hui 's visit to Japan , and the Japanese prime minister 's action of paying homage at Yasukuni Shrine , Sino-Japanese relations have been bogged down in the most difficult condition over the past 30 years since the normalization of diplomatic relations .  The Japanese side should create favorable conditions for getting Sino-Japanese relations out of this predicament by resolving the current existing problems .  
Since reform and opening up , urban and rural residents have increased their incomes by a relatively big margin , the masses have obtained actual benefits but , on the whole , the people 's living standards are still low , the laid-off staff and workers in cities and towns are leading a relatively difficult life , and more than 30 million people have not resolved the food and clothing problem yet .  Therefore , long-term and painstaking efforts are still needed to enhance the people 's living standards .  
The historical contribution of the Taiwan Strait area and the Western Pacific coastal area in the 21st century , and whether it will create wealth or engender more conflict , will be decided based on whether the leaders of Taiwan , poised at a crossroads , can accurately judge the trends of the times , distinguishing true historical opportunities from false , in order to successfully negotiate the difficult situation in which they find themselves .

Second , our country 's economic restructuring has entered a crucial stage , and industries are in a historical stage of large-scale readjustment .  If we do not set up and improve the social security system , it will be impossible to realize the fundamental reform of state-owned enterprises , there will be no way to readjust the industrial structure , and it will be difficult to maintain social stability .  
The Tibet issue has all along been a " human rights " hot spot ; even then the CSHRS has not evaded this difficult issue but instead has expounded , with a host of facts , on the great changes that have taken place since Tibet implemented the democratic reform and wiped out the feudal serfdom to refute the Dalai clique and international hostile forces ' distortions of and attacks on Tibet 's human rights situation .  
The part of cross-strait relations in the new Taiwan leader 's inaugural speech superficially looked mild and prudent in words and phrases and involved no hackneyed and stereotyped expressions openly advocating " Taiwan independence . "  However , if we read this speech more carefully , it will not be difficult for us to find that this new leader did not make any concession on the issues related to principles , did not free himself from the keynotes of " the two-state theory , " and stubbornly adhered to the stance on " Taiwan independence . "  
When elucidating the human rights situation of the motherland of China , it is very correct to emphasize that the right to survive is fundamental .  However , explaining " democracy and human rights " to the Taiwan compatriots is even more complicated , and is also very difficult to manage .  But , this is possibly much more powerful than guided missiles , so it is worth striving to try to do .  
If we do not speed up development of China 's economic and scientific and technological undertakings and work hard to narrow the gap with advanced global levels , we will have a difficult time taking hold of initiative in the fierce international competition .  
The Chinese people have generally practiced pacifism and have the thinking and natural instincts of assuming the defensive .  These are integrated with their strong traditional ideology of blood relationship and their special social crowd structure .  One of the results of this humane culture is that hegemonism which is aimed at invading other countries will be difficult to develop .  
For quite a long time to come , it will still be difficult to change the basic trends of an increasing population and decreasing farmland .  It is imperative to protect farmland , regarding it as a major issue that has a bearing on the national economy and the people 's livelihood and on sustainable development .  At no time should we relax work in this respect .  
The government 's investment in the development of science and technology is limited by its financial resources , and it can not attend to each and every aspect of the development of science and technology but should be responsible mainly for organizing , administering , and funding basic research and make necessary coordination and providing necessary funds for projects to tackle key difficult problems in advanced technology ; as for the general development and application of science and technology , they should be left to enterprises .  
The trends of international development in recent yeas show that as the funds needed for investment in research and development have been doubled and redoubled , enterprises have been unable to innovate in products alone and that with the rapid renewal of knowledge and technology , it is difficult for enterprises , although with patents and intellectual property rights , to recover their investments in research and development in a short period of time before the appearance of other newer technologies .  
The party 's ideological and political work , which has become even more arduous and difficult under the increasingly complicated circumstances , is by no means dispensable or fruitless ; rather , it is indispensable and well worth doing . 
The whole army should bring into play the excellent traditions and work styles of our army stationing troops to open up wastelands and guarding the frontiers and pioneering enterprises with painstaking efforts and being bold in undertaking urgent , difficult , dangerous , and arduous tasks to perform meritorious services in the big west development .  
Due to the facts that the trend of an economic globalization has come with a swift and violent momentum and that many things still remain undone which should have been accomplished under the rule of the British Hong Kong authorities , and with the addition that the Asian financial turmoil has exploded the economic bubbles that were formed during the rule of the British Hong Kong authorities and has also exposed the problems and long-standing defects in many fields , the reform tasks facing the SAR government have proved extremely difficult and arduous .  
During these 10 years , he bore all types of false charges that had no basis , was subjected to unprecedented humiliation , experienced a lifetime 's most difficult " coming out of retirement , " and faced the most chaotic and irrational political situation .  
Following the growth of the DPP in Taiwan 's political arena , " Taiwan independence " thinkers seem to have felt that the simple slogan of " democracy and human rights " is rather of the grass roots , not comprehensive and profound enough , and difficult to attain the purpose of " winning maximum popular support . "  Besides , an extremely urgent matter for Chen Shui-bian after his inauguration is the debate over reunification and independence , which " democracy and human rights " seem unable to eliminate .  
Second , the US military has a large number of complex and high-tech weapons .  Therefore , there is a large consumption and costly price for logistical and technical support .  In addition , because of independent purchases systems for various weapons of armed services , the maintenance and upkeep is extremely difficult .  
Moreover , the planes ' main components and parts , equipment , airborne weapons , and maintenance technology are highly dependent on foreign countries .  Once a war breaks out in the Taiwan Strait , supply for the planes will become difficult and the number of such planes owned by the Taiwan Air Force will decrease with each plane shut down .  
It has been learned that since the founding of New China , the large number of science and technology personnel and workers of departments taking part in the cooperation in science and technology for national defense have carried forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard work , tackled and solved one difficult technological problem after another , ensured the needs of the development of science and technology for national defense , and made important contribution to the modernization of national defense and economic construction .  
First , it is necessary to step up law enforcement .  Second , it is necessary to cooperate with the State Economic and Trade Commission and other departments and implement the relevant policies and handle the technological and capital matters that will enable the large and medium state enterprises to fulfill the anti-pollution requirements .  Third , it is necessary to further strengthen basic work of fulfilling the anti-pollution requirements in industry , analyze the progress of work , find the focal and difficult points , and offer meticulous and classified guidance .  
established and perfected rules and regulations ; and have satisfactorily resolved many " long-standing , big , and difficult " issues which long defied solution .  Through the education and rectification activity , the vast numbers of cadres in leading organs have enhanced their political awareness and the awareness of responsibility , and have pledged one after another to set an example for the troops with their own conduct in fulfilling the requirement of " three represents . "  
Faced with the crucial situation in cross-strait relations , the station 's officers and men have resolved to support the government 's just stance with practical actions , solidly made relentless preparations , stand in combat readiness , and established the thought of offering themselves first for the whole battle to win the war .  The station is prepared to fight a war under the most difficult situation based on current circumstances .  
Another weak point of the Taiwan military is that it purchases weapons from a variety of countries ; their quality , performance , and operating regulations differ , with the result that it is very difficult to form the weapon systems into a complete perfect set , and this has a direct impact on taking advantage of their combat capability .  
Many in the political circles , public opinion , and even the " vice president " Annette Lu [ Lu Xiulian ] , all hold a reserved attitude toward Chen Shui-bian 's trip .  They believe that Chen Shui-bian 's trip does not conform to what is appropriate for the present time , is full of variables , and that it will be difficult to gain any positive results .  As well , they think it is bound to have a negative impact on the already turbid cross-strait relations .  
With the exception of major and difficult cases they , through study by the collegial panel , should be reported to the president of the people 's court for discussion and final judgment by the judicial council , and judgments of all cases are to be made directly by the collegial panel according to the law .  The chief justice will directly sign the final document according to the law .  
Generally , developing countries possess vast land , have huge populations , are rich in natural resources , and have vast markets .  Without progress in developing countries , it will be difficult for developed countries to maintain lasting prosperity .  
It has been revealed that each test costs some $ 100 million , a preliminary system would cost $ 10 billion , and the entire system could cost as much as $ 60 billion .  Even after spending so much money , no one can say with certainty that the completed system would be flawless and problem free .  Besides , with the rapid development of modern science and technology , it is difficult to predict that the NMD would not become a pile of trash in the future .  
There are also , however , a number of rural problems that can not be neglected ; the main ones are that it is difficult for the peasants to increase income , and their burdens are too heavy , while the work style of certain grassroots cadres is simple and crude and they issue compulsory orders , causing bad incidents and mass incidents in certain localities .  
Every year throughout the military , over one thousand leading cadres at or above the army level have gone among the soldiers to understand the situations , give guidance and lectures , answer and solve hot and difficult educational issues , and give effective guidance on education .  This has produced a lively situation where party committees have attached great importance to education , leaders have worked together to manage it , and officers and men participated in it enthusiastically .  
If war breaks out , the blows dealt to Taiwan 's economy can not be compared to a minor power cut or a major earthquake ; the financial securities market will fall into serious chaos , the stock market will dive , there will be massive exchange rate turbulence , foreign investment will be withdrawn , and the entire Taiwan economy may be paralyzed , so Taiwan will find it very difficult to fight a protracted war with the mainland .  
The practice in the construction of our country has also proved that if the productive forces develop slowly , it will be difficult to resolve various kinds of contradictions and problems exiting in economic and social life , and it will also be difficult to meet the people 's demands for improving their living standard .  
To make a success of training the troops through science and technology , it is necessary to carry it out in close connection with the requirements of actual combat , centering on resolving key and difficult problems in preparations for military struggle , persist in hard and strict training , intensify targeted training , and make efforts to narrow the gap between training and actual combat .  
The report stated " the Fuzhou Theater in particular has rapidly been taking shape as a strong joint operation mechanism for the troops and has greatly enhanced the capability to launch a large-scale joint operation under difficult conditions of having to organize the Theater in a very short period and of personnel coming from different military systems . " 
Speaking to Chinese reporters , Yang Hyong-sop , first vice chairman of the Korean Supreme People 's Assembly , said that 50 years ago today , countless numbers of outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people had , holding high the banner of " resisting US aggression and helping Korea and protecting and defending home and country , " crossed the Yalu River and fought along with the Korean army and people at their most difficult moment .  
Under a new situation , we always insist on the forward direction of advanced Chinese culture and push the prosperous development of socialism 's culture and art to satisfy the growing need for peoples ' cultural spirit , and provide the insured thoughts , motives of spirit and intellectual support for economic development and improvement of the whole society , and build a nice social atmosphere and human cultural circumstance , above are honorable and difficult historical responsibilities of the cultural and art workers .  
Wu Bangguo said : As a traditional industry , the coal industry has to shoulder a heavy historical burden .  In the current process , in which great changes have taken place in market supply and demand and the old economic system is being changed into the new , it is difficult for coal enterprises themselves to completely overcome difficulties they have encountered .  The government must make efforts to create an essential external environment and conditions in all aspects and give them specific support and assistance .  
The " Opinion " puts forth the following demands : Political organs at all levels must have the ability to correctly analyze and understand the state of mind of officers and men in their respective units and make prompt suggestions on how to educate them , ability to give theoretical guidance and to study and solve hot and difficult issues , ability to discover typical examples and sum up experience , and ability to conduct the ideological and political education innovatively in accordance with the actual situation .  
and for servicemen who have served in areas known for harsh conditions or in some special posts .  As for economically underdeveloped areas faced with a heavy or difficult settlement task , the people 's governments at the provincial level may extend to a certain extent the scope of relocated settlement after taking all factors into account .  
Rarely did any of the previous US presidents make it so clear on the issue .  In particular , Bush Junior holds a more conservative attitude toward getting involved in international affairs , while Gore is more active in terms of getting involved in the maintenance of the international order .  It is fairly difficult to decide on a short view as to the election of which will be more favorable to Taiwan .  
Wang Liheng indicated that in the future , the corporation will give priority to developing communications satellites , natural resources satellites , meteorological satellites , disaster reduction satellites , a system of satellites to forecast and appraise small satellites , and the ground application system .  It will also give priority to building a space-ground infrastructure information system with the applied satellites as the major platform and to utilizing space technology to solve the difficult and hot issues emerging in national economic and social development .  
Checked by the definition of the US ' China strategy and the choice of policies , the younger Bush deliberately adopted an uncompromising attitude toward numerous issues concerning China while Gore was unwilling to leave an impression of being weak .  Although the two men 's specific views on China are not completely the same , it is difficult for people to find any substantial differences in their views on China .  
Comrade Deng Xiaoping , chief architect of our country 's socialist reform and opening up , led all party comrades in emancipating their minds , seeking truth from facts , observing the characteristics of the times and the current international situation in an all-round way , summing up foreign and domestic socialist construction as well as historical and immediate experiences , and conducting difficult explorations , thus making important achievements in the theory and practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Qiu Xiaohua pointed out that in future , China should pay special attention to improving the quality of economic growth and organically integrate structural innovation with technical innovation in order to provide a good economic environment for reform to enter a stage of tackling difficult problems and to fundamentally increase the intrinsic vitality of China 's economy .  
Jeffrey Koo said : Advanced countries do not have many restrictions regarding sending back the investment made by transnational companies .  A long time ago when Taiwan did not have an ample foreign exchange reserve , it set a requirement , setting a yearly limit for Taiwan businessmen to remit money to foreign countries .  According to China 's current financial system , it is difficult for Taiwan businessmen to remit their profits back to Taiwan .  
Question : Since the new US president is expected to emerge amidst " wrangling " and the two political parties are also likely to have equal shares in both the Senate and the House of Representatives in the future , will such a situation make it difficult for the executive departments to introduce drastic changes to the existing policies ?  
After going through the " three stresses " campaign , the thinking of every locality is much more free and the spirit is much more inspired ; conspicuous problems , problems of hotspots , and problems of difficult points that all appeared in the process of reform and development have been solved ; the cohesive power and fighting strength of Party organizations have been strengthened ;  
in particular , political forces standing for human rights and environmental protection and opposing free trade have continually expanded , with the result that it was very difficult for Gore to build a broad and close-knit Democratic Party campaign alliance . 
The ideological-political work is a fine tradition of our party that has been handed down from generation to generation .  No matter whether it was during the arduous war years or the rough and difficult period of construction , in-depth and meticulous ideological-political work had always played an indispensable part in uniting the masses , rallying people 's confidence , and expanding our strength .  
Guided by theoretical study , we should step up study of the international strategic situation and the characteristics and law of military management under the high-technology local war conditions and the new situations ; we should actively organize and coordinate military organs , military academies , scientific research units , and the troops , to systematically study crucial and difficult problems .  
Under the current situation in which the standard of China 's rural productive forces is fairly low , it is difficult to carry out agricultural scientific research and development without government support .  
These people are subject to the manipulation of foreign powers and the harmful leadership of a heretical teaching .  The ideology is extreme , the behavior is boundless , and it is very difficult to guarantee that a self-burning incident like the one in Tiananmen will not happen in Hong Kong or perhaps yet another burning tragedy in the country .  
Market competition hinges , to a considerable extent , upon the quality and functions of products .  In order to implement the open strategy of pluralistic markets and " walking out , " it is imperative to concentrate our efforts on heightening the quality and grades of export commodities and enhancing their competitiveness , otherwise , it will be very difficult to guarantee the original market shares , and still more difficult to open up new international markets .  As a result , China 's level of opening to the outside world will be seriously impaired .  
In his letter , Wu Bangguo said : Beginning from 2001 , the Three Gorges Project will enter the most arduous construction period .  The concrete pouring work will be more difficult than before .  In addition , the work of installing heavy metal components as well as mechanical and electronic equipment will enter a peak period .  
( 3 ) Compared with his economic achievements , Clinton was weak and inept in diplomatic strategy .  Since it is very difficult for Bush to demonstrate his economic aptitude within a short period of time , he has to use underhand method to score some points first in foreign affairs .  
They embody the spirit of being highly responsible to the cause of the party and the people , the spirit of faithfully performing duties and making selfless dedications , the humanitarian spirit of being friendly toward people and being patient in helping people being obsessed and misled by the evil cult , the spirit of defending science and upholding the truth , the spirit of fearing no difficulty and daring to undertaking difficult tasks , and the spirit of being responsible and doing down-to-earth work .  
Deputy Zhang Xinan , director of Chenchang town horticultural garden in Hubei 's Xiantao city , said : Because it is currently difficult to collect funds to be retained by a collective , many people are unwilling to be village cadres , and the foundation of grass-roots political power has become shaky .  
Deputy Zhang Baoyi , mayor of Zhangjiakou City , said : This is an amazing achievement .  These years , the work of aiding the poor to tackle difficult problems has been done as an important task from the central to local levels , and actual results have been achieved from formulating policies to inputting human , financial , and material resources into this work .  
Wu Jinglian , famous economist and standing committee member of the National Committee of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference , today at a news conference remarked that the large-scale lay-offs of workers that have occurred in China in recent years are inevitable reflections of the employment system and policies of a planned economy that is undergoing the process of economic transition .  The large influx of excess agricultural labor in non-agricultural industries has also made employment increasingly difficult .  Thus , improving the social environment for employment is a new solution for re-employment .  
Buhe , vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee , joined deputies of the Fujian delegation in discussing Chairman Li Peng 's work report .  He pointed out : In the next few years , we will be facing arduous legislative tasks , and the difficult points in the legislative work will be rather prominent .  We must further quicken the pace of legislation , establish and perfect the socialist legal system .  This is a fundamental measure concerning our country 's long-lasting order and stability and long-term development .  
Competition in the aspect of agricultural development comes more often from the foreign market than from the domestic market .  As far as hundreds of millions of peasants are concerned , it is rather difficult to increase their incomes by simply relying on growing crops .  Having insufficient stamina , township enterprises , which flourished some years ago , find it hard to become a major channel for increasing peasants ' incomes in a short period of time .  
Second , our country was subject to the planned economic system over a long time , and people did not have a good sense of acting according to the legal system .  As a result , it is a common phenomenon that leaders substitute the laws with their words , and law enforcers violate the laws by themselves .  This makes it rather difficult to perform supervision .  
The average per-capita amount of grain was less than 300 jin .  Faced with difficult natural conditions , the masses of cadres and people in Bazhong , earnestly implementing the policies set by the central authorities , have enormously changed the impoverished feature of Bazhong after eight years of unremitting efforts .  
They should take supporting the large-scale development of the western region as an important way to increase their fighting capacity and cultivate their militant style of enduring hardships and daring to fight a hard battle and promote army building in an all-round way by providing aid to local people in carrying out urgent , difficult , dangerous , or important tasks .  2 .  
Miss Yue said the negotiations on financial services were protracted and difficult .  She is therefore particularly pleased that the negotiations were concluded with a substantially improved package of offers with a very broad level of participation from both developed and developing members of the WTO .  
The rest of $ 70 billion are either statutory or contractual payments which we are required to pay under existing policies .  Examples are pensions , social security and legal aid .  It would be difficult to achieve a quantified 5% gain within two to three years in respect of these payments .  
10 .  The way the Ordinance is written has put the main burden of proof on the attending medical practitioner because he has received professional training and would be the most suitable person to give justifications for the application .  Nevertheless , since the medial practitioner is neither the donor nor the recipient , it is difficult for him to represent both parties to submit the proof to the Board and certify that there is no commercial dealing .  
Our critics , both at home and abroad , have accused us of intervening with the aim simply of propping up the stock market ; of being too afraid to face the pain from the necessary interest rate volatility under a strict currency board system operating in difficult conditions ; even of trying to introduce a novel form of state ownership by acquiring a substantial interest in Hong Kong 's major corporations .  
A simplistic approach to the difficult task of determining where the public interest may properly be said to lie may be fine for the armchair commentator , but it is a luxury which the responsible prosecutor , whose decision may have grave and far-reaching consequences for the suspect , for his family , and for the public at large , can ill-afford .  
" As all applications are of a high quality , the selection panel , comprising members from heads and teachers of primary , secondary and special schools , an academic from a tertiary institution and ED officers had a difficult task in coming up with the allocation decisions , " he said .  
As a high standard of proof is required for " criminal offences " , it is often more difficult to convict complicated commercial crimes and takes a great deal of resources and time to establish a case .  As such , the criminal approach to deal with market misconduct may not necessarily have a stronger deferent effect on committed offenders .  
If CWHKT 's basic rental charge remains substantially below cost , which will still be slightly below cost after the increase , other local operators , whose costs are comparable to CWHKT 's , will find it difficult to offer competitive alternative services to the residential market without suffering a loss .  Ultimately , consumers will suffer because of the lack of a truly competitive market , " the spokesman said .

He explained , " The prolonged economic downturn is making it difficult for some domestic property owners to continue with their monthly mortgage payments .  Some are even forced to sell their properties and move to less satisfactory private housing . "  " And rather than financial gains , the majority of transactions of private domestic property recorded recently have indicated losses to the vendors . "  
The Marre Report on the Future of the English legal profession , published in 1988 , stated that " It is extremely difficult to define the need for legal services .  Unmet need is impossible to quantify . . .  It would be hard to develop research techniques which would give a reliable profile of unmet legal need broken down by type of problem and geographical area " .  
Noting the current difficult economic situation , Mr Tung stressed that the Government would strengthen the service-oriented culture in the civil service by improving its efficiency and quality of service and fostering a higher degree of accountability and responsiveness to public aspirations .

Dr Ho said the Accident and Emergency Ward at Prince of Wales Hospital would be closed for three days because many of the medical staff had reported sick and it was difficult to operate the service with the remaining manpower , and urgent patients would be taken to the nearest alternative hospital .  
Although lighting candles is not regarded as burning candles or wax under the regulation , people celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival should place a metal can or other non-flammable containers under the candles to collect melted wax for easy disposal in litter bins .  This way , they can avoid leaving unsightly blobs of wax on the ground , on leisure facilities and on kerbs of planters , which are extremely difficult to remove .  
Although a large number of surplus teachers and fresh graduates of the Hong Kong Institute of Education ( HKIEd ) have indicated that it is difficult to secure a teaching post , I have received complaints that some schools have employed untrained university graduates as " permitted teachers " in the current school year .  
Following this abstract beginning came more familiar excerpts from " Swan Lake " and " Gypsy . " The next item however , was a modern ballet entitled " Incense Light " ( traditional heritage ) , designed by Huang and with music composed by Li Tai-hsiang perhaps even more difficult to understand than in the " Love Story of the Torch " .

Now , it is recognized as Kuo Chu or national drama , since it is a genuine Chinese art form which upholds traditional virtues such as loyalty , filial piety , chastity , justice and righteousness . No matter what its name , however , there is no doubt that strenuous efforts must be made to save this ancient art from extinction . The biggest reason for the decline of Peiping opera is the fact that its classical language is difficult for members of the younger generation to understand .  
Educational opportunities are extremely limited , with room in colleges for only 3% of the youth . Strict social controls make it difficult for peasants to escape their traditional agricultural roles ; such opportunities are rarer now than they were before 1949 . Indeed , the mainland China of today has become quite conservative : those in positions of authority are mostly from poor agricultural backgrounds with little formal education .  
Moreover , the costs in broken lives , lost educations , and destroyed books and artworks are incalculable and difficult for Westerners to imagine . It is even more painful to realize that Mao launched the " Cultural Revolution " in order to attain the lofty goals of eliminating poverty , bureaucratic excesses and class differences , but became so intoxicated with his own delusions and solutions that he was blinded to the wishes of the people who were forced to follow his orders .  
Although jade was difficult to carve because of its incredible hardness , the stone was cherished for its lustrous sheen , and pure , clean lines .  
Jean 's soft manner has been advantageous in her often difficult position as negotiator in an organization that is part public and part private , where the interests of the two may often conflict .

Puppet theatre has experienced difficult times as of late . A rural art , it lost much of its audience in the tremendous urbanization of the past twenty years . In addition , being educated has come to mean being Westernized for many people , leaving them to shun traditional Chinese art .  
China , to the foreigners , was mysterious , ancient , complex , and difficult to understand .

Q : Now that the R . O . C has severed diplomatic relations with Nicaragua , it is rumored that Uruguay may establish ties with the Mainland . In the face of international political realities , it is very difficult for the R . O . C to appeal to " morality " and limited agricultural and economic aid as a basis for diplomacy .

This is not a particularly difficult task , but it is time consuming and extremely complex because there were no standard editions of the repertoires performed by folk opera troupes , and a tradition of oral transmission inevitably results in textual discrepancies and variants . The old artistes are usually illiterate and are often on the verge of senility , so they frequently do not understand the words they are singing themselves !  
That is to say , the younger those who have been arrested and imprisoned are at the first offense , the more likely is the possibility they will be repeat or serious offenders later . This is because on the inside not only are they able to learn even more " specialized " criminal techniques , after they get out , because they have been " labelled " as bad guys , it is difficult to go straight .  
The supply of eel for export to Japan ca n't meet demand , but since Taiwan is too small and labor is expensive , it 's very difficult to expand the scope of eel farming . So we have always been alert for investment opportunities abroad , " says Lin . At first , the Malaysian government wanted to rent 200 chia of land to him . " In pingtung [ in southern Taiwan ] , to have a five chia eel farm is already miraculous - - how could we deal with 200 chia ? "  
Having just celebrated the anniversary of commissioner Lin 's burning of British opium which triggered the Opium War , Chinese readers might be smiling quietly to themselves at the fact that neighboring Japan is not only supplying the British with cheap and attractive household goods , but is also spending a large amount of money on their cultural education . lt is difficult not to conclude , however , that the only way to avoid accusations of " charm and stealth " might be to send in gunboats selling heroin under the flag of free trade .  
From the melody one can understand the wisdom of life and the changes of the track . Bodies warming up on the turf are like adagio - - slow but ordered . Starting from the blocks is like the first beat - - after a violent burst of energy , one needs gentle fluidity . The contradictions of the heart and the great difficulty of interval training are like variations - - only by charging through the most difficult sections can one get to the gentle and beautiful coda .  
A . Because the chairman of the Legislative Yuan has almost no power to decide , added to the fact that there have been a lot of protest incidents , it has been especially difficult these last two years to preside over the Yuan meetings . I have just been trying to play a fair , objective , and occasionally humorous role , to balance and mediate the confrontational situation between the supplementary legislators and the senior legislators , in order to keep the agenda moving smoothly .  
Chen Yu-feng explains that the forests which have been able to overcome Taiwan 's harsh land are called " special flora which has adapted to an unstable ground quality over a long period of time . " in botany . One of its most important features is that " it is very difficult to restore an area to the original condition after the surface has been stripped away , and this will initiate a long-term , intensive chain reaction . "  
A . With any kind of historical research , especially recent or contemporary , for which many of the people involved are still alive , it is comparatively easy to be coolly objective . Yet it is also , therefore , difficult to get a true picture and description .  
The western seacoast was originally rising land , but because each of the two tributaries to the upstream portion of the Tsengwen River had dams built on them , plus a great amount of illegal pisciculture on the western seacoast , today reclaimed land on the seacoast is declining , not increasing . It would be very difficult to find a similar sandbank for the birds .  
Chiang Hsiao-shan points out even though the vast majority of patients are open , extroverted , positive types with a considerable degree of self-confidence who are bold enough to want to change their image , the longing for a better appearance often involves tangled emotional complexes that are difficult to resolve , and most doctors must still carefully evaluate the patients who walk in their doors .  
China 's ancient books have been through human and natural disasters with countless numbers having been destroyed and lost . There are no certain statistics concerning just how many still survive in the world today . Moreover , with there being much space for dispute over how antique works should be carefully determined and compared , it is even more difficult to put numbers on them .  
We 're constantly seeing cases of leaders being rejudged in the light of history , finding they may have been strong in ability but were weak in morals , or vice versa . Inter-level communicationQ : In your book you analyzed the main cause for the decline of China through the ages and concluded that it lay in the rift between the upper and middle levels and between the middle and lower ones . Is cross-level interaction and communication really that difficult ?  
In the free democratic societies that have mostly replaced authoritarian societies , the upper level is formed from the middle level and the middle level from the lower level . No one 's position is permanently occupied , and there are no strong authoritarian forces blocking interaction and communication . Mutual understanding is n't difficult .  
Because puppets are heavy and hard to manipulate , and the minute and complicated Peikuan rhythmic shifts of the accompanying music are difficult to sing , puppetry is the only traditional performance art whose study can not be promoted in elementary schools .  
Of course , given the current technological level of domestic manufacturing , it is still difficult to undertake joint R &amp; D or sales exchanges with major American or European corporations . In order to transfer some of the more advanced technologies , it is necessary that they first be digested by ITRI before they can be given over to local operations .  
Only the application in daily life of ideals c allow even more people to participate , so that everyone will realize that environmental protection is n't so difficult . One need only make a few adjustments in one 's basic living habits to be able to change the environment . The basic view of green consumption is the admonition : " Do n't avoid doing something just because the gain seems small ; do n't go ahead and do something just because the harm seems marginal . "  
Because the Japanese military imposed strict order , any photography that included topographic features , military bases , or indeed any photo whose field of vision extended downward more than 45 degrees had to be approved by the military police . Thus it was difficult for ordinary people to photograph freely outdoors .  
Those in favor say that there is already a gulf between vernacular and classical Chinese ( or wen-yen-wen ) . Through translation , modern people can share in the wisdom of the ancients . Those opposed contend that it would be difficult to avoid error in translating the spare and refined classical into the modern vernacular . If errors do occur , this will mislead contemporary readers about their history .  
Lin Shan-le , who came to Taiwan to live with relatives , and Li Lan , a student at Hsinpu Junior College , praise " 800O miles " for its deep and fertile subject matter and for daring to tackle sensitive issues . That lover of dramas Ma Yu , on the other hand , believes that " 8000 Miles " goes too far in directly judging mainland trends and cross-strait relations . Sometimes , she says , it has a sneering or glibly debasing tone that makes it more difficult for her to accept .  
Bob Yeh , managing director of the Meta Advertising Company , which handles the account for Shin Shii oolong tea , analyzes the reasons for failure at that time : First , Chinese who had long been accustomed to taking their tea hot could not immediately accept cold tea . There was a traditional belief that " tea left overnight produces poisons . " If tea is left to steep for a long time , it creates tannic acid , which causes the arteries to contract and makes digestion difficult .  
The grasslands also arouse the imagination . When one stands among the grass , looking in all four directions at once , the great earth appears to be a green , round plate without boundaries , a plate pacific and changeless . Occasionally , a lonely , slow song wafts by , and in that voice can be heard the longing for the colorful world beyond the horizon . However difficult it was to bear , the foreign arrivals had to depart the grasslands once again .  
Eastern Taiwan 's inconvenient transportation is well-known , especially the railroad . Because the east is obstructed by the double barrier of the central mountain range and the coastal mountain range , beginning work on the railroad was extremely difficult . The earliest constructed stretch was a simple narrow gauge line from Hwalien to Taitung .  
While researching the article , we came across many moving stories . A couple who , after being " pronounced " infertile , had gone through the long and difficult process of treatment , held each other and wept when the wife finally became pregnant ; a mother who after enduring the pain of the procedures involved gave birth to a baby with a congenital heart defect was neither bitter nor regretful , but full of since re gratitude . . . .  
But this journey is a distant one . Currently the population , lands and culture of the tribal villages are quickly disappearing . As a result , the tribal ceremonies have become mere formalities , put on only for reasons of tourism or politics ; the tribal lodges no longer exist ; the m other tongues and their oral literatures are gradually being forgotten ; traditional social structures have been broken apart ; and tribal elders , chiefs , and leading families have lost their positions of respect . A return to traditional culture would be difficult indeed .  
Sun Ta-chuan , a lecturer in the philosophy department at Soochow University , who is also of Puyuma ancestry , observes that in traditional tribal society leaders inherited their power or were selected by the nobility from within their own ranks , which is quite at odds with the current political system ; this can make it difficult for people to adapt to participating in an electoral system .  
But the old trails run deep into the furthest recesses of the mountain ranges , and were often cut along hunting trails and the tracks worn by wild animals , so that they are difficult for most people to reach , and with little in the way of historical records , searching them out is an extremely difficult task .  
And very recently , with the arrival of spring , climatic conditions are highly unstable , so it is very difficult to ascertain whether it will rain or not . After his weather forecasts have turned out to be totally incorrect , a patient afflicted with bronchitis could not resist calling up TTV in order to complain . " Jen Li-yu 's ability to forecast the weather is not half as accurate as my own bronchial tubes . "  
But after war broke out between China and Japan , the mainland market gradually declined , and then as war spread throughout East Asia , shipping became difficult and many rushwork traders went out of business . After the war ended , things looked up economically , but then mainland China fell victim to civil war , which continued until the Nationalist government withdrew to Taiwan , and the state of the rushwork trade went from bad to worse .  
It is true that the brook masu salmon have survived from ancient times , and they are internationally famous as Taiwan 's precious living fossils . But still , in the greater context of the incessant deterioration of Nature , these fish are not the only creatures who ultimately are finding it difficult to escape extinction . And at the same time , how much hope remains as the salmon struggle against the manmade " New Nature " ?  
At any rate , the investment required to open a computer center is not nearly as monumental as a factory or an overseas branch operation . With the use of satellite communications it really was n't that difficult . As far as Hong Kong and Shanghai is concerned , we were simply turning circumstances to our advantage . " Lo reveals that several dozen employees have returned by this method .  
China 's Minority Peoples For photographers anxious to free themselves from commonplace and boring subjects , China 's ethnic minorities , with their unique customs , rustic appearances , colorful , varied clothing , and rugged , lofty mountains as a backdrop , hold a glamor that is difficult to express .  
And once they have been admitted , it is difficult to discharge them . Chronic illness includes stroke-induced paralysis , pathological changes to the liver and kidney , and rheumatoid arthritis . Patients with those afflictions can not possibly get well and leave the hospital within a short period of time . As a result , those patients who are actually in urgent need of hospitalization can not find a bed covered by insurance ( ie . , in common rooms with three or more beds ) .  
We are surrounded by good things to eat in our prosperous society , and the need to carry heavy things , walk long distances , or perform manual labor is greatly reduced . Our bodies take in more energy than they expend , and while the food is easy to eat , it 's hard to get rid of . So it 's difficult to avoid accumulating fat .  
But later his father suffered a stroke , and the family faced a difficult financial situation . The burden of supporting the household fell entirely on Chou Meng-te 's shoulders , and he had no choice but to leave his undemanding teaching job with its regular salary and find another way to earn a living .  
There 's nothing difficult about running an official publication : " Just handle it like a regular official document . " Topics were set out by the Printed Materials Department , which handled all government publications , and relevant agencies were asked for material and photographs .  
Interestingly , the staff that had been brought up on Lisa Kuan 's strict demands at first found it a bit difficult to adjust to Wang , who is relaxed , has a lively sense of humor , and is warm and genteel in her personal relations . Sunny Hsiao said it well with a metaphor from ROC history : " It was like going from the period of tutelary authoritarianism to that of constitutional democracy . "  
He wrote that " it is easy to move from frugality to luxury , but difficult to move from luxury to frugality . " It is impossible for even the most disciplined and fortunate families to achieve high rank in every generation , not to mention those families in which profligate playboys undo the accumulated achievements of their ancestors .  
Professor Yang Kuo-chu of NTU 's psychology department sums up the situation by saying that in the West , demographic change and equal rights for women have developed over a relatively long period , whereas in Taiwan demographic change has been compressed into a short timeframe , and it is difficult for traditions of male preeminence and of continuation of the male family line to disappear so quickly . These factors , combined with the timely appearance of techniques for determining fetal gender , probably provide the best explanation for the imbalance between male and female births .  
Often many different crops are planted in a single small area ; small towns and large urban areas are not clearly defined and often are mixed together ; and there are rapid changes in construction . These make it difficult to interpret satellite images .  
As in the cultural , agricultural , and economic fields , cross-strait narcotics exchanges and mutual reliance among dealers have also grown significantly these past several years . Cross-strait anti-drug cooperation should be implemented with urgency , but it is stagnating amidst disputes over sovereignty and legal jurisdiction , and it has proven difficult to make any breakthroughs .  
Given the current intense anti-drug efforts and heavy sentences , it is difficult to move drugs within Taiwan , and the price of heroin has increased as supply has been unable to keep up with demand . Depending upon how much major suppliers have in stock , one kilo can be sold for NT $ 15 million .  
Kwan Wen-yen looks at it from the point of view of economic growth . Looking at the current standards of mass sporting events , he says that management of medium-sized 8,000-seat facilities is still inadequate . If the domed stadium is built , it would be OK if it were turned over to the private sector , but if it were managed by the government , based on the current structure , it would be difficult to do the job well .  
For Kuo Mei-fang , who had taken classes in Chinese architecture while in graduate school , had studied classical Chinese , and was familiar with ancient architectural drawings , reading Xin Yi Xiang Fa Yao was not so difficult . By studying it again and again she came to appreciate the tremendous ingenuity of many aspects of Su Song 's original design , and solved many riddles ( see " How the Astronomical Clock Tower Worked " ) .  
Finding foreign partners for joint ventures is not difficult for medium to large-sized companies with substantial financial and technological resources , but " most Taiwanese medium or small businesses have few opportunities to find foreign partners except by becoming satellite companies of Japanese firms , " says Kenneth Lai .  
Rather , starting with ancient Greece , I reread the Western philosophers . I worked hard at standing in their shoes . The process was very difficult , for I discovered that things which in the past I had been educated to accept as true and reasonable gradually became petty and untrustworthy .  
Li describes a six-hour procedure in which he participated : The patient was suffering from a malignant tumor on the common bile duct , which connects to the hepatic duct , bile duct , and pancreatic duct . Because it affected so many organs , the surgery was extremely difficult . Seven persons-the assistant chief of the hospital , a chief resident , a resident , an anesthe-siologist , and three nurses-labored for those six hours to complete the job .  
For example , Chef Chen reveals a dish called " Fresh Mushroom Treasure Chest " ( made from mushrooms deep fried in oil to a golden color and then wokfried with lily bulbs and the tender stalks and leaves of peas ) and another called " Splendid Jade Flute " ( made with zhusheng edible fungus , vegetarian chicken , cane shoots , and green beans ) . Neither is difficult to prepare at home .  
She had less than US $ 10,000 in the bank , but it would be enough for her to " rough it " on a backpack trip through Asia . She was n't worried about her future . She was young and healthy , and had heard that it would be easy to find a job teaching English . With her Berkeley degree and pleasant appearance , she figured it would not be difficult to find such a job .  
The civil code guarantees that the husband will manage , use , and receive the earnings from property . A divorced woman may win custody of her children , but with laws on the division of property incomplete , if her husband is something less than generous and tries to make things difficult for her , she may be left caring for her children without a penny to her name . In principle , the legal code is for " people " ; there should not be any distinctions made on the basis of sex .  
Leaving behind the central plains , they entered Sichuan on paths which were narrow and winding , difficult and dangerous . When , far from home , they heard the cuckoo sing , the legend of the Emperor of Shu turning into a cuckoo drifted into their memories . The rigors of a journey in Sichuan were enough to make the normally robust Li Bai write , " Again the cuckoo sings to the night moon , bringing melancholy to the empty mountains , " and lament that " The roads of Shu are difficult . "  
A soil researcher , Professor Wu says that the red clay widely distributed in tropical countries is usually barren , and it is difficult to coax a good crop from it . However , Chuang Yu-long has overcome this problem , and could rightly be called a model of success in organic farming . When he has the time , in the future Wu plans to write down Chuang 's unique farming experiences .  
With transportation in and out of Pet �n being so difficult , the standard of living is poor . The Mission 's members laughingly call themselves modern day Su Wus ( after an official posted at the edge of the empire to watch sheep until his all male flock should happen to give birth to a lamb ) .  
One educational reformer has commented that , in this age of " free market education " where textbooks have become " intellectual commodities , " it is difficult to expect publishers not to concern themselves with business and other factors not related to education . But the bigger question is , are the rules of the new privatized education game fair ? Are they consistent ?  
While evaluating plans for ROCSAT-2 , the group decided that because synchronous satellites are vastly more complex than low-orbit satellites , and because it would be difficult to redirect the technical and human resources which were being built up through the ROCSAT-1 project , ROCSAT-2 would be redesignated as a low-orbit satellite .  
And , because the Three Kingdoms requires a knowledge of military tactics , it pushes players to study history more deeply outside the game . Tu 's son , a fifth grader , has carefully read a colloquial Chinese translation of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms ( the original is written in the difficult classical Chinese ) in order to better play the game , allowing his father to see the game 's charm firsthand .  
Given that , based on historical experience , forces in an amphibious assault are only about one-third as effective as on land ( i.e . effective fighting capability declines by two-thirds ) , unless the PRC develops transport and supply ships capable of carrying and supporting large numbers of troops , it would be very difficult to invade Taiwan .  
And although these kind of knowledge can be recorded in books , such books are difficult to understand and in the end , it is " technicians " who are key . In a how-to manual on industrial espionage , chapter one might mention that if a company wants to protect itself , it must be very careful with high-level technical people it has hired away from other companies .  
ATM leader Shen explains that some of the land in the reclamation area is of poor quality . The soil is very rocky , making planting of paddy rice difficult , so the land must be cleared to a depth of at least 20 centimeters . Though large stones can be dug up with heavy machinery , small stones have to be removed by hand as they are uncovered during plowing .  
The move toward open agricultural markets was agreed upon by the WTO member nations in the Uruguay round of GATT . With this international consensus and the global trend toward free trade in agriculture , Taiwan is finding it difficult to swim against the current by maintaining its protectionist agricultural policies .  
The center has increased its range of research substantially since its establishment , and the external environment has also become more complex . However , its objectives remain as unchanged as the simple exterior of its building-improving the lives of people in difficult environments and offering them a better future .  
But the distorted value systems on these other shows , in which truth becomes inseparable from fiction , are even more insidious . " Kuo says that most people already find it difficult to extract meaning from reality in all its complexity and suffer information overload . People usually take the easy way out , and turn to television . The uninterrupted flow of dubiously " re-constructed , " or outright fictional , information can temporarily offer solace to their tired souls .  
NHI was initially intended to use a global budgeting system , but this system has proved to be too difficult to implement . However , according to Yang Han-chuan , the BNHI is now working on a pilot program to be tested with dental care in the near future . Chuang Yi-chou says , " The mechanism is a good one , but the system was designed with the whole nation operating off of one budget .  
By paying for each procedure carried out , NHI is encouraging the medical community to emphasize quantity rather than quality of treatment . It is also encouraging doctors to go into easier fields which pay well . For this reason , dermatology , pediatrics and physical rehabilitation have become hot areas to work in , and doctors are leaving hospitals to set up their own private clinics . On the other hand , more difficult areas of medicine such as surgery are suffering from a shortage of doctors .  
Commenting on the results of this most recent meeting of APEC , Sung Chen-chao , a professor in the graduate institute of political economy at National Cheng Kung University , states that APEC has difficulty reaching decisions because it acts by consensus rather than by majority vote . The increase in the number of participating nations means that differences in economic level have also increased . Some of the organization 's less developed members are facing pressures which make it difficult for them to embrace the liberalization of economics and trade .  
" In Taiwan , AIDS is a venereal disease , " says Troy Lee . In the past , LOFAA 's primary mission was caring for AIDS victims . However , the group gradually realized that the key to AIDS prevention is education of those members of the public who are not infected with the virus . " If even sex is difficult to talk about , how can we talk about AIDS ? "  
Over a long period , as the various agencies implemented the policies decided upon by the relevant ministries of the central government , they were never in harmony , nor was there any authority to force these various units to work together for the regulation of waterways . This situation was compounded by the shortage of skilled personnel at the grass-roots level , making implementation of policy even more difficult .  
To avoid having their shares sold off , these tycoons , who were such able stock market operators when the economy was sound , had to devote their firm 's entire resources to defending their share price . This made it difficult to employ their capital effectively-they lived and died with the market .  
On the question of KPS setting up its own channel , Father Raymond Parent notes that when he was a member of the Government Information Office 's nine-member research team on cable television , he felt that the remit set by the GIO was too narrow , and the pace of legal reform too slow . With the chaotic situation of the time , when all cable channels were illegal , it would have been very difficult for KPS , with its limited financial resources , to enter this market .  
Take for example nasopharyngeal cancer , to which Chinese are specially susceptible . Nasopharyngeal cancer originates near the base of the skull , close to vital organs , so there 's little room for safety to make surgery more practicable . In addition , nasopharyngeal cancer is extremely likely to spread to the lymph nodes in the neck or other more remote areas of the body , so it is difficult to get all of the cancer with surgery .  
It required " a grade one vocational qualification [ equivalent to a degree from a junior college of that time ] and a grade two academic qualification [ equivalent to a degree from a three-year technical high school of that time ] . Preparing for the test was difficult . Days were hard after you went to work too , both in the training period and when you actually were working . If you did n't have an interest in machinery , it would have been hard to take any pleasure in the work , " says Cheng .  
That 's when he left behind the fingerprints . " It was these fingerprints that enabled the police to crack the case . The uncanny ability of the police to solve difficult cases has led some to quip that investigators have a crystal ball in their possession . To be sure , forensic science makes the crystal ball work better , but the crystal ball itself is something else entirely-the careful reasoning of seasoned investigators .  
Chiu Chung-hsien is the principal of Taipei County 's Hsiushan Elementary School , which won four first prizes for ensembles at this year 's provincial competition and one national second prize . Chiu says that because most parents do n't know which schools offer music programs , and those students without musical ability are too intimidated to sign up for the test , about one-half to one-third of those who apply are accepted . In short , it is n't that difficult to get into a program .  
All foster parents receive basic training and understand that abused children are different from other children . Nevertheless , as one foster mother put it , " Until you 've actually been through it , you just ca n't imagine how tough it is . " For most prospective foster parents , the task that lies ahead will be more difficult than expected .  
The possibility that the political situation and foreign policy of another country can be completely overturned in half a month makes the job of the ROC Foreign Ministry in seeking formal ties abroad that much more difficult . It also creates more public opinion pressure on the government .  
While a 5,000-year-old cultural legacy was being smashed to smithereens on the mainland , the ROC 's commitment to " revive classical Chinese culture and carry on traditional ways " represented a difficult burden for the small island of Taiwan to bear by itself . President Chiang Kai-shek would serve as head of the " Council for Chinese Cultural Renaissance . " Peking opera and classical Chinese painting were deliberately promoted and local Taiwanese culture suppressed .  
Unlike neighboring Hong Kong in 1997 , there was no public backlash in Macau on the occasion of the handover , and no exodus of emigrants . Everything seemed smooth and orderly . But the people 's primary concern was whether or not the incoming SAR administration would be capable of tackling difficult problems left behind by the Portuguese , particularly economic recession and declining public order .  
Section chief Victor Chu of the GIO , who has been involved in organizing the camp three times , says that all the participants are very satisfied with the course . After returning home most of them produce newspaper accounts of their experience . Unfortunately , it is very difficult for them to apply the technical infomation they learned , because in most cases they lack the hardware and facilities available in Taiwan . Thus they are only able to apply the theoretical insights they picked up to their own media work at home .  
This led to the questions getting more and more difficult . It was the sole basis for determining educational advancement , but it was completely removed from the basic educational level . What we want to do is to expand the base . " As long as the schools put the emphasis on imparting basic knowledge , then they will be meeting the goal of the reforms .  
" When people think about students at star schools they think in terms of students who get good grades , but being a high academic achiever is not the same thing as being gifted , " says Cheng . At Kaohsiung High , which is the most selective school in the Kaohsiung-Pingtung testing zone , quite a few of the students find the textbooks hard to follow . They are so difficult and obscure because their editors designed them to meet the needs of a small group of truly gifted students .  
But a flip side to economic growth , something the new administration needs to address , is the worsening problem of unemployment . In the first quarter of this year the number of unemployed climbed to 270,000 people , and narrowly-defined unemployment rose to a new high of 2.8% . Under the combined pressures of industrial upgrading , internationalization and liberalization , Taiwan 's economy is still facing a number of difficult challenges .  
As Hsia Chen points out , the KMT needed votes so it formed a symbiotic relationship with the financial apparatus at the local level : " Give me your votes , and you can suckle here in return . " Bank directors are often involved with local factions , and operate as influential " vote captains " at election time , so it 's difficult for political forces not to get involved whenever a problem crops up .  
Genetic engineering appears to be infinitely profitable and omnipotent . However , it is worth noting that gene transfer has risks : transferred genes can spread to unintended hosts , they can not be retracted , and they become permanent . If there is a problem , it could very well be difficult to put the genie back in the bottle .  
According to statistics of the Ministry of Finance , 87.5% of the trading volume on the Taiwan stock exchange comes from individual investors . In 1999 turnover was 288% ( that is , total trading volume was 2.88 times the total value of the market ) , which , though considerably down from nearly 600% ten years before , remained four times higher than the New York stock exchange . Despite numerous painful lessons in the past , the habit of chasing a rising market and cutthroat selling in a falling market has proven difficult to change .  
Except for a small number of sea creatures which are attracting international attention because their numbers are dropping sharply-such as the shark , whale , and sea turtle-few marine animals are protected by law , and it is not difficult for aquariums to collect specimens . Since these then become the main selling points to attract visitors , particular attention is therefore devoted to how these precious creatures respond to their new environment .  
However , WTO regulations require that exemptions be declared prior to application for entry . Given Taiwan 's current weak diplomatic position , unless the PRC agrees to the exemption , it will be difficult for Taiwan to get the required support of two-thirds of the 137 WTO member states for this escape clause . In sum , Kinmen people remain optimistic that the arguments in favor of the little three links will win out .  
This cultural illness is particularly serious in United States . American girls begin to be extremely concerned about their appearance from high school on , and many people are constantly depressed about their weight . Though the situation is not so serious in Taiwan , the mass media puts out a virtually unvarying message that beauty equals success . It is difficult for young people to resist the message implied in teenage beauty pageants , love-at-first-sight stories pairing up beautiful girls and handsome guys , and the images of pop superstars .  
Consider the fact that it depends on the central government for less than 10% of its revenues , while the average for Taiwan 's local governments as a whole stands at about 50% . Taipei City can almost make ends meet through its own tax revenues , but other cities are heavily reliant on the central government , and they are trapped in a vicious cycle in which slow economic development makes it difficult for them to broaden their tax base no matter hard they try .  
Q : As you yourself have mentioned , underworld figures often launder their public image by getting involved in politics , and it is extremely difficult to do anything about it . Previous Justice Ministers Liao Cheng-hao and Ma Ying-jeou both had excellent reputations as able and incorruptible men , yet neither was able to overcome the influence of black gold . It almost looks like " mission impossible . " Do you feel confident of your ability to carry out this mission ?  
The construction budget for the new terminal at CKS Airport , which opened in July , included a public art allocation of NT $ 100 million . Deciding how to handle this huge sum proved a difficult task for the project 's executive committee . Many people questioned whether public art has to be limited to the installation of permanent " works of art . "  
The muscles which join their wings to their thoraxes are well developed , and they can beat their front and rear wings separately to control their direction of flight . Most dragonflies can perform the highly difficult maneuvers of flying backwards or straight upwards , and a few of them can even fly across oceans to make long-distance seasonal migrations .  
With their powerful wings , insects of the order Odonata can spread far and wide . Hence , compared with other insects , which have differentiated in response to specific environments , the proportion of endemic species among Taiwan 's dragonflies is not high . The island has only a third as many dragonfly species as butterfly species , and most were recorded by the middle of the 20th century . Lively dragonflies are easy to spot , but observing their lives in detail is more difficult .  
As for the Taiwan red cypress-merihi in Japanese-it is even more magnificent in appearance than the Taiwan yellow cypress . But the Taiwan red cypress 's trunk is often divided , and because it mostly grows in wet river valleys the heartwood is prone to be eaten away by bacteria , producing strangely tangled hollow trees . The crown is also broad and difficult to cut .  
" They live mixed in with greater crested terns , and this makes them really difficult to pick out . But in our film they do show up very clearly , " says Liang Chieh-te , who was commissioned to film greater crested terns by the Lienchiang County Government . The greater crested tern is around 45 centimeters long . Its most distinctive features are that it has a forked tail like a swallow , a crest of black feathers on its head rather like a Mohican haircut , and a yellow beak .  
Apex 's major product at the moment , the alternating pressure pump mattress , is aimed at preventing bedsores , a real nightmare for bedridden patients . Bedsores result from hard mattresses causing parts of the body that bear the most weight ( such as the buttocks and the shoulders ) to be deprived of oxygen and consequently suffer necrosis ( i.e . tissue death ) . This is accompanied by ulceration , suppuration and infestation , from which recovery is very difficult .  
He filmed 20 60-minute tapes and produced the first edited version of the documentary , which was full of sadness . Laway admits his own mood made it difficult for him to get past tragic facts : " Afterwards , I realized this is not the natural temperament of the Amis people , so I re-edited it , creating this more optimistic version . " Laway immediately took the finished product to share with the Amis of Talu-an .  
Understanding the structure of the universe is a long-standing dream of astronomers . In the past our understanding of cosmic structure was based on little more than theoretical speculation . Before 1990 , it was difficult to test the plethora of cosmological theories being put forward by a growing number of brilliant theorists .  
Chen 's real worry is that state-run opera troupes , which are the dominant force in mainland China 's gezai xi , may no longer be so good at extemporaneous adaptation , and it may be difficult for different troupes to develop their own unique styles . After all , the performers earn a fixed salary , use standardized scripts , and sing a set repertoire of songs .  
In this showdown between political organizations , the ambitions and maneuverings of the most prominent party aristocrats are also getting considerable exposure . Looking at the structure of Taiwan 's voting population , at bottom the ratio of 60% blue vs . 40% green is quite firmly established , and parties on both sides are finding it difficult to make inroads into the other camp .  
Taiwan farmers found it increasingly difficult to compete against mainland China pork on the Japanese market . Adding insult to injury , smuggled pigs brought hoof-and-mouth to Taiwan in 1996 , dealing another heavy blow to Taiwan 's livestock industry . The government issued almost NT $ 1 billion in subsidies to 6,667 farmers that agricultural agencies succeeded in encouraging to leave the livestock industry . Taiwan 's 14 million pig population was chopped in half almost overnight .  
In the past there was also an enormous difference between the simple content of elementary school courses and the difficult and dry content of junior high school courses . In future , courses will be designed with continuity from first to ninth grade , and there will no longer be such a break between elementary and junior high school .  
" The integrated curriculum should not be too disruptive for elementary schools , " says Ou Yung-sheng , because the subject divisions in elementary schools were already very broad , and their teaching arrangements are generally close to a single " class teacher " system , with one teacher teaching several different subjects . Therefore integrating the subjects should not be too difficult .  
According to interpretations of the Avatamsaka Sutra , our universe is formed of pearl-like individual objects strung together in a net , so that it is difficult to separate what is real from what is illusion ; past , present , and future exist side-by-side ; and no individual can exist in isolation . As a result , people should live in the present , embrace goodness and do good deeds , so that the universe will tend toward harmony .  
Over the past half century , the dominant thinking in Taiwan has been " the economy comes first . " Today the government is changing tack , adopting " sustainable management . " Although this is difficult to implement-even more challenging , in fact , given the need to maintain competitiveness amidst a global downturn-it is essential .  
Although the government has now decided to move in the direction of liberalization , the numerous " technical issues " that remain continue to make difficult any easing of the current political impasse . Proposals to allow " three links , " to permit Taiwanese firms to invest in semiconductor or upstream petrochemicals production in China , to allow Chinese capital and workers into Taiwan , and even to establish a free port that would make it easier to bring semi-finished goods from China to Taiwan for processing , still remain just that : proposals .  
If it is easy to find a free e-paper that is similar , or if the readers do n't really need the content , it is difficult to achieve the level of appeal required to collect fees , " says Hsu . But it can be done . Currently , e-papers at PChome that do the best with subscriber fees are for language learning and industrial reports . The publication with the most subscribers is iThome , a computer report , with about 10,000 .  
After millions of years of wind and sea erosion , many of the pillars on the basalt islands have been worn down and are now covered with mud . More recently , human activity has made it difficult to distinguish what is so interesting about these basalt islands . Only by approaching cliffs near the edge of the sea or visiting uninhabited peripheral islands can one clearly see the basalt columns with their vertical fractures running from top to bottom .  
The 23-kilometer-long old Mountain Line was built in 1908 , early in the Japanese colonial era . Trains on this line began by winding through the precipices of Sanyi Rural Township , and from there cut through mountains and crossed rivers . This was the last north-south line in western Taiwan to be completed , and the most difficult stretch of track from an engineering point of view , with nine tunnels and three bridges .  
Actually , as an island , Taiwan has always had an international economy . But China is growing bigger every day and cross-strait political tensions remain unresolved . Within Taiwan , the " globalist , " " China " and " Taiwan-first " factions all read this situation differently and their responses to it have been anything but compatible . In fact , they are often at cross-purposes , and the resulting confusion has made it still more difficult for Taiwan to chart a course for the future .  
From the moment they say " I do , " they should be ready in their hearts and willing to take the bad along with the good . Why is it , then , that today 's couples , free to choose their partners , find it so difficult to honor their vows ? Some find it impossible to deal with hardship , and others , even after struggling to make it through a difficult stretch , are somehow unable to enjoy the sweet yields of their struggle .  
Tsao Fu-yung admits frankly that this was a very difficult task . " Just think , we 'd all been in Chinese opera for so long that we had long since grown accustomed to the Peking Opera style of singing , speaking and moving . Now we had to put all that aside and start again with a completely new face-but none of us was at all sure what that new face was supposed to be , and even now we 're still feeling our way forward . "  
Of particular importance are these few sentences that capture the essence of Dan 's thinking : " It 's naturally difficult to search for nothing , yet when the substance is clearly defined you see the emptiness . It 's impossible to paint the spirit , yet when reality is reduced to its essence the spirit will be revealed . A painting that is chaotic and busy is largely superfluous . Only when emptiness and reality are arranged properly will the idea of the picture extend beyond the painting . "  
In a society where " information equals power , " it is apparent that the gulfs between urban and rural , rich and poor will be increasingly difficult to traverse . Disparities in digital technology accordingly will become one of the world 's most controversial issues .  
Apart from uneven levels of quality , the main reason why alternative medicine is not welcomed by the regulatory authorities or mainstream medical practitioners is that it is difficult or impossible to test the effectiveness of alternative treatments by scientific methods .  
The reason is simple : " Because plants do not grow for us to eat them . " The cell structure of most biological materials is very durable , and not easily broken down . Therefore it is difficult for the matter inside to be released , much less absorbed into the human body .  
Chen feels that leaving white space is more difficult to master than the actual artwork , because all that space can easily end up looking excessive , or even downright vacant . That is why he is so careful about blank space . Besides , white and black are two of his favorite colors .  
The most common complaint for children is respiratory infections . This is because local residents have not yet learned to pay close attention to public health norms . People spit wherever they want , while the houses let in little sunlight and have poor ventilation , so children are much more likely to get infected and it is correspondingly difficult to cure them .  
Chen Chin-chin , principal of Taichung Industrial High School , feels the technical and vocational education system , an alternative to the usual route through high school and then college and sometimes referred to as the " second track , " was very difficult to set up in the first place and that it is an integral part of the nation 's wellbeing . So , how can one talk lightly about abolishing it ?  
" There are some battered foreign brides who loathe Taiwanese and think all Taiwanese are evil , and even distrust the social workers themselves , " says Vietnamese-born Sister Mei of the Good Shepherd Sisters . Current law stipulates that even foreign brides who have legal residence must return home if they get divorced , without the possibility of taking their children with them . This last point is very difficult to bear and they frequently feel the social workers are unwilling to help them .  
" In our more than ten years of service we have been deeply moved by the unfortunate situation created by international marriages . The harm and lasting effects on women and children is truly frightful and difficult to gauge accurately , " says Sister Therese Tang , executive director of the Good Shepherd Sisters Social Welfare Services Foundation . The government should set up an appropriate system of preventative measures , she says , but in the end , family problems must be solved by the families themselves .  
The mainland is a massive country , and the distance between urban areas is huge . Profits from distribution and retailing of books and magazines are small , even though the ' planned economy ' is gradually being dismantled , and soon it will be far too difficult to set up a wide-ranging logistics and shipping network . Because of this , some publishers are choosing not to sell through bookstores , instead looking for an alternative way , facing their own technological difficulties on the way .  
In order to strengthen the tuberculosis treatment network , the Department of Health has made preliminary plans to use Taipei 's Hospital for Chronic Diseases , Taoyuan Hospital , Taichung Hospital , the Center for Chest Disease , and Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital as diagnostic referral centers for northern , central , and southern Taiwan , accepting TB patients who have been diagnosed at regular hospitals or whose disease is proving difficult to treat .  
Intending to prevent a recurrence of Bunun resistance and because it was difficult to keep the garrison roads in good repair in the deep mountain areas , the Japanese government went a step further and forced a mass displacement of the Bunun down the mountain to the lower reaches of the Lakulaku River on the Huatung Valley plain . Through contact with the Han Chinese and the Amis people living there , the unique characteristics of Bunun mountain culture were gradually lost .  
Perhaps because Yushan is located in the most remote part of Taiwan 's mountainous regions , and access is difficult , it has largely escaped deforestation , with the exception of the cypress forests of the Nantsaihsien River , which were completely logged out , and outlying areas such as Tungpu and Tataka . The core areas in the center of the national park still boast virgin forests and a vibrant ecology .  
Architecture has long been a most regrettable , unbecoming shortcoming of the " beautiful island " of Taiwan . Shop signs sticking out all over the place , iron window grates plastered all over buildings , and shacks willy-nilly sprouting on rooftops-an architectural crazy quilt more post-modern than post-modern , in " immigrant makeshift " style . People from overseas have a difficult time describing Taiwan cities as " beautiful . " The best they can manage is " unusual . "  
" What 's original with me is that after folding the wing into a very normal flat shape , I improved the structure by further folding the wings into triangle shapes that attached to the middle of the fuselage . Finally , there is the square fold of a stabilizer wing beneath the fuselage . That was the most difficult part .  
The body 's immune responses to these germs-cell-mediated immunity , which is called " type 1 immune response , " and the " type 2 immune response , " known as humoral immunity-are mutually antagonistic . This can result in imbalances , much like when the police deploy all their forces to catch a big criminal and end up letting small-time thieves slip through the net . To an allergic person 's immune system , finding the right balance is as difficult as it is for a seesaw to stay horizontal with children on it .  
" They are always so happy , though , just because I 'm doing the shopping and preparing meals for them , " Day says . Filial piety is n't difficult ; one just needs to cater to another 's pleasures . His father , for example , loves to eat a traditional salted pork dish , so Day practiced until he learned the techniques for making it , mastering each step , from choosing the right cut of meat to the actual cooking and dressing of the meat .  
Biomechanical imbalances can be corrected and a comfortable gait achieved by inserting an arch or spacer in the shoe . The second group have lost the feeling in their feet due to nerve damage , so that they may be injured without realizing it if they bump into things , making them very prone to infection . This group has grown substantially in recent years . Diabetics are particularly difficult to deal with , because their wounds are slow to heal .  
Regular shoes are designed to fit normally arched feet . However , because the soles of flat feet are insufficiently arched , making it difficult to maintain a solid footing , it is best for people with flat feet to add an arch support when exercising , as this will reduce the chance of soreness .  
After these decorative lines are dry , they spray on a layer of yellow paint , and then add gold leaf . Before applying the gold leaf , they 've got to first apply some glue designed for that purpose : " You 've got to precisely control the time that the gold leaf glue dries , because that will affect on the quality of the gold leaf . If it 's too wet , it 's difficult to spread evenly ; if it 's too dry , it wo n't stick . "  
In the era of the knowledge-based economy , ideas are the ultimate source of profits . However , Hsu has observed that Taiwanese children growing up under the rigid educational system have lost out on many opportunities for hands-on learning and learning by doing , making it very difficult to spark creative ideas .  
Chen Chung believes that the small cultivated plots of traditional farming make it difficult to use efficient , labor-saving technologies and thus hinder competitiveness in international markets . The usual remedy for this has been even further exploitation of the land , and as Chen Chung points out with a pained expression , " the result was heavy use of pesticides and fertilizers , increased soil depletion , and environmental pollution . "  
The thrifty gene theory hypothesizes that because of harsh living conditions in Asian countries during ancient times , individuals with a genetic endowment that enabled them to more efficiently store fat as a hedge against times when food was scarce were more likely to survive the natural selection process to reproduce . Now , though the environment has improved and food is no longer difficult to obtain , the thrifty gene continues to exert its effect , with the result that the person easily accumulates body fat and becomes obese-an important risk factor for diabetes .  
" While the adjustments may be difficult for a time , these crises will pass , " he said , stressing that " stronger individual economies and a more robust and efficient international economic and financial system will surely emerge in their wake "  
He said he is extremely pleased with the fact that the financial situation in ROK has reached a major turning point in its most difficult period and attributed the success to the efforts of the ROK government and people He expressed hope that ROK will overcome current difficulties and regain economic vitality at the earliest possible date  
He noted that the lack of meaningful developments to date , while disappointing , had to be seen in the context of the difficult and fundamental changes taking place in the economic , social and political areas of the countries concerned .  
They have had the difficult task of providing subsidized loans to risky ventures and inefficient public enterprises , which often has forced Governments to recapitalize them with financial transfers from an already overburdened government budget .  
Past mediation efforts have been shown to be insufficient because they were limited by a mandate lacking firmness , but also rendered more difficult by the diverse political interests of individual external forces .  
This greatly complicates the future of these countries as they attempt to solve by themselves the difficult economic , political , psychological , cultural and historical problems that they have inherited from the recent past .  
Such strategies are however dangerous and difficult to reverse : surplus fishing vessels , once established in a fishery , may be difficult to displace , with limited alternative incomeearning opportunities , and a loss in economic yield will certainly occur .  
Although reliable data are scarce , it is known that the phenomenon of children in especially difficult circumstances is increasing rapidly as a result of adverse economic conditions , civil conflicts and rapid growth and impoverishment of urban centres .  
It has proved exceedingly difficult to curb the growing tendency of subsidiary bodies to meet on an annual basis , despite an existing legislative mandate for biennial sessions .  
It will be a difficult task to bring about national reconciliation , to reconstruct the destroyed physical infrastructure and to lay the ground for a return to normal life for all citizens traumatized by a civil war with unprecedented massacres .  
The difficult socioeconomic conditions , exacerbated by deteriorating and fluctuating terms of trade , external indebtedness and political instability , which induce internal , regional and international migrations ;  
Promoting the socioeconomic status of disadvantaged ethnic , cultural , occupational or religious groups is also difficult owing to a lack of effective and acceptable means of intervention .  
The deplorable living conditions in many urban areas of the world , coupled with the rapidly deteriorating quality of life in others , posed difficult obstacles to successful crime prevention .  
The Committee was also informed that the existing logistics support base at Split was overloaded and difficult to manage , and that it could not be expanded for additional use without incurring additional costs , such as rental and refurbishment of premises .  
The establishment of an international criminal court involved many complex and difficult issues , such as jurisdiction , applicable law , court structure , prosecution and other matters which must be addressed with utmost care .  The meeting rose at 1.10 p.m .  
The difficult question of the qualifications of the judges ( art . 6 ) was handled well , although it was regrettable that a rigid distinction was drawn between judges with criminal trial experience and judges with recognized competence in international law .  
Although the implementation of economic , social and cultural rights might be expensive and difficult , they should be promoted on an equal basis with civil and political rights .  
When combined with the prevailing culture and political calculation , the cult of performance and the cult of instant satisfaction make it difficult to sustain the constant and patient efforts that are needed for development and social progress .  
As the international community is aware , the Agreement signed at Chapultepec , Mexico , in January 1992 put an end to the armed conflict in El Salvador , marking the conclusion of the first phase of the peace process but the beginning of a complex and difficult period of transition during which the commitments made served as the framework for a developing political , economic and social process , which we are convinced will culminate in the consolidation of democracy . 
Having taken up his difficult and demanding tasks at a particularly important time in the history of the United Nations , Mr . Boutros-Ghali has shown himself , throughout his term of office , to be not only an outstanding intellectual capable of theorizing and conceptualizing problems and of thinking before acting , but also a man of action capable of taking timely decisions on the most difficult issues that every day come before the chief executive of the United Nations .  
We know how difficult was the road leading to the establishment of lasting peace in view of the level of distrust and the acute , accumulated suffering involved .  
We are aware that we have set ourselves a difficult task as a region , but there is no alternative to this path of collective self-reliance if our region is to survive in the current competitive international economic environment .  
While we call upon Iraq to respond fully to the behests of international legality , we must voice our concern over the territorial integrity , sovereignty and unity of Iraq which must be preserved and express sympathy with the brotherly Iraqi people who endure difficult economic and social conditions that should end once their causes cease to exist .  
The Islamic Republic of Mauritania which , since 1984 , has been engaged in a determined battle that aims at restructuring the Mauritanian economy despite difficult domestic , regional and international conditions , has made tangible progress towards restoring the macroeconomic balance and reducing its foreign debt , a fact that is attested to by international financial institutions . 
For its part , and despite its difficult economic and financial conditions , Cameroon , like other developing countries and African ones in particular , confirming its political will and joining in the expansion of the lofty ideals of the United Nations , recently paid up nearly all its arrears in contributions due the Organization .  
El Salvador experienced one of the most severe , complex and difficult crises in Central America in the second half of this century in the 1980s , to be precise , when a military and political conflict began and went on for 12 years .  
Recognizing that it is primarily responsible for its own development , and in keeping with commitments entered into under UN-NADAF , Africa has recently become involved in far-reaching and difficult reforms designed to accelerate the process of democratization , promote human rights and achieve economic , social and cultural development , in a climate of transparency and with the active participation of all positive forces .  
Indeed , since 1990 official development assistance for Africa has continued to decline , and direct foreign investment remains weak in a very difficult international situation characterized by fierce trade competition , which the Uruguay Round agreements have made even more onerous for the African countries . 
Aware of the possible tragic consequences for the entire population of that country that an increase in tension and violence could have , the High Commissioner decided to write to the interim President to express his support for all those who during that difficult period were working for tolerance and mutual understanding .  
In its statement at the International Conference on Population and Development , held in Cairo in 1994 , the Central African Republic commented on the country 's unequal spatial distribution and rapid urban growth , which was difficult to manage and had led to social and cultural crises .  
This important event is a worthy culmination of Mozambique 's progress along the difficult road to peace and consent and has marked the end of a lengthy period of destructive internecine conflict that brought untold suffering to the people of that country .  
The deployment of the Multinational Force in Haiti , on 19 September 1994 , represented the first phase in the international community 's delicate and difficult undertaking to restore to office the democratically elected Government of President Aristide and to assist that Government in the economic , social and institutional reconstruction of its devastated country .  
Although the Marriage Act had been designed to ensure equal treatment for men and women , in reality , women sometimes found themselves in difficult financial circumstances after a divorce ; that eventuality was however covered by the social security system , and if necessary it was also possible to obtain a living allowance from the municipal authority .  
It was noted that while , generally speaking , the International Law Commission was justified in finding it difficult to impose an equivalent obligation on States parties for crimes under international law in articles 20 , subparagraphs ( b ) to ( d ) , in the absence of a secure jurisdictional basis or a widely accepted extradition regime , the basis of the aut dedere aut judicare obligation was not the treaties referred to in article 20 , subparagraph ( e ) , but article 54 of the statute itself .  
Expressing deep concern at the immense human suffering and loss of life which have accompanied recent crises involving refugee flows and other forced displacements , as well as the magnitude and complexity of current refugee problems , which have made more difficult the accomplishment of the High Commissioner 's crucial functions of ensuring international protection for refugees and achieving timely and durable solutions to their plight ,  
Deeply concerned also about the serious consequences of the presence of refugees and externally displaced persons for the already difficult economic and social situation in Djibouti , which is suffering from prolonged drought and the negative effects of the critical situation in the Horn of Africa ,  
Few impediments to progress are more implacable and emotional than that of Israeli settlers who both remain in and continue to settle the occupied territories , and that this could be supported by the Israeli Government in full knowledge of the ultimate and unavoidable consequences is difficult to believe when there is plainly a direct correlation between the violence in the occupied territories and the continued expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank . 
Although in a letter dated 9 February addressed to MINUGUA , the URNG command denied responsibility for the incident and stated its determination to fulfil these commitments , there is reason to believe that the shot came from URNG lines , although it is true that the proximity of the fighting makes it difficult to judge whether the shot was intentional . 
The vast majority of cases involving death have not been adequately investigated or resolved by the competent authorities , and this increases levels of impunity , promoting a widespread feeling of insecurity among the public , and makes it more difficult to distinguish violations of the right to life which could be classified as human rights violations from common crimes without a political motive .  
Although endowed with more sophisticated capacity and resources than others , the Institute has found it difficult at this late stage to adapt quickly to the needs of the land programme , especially as most of its previous experience related to titling of housing in urban areas in which there was a fairly reliable registry and census of properties and relatively easy access .  
However , the principle that harm which does not entail economic loss should be compensated is not a new absolute in law , as can be seen in the universal acceptance , in domestic and international law , of compensation for moral injury , which is as difficult to evaluate in monetary terms as ecological harm .  
It has required , for example , that UNDP continue to adjust and focus its programmes in the countries it serves , shifting its work upstream to broad policies and programmes , reducing the proliferation of isolated projects and addressing difficult goals such as providing the poor with decent jobs and even difficult concepts like good governance and implementation capacity . 
At the recently concluded nineteenth session of the Staff-Management Coordinating Committee ( SMCC ) held at Amman , Jordan , both management and staff representatives had acknowledged that it had been difficult in the past to keep track of the time which staff representatives devoted to staff activities , and had reached agreement on what constituted " a reasonable amount of time " for staff representatives at all levels in the nine major duty stations effectively to discharge their responsibilities .  
In this difficult moment , I wish to express my Government 's full solidarity with the UNPROFOR forces , particularly with the courageous Dutch soldiers operating in the Srebrenica territory , sharing the hardships of the civilian population they are protecting and facing overwhelmingly superior forces .  
At the social level , conditions of life are very difficult , characterized by poor nutrition as a result of low purchasing power , poor health , with widespread diseases such as tuberculosis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , inadequate educational facilities and limited qualified manpower .  
This step taken by the international community following the signing by the Government and UNITA of the Lusaka Protocol , the new instrument setting forth the legal framework for the country 's transition from war to peace , gave a major boost to the peace process and helped curtail initial pessimism as did the positive unfolding of such a difficult and complex process , shrouded at first in a climate of deeply held mutual mistrust and hostility rooted in a long , destructive war .  
The requested reclassifications of three General Service ( Other level ) posts to the Principal level would provide recognition of the additional and difficult functions assigned to very senior staff who have acquired considerable knowledge and experience of a highly complex pension system . 
In drafting the resolution that the Council adopted a few moments ago , it proved particularly difficult to find words adequately to express the real indignation over the lamentable fact that troops of the peace-keeping forces with which the international community is trying generously to help the parties to resolve their conflicts a generosity not adequately reciprocated lost their lives as a result of deliberate action by members of one of these parties .  
The challenge we face is therefore enormous because it is quick , easy and cheap to lay mines , whereas clearing them is expensive , difficult and dangerous .  
To that end , the Ministers emphasized the need for concerted action in the region against the spread of extremism , which exploited the noble and sacred values of their peoples , and against arms proliferation and drug trafficking , and for swift implementation of the measures to combat those problems adopted at the meeting on regional security held at Bamako on 22 and 23 August 1994 .  16 .  The Ministers noted with concern the difficult economic situation in their countries .  
One of the main reasons for the failure is the palliative attitude towards the difficult situation in the Balkans and marginal attention dedicated to preventive actions and to the development of good-neighbourly relations based on mutual respect and equality .  
The humanitarian situation , which is particularly difficult , the observance of human rights , which can neither be renounced nor evaded , and the capacity of the local police to be effective , impartial and professional , are all important issues which must be addressed , on a priority basis , and for which we will also support efforts to show the commitment and the support of the international community .  
However , while developed countries already possess the infrastructure and crucial knowledge required in mustering the necessary resources and maximizing their efficiency and effectiveness , developing countries and countries in transition are found in the very difficult position of easily being outpaced by organized criminal groups .  
The subject was put before the leadership for a second time two years ago by the President of the Republic , but the country 's difficult circumstances , particularly the anomalous situation in northern Iraq , which was subjected to quasi-occupation by the Coalition forces , caused the leadership to delay the matter until the sanctions were lifted and the situation in the north was restored to normal .

NULLThe events described above , coupled with other political and military developments within the Republic of Croatia and the contiguous territories of the former Yugoslavia , as well as the frequently declared intention of the Croatian authorities to recover lost territories by other means if negotiations did not succeed , made it very difficult to resume meaningful negotiations and bring them to a successful conclusion .  
The frequent lack of adequate presence in areas where there are internally displaced populations , combined with insufficient understanding of what internal displacement means , has often made it difficult to know the numbers of internally displaced populations and their specific assistance , protection and development needs .  
Although some of the problems raised , such as remuneration of personnel employed in peace-keeping operations and more extensive use of United Nations Volunteers is of concern to JIU and are actually reflected in its report on staffing of the United Nations peace-keeping and related missions ( civilian component ) ( JIU / REP / 93 / 6 ) , it is difficult to make any substantive comments without access to the original records .  
As a result of the sanctions , it has become increasingly difficult to satisfy minimum existential needs , especially in the case of the unemployed , the employed with low income and family income below a social minimum , pensioners with low pensions and family incomes , families with children , elderly rural households , etc .  
Preschool institutions , homes for children deprived of parental care , disabled children and youth institutions for juvenile delinquents , are also in an increasingly difficult material situation , manifested by a poor quality of food and a considerable decline of standards , including poor hygienic standards , insufficient heating , inadequate maintenance , the impossibility to keep facilities and equipment in proper repair .  
In the situation when the levels of earnings and the standard of living are very low , when even the basic needs for food , accommodation and clothing are difficult to meet , it is more and more difficult for the citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to devote attention to environmental quality and protection .  
The reform seeks to introduce a professionalized and efficient first-level appeal system to replace the current volunteer system which , in an era of increasing management accountability for programme delivery coupled with declining resources and an increasing number of cases , makes it difficult to attract sufficient experienced and qualified staff to discharge these vital functions .  
The Working Group is convinced that , without a long-term strategy benefiting from the effective contribution of all the players , first States and then the international organizations and non-governmental organizations concerned , it is difficult to envisage , even in the more or less distant future , the attainment of so ambitious an objective as universal enjoyment of the right to development .  
Although concrete results have been reached over the past few years in improving the technical infrastructure at the Palais des Nations , the physical distribution of buildings and the relative autonomy of many Secretariat organizational units located in Geneva , made it difficult for the Electronic Services Section of the United Nations Office at Geneva to provide the increasing amount of services required .  
Noting also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation , and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
In that connection , the incapacity of the newly independent States which had emerged from the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to discharge their financial obligations was attributable not only to their extremely difficult social and economic situation , but above all to the fact that the rates of assessment recommended by the Committee on Contributions in 1992 were unfair and excessive compared with their real capacity to pay .  
The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , for its part , had paid its assessed contribution up to the end of the current year , despite the difficult economic circumstances it was suffering ; those difficulties , as everyone knew , had been considerably worsened by the consequences of the embargo and unjust sanctions imposed by the Security Council .  
United States government civilian employees assigned overseas may receive a taxable post differential of up to 25 per cent of basic salary for posting to duty stations where " extraordinarily difficult or notably unhealthful conditions or excessive physical hardships " exist .  
also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation , and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
of the Committee would recall the difficult discussions which had taken place at recent major multilateral trade and economic negotiations on measures to preserve cultural industries and the provisions made in some documents , such as those of the Copenhagen Summit , requiring that liberalized and multifaceted economic actions , including structural adjustment , should be tempered by prudent considerations which reflected the concern to minimize the harm which could be caused to the populations to which they would be applied .  
With respect to the recommendation of the Advisory Committee that the conversion of some temporary posts to permanent posts should be deferred , he said it was difficult to demand a high level of efficiency from the Centre when significant new mandates had been assigned to it without commensurate human and financial resources .  
was not mere rhetorical emphasis to say that the developing countries - regardless of their good will and sense of responsibility - faced a difficult choice between paying their debts to the Organization or attending to their own basic needs .  
Social trust can be increased , however difficult it may be to achieve consensus among those who have been combatants , through a predictable legal system , based on the rule of law , in which everyone can engage in social and economic activities knowing that a fair , impartial and predictable system of adjudication awaits any disputes .  
The causes are as well-known as they are difficult to resolve : double standards ; lack of democracy , of public information and transparency ; informal consultations and secret lobbying ; the obsolete veto power ; and the threat of the veto , which has become an even more dangerous and unacceptable instrument because the consequences of using it are not publicly assumed .  
The negative consequences of such a threat could lead to greater destruction of Lebanon 's infrastructure and reverse the efforts of its Government and people to rebuild all that was destroyed in the civil war , which was a terrible burden on the Lebanese people , who faced the horrors of destruction throughout an extremely difficult and confused period of Lebanon 's modern history . 
It is difficult for us to see how the firing of Katyusha rockets by Hezbollah into northern Israel , condemnable as it is , can be equated with the Israeli artillery bombardments , sea and air attacks and other missile attacks directed at the civilian populations in Lebanese villages , towns and cities , resulting in many deaths , enormous suffering and extensive destruction of property .  
The Committee identified as major factors and difficulties in implementing the Convention : the weak State machinery to effectively maintain the peace process ; the difficult process of national reconciliation ; the breakdown of public infrastructure and private support systems ; the large number of Rwandan refugees and internally displaced persons ; the great number of militias and some civilians who are still armed ; and the shattered economy and extreme poverty .  
Though caught in the vortex of the complex and fluctuating international situation surrounding the Korean peninsula , the Korean people have been able to march forward continuously along the road to socialism which they themselves chose without any vacillation , disappointment or vicissitude , despite the fact that on an untrodden and poorly paved path , every step is difficult .  
Although the international community has succeeded , by dint of serious negotiations , in resolving many difficult problems and has achieved important results in many sensitive areas through the establishment of the World Trade Organization , we are still concerned by the continuing practice of trade protectionism , which runs counter to our belief in the importance of allowing market forces to play their natural role in economic affairs .  
That is why in many African countries today Governments continue with determination to carry out bold and difficult reforms , reflected , inter alia , in the improved and more rational use of public funds , in the opening of our economies to international trade and in the creation of conditions conducive to private enterprise and to the transparent management of public affairs with , most importantly , all sectors of society participating in the work of national development , in the interests of all .  
It is difficult to persevere in the face of harsh and unjustified criticism and insufficient financial resources while engaged in the complex task of revitalizing the United Nations to meet the needs of a world in rapid transformation .  
Despite this difficult situation , Zaire has made it a point of honour to pursue its democratic process , committing itself to reestablishing the authority of the State , rebuilding the basic infrastructure , improving the country 's economic , financial and monetary situation , ensuring the security of persons and property and observing human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
He has provided dedicated leadership at a particularly difficult time in the history of the United Nations , enduring often unwarranted personal criticism even as he was operating in a situation of diminishing resources on the one hand , and escalating , often conflicting , expectations on the other hand .  
The dynamic and extraordinary manner in which Mr . Boutros Boutros-Ghali has accomplished his mission as Secretary-General in difficult circumstances of financial constraints and wars within and among Nations , and his fostering of social and economic development , has earned our sincere gratitude .  
The commitment that we undertook at the 1990 World Summit therefore represented a challenge that we had to accept in extremely difficult circumstances , since we entered the decade in the midst of a deep economic crisis with reduced resources , an oppressive external debt and great demands and needs for social services .  
Moreover , it is precisely in situations requiring difficult choices that the objectives , commitments and Programme of Action adopted in Copenhagen can be given specific meaning , despite various obstacles which limit the leeway of decision makers .  The objectives and commitments of the world social Summit can be inconvenient in practice , or can conflict with other priorities at the local , regional and international levels .  
Since this initiative came to the General Assembly for the first time as a result of Nicaragua 's urgent needs in 1990 at the end of its decade-long armed conflict and of its starting on the path to democracy and economic and social development , we have seen emergency assistance to be a temporary but very effective mechanism to help resolve the difficult problems of transition .  
For our part , we have carefully analyzed our position in the light of the views expressed so far in the discussions and we will soon present our considerations in the form of an informal position paper , which will elaborate on our previously presented views concerning the most important aspects of the Security Council 's future , including one of the most difficult among them : the issue of the size of the Council and the allocation of newly created seats . 
Seemingly intractable , age-old problems have witnessed dramatic developments , stability and economic development .  As my Minister for Foreign Affairs has stated , the Government of Angola is profoundly concerned by the difficult social and economic situation prevailing in the Republic of Cuba as a result of the financial and economic blockade imposed on that member of the General Assembly .  
I am confident that this session of the General Assembly will live up to the expectations of Governments and the hopes of peoples : that all of us will take a new step in humankind 's difficult transition towards a world united in its diversity , a world that is open to universal economic and spiritual development , a world that promises security and stability a world in which States cooperate on an equal footing .  
It should be unconscionable that financial flows to Africa remain so low despite renewed commitments by the international community to the contrary , and even more so when the majority of African countries have undertaken difficult and unpopular structural adjustment programmes that have marginalized the poor further , depleted natural resources and degraded the environment .  
In our endeavours to face the challenges of humanitarian assistance in emergency situations , the role of the United Nations is of utmost importance in providing a proper framework for effective coordination when the international community is called upon to address difficult problems emerging from natural disasters or other phenomena of a complex nature .  
Since 1991 , official development assistance for Africa has been shrinking , and direct foreign investments remain weak in a very difficult international context that is marked by a fierce commercial competition that the Uruguay agreements have made even more onerous for the African countries .  
President , I have long admired the imagination and determination you have brought to the difficult challenges of multilateral diplomacy , and I should like to express my appreciation for the leadership you have demonstrated in taking the General Assembly through its demanding schedule to an efficient and productive conclusion .  
There may be no other single individual who has been as instrumental or as effective in leading the world community in recent years in the difficult search for common ground , particularly on issues relating to environmentally sustainable development .  
It is clear that the difficult , and at times unfavourable , economic situation faced by many developing countries and countries with economies in transition , the dwindling resources allocated by the international donor community for official development assistance ( ODA ) , and unfavourable internal conditions need to be fully addressed in order to successfully implement reproductive health programmes and to reach the goal of reproductive health by the year 2015 .  
Although the Security Council meets far away from the scene of the events we are discussing today , and although we are not subject to the difficulties faced by the people in the field , I believe it is important that the personnel of the United Nations civilian and military should be aware of our solidarity with them and understanding of the difficult tasks and living conditions that they have to face .  
Perhaps 80 per cent of global exposure to particulate air pollution occurs indoors in developing countries and a disproportionate share of exposure to this serious health hazard is borne by women who do the cooking and by children who are indoors with their mothers .  This extremely difficult situation in the developing world is to a very large extent the result of relatively low consumption of modern commercial energy .  
The representative of Norway had said that one of the most difficult challenges facing the international community was the question of ensuring respect for the rights of persons belonging to ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities , while guaranteeing the territorial integrity and political independence of States .  
The basic reasons for the rising divorce rate were the overall situation of political and economic instability , low incomes , difficult living conditions and environmental problems , and inadequate nutrition for children .  
In the specific area of the advancement of women , the emphasis would be placed on reinforcing women 's economic power , power-sharing between men and women , improving access to social services , raising their legal status through reform of the civil codes , reinforcing their role in the culture of peace , supporting women in particularly difficult circumstances and promoting and protecting the girl child .  
It is particularly difficult to apply meaningfully when the respondent is asked to express a value for many functions of the forest that have no established monetary market value , such as provision of cleaner water , which might become available in a hypothetical set of circumstances , such as through reduction in upstream harvesting activities . 
It will be difficult for those who must daily face a lack of the basic necessities of life to commit themselves to a democratic system unless it brings about a genuine improvement in their low standard of living .  
Noting also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
Concerned about the continuing difficult situation of Palestinian women in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , and about the severe consequences of continuous Israeli illegal settlements activities , as well as the harsh economic conditions and other consequences for the situation of Palestine women and their families , resulting from the frequent closure and isolation of the occupied territory ,  
If it was difficult to give proper treatment in an ordinary detention centre , or if a special or a long-term treatment was required , a patient would be sent to special detention institutions where sufficient medical treatment was available .  
We are addressing ourselves to you , Mr . Secretary-General , in the difficult and critical circumstances in which we find ourselves , in order to assure you once again that we reject and condemn the policy of blockade and closure being pursued by the Government of Israel and to convey to you our extreme displeasure and great concern at the dire consequences the blockade measures are having and at the ongoing closures that have been imposed by Israel on the entire Palestinian people in the areas subject to the Palestinian National Authority . 
As one form of outreach , set up special advisory centres for women and the girl child who might be in trouble or in difficult or irregular situations , including those involved in drug abuse or illicit trafficking , those engaged in prostitution and pornography , runaways , street children , the homeless and those experiencing psychological difficulties or trauma ;  
The possibility that public awareness , educational or other material designed to prevent or reduce illicit demand may draw attention to the availability and means of abuse of prohibited drugs within certain segments of the population is a difficult issue that remains to be resolved .  
Quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of the Basel Convention remains difficult , largely because of a lack of reliable data related to hazardous waste generation ; an absence of comparable data between national authorities ; the absence of accurate baseline data for reported global trade in hazardous wastes ; lack of clear definitions of wastes considered to be " hazardous " ; and the absence of one major industrialized country and several developing countries as parties to the Convention .  
At the same time , we wish to stress our belief that a complete and absolute solution to the problem of extremism and terrorism is linked to bringing an end to the unfair and unjust practices against our people , to the achievement of further political progress in the peace process and to improvements in the living conditions and the difficult economic situation of our people .  
Although it is difficult to make precise statements about the contribution of the various components of domestic demand to overall growth ( because of the often large statistical discrepancies in the national accounts ) , it does appear that fixed investment is now playing an increasingly important role in the economic recovery of eastern Europe .  
While unnecessary , wanton humiliations of the law-breaking State would surely be inappropriate , one finds it difficult to see - for example - how a State guilty of such a crime as a deliberate armed attack and invasion , or deliberate , systematic , massive violations of human rights or self-determination should not be required to offer guarantees that , while preserving its independent statehood and territorial integrity , could be viewed as incompatible with such a formal attribute of a State as its " dignity " .  
As the umbrella term children and youth in especially difficult circumstances covers a wide range of disparate target groups , it is evident that no single strategy will be effective in preventing or responding to the problems of substance abuse to which they are exposed .  
Links should be established or reinforced with media to avoid the negative reporting on children and youth in especially difficult circumstances and to further specific messages to enhance positive , social values fostering favourable conditions for accepting these children back into society .  
Giving a high priority to eradicating the most extreme forms of poverty by trying to reach the poorest of the poor raises not only practical questions of how it can be done in practice with limited resources , material and administrative but also difficult questions of social justice . 
In summary they are those whose ownership of assets or access to productive resources and whose capacity to participate in new opportunities is so low as to make it difficult for them to have the basic minimum of consumption and services required for a decent life .  
In other words , if the tax rules for various types of investment vehicles were not completely consistent , taxpayers could use derivatives to choose the tax treatment that they most desired ; moreover , achieving complete consistency was difficult if not impossible because various instruments differed in ways that were traditionally considered highly relevant to taxation , such as the predictable returns of a debt instrument versus the unpredictable returns on most equity investments . 
Although at times difficult political , economic and technical problems had to be solved , common sense and the two sides ' commitment to their international obligations always won out .  
At the same time , we are pleased to note that the members of the Security Council have been able to resist the temptation to use threatening language and an approach based on force , which could only have complicated the work of the Special Commission and in the final analysis made it more difficult to achieve the major goal set out in Security Council resolutions : a lasting post-crisis settlement in the Persian Gulf .  
The information transmitted is often designed to bring about the provisional arrest of a criminal with a view to subsequent extradition .  The organization also has an analytical crime intelligence unit working on international crime and producing reports that are extremely useful in connection with offences such as money-laundering , where transnational movements are very difficult to trace .  
Although it may be difficult to present these situations in terms of precise and measurable indicators , it is suggested that both qualitative and quantitative indicators are important in relation to indicators of violence against women migrant workers and that specific indicators for the following can be developed in due course .  
The political maturity displayed during and after the general elections by Pierre Buyoya , who gracefully handed over power to the victor , was unceremoniously shattered once again , giving way to a difficult situation which has left the country fragmented and has compounded the problem of mistrust among conflicting parties .  
Coupled with the ongoing process of difficult transition from a centrally planned to a market-oriented economy , the special economic problems resulting from the implementation of the sanctions regime more than four years ago now continue to exert their negative impact on the national economy and on the overall social and economic situation in the country .  
Some delegations underlined the difficult situation and the special needs and requirements of developing countries as a result of environmental degradation and emphasized the need for international support to deal with those problems through projects prepared and implemented by UNEP , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and other relevant organizations .  
Some delegations felt that the development of new norms and new standards and instruments mentioned in paragraphs 19.2 and 19.3 ( n ) was not an appropriate goal , and that the universal ratification of basic international human rights treaties mentioned in paragraph 19.3 ( a ) represented goals which were too ambitious and difficult to be realized during the plan period .  
Although it may be difficult to present these situations in terms of precise and measurable indicators , it is suggested that both qualitative and quantitative indicators are important in relation to indicators of violence against women migrant workers and that specific indicators for the following can be developed in due course .  
The documents also detail the advantages of the Saddam river project in the marsh area , and explain the reasons for the imposition of some of the severe punitive measures of a preventive and temporary nature dictated by the difficult conditions experienced by Iraq as a result of the economic sanctions imposed on it .  
The information received recently by the Special Rapporteur hardly suggests any improvement in the treatment of detainees in prisons and detention centres , which he described in earlier reports .  11 / Those reports give an account of the overcrowding , terrible sanitary conditions , inadequate and substandard food , limited medical care , beatings , restrictions on family visits , the problems of having common criminals share living quarters with political prisoners , and the jailing of many political prisoners far from their home towns , which makes contact with their families extremely difficult .  
In spite of the difficult world economic climate , Tunisia has also managed to achieve encouraging results , illustrated in a rate of growth in national product averaging 4.8 per cent over the last four years ; an increase in non-agricultural industrial exports at an annual rate of 13 per cent ; and an improvement in employment potential , with demand for employment fully absorbed for the first time ; while at the same time the country 's financial equilibrium has been preserved and its external debt brought under control .  
While the State bears the cost of wages and supplementary social charges for no fewer than 14 days when work is suspended ( decree No . 1447 of 31 December 1987 ) , to enable public officials to celebrate a variety of religious , political and social holidays , private enterprises would find it difficult to support such charges , which place a substantial burden on production costs .  
Following the visits of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to a number of the country 's rural and urban areas , during which he noted the inhabitants ' difficult living conditions , the Select Ministerial Council decided to establish a national programme to remedy the situation in districts lacking basic infrastructures . 
Turning to the report of the Secretary-General on privileges and immunities of officials of the United Nations and the specialized agencies and related organizations ( A / C . 5 / 51 / 3 ) he said that the important , sensitive and sometimes difficult task of maintaining the personal safety and security of the staff of the United Nations system was fully recognized by the European Union which appreciated that many of the operations in which staff were expected to serve were complicated and dangerous .  
While it was gratifying to note that the percentage of women in posts subject to geographical distribution had risen by 1 per cent over the past year , his delegation was concerned that , because of the financial crisis , it had been difficult for the Organization to meet its targets for the percentage of women in decision-making and policy-making posts .  
In addition , price measures might suffer from a number of practical problems : the changing nature of output and the increased heterogeneity of products made it very difficult to compile consistent price measures over time ; service industry outputs were notoriously difficult to define and to price ; and measuring the price of governmental outputs presented major conceptual problems .  
As in the preceding months , the mission of observers continues to received numerous allegations of massacres , killings , infringements of personal freedom and security , forced disappearances and arbitrary detentions in the interior of Burundi , especially in the provinces of Muramvya , Gitega , Kayanza , Cibitoke and Bubanza , allegations which are difficult or take a long time to verify because of the aforementioned security constraints . 
With respect to article 4 of the Convention , and in the light of the current difficult economic situation , the Committee emphasizes the importance of the allocation of resources to the maximum extent possible for the implementation of economic , social and cultural rights of the child at both central and local levels , in accordance with the principles of the Convention , in particular those relating to non-discrimination and the best interests of the child ( arts . 2 and 3 ) .  
The fierce international competition and the ever growing ability of well established firms to penetrate remote and underdeveloped markets makes it increasingly difficult for enterprises in low-income countries , in particular the LDCs , to survive , let alone compete , unless strong supportive action is taken so as to redress the structural handicaps confronted by these firms .  
The design of the mobility element attempted to strike a balance between different needs : ( a ) for organizations without rotation policies , and / or with a large proportion of their staff at headquarters , it recognized that the first move was the most difficult to effect ; ( b ) for staff with extensive field networks , which consequently had systematic rotation policies , it made provision for the additional toll exacted by frequent moves , more often than not without a home base .  
Turning to chapter V of the Commission 's report on international liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law , she said that it would be difficult to achieve a universal legal system which covered liability and compensation for harm arising out of acts which were unspecified , particularly in view of the variety of activities and harm that were potentially involved .  
HARRIS ( United States of America ) said that article 3 posed the greatest conceptual difficulties of all the draft articles , because it was always difficult to express the relationship between a new comprehensive agreement and existing bilateral and multilateral agreements on a particular subject .  
It was difficult to believe that euthanasia was now perceived by some as an acceptable alternative to caring for the sick and elderly and disabled persons .  
In the area of backstopping of peacekeeping operations ( financed by the peacekeeping support account ) or the start-up of the international tribunals , for instance , the General Assembly had , until recently , agreed only to ad hoc and temporary financial arrangements under which it has been difficult for the Secretariat to recruit staff in a planned and orderly manner .  
Noting the arduous and difficult conditions in which UNRWA carried out its work to assist Palestinian refugees , he said that , at the regional level , Israel was continuing its occupation and escalating its acts of aggression against the Palestinians , and that it had imposed an economic embargo and a curfew , and had destroyed homes and closed schools .  At the international level , donor Governments had not made their contributions to UNRWA activities , and the new Israeli Government had announced that it was repudiating all the principles of the peace process .  
In those circumstances UNRWA was forced to perform new tasks which had been entrusted to it after the beginning of the peace process , in particular to meet the growing humanitarian needs , ensure the necessary level of services to the Palestinian population , sometimes in extremely difficult circumstances , facilitate the advancement of the peace process with the help of investment and job creation projects , help establish Palestinian State bodies in the autonomous areas and meet the growing needs despite a reduction in budgetary resources .  
Noting also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
The spokesman for the African Group ( Morocco ) said that it was difficult to be optimistic about the possibilities for the African continent to achieve economic and social development , given the negative net external financial flows experienced by the region .  
Noting also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
A general definition of the activities covered , as contained in article 1 , was satisfactory , since it would be difficult to list all the activities and substances to which the articles applied , not least because of the constant advances of science and the concomitant increase in lawful activities ; and also because of the need progressively to eliminate certain chemical substances deemed to be harmful to the environment and to prohibit certain activities that were currently lawful , such as deforestation .  
The maintenance of a significant United Nations presence in Haiti in the form of military elements , particularly against the backdrop of the far more drastic crisis situations in other regions of the world and the extremely difficult financial situation of the Organization , could be perceived as a manifestation of double standards , especially when one takes into account the totally different attitude towards other truly critical and more volatile flashpoints .  
UNICEF 's multifaceted activities have included the massive struggle waged to control the menace of epidemic diseases in the 1950s ; efforts to integrate children 's needs into the overall development agenda in the 1960s ; the commitment to provide basic social services to children in the 1970s ; the campaign for child survival and development in the 1980s ; and , in the closing decade of this century , efforts to support Governments in ensuring the protection of the rights of children , in particular those in especially difficult circumstances .  
The developments which took place prior to the Dayton Peace Agreement proved once again that a lack of firm and prompt international response to aggression leads to further aggravation of crises , causes untold human suffering and makes it all the more difficult to find solutions .  
This hope and faith fuel the efforts of my Government which , under the difficult circumstances of the transition period , and bearing the onerous burden of the consequences of the civil war , is resolving the complex problems involved in transforming the highly centralized economy that we inherited into a market economy .  
Concerning the procedural aspects of the question , it had become clear that the establishment of a permanent international criminal court posed difficult political and technical problems .  
In other cases , however , the joint pursuit of these goals has proved more difficult than expected , at times contributing to political instability , social disarray and economic disappointment .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; these countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
Responding to this productive mood , and convinced that we could advance the process if we continued , our delegations proposed and the Fourth Committee agreed to defer action on the draft resolution and continue the informal dialogue to tackle the more difficult issues still outstanding .  
In response to that suggestion it was observed that in legal systems that recognized insolvency proceedings of natural persons , such as individual traders or merchants , it would sometimes be difficult to establish a clear distinction between the debtors business and personal affairs , and that proceedings apparently falling in the latter category might well have influence on the debtors assets and liabilities .  
For some States it was doubtful whether a workable framework for judicial cooperation could be established exclusively by way of a national statute , in particular since it was difficult to incorporate in it the concept of reciprocity .  
Quite apart from the exceptional amount of public interest this case aroused in those countries , and the variety of difficult and challenging issues it raised fundamental issues of the law of treaties , environmental law , the law of international watercourses and of State succession and State responsibility the case presented a number of distinctive features which called upon the Court 's resourcefulness . 
The need for that assistance and support remains urgent amid the current difficult circumstances faced by the Palestinian people of the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip , in view of the stagnation of the peace process and Israeli coercive measures , including closures and restrictions on the movement of workers and commodities to and from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip which represent an additional burden increasing the suffering of the Palestinian people .  
There can be no doubt that in adopting such provocative and extremist measures , which run radically counter to the will and direction of the international community , the Netanyahu Government is in fact pursuing a premeditated and programmed policy designed to demolish the forthcoming negotiations with the Palestinians , collapse the peace efforts of the United States of America and fabricate a climate of escalation that will make saving the peace process desperately difficult , if not impossible .  
I should like to conclude my remarks by expressing the Government of Japan \ x { e5b8 } deep appreciation to all the countries and international institutions that are engaged in the noble and difficult tasks , both civilian and military , that are required for the implementation of the Peace Agreement .  
Landmines exact a high human , social , economic and environmental cost and make it difficult to create the conditions needed for sustainable development in afflicted regions .  
The latter includes : ( i ) general actions related to shelter , services and settlement-wide issues ; ( ii ) actions for families in especially difficult circumstances ( including those in critical housing conditions , the homeless , female headed households and evicted families ) ; and ( iii ) specific actions for children ( mainly children in especially difficult circumstances ) .  
While proximity to the countries is a definite advantage in developing geographical specialization - something difficult to achieve by entities outside the region - the marked heterogeneity among the countries of the ESCAP region calls for special skills , localized knowledge , and competence for adopting , whenever required , a case-by-case approach .  
At police stations , the forms of torture and ill-treatment reported include kicking ; beating ; application of electric shocks by means of batons or small electrical generators ; the use of self-tightening handcuffs ; deprivation of food ; exposure to alternating extremes of hot and cold temperatures ; enforced standing in difficult positions ; enforced standing in cold water ; prolonged shackling of detainees spread-eagled to a wall ; placing of heated objects on the skin ; and striking with iron rods on the joints or hands .  
I am firmly convinced that with the final fine tuning of these ultimate requirements , this United Nations compensation operation will pass into history as a model of effectiveness , correction and fairness in the delicate and difficult circumstances that led to its creation , and that its work , its rules and its results will guide and shape the outcome of future compensation operations .  
In such conflicts , particularly in the case of a civil war , it is often difficult to determine which party is guilty of violating the peace , and the sanctions themselves may be indiscriminate , non-specific and , consequently ineffective and may only increase the already excessive burdens and sufferings borne by the innocent civilian population .  
In addition to the poverty in which Venezuela 's population was living , the Committee was extremely concerned at the absence of any practical plans at the grass-roots level for putting forward women 's demands , and at the fact that it was difficult to secure passage of legislative proposals for meeting women 's needs .  
Statements were made that judicial cooperation in general , including cooperation in insolvency matters , was governed by bilateral or multilateral treaties , which typically provided for cooperation based on reciprocity .  For some States it was doubtful whether a workable framework for judicial cooperation could be established exclusively by way of a national statute , in particular since it was difficult to incorporate in it the concept of reciprocity .  
A number of members of the Committee expressed concern that in the current situation of dwindling financial resources throughout the United Nations system , there was a tendency in many organizations to cut the funding for public information activities , as public information work was difficult to define in quantitative terms .  
In some cases , the allocation for TCDC is not separately identified from the budgetary allocation for the overall operations of the national focal point as an agency of the Government , and since there may not be a detailed system of accounting , it is difficult to determine how much is being dedicated to the actual promotion of TCDC .  
Every study conducted on remnants of war in North Africa has concluded that the Libyan territory situated between Egypt and Tunisia was transformed into a stockpile of deadly and destructive weapons , and that it is difficult to give exact information about those weapons , since the mines cleared by one party to the conflict were re-laid by the other party , making it difficult to give any precise details as to their number and type .  
Concerned about the continuing difficult situation of Palestinian women in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , and about the severe consequences of continuous Israeli illegal settlements activities as well as the harsh economic conditions and other consequences for the situation of Palestinian women and their families , resulting from the frequent closure and isolation of the occupied territory ,  
The extensive fighting in the north and south of the country has displaced a significant proportion of the population and made it difficult for humanitarian aid agencies to conduct a consistent and effective relief programme .  
Whether through such a mechanism or direct allocations of budgetary expenditures by donors , the funds will need to be in place as increasing numbers of countries pass through the process .  50 .  Countries that begin the process are being told that at the end of an extended period of difficult adjustment measures they will still be in a parlous situation unless they receive a special degree of debt relief .  
It is becoming difficult for a single firm to muster all the resources required to be innovative and competitive in the global markets , and firms are therefore aligning themselves with others , including competitors , with complementary capabilities or resources . 
After the lifting of the sanctions the special economic problems resulting from the implementation of the sanctions regime coupled with the ongoing process of difficult transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy and the accumulation of losses related to the implementation of the sanctions against the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Iraq continue to exert a negative impact on the national economy and on the overall social and economic situation in Bulgaria .  
VIII . 177 .  The Advisory Committee was informed that the arrangements for common and joint services in Vienna that had been in place since 1979 and were based on a tripartite agreement between IAEA , UNIDO and the United Nations , have changed to the extent that certain programmes have become increasingly difficult to maintain at the previous levels .  
This was made possible by the fact that the leaders of the major countries of Europe and North America , in the current difficult situation , have shown the political will to accommodate mutual interests and find compromise solutions designed to keep the world from returning to confrontation .  We continue consistently to oppose the expansion of the North Atlantic Alliance as an outdated and , hence , counter-productive policy direction .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; those countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
I am seriously concerned by an increasing trend towards restrictive asylum policies in many Western countries , including rejection of asylum seekers at borders , interdiction at sea and the narrow interpretation of the refugee definition , including limiting to persecution by State actors .  The distinction between refugees and economic migrants in Western countries is sometimes difficult to establish in practical terms .  
After the lifting of the sanctions the special economic problems resulting from the implementation of the sanctions regime coupled with the ongoing process of the difficult transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy continued to exert a negative impact on the overall social and economic situation in Bulgaria .  
Allow me to reiterate here the great importance of the support of the international community in assisting the member States of the Standing Advisory Committee to carry out the positive measures they have adopted , in a context that must be described as particularly difficult , in order to strengthen subregional security through increased cooperation , as is reflected in document A / 52 / 283 , which contains the report of the ninth ministerial meeting of the Standing Advisory Committee , held in Libreville , Gabon , from 7 to 11 July 1997 .  
After prolonged and difficult talks , the protocol concerning the redeployment in Hebron , concluded on 17 January 1997 , inspired the hope that confidence and mutual trust between Palestinians and Israelis would increase and create a positive environment for subsequent negotiations that could be successful .  
I also take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the entire international community for their immense political , diplomatic and material support to Sierra Leone , and to my Government and people in these difficult times .  
The allegations of summary , arbitrary and extrajudicial executions reported to him from many parts of the country were not surprising , because Iraqi legislation routinely prescribed the death penalty , even for minor offences , and also because the special security services and important figures in the regime had the power to take peoples lives at will ; the Iraqi Government made no attempt whatsoever to change that state of affairs , which it even justified on the grounds that the situation was difficult and that crime was on the increase .  
In rural settings , where women have little access to resources to pay for transport and where roads are likely to be poor and vehicles rare , the physical barriers involved render the use even of routine prenatal care services complicated and use of services for complications and emergencies is difficult .  
Earth observation of coastal regions were still in a pre-operational stage , key constraints being the lack of continuously operational Ocean Colour Sensors , lack of appropriate algorithms with local and timely calibration , low frequency of measurements , difficult access to data , unfriendly integration scheme with other data sources and poor information dissemination .  
Furthermore , on the subject of human rights , our countries have also gone through a difficult and often painful process in their transition to democracy and in the quest for fundamental human rights , a process that resulted in sad and tragic episodes but also taught valuable lessons that can and should be shared with other parts of the world .  
We believe that , for an environment conducive to progress in the peace process to be maintained , particularly at this difficult time , it is essential that the Palestinian people see and experience for themselves the positive economic and social effects of the political changes that would be brought about by a comprehensive peace settlement between Israel and its neighbours .  
In such conflicts , particularly in the case of a civil war , it is often difficult to determine which party is guilty of violating the peace , and the sanctions themselves may be indiscriminate , non-specific and , consequently ineffective and may only increase the already excessive burdens and sufferings borne by the innocent civilian population .  
As a State that has experienced first-hand all the hardships of civil war and has travelled the difficult road towards national reconciliation with active support and assistance from the United Nations , Tajikistan is convinced of the need to preserve strong and efficient peacemaking mechanisms .  
The fact that we have managed to defend the most important social benefits in decades , in such difficult and unusual conditions , strengthens the thesis that in a framework of social justice and an equitable distribution of wealth , certain basic goals of social development can be reached in situations where economic growth is limited , even negative .  
The Rwanda Tribunal is faced with the very difficult task of adjudicating persons responsible for the most egregious crimes imaginable by the human mind : the crime of genocide , crimes against humanity and serious violations of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflicts .  
Bearing in mind those facts and the requirements of our national societies in an international context that is marked by globalization and the interdependence of the phenomena affecting it , and recognizing that it is difficult for the Central American countries to deal with them individually , we must be more creative in order to ensure that our political and economic integration at the international level will be positive in terms of our goals of democratization and sustainable development .  
While it is prepared to consider the question of a thematic debate , whose utility has yet to be proven in the light of recent sessions , my delegation nevertheless continues to believe that it would be difficult to accept the idea of adding other matters to the agenda that have no bearing on the subject matter already addressed .  
The differing provisions of each treaty may make the creation of formal legal linkages complex and difficult , but we see scope for developing political links between the four existing or potential nuclear-weapon-free zones .  
All conferences stressed that every child has the right to be nurtured and protected by its family and that families and society must work together to improve the situation and protect the rights of all children , particularly those in especially difficult circumstances , for example children in areas of armed conflict , children who lack adequate family support , urban street children , abandoned children , children with disabilities , children addicted to narcotic drugs , and the girl child .  
These obstacles include the difficult legacy of the past , contradictory legislation and regulations , administrative delays due to conflicts of interest , differing conceptions of economic and social development , ineffective consultation with the populations concerned , notably on the use of territorial resources , and finally endemic violence .  
In the report on this subject prepared two years ago for the Commission for Social Development , it was emphasized that , in a period of rapid change , it was particularly difficult to identify significant trends and distinguish transient from lasting changes affecting society .  
The lack of sufficient and reliable data on water availability , its use and quality in many areas of the world makes effective national , regional and global water resource assessment difficult , if not impractical .  
We also remain hopeful that on the basis of the continued commitments of member States of the Conference to the shared goals of global disarmament it will be able to resolve the many difficult issues on its agenda , including the contentious issue of a fissile cut _ off .  
While progress in adopting and implementing policies and programmes to promote and facilitate the transfer and diffusion of ESTs is well documented , it has been extremely difficult to make reliable estimates on the actual transfer of ESTs to developing countries and the real size and growth of EST markets , or on the share of investments that can be clearly assigned to financing of the transfer and diffusion of ESTs .  
Noting the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
The Government faces a very difficult task and heavy responsibility in its obligation to protect all citizens of the Turkish Republic from the scourge of terrorism while simultaneously protecting all human rights of all the people of Turkey . 55 .  Secondly , while the press and other media are vivid , the Special Rapporteur finds that , at times , the press is not inspired by a vision of itself as a professional force that serves to inform all members of the public .  
In addition to the general problems involved with an international criminal court , the material differences in the environmental law of different countries made the international hearing of environmental cases difficult , particularly with regard to the choice of law .  
As the distinction was difficult to apply in practice , the Commission should in the future base its work on any given topic on international conventions and custom and the recognized principles of law and should then proceed to consider what contributions to progressive development might be acceptable to the international community .  
Given the gravity of the concerns highlighted , the mandate remains a most sensitive and difficult one since it relates to a State Member of the United Nations where governmental authority is absent and a State administration non _ existent , with the adverse impact this implies on the observance and protection of basic human rights and freedoms .  
We would like to express our delight and gratitude to the entire military and civil staff of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan for the devotion and bravery they demonstrated in complicated and often life-threatening situations as they carried out the very difficult duties assigned them by the Security Council .  
The reason for this is that , although children unquestionably require protection from enlistment in the ranks of these groups , the political and military circumstances of these entities vary to an extent that makes it not only difficult to subject them to a standard rule but also dangerous to accord them international legal status , which might be misinterpreted as granting them implicit recognition .  
Also taking note , with appreciation , of the significant policy reform efforts undertaken by the least developed countries , which in many cases have been wide ranging and difficult to implement ; that these efforts should be pursued further ; and that structural adjustment poses real challenges and resource issues for these countries ; and in this context , encourages the international community to support these further reform efforts by the least developed countries including helping to minimize any social cost of adjustments ,  
Many NGOs have demonstrated an ability not only to serve segments of the community that are difficult to reach , such as adolescents or women living in poor communities , but also to provide high quality services , to work in inaccessible or sensitive areas and to test innovative approaches .  
Also taking note , with appreciation , of the significant policy reform efforts undertaken by the least developed countries , which in many cases have been wide ranging and difficult to implement ; that these efforts should be pursued further ; and that structural adjustment poses real challenges and resource issues for these countries ; and in this context , encourages the international community to support these further reform efforts by the least developed countries including helping to minimize any social cost of adjustments ,  
There was no major humanitarian crisis in 1996 but daily life for the average Somali person continued to be very difficult , especially in the southern half of the country .  
In particular , the disproportionate increase in multilateral debt , which is usually more difficult to service and can not be rescheduled , has intensified the problem of the debt overhang in the region and rendered the process of debt renegotiation more intractable , despite the latest initiative for the " highly indebted poor countries " . 
Deeply concerned at the impact of the conflict on the humanitarian situation and on the social and economic infrastructure of Tajikistan , and aware that the sharp decline in the provision of social , health and education services , lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes and the sharp drop in the real income of most families have made it increasingly difficult for large sections of the population in Tajikistan to meet their basic needs ,  
In fact , it is extremely difficult to establish a regulatory regime which is both expert and independent of capture by well-endowed enterprises ( who may be supported by strong ministers ) , nor perverted by short-term political interests .

However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; these countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
In any case , the Inspectors ' suggestion that such teams should be assisted by the local United Nations Resident Coordinators would be difficult to reconcile either with the Member States ' view that developmental and humanitarian activities in the field should not be mixed with political activities or with UNDP 's need to work in close cooperation with Governments .  
In looking ahead toward post _ START III negotiations , nuclear arms reductions would be far more difficult without a ban on new fissile material production for weapons embodied in a treaty that provides confidence that the international community would detect clandestine production .  
Although the world economy was becoming more integrated through trade and other financial flows , and offers mutual benefits and growing opportunities for economic expansion to participating countries , it also generated social dislocation and demands difficult policy adjustments .  
One Government stressed that a necessary condition for the success of a conference was that the interests of sending , receiving and transit countries be served by it and that , if consensus proved difficult to achieve at the global level , a more realistic approach would be to pursue a process of regional consultations , ensuring that the regional groupings involved reflected migration realities and were not necessarily tied to the configuration of the regional commissions . 
Today 's cities were faced with a lack of financial resources and socio-economic and demographic pressures ; the gap between rich and poor was widening , providing basic social services was increasingly difficult , health , environmental and security problems were getting worse and unsustainable patterns of production and consumption were becoming widespread . 
The situation was particularly difficult for the developing countries since the liberalization of their foreign transactions made them increasingly vulnerable to the unpredictable fluctuations of private capital flows in the international financial markets .  
Those audits disclosed various financial control weaknesses and recurring problems , such as delayed or unreliable financial and narrative reporting , making it difficult for UNHCR to determine the extent to which funds were being used for the intended purposes .  
Striking a balance between the static and dynamic components of competition is particularly difficult for developing countries in todays globalizing world , where the gaps - whether measured in terms of income , productivity performance or technological capacities - are greater than ever , and where small market size , limited availability of entrepreneurs and of production inputs , outmoded technology , inefficient distribution and communications systems or poor information flows combine to create barriers to market entry .  
While understanding the difficult economic situation and the difficulty of reaching durable solutions to the refugee problem , the Committee expressed its concern with respect to the precarious material and psychological conditions of women refugees .  
The application of the exclusion clauses traditionally raises complex , practical and difficult legal questions , not least in the context of very unsettled and ambiguous circumstances surrounding continuous displacement in the Great Lakes region of Africa .  
Russia , and most of the other countries with transition economies , possessed a developed industrial , scientific and technological base , now operating under difficult transitional conditions .  
His delegation would work towards an acceptable definition of the concepts involved and the establishment of a clear standard of proof in respect of legal persons or criminal organizations , but considered that it would be difficult to reach consensus .  
Peacekeeping operations with a humanitarian component were increasingly coming to the fore , and raised a number of difficult political , legal and operational problems .  
The Committee noted that the improved economic performance of LDCs in recent years was mainly attributable to their own sound macroeconomic policy reforms , undertaken under most difficult domestic and external conditions .  
The Board noted that the improved economic performance of LDCs in recent years was mainly attributable to their own sound macroeconomic policy reforms , undertaken under most difficult domestic and external conditions .  
The Board noted that the improved economic performance of LDCs in recent years was mainly attributable to their own sound macroeconomic policy reforms , undertaken under most difficult domestic and external conditions .  
At the policy level , there is a lack of properly articulated policies on sustainable development , and very little or no integration of environmental dimensions in socio-economic policy planning at the national level , which makes it difficult to harmonize priorities at the regional and subregional levels , and to develop coherent and subregional programmes .  
The Government of Rwanda has been regrouping rural populations of the north _ west in grouped settlements , as opposed to the traditional patterns of scattered settlements which leave the people exposed to the action of the rebel groups , while making difficult their access to services such as public education and health , electricity and water .  
We are particularly concerned that poverty continues unabated ; financial resources have taken a downturn ; the transfer of environmental technologies has not materialized ; human-induced climate change has increased ; trade and investments have become more difficult for developing countries ; and globalization has unleashed new threats to sustainable development .  
The view was expressed that the draft articles seemed to be premised upon a highly centralized State with comprehensive regulatory powers ; it would be difficult or even impossible to implement those principles effectively in federal States , where regulatory authority was shared .  
Second , financial aspects , recognizing that it is very difficult to rely on mobilizing domestic financial resources in very poor and populous countries where natural resources are degraded , and international cooperation will need to play a very key role .  
However , considering the value of these forests to local populations , it will be difficult to adequately identify quality changes , especially change in species composition and biological diversity , which is mostly induced by the common practice of selective cutting of highly valuable trees .  
Likewise , when we are aware of the zeal with which alleged terrorists are tracked down , in every corner of the globe , it is difficult to understand why , despite the tireless appeals launched by the overwhelming majority of States , nothing significant has ever been carried out at the national level to prevent the recruitment and use of mercenaries , which , as has been proved , contributes to the flouting of the rules of international humanitarian law . 
The unknown and unpredictable costs associated with such risks as contractual disputes , unfunded liabilities , business interruption or losses due to civil strife , natural disasters , etc . , make it difficult to use a strict formula to determine the protection needed .  
The developing countries difficult situation was further compounded by their lack of technological capabilities , since commodities were becoming less important ( particularly in view of the growing use of manufactured products ) , trade preferences were being eliminated and a new trend had arisen in the commodities futures markets and was threatening to destabilize the earnings of countries dependent on such goods . 
It made it more difficult for developing countries to make use of their traditional comparative advantages , such as cheap labour and abundant natural resources , since industrial and technological capacity with a solid infrastructural base , adequate human resources and business development were increasingly determinants of economic growth and sustainable development .  
The crisis had proved difficult to manage , partly because of its rapid spread to other countries , but more importantly because the usual prescriptions had either proved ineffective or would have involved a much longer transition , which would have caused greater losses of output and social distress .  
If , in addition , one considered the frequent violations of the human rights of the Palestinian and Arab population , the severe conditions under which members of that population were held in custody and the frequent closures of Palestinian territory , it was easy to understand how difficult it was for the Palestinian population to hold on to the optimism and hope engendered by the various peace agreements that had been concluded since 1991 .  
The absence of a consolidated text of the various provisions tends to inhibit focused and systematic attention to migrants as a specific vulnerable social group , and makes the tasks of the relevant advocacy bodies more difficult .  
Mention should be made of the social problems existing in EPZs : local landlords take advantage of the accommodation shortage to charge enormous rents for sub _ standard accommodation ; transport services and social infrastructure ( especially child _ care facilities ) are often non-existent ; friction between the EPZ workers and local residents is common and real integration of workers in local communities is difficult to achieve , in particular because of the high turnover in many Zones .  
The Russian Federation was implementing the provisions of the conference under difficult economic conditions , but within a firm legal framework which included a national plan of action for the advancement of women to the year 2000 and specific federal programmes .  
Under difficult conditions , FRY thus preserved fundamental rights stemming from employment and exerted considerable efforts in the attempt to secure minimum safety at work , where the effects of sanctions and the international blockade were especially inhuman .  
The employed person 's salary is augmented in case of work in conditions which are more difficult than normal for a particular job ( climate , noise , vibrations , irradiation , humidity , harmful gases , biologically harmful substances , physical strain , work with dirty materials , danger caused by tools or objects , means of transport , waste materials , electricity , explosions , heat , corrosive materials , etc . ) , which need to be made specific by special or individual collective agreements .  
During the period of the United Nations Security Council sanctions , it was very difficult , or even impossible , for FRY to import medicaments , raw materials for medicaments , medical supplies , instruments and their spare parts , materials for personal protection of workers , measuring instruments and their spare parts , various chemicals which are required for various analyses in health care and micro-climate tests of working conditions , scientific and technical books , etc .  
These are particularly difficult times for the families of mineworkers and industrial workers who have no revenues from the land ( poverty ratio of 44.33 per cent ) , poor urban families with a large number of children , families with mentally or physically handicapped members , adults or elderly persons without relatives unable to fend for themselves , pensioners with a minimum pension , urban families who have provided shelter to refugee families from war-torn areas of the former Yugoslavia , etc .  
Reaffirms that juvenile justice remains a high priority in the work of the Centre for International Crime Prevention and the institutes comprising the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network , in particular as children and young people , both those in conflict with the law and those in difficult circumstances who may be potential future criminals , are easy prey for criminal organizations closely linked with activities of transnational organized crime ;  
Notwithstanding its own difficult economic situation , which , in fact , is complicated by economic losses caused by the ongoing military actions in Yugoslavia , Ukraine is contributing to international efforts by providing humanitarian aid to refugees from Kosovo .  
It was imperative that the international community , especially the major donors , whether they were States or financial institutions , should not abandon the Palestinian people in such a difficult economic , political and social situation .  
I urge the Council to endorse the electoral support plan submitted by MINURCA , which is based on the minimum that is required , in the difficult circumstances prevailing within the Central African Republic , to ensure an acceptable level of observation of the freedom and fairness of the election process .  
In some cases , the small size of their public sectors makes it difficult to provide adequate regulation , particularly if the offshore sector has grown more rapidly than regulatory capacity .  
Internationally recruited staff members serving at designated duty stations having very difficult conditions of life and work shall be granted once a year , under conditions established by the Secretary-General , an additional shipment entitlement to the duty station by the most economical means of up to 50 kilograms or 0.31 cubic metres , in respect of the staff member and each eligible family member for whom the Organization has paid travel costs to the duty station .  
A focused , transparent and accountable Centre was also worthy of support and commitment from Member States , and he urged the Commission at its current session to send a positive financial signal in that regard , otherwise some very difficult decisions would have to be made .  
Earlier in the present report ( para . 261 ) the Special Rapporteur noted the generalized opinion that , in the light of the situation endured by indigenous peoples today , the existing mechanisms , either administrative or judicial , within non-indigenous spheres of government have been incapable of solving their difficult predicament .  
The problem was that , according to the normal understanding , where an obligation was breached and the exhaustion rule applied , the applicable international law was the law applicable at the time the harm was done and not at the time the local remedies were exhausted ; indeed it was difficult to specify that time because of the different ways in which local remedies could be exhausted .  
Since this was likely to prove particularly difficult at the international level and be of limited relevance to international commercial transactions , the additional benefit to be expected from using an enhanced electronic signature as opposed to a mere electronic signature might need to be clarified .  
Without continued efforts at international cooperation , however , smaller and many developing countries may find it difficult to never build up an adequate scientific and educational base for sustainable space technology and application programmes .  
One country stressed that a necessary condition for the success of a conference was that the interests of sending , receiving and transit countries be served by it and that if it proved difficult to achieve a consensus at the global level , a more realistic approach would be to pursue a process of regional consultations , ensuring that the regional groupings involved reflected migration realities and were not necessarily tied to the configuration of the regional commissions .  
This requires addressing difficult and controversial issues such as schoolgirl pregnancy , adaptation of the content of educational curricula and textbooks to the objective of equipping girls with the knowledge and skills necessary for them to avoid early pregnancy , and broadening the objectives and purposes of education to provide the future generations of women in Uganda with options unavailable to the past and current generations of women .  
As for shortcomings that still need to be addressed , difficult circumstances at the field level have constituted a major cause of interruptions , delays or otherwise hindering the smooth implementation of technical cooperation activities .  
The trend towards ballistic missile defence would be difficult to reverse because the political support in the United States for its development was considerable ; large investments had already been made and committed to further research and development ; and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty was often perceived as an obsolete arms control agreement preventing the protection of the territory of the United States .  
Many small island developing States find it increasingly difficult to access concessional development finance due to the application of criteria by some members of the international community , which focus on their relatively higher per capita gross national product levels without taking full account of their actual levels of development , vulnerability or standard of living in real terms .  
Lack of governmental coordination at the national level : Responsibility for family issues and programmes concerning individual family members ( for example , children , women , youth and so forth ) is usually shared between numerous ministries and agencies within a given country , giving rise to many coordination challenges and making it difficult to develop and implement comprehensive strategies for families , children and so on ;  
The weakening of economic performance in the past two years due to , inter alia , unfavourable climatic conditions and weak commodity prices , together with a more challenging global economic environment , suggest that the recent economic performance of the least developed countries might be difficult to sustain without further diversification of their economies so as to reduce their vulnerability to exogenous shocks .  
I do not want to conclude without paying my delegation 's special tribute to the entire staff men and women of UNAMET and all other humanitarian personnel , particularly those who still remain voluntarily and courageously in Dili , for their tireless efforts , devotion and sometimes sacrifices that they have so valiantly demonstrated in the face of an extremely difficult environment throughout the process , since the popular consultation up to now .  
It provides such channels as absence of currency controls at borders ; increased and instant capital flows at the international level , making it difficult to isolate suspicious transactions ; dollarization of economies , thereby facilitating the circulation of dirty cash ; and a multiplication of the development of offshore financial services to attract foreign investments .  
Then , at the most critical and difficult time in our history , when the Soviet Union and the socialist bloc collapsed and the country was deprived of the fundamental markets and sources of supplies it could count on to withstand the ferocious economic warfare waged against an island located only 90 miles from the United States coast , that country decided to act more ruthlessly still against Cuba : the blockade was intensified to the maximum , in a case of truly vulgar and repugnant opportunism .  
These conflicts are made even more difficult by the huge rise in banditry , illicit trafficking in narcotics and psychotropic substances and the uncontrolled circulation of arms , especially small arms and light weapons , in a continent characterized by porous borders .  
A comprehensive approach was needed in addressing Africa 's structural constraints , including its weak infrastructure and high transport costs , which continued to undermine the expected gains from economic reforms , making it difficult to attract adequate foreign private investment .  
In order to carry out those difficult but necessary changes , Africa needed the international communitys support , including increased financial and humanitarian assistance , contributions to peacekeeping efforts , reduction of the debt burden , better access to export markets and incentives for foreign direct investment .  
Given the difficult financial situations faced by many Member States , however , he called on UNRWA to explore creative measures to alleviate its financial difficulties through alternative sources of income such as contributions from the private sector and expanded joint programmes with international organizations .  
Those who are satisfied with their global economic performance under existing rules are steadfastly opposed because they do not want to do anything that would jeopardize what they see as the crucial , and already difficult , basic mission of increasing trade openness .  
The development of the developing countries was hampered by a debt burden equivalent to a huge proportion of their export revenues ( over 50 per cent in Latin America and nearly 30 per cent in Africa ) and by protectionism ; rigid quality standards that were difficult to meet ; and falling commodity prices .  
Significant regularities observed in countries belonging to each of the really existing systemic families led to a comparative assessment where favourable , and adverse trends were mixed on both sides , making objective economic comparison more difficult ( see table 2 ) .  
It was to be hoped that the questionnaire would meet with the widest possible response , but Governments might find it difficult to provide all the information requested , as the concept of a unilateral act might be as undefined at the national level as it was at the international level .  
Estimates of the number of militia fluctuate for a variety of reasons : some minor leaders and some of the rank and file are returning to East Timor ; militia are often collocated with local West Timorese and displaced persons , making it difficult to distinguish between the two ; with some militia involved in criminal activity , their identity as a pro-integration group is becoming blurred ; and significant elements of the militia leadership appear to be reviewing their plans for the future .  
Some studies indicate that criminal groups are slowly abandoning their involvement in visible economic activities and are diverting criminal profits towards the more secretive financial sector . 7 This diversion is said to make detection more difficult and the confiscation of assets problematic . 
Many still wish to return to the properties they occupied prior to the war , but return has been made difficult by complicated property laws that have not been implemented and by the difficult economic , security and political realities facing those who would now be part of ethnic minorities in their pre-war communities .  
The Committee commends your efforts at supporting the Middle East peace process and at bringing about a comprehensive , just and lasting settlement of the question of Palestine , providing the varied economic assistance to the Palestinian people , carrying out the difficult task of rehabilitating the Palestinian economy , as well as making the socio-economic development of the Palestinian society viable and sustainable . 
We are troubled to see that in a world dominated by a single military and technological Power , we are today less safe than during the difficult years of the cold war .  
At the most critical and difficult time in our history , when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the socialist bloc collapsed , and with them the basic markets and sources of supply that the country could count on to withstand the ferocious economic warfare waged against an island only 90 miles from the United States coast , they decided to be yet more unyielding in their approach to Cuba : with truly vulgar and repugnant opportunism , the blockade was intensified to the maximum .  
The Governments of these countries , faced as many of them are with heavy debt burdens and severe structural adjustment programmes , will find it difficult if not impossible to bear the costs of adequate social measures .  
It would be difficult to explain to the growing number of people who live in pockets of poverty throughout the industrialized world that in Copenhagen , four years ago , we decided to help them and integrate them into the framework of the tremendous social development that prevails in their countries .  
In the four years since the Summit , the developing countries have enjoyed little in the way of the technical and financial cooperation for development that was committed and certainly they have not engaged the path to rapid , broad-based sustainable development.It is in fact somewhat difficult to undertake a review of progress made in follow-up activities when the economic picture today is bleaker than it was at the time of the Summit .  
The action plan could include management initiatives for regional fisheries bodies , monitoring and surveillance , penalties , port access arrangements , boat and gear identification , vessel registers , independent observers , product certification , trade and marketing documentation and memorandums of understanding between producing and consuming countries.Illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing is a difficult issue for Governments to deal with . 
These included reduction of the infant mortality and under-five child mortality by one third and of maternal mortality by half , cutting down by 50 per cent the number of children under five suffering from malnutrition , enabling every child to attend primary school , immunizing 90 percent of the worlds infants and protecting children in especially difficult circumstances , particularly in situations of armed conflict .  
Notwithstanding the difficult economic and social conditions existing in many African countries and the environmental and desertification-related problems , the continent is doing all it can to create conditions for sustained economic growth and sustainable development in Africa .  
Mr . Kuchel ( United States of America ) : Many difficult compromises were reached in the negotiation of this convention , and we believe the agreement that resulted is a reasonable one accommodating diverse interests , which will prove to be useful addition to the developing body of international law relating to the peaceful exploration and use of outer space .  
Not only have we had to battle against established customs and the preachings of a number of conservative sectors , we also although this may be difficult to believe have had to deal with a number of non-governmental organizations which , when they did not get the budgetary support they expected , joined the campaign being waged by some parts of the media and certain political sectors and , betraying their principles , acted in opposition to the reproductive health programmes .  
We must take on the often difficult challenge of recognizing and addressing the intimate but complex links between both international and internal migration and other population and development issues.Canada is committed to continuing an active multilateral approach to migration which has as its cornerstone protection of the human rights of all migrants .  
Many small island developing States find it increasingly difficult to access concessional development finance due to the application of criteria by some members of the international community , which focus on their relatively higher per capita gross national product levels without taking full account of their actual levels of development , vulnerability or standard of living in real terms .  
Concerned about the continuing difficult situation of Palestinian women in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , and about the severe consequences of continuous illegal Israeli settlements activities , as well as the harsh economic conditions and other consequences for the situation of Palestinian women and their families , resulting from the frequent closures and isolation of the occupied territory ,  
Taking note of the decision contained in the recently adopted General Assembly resolution 53-12 on the rapidly deployable mission headquarters , China considered that in the current difficult financial situation faced by the United Nations and the relative scaling down of peacekeeping operations , the efforts to strengthen the rapid deployment capability should be focused on tapping the full potential of current mechanisms .  
The independent experts had identified the shortcomings that had made the development of IMIS difficult , including the lack of a corporate information technology plan for the Secretariat , the continuous lack of adequate internal staff , the gross underestimation of the level of effort required for report-writing , and delays in setting up operations support within user offices .  
What the Convention will do is create a system that makes that extremely difficult as a practical matter , because of its system of monitoring sensitive chemicals , its challenge inspection provisions , its economic and political sanctions , and by creating a forum for determining collective action to combat the threat of chemical weapons .  
It was difficult to believe that while Governments and international organizations were spending vast sums of money on bilateral and international law reform programmes , the training and legislative technical assistance programme of the United Nations body dealing specifically with international trade law was being funded from limited extrabudgetary resources in the form of special contributions by a very few Governments .  
This is especially true where products ( especially services ) are difficult to specify clearly and may vary significantly in quality ( for which sufficient adjustment is not made ) , and where annual national average prices are able to fall , quite logically , within a wide price band ( as say , in the case of India or China ) .  
It is under these circumstances that Ethiopia would find it difficult to consider these latest statements by the international community , though encouraging and positive , sufficiently forthright and commensurate with the gravity of the situation we face , which is made all the more serious in light of the continuing Eritrean attempt at expanding its occupation and its war of aggression .  
That violence is particularly evident during raids in which large numbers of more or less arbitrary and often violent arrests are made , often on the basis of being the wrong sort 8 ] , and the burden of proof of legal status rests with the accused : many foreigners , even South Africans , have spent months in prison like this , as their status can sometimes be difficult to determine . 
Reports mention the poor food , the sharing of cells with people who have committed criminal acts , and harsh treatment by police officers ( made all the more easy by the fact that the illegal persons status makes it more difficult for them to gain access to official legal channels ) , all of which has apparently led to the death of a number of immigrants while in detention . 
Her delegation supported the decision to focus the activities of the Organization and , in particular , of UNDP , on the difficult balance between macroeconomic reform and the need for a credible State capable not only of supporting market development , but also of creating legal structures , institutions and regulatory frameworks .  
Because the diversity of national legal traditions and administrative practices made formulating model legislation difficult , his delegation supported the idea that legislative recommendations should be reviewed with the assistance of experts , subject to the participation of all Member States .  
Such personal networks hide behind consensual agreements , justified by political , social , ethnic and religious arguments , so that it is difficult for the public to become aware of them .  
To make matters worse , they find it difficult without the requisite technology and human resource base to attract foreign direct investment , which is increasingly concentrated in a small number of emerging economies .  
In recent years the African continent has witnessed many acute struggles that threatened peace and security and led to difficult humanitarian situations , with tragic economic and social dimensions .  
The Convention and the two Protocols address sensitive issues and set up a complex normative system on matters such as criminal law , in which differences between national legislations make the drafting of international laws particularly difficult .  
The fast pace of globalization , the competition for FDI and the sheer size of many transnational corporations ( TNCs ) can make it difficult for a host country acting alone to set in place adequate environmental controls over incoming FDI .  
Determining actual and reasonable costs is often difficult for troop contributors to do , especially when they move matriel and personnel by military means and can not therefore easily provide documentary evidence of an acceptable national commercial rate .  
While convincing results have been achieved in building institutional memory in specific substantive subject areas , such repositories of knowledge remain compartmentalized , with crosscutting access either difficult or nonexistent .  
In order to bring about satisfactory political , social and cultural integration , it was necessary to meet the needs of vulnerable groups in difficult circumstances such as women , children , the poor , displaced persons and refugees .  
In these cases the Panel considered it appropriate to accept a level of documentation consistent with the practical realities of a difficult , uncertain and often hurried situation , taking into account the concerns necessarily involved .  
In order to stabilize regional labour markets in the light of the difficult demographic situation and the considerable strain on the labour market as a whole , the Government is creating special economic zones and encouraging an investment drive .  
In the future , combating racial discrimination would be more difficult as it would be expressed less and less in crude forms of colour discrimination , but rather would be combined with class and other material conditions .  
In contrast , the view was expressed that the distinction between primary and secondary rules was intellectually tempting , but rather artificial , hard to maintain , difficult to apply in practice and sometimes invalid .  
Although all citizens in principle had equal access to medical services , including at least a minimum level of care for pregnant women and children , the difficult economic climate made even minimal medical care difficult to provide . 
UNICEFs Afghan female assistant programme officer for health , who is based in Islamabad , was able to travel and conduct training sessions inside Afghanistan , accompanied by her mahram ( male relative ) and under somewhat difficult circumstances .  
Stop imposing economic sanctions , which deprive people of their basic economic , social and environmental rights and which make their struggle for survival , as well as for civil and political rights , more difficult . 
Indeed , it was considered that Muslim extremists profited from a difficult socioeconomic system , under which most people sought refuge in religion , but were , unfortunately , guided by religious officials who were often incompetent , and / or close to extremists .  
The negative effects resulted mainly from the increased dominant or monopoly power of the merged firm , and this made competition between large multinational corporations and companies of developing countries ever more difficult .  
The existing system , which relies on unpredictable and piecemeal funding and outdated , cumbersome and complex procedures is simply not suited for the difficult and dangerous situations in which United Nations personnel are obliged to work .  
The negative effects resulted mainly from the increased dominant or monopoly power of the merged firm , and this made competition between large multinational corporations and companies of developing countries ever more difficult .  
While all States agreed that the environment must be protected and that potentially harmful activities must be regulated , environmental standards and national financial capacities varied and it would be difficult to establish a minimum standard of conduct .  
One of the main problems faced by local firms in the domestic market is securing effective and substantive participation in projects funded by multilateral funding agencies since they have found it difficult to meet the prequalification requirements .  
The Panel had a difficult and very delicate mission that had to be carried out and completed in extremely adverse and hazardous circumstances in a sensitive region where the susceptibilities and ambitions of the belligerents have reduced the life of the local populations to insecurity and uncertainty . 
We are convinced that the absence of such dialogue , against the backdrop of social tension and a very difficult economic situation , could have the most dangerous consequences for the future of post-conflict recovery in the Central African Republic , and could lead to a situation in which the results of the international communitys efforts over the past few years would be lost and reduced to naught .  
While all these measures are , from our point of view , extremely positive , given the difficult circumstances the country is going through and the prevalence of extreme poverty among its population , we unfortunately find that the international community is still hesitant in mobilizing the financial resources and other forms of assistance that the country requires to address the enormous challenges , which are only increasing day by day . 
While there is now uncertainty as to how long hostilities will continue , ensuring that aid reaches civilians especially millions of women , children and the elderly , many of them trapped deep inside villages appears even more difficult than before , with both the holy month of Ramadan and the Central Asian winter fast approaching .  
I recognize that it has been very difficult for non-members of the Council to be present here today , in view of the many other activities that are taking place and of the fact that our meeting had to start much later than anticipated , since we had to have earlier consultations , the consultations having proved extremely useful on the situation in Afghanistan . I wish at this time to express my deep appreciation to the members of the Council for the considerable cooperation which the Jamaican delegation received this month .  
Individuals living in the contaminated areas showed increased morbidity due to diseases of the endocrine , circulatory and digestive systems , as well as a higher rate of mental disorders , but it was difficult to interpret those results .  
Concern has been expressed that , where the summary of a 1503 communication is edited to eliminate material that may not deal expressly with the rights of women , this may distort the overall gist of the communication and may make it difficult to evaluate a governmental response that addresses all issues raised in the original communication .  
The development of a comprehensive convention on international space law with due regard for the sovereign rights of States could help to resolve such difficult issues as the delimitation and definition of outer space , control of space pollution , management of scientific research and commercial activities in outer space , registration of space objects , protection of intellectual property , responsibility and the settlement of disputes .  
In light of articles 3 , 4 , 6 , 26 and 27 of the Convention , the Committee encourages the State party to take all appropriate measures to the maximum extent of its available resources , in particular at the local level , to support families in a difficult economic and / or social situation in order to ensure , to the maximum extent possible , the survival and development of all children living in Latvia .  
In light of articles 3 , 4 , 6 , 26 and 27 of the Convention , the Committee encourages the State party to take all appropriate measures , such as the adoption and enforcement of the Programme of Assistance to Families Raising Children , to the maximum extent of its available resources and in particular at the local level , to support families in a difficult economic and / or social situation in order to ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of all children living in Lithuania , without discrimination .  
Ms . Schpp-Schilling acknowledged that sexual stereotyping existed in both developed and developing countries , but it was particularly difficult to end the practice when it was deeply rooted in cultural and customary traditions .  
In her delegations view , the debate on the subject of children always raised a host of questions stemming from the fact that , in one part of the world , children received maximum attention , whereas elsewhere it was so difficult to reach an acceptable minimum standard .  
Situation in least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked developing countries and other vulnerable economies is more difficult due to inherent economic problems of poor resource base , low productivity and lack of financial institutions . 
Others for different reasons , including domestic economic mismanagement , conflicts , natural catastrophes and external economic shocks , such as terms of trade changes , international interest rate hikes or contagion are faced with difficult or even unbearable debt burdens .  
While the need for effective forward planning of purchases was recognized , it was decided that the fluid nature of many of the projects , which evolve as research progresses , makes concrete planning of purchases on a universal level extremely difficult .  
If we look seriously at the current situation prevailing in the way that outer space is used and other related developments in outer space , it would not be difficult to draw the conclusion that negotiating such an international legal instrument is not merely a necessity , but an urgent necessity in the field of multilateral arms control and disarmament . 
The humanitarian consequences of the increasingly difficult operating environment include : reduced ability to work with or access women ; inability to reach populations that are a low priority for the Taliban authorities ; and generally increased costs or difficulty in implementing assistance projects to the extent that otherwise viable projects have to be considered for closure . 
He had concluded that that was not necessary either for practical reasons ( it would be extremely difficult , if not impossible , to establish a clear-cut violation of internal law in respect of reservations ) or for technical reasons ( the internal procedure in respect of reservations is often empirical and difficult of access ) ; there , too , the Commissions opinion would be valuable to him . 
In this regard , the Jordanian Government has taken many national measures to combat terrorism , from which Jordan has often suffered as a result of difficult political regional and international conditions .  On the national level , requisite punitive legislation was enacted to punish all forms of terrorist activities , bring perpetrators to justice and suppress the financing of such acts .  
It is no exaggeration to say that the world situation is complex and difficult in view of the fact that our world today is rife with international conflicts that we have not been able to settle and chronic crises awaiting solutions that would break the spiral of violence and suffering threatening our human existence .  
Noting with concern the devastating effects of difficult social and economic conditions , armed conflicts , wars , natural disasters , infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria , and of the HIV / AIDS pandemic on family life and stability ,  
One panellist considered that the success of European monetary integration had been favoured by the close trade ties among the countries involved and had been based on a unique and historically motivated political commitment by EU member States , which so far was still lacking in Asia , for example , and which in general was difficult to replicate elsewhere .  
Given that the current difficult situation could be overcome only by a combination of adequate domestic policies and an enabling international environment , the Committee must review the main economic issues and identify areas for cooperation .  
An unrepresentative and anachronistic Council that does not reflect current global realities would find it extremely difficult , notwithstanding its worthy intentions , to effectively and credibly tackle this momentous challenge to international peace and security .  
If international cooperation failed to expand , it would be difficult for many developing countries to create a reliable scientific and educational base for the sustainable development of space technology .  
The road ahead remains long and difficult , however , and all of us , by virtue of our joint responsibility , must stand in firm support of that country until it has established peace , security and stability and its people are able to enjoy the economic and social prosperity and decent life of which they have been deprived for over 10 years and which they deserve , like all other peoples of the international family .  
Chen Jianwen , the researcher responsible for this research explained that X-ray computerized tomography ( CT ) is usually used in clinical medicine to determine the pathology of a biological tissue .  Nonetheless , compared with a normal tissue , the difference of absorbing the X-ray by an initial cancerous tissue is extremely small , making it impossible to reflect the absorption on an image .  Thus , it is very difficult to diagnose an initial stage cancer .  
Guangzhou Military Region is using test beds as the vanguard to lead its advance .  It is using its focus on difficult points and attacking key problems to promote all-around progress .  It is gradually making S &amp; T training for troops standardized and scientific , and it has seen clear improvements in the quality of unit military training and in the level of combat power of its units .  
It is also worth mentioning that the private companies under Chen ostensibly included some joint ventures with Hong Kong businesses , some joint ventures with banks , and also some joint ventures with the Yuhu Prefectural Government . As such , public ownership were intermixed with private ownership to give people many false impressions and make it difficult for people to discern their nature off-hand .  This was to make it easy for them to profit from confusion and to slip away unpunished in the event of an exposure of their offenses .  
If the departments concerned can work in close cooperation , coordinate their actions and produce some tangible results in these activities , it will be conducive to promoting the solution of major and difficult issues that the masses feel very strongly about , thus making the effects of ideological and political work felt deep in the heart of the masses , improving the quality of the population as civilized people , and making the urban and rural areas more civilized .  
Yunnan deputy Wang Shikun [ 3769-0013-0981 ] said : The Standing Committee put supervision in an important position last year .  The law-enforcement inspection which centered round the state 's central tasks , the actual implementation of the law as well as key and difficult problems of great concern to the masses played a positive role in promoting the practice of doing things and exercising administration according to law in the local governments .  
Many deputies and committee members said that in the course of reform , opening up , and establishing a socialist market economy system , pluralistic trends have emerged in economic components and interests , ways of social life , and social organizational forms ; high technology has developed rapidly , new changes have occurred in people 's ideological concepts and value orientation , there are more social hot spots and difficult points , all kinds of ideas and cultures stir each other , and certain new situations and problems have arisen in social life .  
and the foundation of unity and stability has been further strengthened .  At the same time , with the continual deepening of reform and opening , there have emerged diverse economic elements and economic interests as well as diverse lifestyles and organizational forms in society , resulting in new changes in the economic structure and social relationships .  As a result , we are faced with many complicated issues entailing both benefits and harms and have encountered many tough and difficult contradictions .  
Similarly , if today 's new and promising actors and actresses with potential can not find opportunities to exercise or display themselves , it would be difficult for them to spring up , become outstanding successors of the military 's rank of actors and actresses and truly become pillars of the military 's work in the literary and artistic field .  
In the face of new changes taking place in the domestic and international situation and new development in ideological education for young people , we feel deeply that Comrade Jiang Zemin 's speech has a clear objective , that it targets at the current problems , and that it is of great practical meaning , and it has made us realize even more the urgency and difficult nature of young people 's ideological education .  
Before Clinton left for his South Asia visit , US Secretary of State Albright stated outright that India has an enormous middle class - a group of consumers with immense power who are difficult to ignore .  Developing trade and economic cooperation with India will bring the United States enormous economic benefits .  
The party committee of this brigade learned from its investigations that alongside the deepening and development of reform and opening up , some cadres and soldiers were lacking in a necessary mental preparation for the impacts that had been exerted on their personal interests by certain reform polices of the state and the army ; and when faced with practical problems , such as the layoff of their family members and an increasingly difficult situation in the resettlement of demobilized armymen , these cadres and soldiers would usually feel puzzled and would develop doubts and misgivings .  
As Taiwan Island is a narrow and small area , its military targets are relatively concentrated .  Moreover , Taiwan is close to the mainland , these relatively concentrated targets , in time of war , are susceptible to attacks from all directions and in various forms , and will be destroyed very quickly .  It is difficult to conserve the strength for the second attack and decisive battle .  
The success of the exercise fully reflected the great achievements of the air force logistics system in seriously implementing Chairman Jiang Zemin 's strategic thinking on strengthening the army through science and technology , persisting in taking as their goal winning a high-tech local war , and actively launching mass science and technology training , closely centering on the focal and difficult points in logistics in actual combat .  
If we only reckon up dead accounts , it will be very difficult to do a good job in fiscal work , and we may stifle it to death , which will have a direct impact on the economic and political results of financial expenditure , on economic and social development , and on the expansion of sources of finance and the strengthening of the state 's finances .  
If the US Government could be introspective regarding their failure , it would not be difficult to discover that the politicizing of human rights is wishful thinking , and has already caused a lot of countries in the world , especially developing countries , to be strongly disapproving .  And it is also an obstacle to all kinds of economic development by the United Nations . This affects dialogue and cooperation about human rights between all member countries .  
As of date , the unit has established medical , transportation , ordnance , maintenance , telecommunications , and other groups to engage in supporting campaigns and studying methods of operations .  It has exerted great efforts to tackle the most difficult scientific and technical problems and decided on more than 10 topics of study .  The 30-plus theses it published have attracted the attention of academic departments and higher-level administrative departments .  
We must , through vigorous ideological-political work , enable Marxism to firmly control the ideological and cultural fields and make it difficult for all kinds of reactionary , decadent , and backward political viewpoint , ideology , and life style to gain a foothold and spread .  
The " three-three 's system " of raising money for basic subsistence payments to workers laid off from the SOEs has been difficult to implement fully .  There are some laid-off workers who have not received a sufficient basic subsistence allowance , while there are other laid-off workers who have no basic subsistence support because the enterprises have ceased production , and there are occasional incidents in which groups in society appeal to higher authorities or impede public order .  
Zhu Rongji stated that , only if the entire country makes a concerted effort from top to bottom to establish a better social security system will this difficult but grand undertaking definitely be able to succeed , making it possible for us to promote great advances in the reform of China 's socialist market economy system and lay an even firmer foundation for achieving the great goal of national modernization .  
However , the FRY also took advantage of the battlefield environment , including the complex topography of the country , the dense vegetation , and the extremely variable weather conditions to make it difficult for NATO 's reconnaissance and bombing to be effective , and they actually destroyed or damaged numerous U.S . planes , including an F-117 stealth fighter .  
Over a long period of time , our military academies have integrated basic education with professional training .  As a result , our military academies have been vacillating between building a solid foundation for their students and meeting the need of students ' first job after their graduation .  This practice has made it difficult to enhance students ' quality and achieve economic performance of scale .  
Piracy has seriously disturbed the economic and cultural operational orders in the country and worsened the environment for national cultural industries ' survival , thus causing a massive drain on state revenues and causing cultural business units ' failure to gain an advantageous position in competition amid world economic integration by making it difficult for them to achieve effective accumulation and rapidly expand their industrial scale .  
Against such a backdrop , we should give full play to the armed forces ' fine traditions and encourage team efforts to solve problems together .  To achieve research breakthroughs , we should form many cooperative collectives with top-notched scientists as the cores .  This means that we should choose a large number of authoritative , reputable , innovative scientists with supervisory ability to head these collectives and organize and coordinate all quarters to tackle difficult technological issues and carry out large , strategic , frontline , and exploratory projects .  
It must be noted that with the end of the economy of shortage , low-standard surpluses are reflected in most fields of merchandise , that our economic structure does not meet the needs of the new macroeconomic situation , and that if the economic structure is not promptly readjusted and optimized , it will be difficult to maintain sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development .  
Ours is a huge country with very low starting point .  And with difficult tasks ahead , it would be very difficult for us to face with complex contradictions , to organize and guide hundreds and millions of people to plunge into fierce competition in the new century , to realize our grand goals , and to find a foothold for the Chinese nation if we do not have a large number of the " solid rock " leading cadres who are trusted and supported by the masses .  
Leading cadres should take the lead in studying the " Three Represents " , should publicize and disseminate the " Three Represents " through their personal fruitful experiences , and should go deep down to the grassroots units , instructing them face to face , explaining the difficult points and unclear points , inspiring and guiding them , and assisting the Party members and broad numbers of officers and soldiers in grassroots units in their effectively studying and satisfactorily carrying out the important thinking of the " Three Represents " .  
Although it is still difficult to set a standard for quantification of economic globalization , viewed from the angle of nature , at least the following three characteristics are important .  The global distribution of key economic elements has become very convenient and rapid ;  
China is a country with dense population and little cultivated land .  For a considerably long period of time , it will be difficult to change the basic trend in which population is increasing , and cultivated land is decreasing .  We must regard the protection of cultivated land as one of the major affairs affecting the national economy and the people 's livelihood as well as the country 's sustainable development , and must never slacken efforts in grasping it at any time .  
As all types of economic targets are large in number and wide in scope ; are interrelated with one another ; and are under the control of different departments , some of which are also large in size ; are exposed to a large extent ; and are highly vulnerable owing to their state of production , operation , or utilization in peace time , it is difficult and costly to protect them .  Also it is unrealistic to protect them in an all-round way and hard to raise their protection efficiency .  
and should conduct emergency repair-oriented professional or technical training and comprehensive simulated training so as to strengthen our capability of handling an emergency situation or conducting an emergency repair under the complex , difficult , or dangerous conditions during a war and ensure that certain economic targets , which are damaged to a certain extent , will be quickly repaired and restored to normal operation in a timely fashion , thus reducing damages and avoiding further damages .  
The Guangzhou Military Region , which is located on the forefront of reform and opening up , has always been carrying out ideological and political work with emphasis on studying and solving new situation and problems under the conditions of reform , opening up and the development of a socialist market economy , on studying and solving main , difficult , hot and doubtful problems faced by various units at present , and on summing up and promoting effective experiences in army building in the new period with good results .  
In future local wars , the boundaries between strategy , operation , and tactics are vague , making the identification of operation and strategic networks even more difficult .  Strategic information , operation information , and tactical information will flow orderly in an integrated network environment , and display the characteristics of close inter-linked and integration .  
Specifically , it is necessary to achieve actual effects in correcting the guiding ideology for work and overcoming the formalism , in enhancing the unit 's level of training the military with science and technology , in strengthening the ideological and political building of the unit , and in resolving the hot and difficult issues which have confounded the grass-roots level over a long period of time .  
The lake was more than 1,000 meters wide between its southern and northern banks .  Though it was by no means difficult for someone carrying nothing to cross the lake , it was indeed far from easy for the " special combat " soldiers , who were each carrying equipment as heavy as or more than 20 kilograms , to do the same .  
During recent years , they " sharpened " themselves with the tasks of dealing with the priorities and difficulties in information operations and electronic countermeasures , established more than 20 tasks to tackle difficult problems in science-technology military training , including acquiring new knowledge , mastering new equipment , studying new military tactics and training high-quality personnel .  Through taking specific measures such as fixing the training content , measures , levels , and steps , they institutionalized and standardized science-technology military training .  
" It is difficult to draw a human being but it is easy to draw a ghost " .  This is how the Chinese describe tricks aimed at deceiving people with fabricated stories , meaning that it is difficult to deceive people with what is real or can be seen but easy to lead people astray with what is absurd or preposterous .  
Currently we regulate and control the money supply mainly by controlling the total credit of state-owned commercial banks and we have not yet adopted indirect regulation and control means in real terms in this regard .  After China enters the WTO , changes in money supply and swings in interests in international markets will have a direct impact on China 's domestic financial market and money supply and they will make it more difficult to regulate and control money supply .  Consequently , China 's existing macroscopic financial regulation and control will face challenges .  
Moreover , the group army has also smoothed out and studied or tackled through its training exercises on the sea some difficult issues laid bare during several joint combat exercises held over the past few years , which have involved the units of various arms , including the group army itself .  
It was disclosed that the entire system is likely to cost as much as $ 60-billion upon completion .  However , no one is yet sure if the system will serve as " a seamless heavenly robe " free of problems upon completion .  Moreover , as modern science and technology are still developing at lightning speed , it is difficult to tell if the NMD system will end up as a heap of waste material in future .  
It has made one innovation after another and has developed " tools for cooking and distributing hot foods " , " water filters for camp and field training " , " mobile barracks on vehicles " , and " oil heaters for cold areas on plateaus " .  It has laid a solid foundation for solving difficult problems that restrain long distance mobile support for the armed forces .  
The efforts to seek truth and practical results have made each and every flower of reform in the scientific and technological military training bear the fruit of enhancing the troops ' ability of " winning in war " .  Some difficult questions concerning fighting under high-tech conditions have been effectively solved .  
All the achievements in military theory research presented this time deal with major practical questions concerning preparation for military struggle and furthering of scientific and technological military training , with focus on key and difficult questions concerning combined-arms joint operations , air assault and air defense .  They are the result of thorough exploration of the characteristics and law of fighting and scientific and technological military training under the high-tech conditions .  They serve specific purposes , and they are highly directive and feasible , reflecting the latest achievements made by the PLA in military theory research .  
In this way , they have effectively solved the difficult problem of insufficient sustained supporting strength for the airborne troops , and the airborne troops now have reliable " mobile warehouses " .  This indicates the airborne troops have taken a historical leap forward from being able to air-drop troops alone to being able to conduct combined operations .  
It is necessary to adhere to the policy of having priorities , focusing on developing high-tech equipment that is truly effective on future battlefields , while continually improving the overall technology level of existing armaments and accelerating renovation and updating efforts , so as to prevent the emergence of a " generational gap " between our side and any enemy , a gap that is difficult to remedy .  
In light of characteristics of a hi-tech war in future , the unit had decided to hold in an unfamiliar water area a training exercise centered on several highly difficult training topics , such as rapid camouflage on the sea , protecting itself against an enemy 's electronic jamming , countering an enemy 's hi-tech reconnaissance , and so on .  
People have come to see that as a regional vehicle for promoting an open trade and an economic and technological cooperation , APEC has been moving at an extremely slow pace in exercising its latter function , and is now unable to meet the economic development needs of its member states in this aspect ; as for its former function , due to an unduly fast speed in the past , APEC has now found it difficult to take another step forward .  
With regard to strengthening mutual trust and cooperation in the military sphere , although Sergeyev 's visit has avoided another storm arising in bilateral military cooperation ties on account of the espionage affair , the hard ice that has long formed between the two countries can hardly undergo a complete thaw in one or two visits , and " a still more difficult path lies ahead . "  
In the past decade , with the implementation of President Jiang Zemin 's instruction on " working hard to build revolutionized , modernized and regularized anti-chemical warfare units , " our country 's anti-chemical warfare units have basically formed a new fighting system marked by the new generation of " ordinance for anti-chemical warfare " and has achieved significant progress in solving major and difficult problems .  Our country has in the main formed a new type of anti-chemical warfare training system with a new generation of training program .  
Party committees and governments in all localities included the warmth-giving activities in their overall work arrangements .  In the whole country , 358,000 leading cadres at all levels set up fixed connection with 45,000 enterprises encountering business difficulties and 629,000 worker families living in difficult condition for helping and supporting them .  This further advanced the process of constantly carrying out the warmth-giving activities and institutionalizing such activities on the basis of taking them as regular social activities .  
In light of the operational characteristics of missile vessels and the technical and tactical levels of their attacks , it intensified training in such difficult areas as twin planes ' minimum altitude attacks and interception .  
In early winter , a certain naval submarine detachment conducted a highly difficult , all-directional live ammunition combat drill in the surging waters of the East China Sea . During the exercise , one submarine after another used deep submerging and other new tactics to successively break the multiple defense lines formed by the " enemy 's " destroyers and convoy ships .  After infiltrating into the " enemy 's " position , the submarines waited for opportunities to attack the enemy targets .  
The new century has only just begun , and with the surging tide of economic globalization , the new arms race about which people are continually concerned is exhibiting a growing momentum which is difficult to check .  It is not easy to be optimistic about the prospects for arms control .  This has cast a dark shadow over the world 's military security .  
The emergence of key and difficult problems makes some new demands on the organizational structure , the internal division of effort , the means and methods , and the scope of application of ideological and political work , and in the mutual relationships among these things .  How to draw new boundaries and achieve new standardization of these things , and make them form up an integrated whole which is full of vitality , is an important aspect of strengthening and improving ideological and political work in the new situation .  
The resolution of key and difficult problems certainly does not lie in shouting slogans more loudly .  It lies in starting out with a recognition of reality , revolving around real problems of widespread concern to the broad masses of officers and soldiers , thinking of practical moves , taking real action , and working steadily and surely to solve the problems .  
Japan recently published its " Medium-term Reorganization and Equipment Plan for the Defense Force for 2001-2005 . "  It is not difficult to see from this that , to fit in with its strategic goal of becoming a major political power , Japan is now making efforts to develop in the direction of becoming a strong military power , and will build the Japanese Self-defense Force into a new defense force with stronger capability , faster reaction , and more capable of dealing with " peripheral events . "  
The military , as an armed group responsible for carrying out special political tasks , should not only be ready to physically fight in battlefields to complete urgent , difficult , dangerous and heavy tasks given by the Party and the people , but also live through various tests and make mental and physical contributions to the reform and construction .  
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have now entered a critical stage , and the unfinished final position negotiations involve the most complex and sensitive issues ; it is difficult to take one step forward , which requires tremendous efforts on both sides .  
" Small , remote , scattered and directly administered " military units work in such posts as telecom , piloting , scientific and technological studies and logistics supply , and carry out such tasks as fighting , training , military duties and logistics supply .  Most of these units call for high technological levels , shouldering important responsibilities , work in crucial posts , and play a vital role in grassroots construction .  These units are also a difficult issue to handle in grassroots construction .  
Equipped with such a portable tent , a patrol or inspection team is capable of taking a rest or staying in an area at any time , should it fail to reach a destination in time or encounter bad weather , and this has also enhanced the regiment 's control over some key areas or sandy areas , to which access is difficult .  
In the process of accelerating and advancing military modernization , if our military 's party members uphold obsolete ideas and concepts , lack high scientific and technological attainment , and lack the ability to skillfully use modern weapons and armaments and to give appropriate commands in modern wars , it will be difficult for these party members to embody the advanced nature of the party members and make great achievements in the military 's reform and construction .  
It is very difficult see the embodiment of the advanced nature in party members like these .  Promoting this educational campaign for maintaining the advanced nature of party members is of great significance for implementing the requirement of focusing the minds of party members on the correct theory , spurring the real work of the military , solving existing problems in the contingent of party members , advancing the military 's party-building in the new period and pushing forward the military modernization construction .  
Some analyses say that the PRC fighter intentionally struck the American craft , thinking to force the US plane to land on Chinese soil .  Some people also say that the American plane made a sudden turn toward the Jian-8 as though it were a bicycle moving forward of its own volition .  It is difficult to grasp the distances at which fighter planes pass at high speeds , where a tiny slip can mean a crash and death to the crew .  
Corruption is a hotbed for breeding criminal syndicates and the evil forces .  Behind all the criminal syndicates cracked by the public security organs , there are always well-connected networks and " protective umbrellas " that are complicated and difficult to deal with .  
Base leaders and official personnel will be deeply involved in on-site training , directing the troops in drawing up concrete training plans , scientifically arranging the contents of training , conducting strict inspections and supervising the organization and implementation of training .  They will participate in researching and attacking difficult key problems , comprehensively coordinating the relations among all the troops participating in the training , providing relevant assurances to the troops , and making a preliminary exploration of the use of large-scale training bases to organize joint training for different branches of the armed forces .  
Compared to ordinary fighters , the unmanned Stealth fighter is more suited to carrying out highly difficult missions , such as long-range surprise attacks on enemy targets with dense air defenses , sneak attacks on enemy biological and chemical weapon bases , and interception of cruise missiles , and so on .  
The western region 's garrisons have formulated some concrete implementation measures , but society 's low overall scientific and technological standards have made it very difficult in practice for the troops to develop an awareness for science and technology , to coordinate science and technology to tackle the tough problems , and to introduce and propagate the successful results .  
They even slept near the door to fence off cold winds for their comrades .  In peaceful times , Party members took the lead in answering the call of the Party , executing Party lines and completing urgent , difficult , dangerous and heavy tasks .  
Reportedly , although many proposals on adjusting China 's foreign policy have been sent to Zhongnanhai , as a leadership change at the upcoming 16th party congress is not far away , Jiang Zemin hopes to accomplish the transfer of power in a stable political environment , so the difficult policy issues will be left up to his successor .  Therefore , China will continue to maintain its existing foreign policy for the time being , and will continue to behave in a manner of " hiding its strength and biding its time " in international affairs .  
National model workers Li Huangxi , Bao Qian , Wang Yiqiang , Sun Haijun , Zhang Ruimin successively spoke on such subjects as striving to be new-type industrial workers in the new era , carrying forward the spirit of doing pioneering work against difficult conditions , rebuilding beautiful natural environment , and enhancing the enterprise 's international competitive power .  
He stated that the science and technology hall is an important place for people to acquire scientific and technical knowledge , understand science and technology , and exchange S &amp; T knowledge and results , as well as being a base for primary and middle-school students to engage in quality education , so we should make full use of existing facilities , enhancing the content of the exhibits and also doing a good job of making the briefings and lectures lively and explaining difficult concepts in simple terms .  
To find a way out of the difficult position , create a peaceful and stable external environment , reinvigorate the economy , and make the country prosperous and powerful , the DPRK is endeavoring to implement an omnidirectional foreign policy , with the stress on developing the relations with EU member states and has sent delegations one after another to EU member states , and thus laid a foundation for improvement of bilateral political and economic relations .  
In recent years , a submarine chaser group of the East Sea Fleet has successfully accomplished dozens of urgent , difficult , dangerous , and arduous tasks , such as emergency and disaster rescue , locating shipwrecks , and going on patrol at sea .  It has won the title of advanced unit in military training from the higher authorities for many years in a row and is known as " hunters " of the East China Sea .  
In the boundless vast sea of clouds and the vast sky filled with gun smoke , Fu Shaoyin and the young fellows of the " blue army " detachment placed the " red army " in a difficult position time and again with their nimble and skillful technical tactics as well as rapid , cunning , and stubborn striking power .  
In order to gain the initiative in maneuver operations at night , this regiment actively organized pilots to conduct night maneuvers at unfamiliar airports , aviation routes , airspace and environment ; laid ambushes ; and made long-distance raids and carried out other difficult training subjects in an effort to vigorously improve the quality of flights as well as the organizational planning and command coordination ability of commanders , and tempered their mentality , technology , and other comprehensive qualities .  
There are two reasons why the United States has decided to give up its strategy of " winning two local wars breaking out simultaneously . "  First , the United States has been feeling that its military strength and transport capability are inadequate and its financial resources are insufficient , making it difficult to continue to hit others using two fists at the same time .  
Only evaluating " horses " will be tantamount to give the power of initiative on personnel training to history , making the difficult process of personnel training a process of living or dying without external interference .  When there is an urgent need , there will be shortages of needed personnel , and it then becomes necessary to pick the taller ones among short people .  
Try and imagine , the moment a rocket lifts off from earth and shoots into the sky , the tremendous sense of accomplishment and happiness that surges in the hearts of every person involved in space flight when seeing the ever shrinking difference between the level of China 's space flight technology and the most advanced international levels and when seeing the ever increasing international position of China as a result of this is something that is difficult for the ordinary person to understand .  
At a regular press conference held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today , Zhu Bangzao , spokesman of the ministry , said while asserting the necessity of paying attention to international coordination and developing friendly relations with all countries in Asia , Japan 's leader has insisted on visiting the Yasukuni Shrine , which houses memorial tablets of Japanese Class-A war criminals .  We find it difficult to understand this .  
This requires that this party be composed of advanced people who have a common ideal , strict discipline and close relations with the people and the masses and that this party be able to struggle in an unswerving manner despite the extremely difficult and dangerous environment .  
As noted in " The Decision on the Party 's Few Historical Issues Since the Founding of New China " , " Generally speaking , having relatively successfully conducted such a complex , difficult and profound social revolution in such a large country with hundreds of millions of people and having accelerated the development of the national economy including agriculture and industry is really a great historical victory " .  
Governments at all levels and various government departments should make the basic interests of the masses of people the starting point of all work and take effective measures to solve difficult problems of universal concern to the masses of people .  At present , we should do the following three tasks well : first , it is necessary to effectively strengthen public security work and to go all out to safeguard social and political stability .  
Then , aside from assigning the personnel with doctorate or master 's degrees to units with modern equipment and positions that require scientific and technical expertise , the region also gave them important military assignments to accomplish , or assigned them to oversee projects of tackling difficult operational and training problems .  
He said : Russia and the United States are shouldering the special responsibility of safeguarding world peace and stability and building a new international security framework .  All this needs efforts to conduct close bilateral cooperation and international cooperation .  Any unilateral action may make solutions for modern social problems difficult .  
As the situation of regional development has been changing and non-stop various international forces have been involved in the region , the unique ethnic , cultural conditions and the difficult regional security issues of the Eurasian area have been plaguing each country of the region .  
In the period of the democratic revolution , his main contribution was to combine the universal truth of Marxism with China 's specific conditions and set forth the theory of new democracy , which resolved the question of how to take the path of the Russians , and thus resolved a major difficult issue in the course of Sinicizing Marxism .  
second , it is even more difficult to do this because we are confronted with the new situation characterized by the new scientific and technological revolution in the 21st century and the fierce competition worldwide , with a serious challenge from our double mission to achieve China 's modernization , and with the magnificent task of building a socialist material civilization and a socialist spiritual civilization .  
They are unwilling to delve into reality , to get down and mix with the masses , and to conduct difficult and detailed investigative research .  Even if they do try this , it is just a gourd dropping into a well : it seems to sink , but then it just floats on the surface .  These organizations report good news , but not anything that might be worrying , or they report a lot of good news and little that is bad .  
To triumph in future sea battles under a high-tech environment , in recent years officers and men of the logistical department of the East China Sea Fleet base have centered on the most complex and difficult situations , combined theoretical study and training on the sea , and boldly reformed and innovated logistical measures to stage splendid performances in logistical support on the sea .  
They have also dispatched the fleet to the sea to conduct test training in different sea areas and under different weather conditions .  They have successively completed more than 30 difficult training courses , including replenishment in rocky areas at night , round-the-clock comprehensive supplies from all directions , replenishment in strong waves and winds , and joint logistical replenishment tasks by military and civilian vessels .  
In recent years , the base 's relevant departments have repeatedly organized rapid mobilization of maritime medical teams from its hospital and urgently dispatched them for training in sea rescue , with some of them participating in the highly difficult joint ship-airplane rescue drills .  
Thus far , pilots of this flight squadron have independently fulfilled the highly difficult tasks of two planes flying parallel at night , landing under the guidance of airport lights , and flying at night in extremely complicated weather .  As a result , the night flexible operation capacity of this squadron has been enhanced greatly .  
However , if Western developed countries continue to turn a blind eye to the global wide gap between the rich and the poor , large quantity of unemployment , and ecological damage , and if they continue to turn a deaf ear to the voice of developing countries and ordinary people , President Bush perhaps will see more miserable tragedies in greater numbers , and it will also be difficult for the United States not to get involved .  
Lianyungang and other localities have brought into full play the role of high-tech facilities of military bases in the field of coastal defense surveillance and have built and improved a multilevel surveillance and intelligence network for the sea and coastal regions ( including islands ) .  This has enhanced the coastal defense monitoring capability in ocean and territorial airspace , not merely restricted to coastal beaches , thus solving the difficult problem in coastal defense management .  
Since the introduction of the reform and opening-up program , our army has firmly implemented the Party 's basic line , and supported reform with actual deeds .  It has correctly dealt with difficult problems such as helping officers and men transfer to civilian jobs , become decommissioned , and settle down , and assisting their family members find jobs .  It has successfully fulfilled the task of reshuffling and streamlining the army , actively participated in and supported the local economic construction projects , and resolutely strengthened unity and stability in the country .  
In the 80 years since its founding , the CPC has grown from a small and weak force to a big and strong one .  It has defeated formidable enemies in extremely difficult conditions and kept forging ahead in a tortuous course of exploration , accumulating very rich experiences .  
Officials of the senior presidential office and the Executive Yuan admitted frankly that direct shipping between the two sides of the strait constitutes the most difficult part in the current plan to comprehensively open up cross-strait economic and trade exchanges , but the initial plan will still designate six domestic ports as the cargo handling ports for cross-strait shipping .  
Following the continuous implementation of the proactive fiscal policy in depth , China had witnessed a major turnaround in economic development in 2000 .  The annual GDP grew 8 percent in 2000 .  The state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises had notably improved their economic performances .  China had basically achieved its goal to lift difficult enterprises out of their economic trouble .  Its exports increased by 28 percent and fiscal revenues reached 1.338-trillion yuan , a growth of 193.6-billion yuan over that in 1999 .  Its financial operation remained stable .  
The Military Region Air Force not only further increased the frequency of no-notice attacks , it also made them more difficult and intense .  When it selected air routes , it broke free of the previous method of using high altitudes and the same routes .  It made a point to select low altitudes , extra low altitudes , and new air routes , to minimize radar warning time as much as possible .  
Governments at all levels should show deep care for the people , always care about the well-being of the working masses living in difficult conditions , fully rely on the masses , rely on the community management organizations , do careful and meticulous work , find out the concrete conditions of the people living in difficult conditions , effectively arrange the necessary funds needed by the issuance of minimum livelihood allowances through adjusting the structure of financial revenue and expenditure .  
It should be pointed out that Junichiro Koizumi has never distinguished between " those who made sacrifices " and other " dead people . "  He emphatically said in his statement : " Facing those war dead who charged forward without any hesitation regarding the future of the motherland in the difficult times , I once again realize that Japan 's peace and prosperity today is built on the basis of their valuable sacrifices . .  
actively organize and encourage both army troops and militia reserves to plunge themselves in the current large-scale development of the country 's western region ; take up urgent , difficult , dangerous , and heavy tasks on our own initiative ; and strive for dual effects of promoting economic development and consolidating the defense building in line with the principle of manufacturing products for both peacetime and wartime use and for both military and civilian use .  
In accordance with the requirements of actual combat , the division has vigorously developed and strengthened its training .  It conducted successfully for the first time a tactical bombing training program in the small hours of the morning .  It has increased the proportion and intensity of training in highly difficult programs such as landing in adverse weather and through the use of marking lights .  
However , because of the poor quality of the pilots of the communist troops , it was impossible for them to understand more difficult tactics .  Therefore , the communist troops developed a set of pithy formula , which the pilots recited whenever they were followed by a rattlesnake missile .  After reciting the formula , they turned a sharp angle to try to shake off the missile .  
Today , Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wu Dawei said here that in the past few months of this year , with the occurrence of such events as the historical issue , Lee Teng-hui 's visit to Japan , and the Japanese prime minister 's action of paying homage at Yasukuni Shrine , Sino-Japanese relations have been bogged down in the most difficult condition over the past 30 years since the normalization of diplomatic relations .  The Japanese side should create favorable conditions for getting Sino-Japanese relations out of this predicament by resolving the current existing problems .  
Since reform and opening up , urban and rural residents have increased their incomes by a relatively big margin , the masses have obtained actual benefits but , on the whole , the people 's living standards are still low , the laid-off staff and workers in cities and towns are leading a relatively difficult life , and more than 30 million people have not resolved the food and clothing problem yet .  Therefore , long-term and painstaking efforts are still needed to enhance the people 's living standards .  
The historical contribution of the Taiwan Strait area and the Western Pacific coastal area in the 21st century , and whether it will create wealth or engender more conflict , will be decided based on whether the leaders of Taiwan , poised at a crossroads , can accurately judge the trends of the times , distinguishing true historical opportunities from false , in order to successfully negotiate the difficult situation in which they find themselves .

Second , our country 's economic restructuring has entered a crucial stage , and industries are in a historical stage of large-scale readjustment .  If we do not set up and improve the social security system , it will be impossible to realize the fundamental reform of state-owned enterprises , there will be no way to readjust the industrial structure , and it will be difficult to maintain social stability .  
The Tibet issue has all along been a " human rights " hot spot ; even then the CSHRS has not evaded this difficult issue but instead has expounded , with a host of facts , on the great changes that have taken place since Tibet implemented the democratic reform and wiped out the feudal serfdom to refute the Dalai clique and international hostile forces ' distortions of and attacks on Tibet 's human rights situation .  
The part of cross-strait relations in the new Taiwan leader 's inaugural speech superficially looked mild and prudent in words and phrases and involved no hackneyed and stereotyped expressions openly advocating " Taiwan independence . "  However , if we read this speech more carefully , it will not be difficult for us to find that this new leader did not make any concession on the issues related to principles , did not free himself from the keynotes of " the two-state theory , " and stubbornly adhered to the stance on " Taiwan independence . "  
When elucidating the human rights situation of the motherland of China , it is very correct to emphasize that the right to survive is fundamental .  However , explaining " democracy and human rights " to the Taiwan compatriots is even more complicated , and is also very difficult to manage .  But , this is possibly much more powerful than guided missiles , so it is worth striving to try to do .  
If we do not speed up development of China 's economic and scientific and technological undertakings and work hard to narrow the gap with advanced global levels , we will have a difficult time taking hold of initiative in the fierce international competition .  
The Chinese people have generally practiced pacifism and have the thinking and natural instincts of assuming the defensive .  These are integrated with their strong traditional ideology of blood relationship and their special social crowd structure .  One of the results of this humane culture is that hegemonism which is aimed at invading other countries will be difficult to develop .  
For quite a long time to come , it will still be difficult to change the basic trends of an increasing population and decreasing farmland .  It is imperative to protect farmland , regarding it as a major issue that has a bearing on the national economy and the people 's livelihood and on sustainable development .  At no time should we relax work in this respect .  
The government 's investment in the development of science and technology is limited by its financial resources , and it can not attend to each and every aspect of the development of science and technology but should be responsible mainly for organizing , administering , and funding basic research and make necessary coordination and providing necessary funds for projects to tackle key difficult problems in advanced technology ; as for the general development and application of science and technology , they should be left to enterprises .  
The trends of international development in recent yeas show that as the funds needed for investment in research and development have been doubled and redoubled , enterprises have been unable to innovate in products alone and that with the rapid renewal of knowledge and technology , it is difficult for enterprises , although with patents and intellectual property rights , to recover their investments in research and development in a short period of time before the appearance of other newer technologies .  
The party 's ideological and political work , which has become even more arduous and difficult under the increasingly complicated circumstances , is by no means dispensable or fruitless ; rather , it is indispensable and well worth doing . 
The whole army should bring into play the excellent traditions and work styles of our army stationing troops to open up wastelands and guarding the frontiers and pioneering enterprises with painstaking efforts and being bold in undertaking urgent , difficult , dangerous , and arduous tasks to perform meritorious services in the big west development .  
Due to the facts that the trend of an economic globalization has come with a swift and violent momentum and that many things still remain undone which should have been accomplished under the rule of the British Hong Kong authorities , and with the addition that the Asian financial turmoil has exploded the economic bubbles that were formed during the rule of the British Hong Kong authorities and has also exposed the problems and long-standing defects in many fields , the reform tasks facing the SAR government have proved extremely difficult and arduous .  
During these 10 years , he bore all types of false charges that had no basis , was subjected to unprecedented humiliation , experienced a lifetime 's most difficult " coming out of retirement , " and faced the most chaotic and irrational political situation .  
Following the growth of the DPP in Taiwan 's political arena , " Taiwan independence " thinkers seem to have felt that the simple slogan of " democracy and human rights " is rather of the grass roots , not comprehensive and profound enough , and difficult to attain the purpose of " winning maximum popular support . "  Besides , an extremely urgent matter for Chen Shui-bian after his inauguration is the debate over reunification and independence , which " democracy and human rights " seem unable to eliminate .  
Second , the US military has a large number of complex and high-tech weapons .  Therefore , there is a large consumption and costly price for logistical and technical support .  In addition , because of independent purchases systems for various weapons of armed services , the maintenance and upkeep is extremely difficult .  
Moreover , the planes ' main components and parts , equipment , airborne weapons , and maintenance technology are highly dependent on foreign countries .  Once a war breaks out in the Taiwan Strait , supply for the planes will become difficult and the number of such planes owned by the Taiwan Air Force will decrease with each plane shut down .  
It has been learned that since the founding of New China , the large number of science and technology personnel and workers of departments taking part in the cooperation in science and technology for national defense have carried forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard work , tackled and solved one difficult technological problem after another , ensured the needs of the development of science and technology for national defense , and made important contribution to the modernization of national defense and economic construction .  
First , it is necessary to step up law enforcement .  Second , it is necessary to cooperate with the State Economic and Trade Commission and other departments and implement the relevant policies and handle the technological and capital matters that will enable the large and medium state enterprises to fulfill the anti-pollution requirements .  Third , it is necessary to further strengthen basic work of fulfilling the anti-pollution requirements in industry , analyze the progress of work , find the focal and difficult points , and offer meticulous and classified guidance .  
established and perfected rules and regulations ; and have satisfactorily resolved many " long-standing , big , and difficult " issues which long defied solution .  Through the education and rectification activity , the vast numbers of cadres in leading organs have enhanced their political awareness and the awareness of responsibility , and have pledged one after another to set an example for the troops with their own conduct in fulfilling the requirement of " three represents . "  
Faced with the crucial situation in cross-strait relations , the station 's officers and men have resolved to support the government 's just stance with practical actions , solidly made relentless preparations , stand in combat readiness , and established the thought of offering themselves first for the whole battle to win the war .  The station is prepared to fight a war under the most difficult situation based on current circumstances .  
Another weak point of the Taiwan military is that it purchases weapons from a variety of countries ; their quality , performance , and operating regulations differ , with the result that it is very difficult to form the weapon systems into a complete perfect set , and this has a direct impact on taking advantage of their combat capability .  
Many in the political circles , public opinion , and even the " vice president " Annette Lu [ Lu Xiulian ] , all hold a reserved attitude toward Chen Shui-bian 's trip .  They believe that Chen Shui-bian 's trip does not conform to what is appropriate for the present time , is full of variables , and that it will be difficult to gain any positive results .  As well , they think it is bound to have a negative impact on the already turbid cross-strait relations .  
With the exception of major and difficult cases they , through study by the collegial panel , should be reported to the president of the people 's court for discussion and final judgment by the judicial council , and judgments of all cases are to be made directly by the collegial panel according to the law .  The chief justice will directly sign the final document according to the law .  
Generally , developing countries possess vast land , have huge populations , are rich in natural resources , and have vast markets .  Without progress in developing countries , it will be difficult for developed countries to maintain lasting prosperity .  
It has been revealed that each test costs some $ 100 million , a preliminary system would cost $ 10 billion , and the entire system could cost as much as $ 60 billion .  Even after spending so much money , no one can say with certainty that the completed system would be flawless and problem free .  Besides , with the rapid development of modern science and technology , it is difficult to predict that the NMD would not become a pile of trash in the future .  
There are also , however , a number of rural problems that can not be neglected ; the main ones are that it is difficult for the peasants to increase income , and their burdens are too heavy , while the work style of certain grassroots cadres is simple and crude and they issue compulsory orders , causing bad incidents and mass incidents in certain localities .  
Every year throughout the military , over one thousand leading cadres at or above the army level have gone among the soldiers to understand the situations , give guidance and lectures , answer and solve hot and difficult educational issues , and give effective guidance on education .  This has produced a lively situation where party committees have attached great importance to education , leaders have worked together to manage it , and officers and men participated in it enthusiastically .  
If war breaks out , the blows dealt to Taiwan 's economy can not be compared to a minor power cut or a major earthquake ; the financial securities market will fall into serious chaos , the stock market will dive , there will be massive exchange rate turbulence , foreign investment will be withdrawn , and the entire Taiwan economy may be paralyzed , so Taiwan will find it very difficult to fight a protracted war with the mainland .  
The practice in the construction of our country has also proved that if the productive forces develop slowly , it will be difficult to resolve various kinds of contradictions and problems exiting in economic and social life , and it will also be difficult to meet the people 's demands for improving their living standard .  
To make a success of training the troops through science and technology , it is necessary to carry it out in close connection with the requirements of actual combat , centering on resolving key and difficult problems in preparations for military struggle , persist in hard and strict training , intensify targeted training , and make efforts to narrow the gap between training and actual combat .  
The report stated " the Fuzhou Theater in particular has rapidly been taking shape as a strong joint operation mechanism for the troops and has greatly enhanced the capability to launch a large-scale joint operation under difficult conditions of having to organize the Theater in a very short period and of personnel coming from different military systems . " 
Speaking to Chinese reporters , Yang Hyong-sop , first vice chairman of the Korean Supreme People 's Assembly , said that 50 years ago today , countless numbers of outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people had , holding high the banner of " resisting US aggression and helping Korea and protecting and defending home and country , " crossed the Yalu River and fought along with the Korean army and people at their most difficult moment .  
Under a new situation , we always insist on the forward direction of advanced Chinese culture and push the prosperous development of socialism 's culture and art to satisfy the growing need for peoples ' cultural spirit , and provide the insured thoughts , motives of spirit and intellectual support for economic development and improvement of the whole society , and build a nice social atmosphere and human cultural circumstance , above are honorable and difficult historical responsibilities of the cultural and art workers .  
Wu Bangguo said : As a traditional industry , the coal industry has to shoulder a heavy historical burden .  In the current process , in which great changes have taken place in market supply and demand and the old economic system is being changed into the new , it is difficult for coal enterprises themselves to completely overcome difficulties they have encountered .  The government must make efforts to create an essential external environment and conditions in all aspects and give them specific support and assistance .  
The " Opinion " puts forth the following demands : Political organs at all levels must have the ability to correctly analyze and understand the state of mind of officers and men in their respective units and make prompt suggestions on how to educate them , ability to give theoretical guidance and to study and solve hot and difficult issues , ability to discover typical examples and sum up experience , and ability to conduct the ideological and political education innovatively in accordance with the actual situation .  
and for servicemen who have served in areas known for harsh conditions or in some special posts .  As for economically underdeveloped areas faced with a heavy or difficult settlement task , the people 's governments at the provincial level may extend to a certain extent the scope of relocated settlement after taking all factors into account .  
Rarely did any of the previous US presidents make it so clear on the issue .  In particular , Bush Junior holds a more conservative attitude toward getting involved in international affairs , while Gore is more active in terms of getting involved in the maintenance of the international order .  It is fairly difficult to decide on a short view as to the election of which will be more favorable to Taiwan .  
Wang Liheng indicated that in the future , the corporation will give priority to developing communications satellites , natural resources satellites , meteorological satellites , disaster reduction satellites , a system of satellites to forecast and appraise small satellites , and the ground application system .  It will also give priority to building a space-ground infrastructure information system with the applied satellites as the major platform and to utilizing space technology to solve the difficult and hot issues emerging in national economic and social development .  
Checked by the definition of the US ' China strategy and the choice of policies , the younger Bush deliberately adopted an uncompromising attitude toward numerous issues concerning China while Gore was unwilling to leave an impression of being weak .  Although the two men 's specific views on China are not completely the same , it is difficult for people to find any substantial differences in their views on China .  
Comrade Deng Xiaoping , chief architect of our country 's socialist reform and opening up , led all party comrades in emancipating their minds , seeking truth from facts , observing the characteristics of the times and the current international situation in an all-round way , summing up foreign and domestic socialist construction as well as historical and immediate experiences , and conducting difficult explorations , thus making important achievements in the theory and practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Qiu Xiaohua pointed out that in future , China should pay special attention to improving the quality of economic growth and organically integrate structural innovation with technical innovation in order to provide a good economic environment for reform to enter a stage of tackling difficult problems and to fundamentally increase the intrinsic vitality of China 's economy .  
Jeffrey Koo said : Advanced countries do not have many restrictions regarding sending back the investment made by transnational companies .  A long time ago when Taiwan did not have an ample foreign exchange reserve , it set a requirement , setting a yearly limit for Taiwan businessmen to remit money to foreign countries .  According to China 's current financial system , it is difficult for Taiwan businessmen to remit their profits back to Taiwan .  
Question : Since the new US president is expected to emerge amidst " wrangling " and the two political parties are also likely to have equal shares in both the Senate and the House of Representatives in the future , will such a situation make it difficult for the executive departments to introduce drastic changes to the existing policies ?  
After going through the " three stresses " campaign , the thinking of every locality is much more free and the spirit is much more inspired ; conspicuous problems , problems of hotspots , and problems of difficult points that all appeared in the process of reform and development have been solved ; the cohesive power and fighting strength of Party organizations have been strengthened ;  
in particular , political forces standing for human rights and environmental protection and opposing free trade have continually expanded , with the result that it was very difficult for Gore to build a broad and close-knit Democratic Party campaign alliance . 
The ideological-political work is a fine tradition of our party that has been handed down from generation to generation .  No matter whether it was during the arduous war years or the rough and difficult period of construction , in-depth and meticulous ideological-political work had always played an indispensable part in uniting the masses , rallying people 's confidence , and expanding our strength .  
Guided by theoretical study , we should step up study of the international strategic situation and the characteristics and law of military management under the high-technology local war conditions and the new situations ; we should actively organize and coordinate military organs , military academies , scientific research units , and the troops , to systematically study crucial and difficult problems .  
Under the current situation in which the standard of China 's rural productive forces is fairly low , it is difficult to carry out agricultural scientific research and development without government support .  
These people are subject to the manipulation of foreign powers and the harmful leadership of a heretical teaching .  The ideology is extreme , the behavior is boundless , and it is very difficult to guarantee that a self-burning incident like the one in Tiananmen will not happen in Hong Kong or perhaps yet another burning tragedy in the country .  
Market competition hinges , to a considerable extent , upon the quality and functions of products .  In order to implement the open strategy of pluralistic markets and " walking out , " it is imperative to concentrate our efforts on heightening the quality and grades of export commodities and enhancing their competitiveness , otherwise , it will be very difficult to guarantee the original market shares , and still more difficult to open up new international markets .  As a result , China 's level of opening to the outside world will be seriously impaired .  
In his letter , Wu Bangguo said : Beginning from 2001 , the Three Gorges Project will enter the most arduous construction period .  The concrete pouring work will be more difficult than before .  In addition , the work of installing heavy metal components as well as mechanical and electronic equipment will enter a peak period .  
( 3 ) Compared with his economic achievements , Clinton was weak and inept in diplomatic strategy .  Since it is very difficult for Bush to demonstrate his economic aptitude within a short period of time , he has to use underhand method to score some points first in foreign affairs .  
They embody the spirit of being highly responsible to the cause of the party and the people , the spirit of faithfully performing duties and making selfless dedications , the humanitarian spirit of being friendly toward people and being patient in helping people being obsessed and misled by the evil cult , the spirit of defending science and upholding the truth , the spirit of fearing no difficulty and daring to undertaking difficult tasks , and the spirit of being responsible and doing down-to-earth work .  
Deputy Zhang Xinan , director of Chenchang town horticultural garden in Hubei 's Xiantao city , said : Because it is currently difficult to collect funds to be retained by a collective , many people are unwilling to be village cadres , and the foundation of grass-roots political power has become shaky .  
Deputy Zhang Baoyi , mayor of Zhangjiakou City , said : This is an amazing achievement .  These years , the work of aiding the poor to tackle difficult problems has been done as an important task from the central to local levels , and actual results have been achieved from formulating policies to inputting human , financial , and material resources into this work .  
Wu Jinglian , famous economist and standing committee member of the National Committee of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference , today at a news conference remarked that the large-scale lay-offs of workers that have occurred in China in recent years are inevitable reflections of the employment system and policies of a planned economy that is undergoing the process of economic transition .  The large influx of excess agricultural labor in non-agricultural industries has also made employment increasingly difficult .  Thus , improving the social environment for employment is a new solution for re-employment .  
Buhe , vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee , joined deputies of the Fujian delegation in discussing Chairman Li Peng 's work report .  He pointed out : In the next few years , we will be facing arduous legislative tasks , and the difficult points in the legislative work will be rather prominent .  We must further quicken the pace of legislation , establish and perfect the socialist legal system .  This is a fundamental measure concerning our country 's long-lasting order and stability and long-term development .  
Competition in the aspect of agricultural development comes more often from the foreign market than from the domestic market .  As far as hundreds of millions of peasants are concerned , it is rather difficult to increase their incomes by simply relying on growing crops .  Having insufficient stamina , township enterprises , which flourished some years ago , find it hard to become a major channel for increasing peasants ' incomes in a short period of time .  
Second , our country was subject to the planned economic system over a long time , and people did not have a good sense of acting according to the legal system .  As a result , it is a common phenomenon that leaders substitute the laws with their words , and law enforcers violate the laws by themselves .  This makes it rather difficult to perform supervision .  
The average per-capita amount of grain was less than 300 jin .  Faced with difficult natural conditions , the masses of cadres and people in Bazhong , earnestly implementing the policies set by the central authorities , have enormously changed the impoverished feature of Bazhong after eight years of unremitting efforts .  
They should take supporting the large-scale development of the western region as an important way to increase their fighting capacity and cultivate their militant style of enduring hardships and daring to fight a hard battle and promote army building in an all-round way by providing aid to local people in carrying out urgent , difficult , dangerous , or important tasks .  2 .  
Miss Yue said the negotiations on financial services were protracted and difficult .  She is therefore particularly pleased that the negotiations were concluded with a substantially improved package of offers with a very broad level of participation from both developed and developing members of the WTO .  
The rest of $ 70 billion are either statutory or contractual payments which we are required to pay under existing policies .  Examples are pensions , social security and legal aid .  It would be difficult to achieve a quantified 5% gain within two to three years in respect of these payments .  
10 .  The way the Ordinance is written has put the main burden of proof on the attending medical practitioner because he has received professional training and would be the most suitable person to give justifications for the application .  Nevertheless , since the medial practitioner is neither the donor nor the recipient , it is difficult for him to represent both parties to submit the proof to the Board and certify that there is no commercial dealing .  
Our critics , both at home and abroad , have accused us of intervening with the aim simply of propping up the stock market ; of being too afraid to face the pain from the necessary interest rate volatility under a strict currency board system operating in difficult conditions ; even of trying to introduce a novel form of state ownership by acquiring a substantial interest in Hong Kong 's major corporations .  
A simplistic approach to the difficult task of determining where the public interest may properly be said to lie may be fine for the armchair commentator , but it is a luxury which the responsible prosecutor , whose decision may have grave and far-reaching consequences for the suspect , for his family , and for the public at large , can ill-afford .  
" As all applications are of a high quality , the selection panel , comprising members from heads and teachers of primary , secondary and special schools , an academic from a tertiary institution and ED officers had a difficult task in coming up with the allocation decisions , " he said .  
As a high standard of proof is required for " criminal offences " , it is often more difficult to convict complicated commercial crimes and takes a great deal of resources and time to establish a case .  As such , the criminal approach to deal with market misconduct may not necessarily have a stronger deferent effect on committed offenders .  
If CWHKT 's basic rental charge remains substantially below cost , which will still be slightly below cost after the increase , other local operators , whose costs are comparable to CWHKT 's , will find it difficult to offer competitive alternative services to the residential market without suffering a loss .  Ultimately , consumers will suffer because of the lack of a truly competitive market , " the spokesman said .  
As Loco-London gold trading are not subject to any financial regulatory regime , the companies are not obliged to keep proper audit trail .  Moreover , the victims signed their contracts without the presence of independent witnesses allowing the companies to easily negate liability from the victims ' losses and make prosecutions more difficult .  
Commenting on the operating results of the Exchange Fund for 1999 , the Chief Executive of the HKMA , Mr Joseph Yam , said that the 20% increase in accumulated surplus was encouraging , particularly in a very difficult year when rising interest rates resulted in volatile financial conditions .  
He explained , " The prolonged economic downturn is making it difficult for some domestic property owners to continue with their monthly mortgage payments .  Some are even forced to sell their properties and move to less satisfactory private housing . "  " And rather than financial gains , the majority of transactions of private domestic property recorded recently have indicated losses to the vendors . "  
The Marre Report on the Future of the English legal profession , published in 1988 , stated that " It is extremely difficult to define the need for legal services .  Unmet need is impossible to quantify . . .  It would be hard to develop research techniques which would give a reliable profile of unmet legal need broken down by type of problem and geographical area " .  
Noting the current difficult economic situation , Mr Tung stressed that the Government would strengthen the service-oriented culture in the civil service by improving its efficiency and quality of service and fostering a higher degree of accountability and responsiveness to public aspirations .  
Under such circumstances , it is too difficult and too demanding to follow the set of high moral standards of Confucianism and be " filial , respectful to the elders , loyal and truthful " .  
Under such circumstances , it is too difficult and too demanding to follow the set of high moral standards of Confucianism and be ' filial , respectful to the elders , loyal and truthful ' .  
" Subject to the approval by the Authority 's Rental Housing Committee at its meeting next week , the enhanced RAS would go a long way in addressing the concern expressed by many housing concern groups , and provide a timely relief for needy public rental housing tenants under the prevailing difficult economic situation , " Mr Ng said . 
Dr Ho said the Accident and Emergency Ward at Prince of Wales Hospital would be closed for three days because many of the medical staff had reported sick and it was difficult to operate the service with the remaining manpower , and urgent patients would be taken to the nearest alternative hospital .  
Although lighting candles is not regarded as burning candles or wax under the regulation , people celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival should place a metal can or other non-flammable containers under the candles to collect melted wax for easy disposal in litter bins .  This way , they can avoid leaving unsightly blobs of wax on the ground , on leisure facilities and on kerbs of planters , which are extremely difficult to remove .  
Although a large number of surplus teachers and fresh graduates of the Hong Kong Institute of Education ( HKIEd ) have indicated that it is difficult to secure a teaching post , I have received complaints that some schools have employed untrained university graduates as " permitted teachers " in the current school year .  
Following this abstract beginning came more familiar excerpts from " Swan Lake " and " Gypsy . " The next item however , was a modern ballet entitled " Incense Light " ( traditional heritage ) , designed by Huang and with music composed by Li Tai-hsiang perhaps even more difficult to understand than in the " Love Story of the Torch " .  
Furthermore , hydraulic power has been exploited to the maximum in Taiwan already . Though there is great potential in the development of nuclear power , the sources of raw material are mainly overseas , and the radioactive residue is difficult to dispose of .  
If prepared well , the meat is juicy , tender , and delectable . Preparing crabs is not difficult . First clean two fresh crabs in cold water .  
Now , it is recognized as Kuo Chu or national drama , since it is a genuine Chinese art form which upholds traditional virtues such as loyalty , filial piety , chastity , justice and righteousness . No matter what its name , however , there is no doubt that strenuous efforts must be made to save this ancient art from extinction . The biggest reason for the decline of Peiping opera is the fact that its classical language is difficult for members of the younger generation to understand .  
Educational opportunities are extremely limited , with room in colleges for only 3% of the youth . Strict social controls make it difficult for peasants to escape their traditional agricultural roles ; such opportunities are rarer now than they were before 1949 . Indeed , the mainland China of today has become quite conservative : those in positions of authority are mostly from poor agricultural backgrounds with little formal education .  
Moreover , the costs in broken lives , lost educations , and destroyed books and artworks are incalculable and difficult for Westerners to imagine . It is even more painful to realize that Mao launched the " Cultural Revolution " in order to attain the lofty goals of eliminating poverty , bureaucratic excesses and class differences , but became so intoxicated with his own delusions and solutions that he was blinded to the wishes of the people who were forced to follow his orders .  
Although jade was difficult to carve because of its incredible hardness , the stone was cherished for its lustrous sheen , and pure , clean lines .  
Jean 's soft manner has been advantageous in her often difficult position as negotiator in an organization that is part public and part private , where the interests of the two may often conflict . Jean feels that she must maintain a calm work attitude to counter the stereotype of the emotional female .  
The rapidly rising standard of living in the Republic of China has led to the increasing diversification of life for its citizens . As options increase , the average citizen becomes busier - - previous chores become more difficult to accomplish as a greater proportion of time is spent engaged in differing activities .  
Puppet theatre has experienced difficult times as of late . A rural art , it lost much of its audience in the tremendous urbanization of the past twenty years . In addition , being educated has come to mean being Westernized for many people , leaving them to shun traditional Chinese art .  
China , to the foreigners , was mysterious , ancient , complex , and difficult to understand . Since coming here , the foreigners characterize the typical Chinese personality as " diligent , " " honest , " " warm and lively , " " hospitable , " " willing to take on challenges , " " family-oriented , " and " self centered . "  
Q : Now that the R . O . C has severed diplomatic relations with Nicaragua , it is rumored that Uruguay may establish ties with the Mainland . In the face of international political realities , it is very difficult for the R . O . C to appeal to " morality " and limited agricultural and economic aid as a basis for diplomacy . How should we deal with this situation ?  
Comparing his black and white with his color photographs , the former appear more cohesive , and more poignant . His color works often emphasize atmosphere , tone , and composition at the expense of the subject . Creating balance among these various elements is , needless to say , a difficult task .  
Unless we further accelerate the training of technical personnel , it will be difficult for us to join the ranks of the industrialized nations . 4 ) Sluggish renovation of technology by private enterprise . The most fundamental reason why the nation 's industrial structure is weak and its speed of adjustment is slow is that the level of creativity in products and production processes is inadequate and technological renovation by private enterprise is sluggish .  
He lost his father at 11 . At 12 he went to Sydney , Australia , and then to the Juliard School in New York at 15 . At 17 he won the grand prize in the Empress Sofia music competition in Spain . At 18 he signed with the famous ICM management group in the U . S . Still no older than 29 , Lin has already traveled a long and difficult road .  
This is not a particularly difficult task , but it is time consuming and extremely complex because there were no standard editions of the repertoires performed by folk opera troupes , and a tradition of oral transmission inevitably results in textual discrepancies and variants . The old artistes are usually illiterate and are often on the verge of senility , so they frequently do not understand the words they are singing themselves !  
That is to say , the younger those who have been arrested and imprisoned are at the first offense , the more likely is the possibility they will be repeat or serious offenders later . This is because on the inside not only are they able to learn even more " specialized " criminal techniques , after they get out , because they have been " labelled " as bad guys , it is difficult to go straight .  
The supply of eel for export to Japan ca n't meet demand , but since Taiwan is too small and labor is expensive , it 's very difficult to expand the scope of eel farming . So we have always been alert for investment opportunities abroad , " says Lin . At first , the Malaysian government wanted to rent 200 chia of land to him . " In pingtung [ in southern Taiwan ] , to have a five chia eel farm is already miraculous - - how could we deal with 200 chia ? "  
Having just celebrated the anniversary of commissioner Lin 's burning of British opium which triggered the Opium War , Chinese readers might be smiling quietly to themselves at the fact that neighboring Japan is not only supplying the British with cheap and attractive household goods , but is also spending a large amount of money on their cultural education . lt is difficult not to conclude , however , that the only way to avoid accusations of " charm and stealth " might be to send in gunboats selling heroin under the flag of free trade .  
From the melody one can understand the wisdom of life and the changes of the track . Bodies warming up on the turf are like adagio - - slow but ordered . Starting from the blocks is like the first beat - - after a violent burst of energy , one needs gentle fluidity . The contradictions of the heart and the great difficulty of interval training are like variations - - only by charging through the most difficult sections can one get to the gentle and beautiful coda .  
A . Because the chairman of the Legislative Yuan has almost no power to decide , added to the fact that there have been a lot of protest incidents , it has been especially difficult these last two years to preside over the Yuan meetings . I have just been trying to play a fair , objective , and occasionally humorous role , to balance and mediate the confrontational situation between the supplementary legislators and the senior legislators , in order to keep the agenda moving smoothly .  
Chen Yu-feng explains that the forests which have been able to overcome Taiwan 's harsh land are called " special flora which has adapted to an unstable ground quality over a long period of time . " in botany . One of its most important features is that " it is very difficult to restore an area to the original condition after the surface has been stripped away , and this will initiate a long-term , intensive chain reaction . "  
A . With any kind of historical research , especially recent or contemporary , for which many of the people involved are still alive , it is comparatively easy to be coolly objective . Yet it is also , therefore , difficult to get a true picture and description .  
The western seacoast was originally rising land , but because each of the two tributaries to the upstream portion of the Tsengwen River had dams built on them , plus a great amount of illegal pisciculture on the western seacoast , today reclaimed land on the seacoast is declining , not increasing . It would be very difficult to find a similar sandbank for the birds .  
Chiang Hsiao-shan points out even though the vast majority of patients are open , extroverted , positive types with a considerable degree of self-confidence who are bold enough to want to change their image , the longing for a better appearance often involves tangled emotional complexes that are difficult to resolve , and most doctors must still carefully evaluate the patients who walk in their doors .  
China 's ancient books have been through human and natural disasters with countless numbers having been destroyed and lost . There are no certain statistics concerning just how many still survive in the world today . Moreover , with there being much space for dispute over how antique works should be carefully determined and compared , it is even more difficult to put numbers on them .  
We 're constantly seeing cases of leaders being rejudged in the light of history , finding they may have been strong in ability but were weak in morals , or vice versa . Inter-level communicationQ : In your book you analyzed the main cause for the decline of China through the ages and concluded that it lay in the rift between the upper and middle levels and between the middle and lower ones . Is cross-level interaction and communication really that difficult ?  
In the free democratic societies that have mostly replaced authoritarian societies , the upper level is formed from the middle level and the middle level from the lower level . No one 's position is permanently occupied , and there are no strong authoritarian forces blocking interaction and communication . Mutual understanding is n't difficult .  
Because puppets are heavy and hard to manipulate , and the minute and complicated Peikuan rhythmic shifts of the accompanying music are difficult to sing , puppetry is the only traditional performance art whose study can not be promoted in elementary schools .  
Of course , given the current technological level of domestic manufacturing , it is still difficult to undertake joint R &amp; D or sales exchanges with major American or European corporations . In order to transfer some of the more advanced technologies , it is necessary that they first be digested by ITRI before they can be given over to local operations .  
Only the application in daily life of ideals c allow even more people to participate , so that everyone will realize that environmental protection is n't so difficult . One need only make a few adjustments in one 's basic living habits to be able to change the environment . The basic view of green consumption is the admonition : " Do n't avoid doing something just because the gain seems small ; do n't go ahead and do something just because the harm seems marginal . "  
Because the Japanese military imposed strict order , any photography that included topographic features , military bases , or indeed any photo whose field of vision extended downward more than 45 degrees had to be approved by the military police . Thus it was difficult for ordinary people to photograph freely outdoors .  
Those in favor say that there is already a gulf between vernacular and classical Chinese ( or wen-yen-wen ) . Through translation , modern people can share in the wisdom of the ancients . Those opposed contend that it would be difficult to avoid error in translating the spare and refined classical into the modern vernacular . If errors do occur , this will mislead contemporary readers about their history .  
Lin Shan-le , who came to Taiwan to live with relatives , and Li Lan , a student at Hsinpu Junior College , praise " 800O miles " for its deep and fertile subject matter and for daring to tackle sensitive issues . That lover of dramas Ma Yu , on the other hand , believes that " 8000 Miles " goes too far in directly judging mainland trends and cross-strait relations . Sometimes , she says , it has a sneering or glibly debasing tone that makes it more difficult for her to accept .  
Bob Yeh , managing director of the Meta Advertising Company , which handles the account for Shin Shii oolong tea , analyzes the reasons for failure at that time : First , Chinese who had long been accustomed to taking their tea hot could not immediately accept cold tea . There was a traditional belief that " tea left overnight produces poisons . " If tea is left to steep for a long time , it creates tannic acid , which causes the arteries to contract and makes digestion difficult .  
The grasslands also arouse the imagination . When one stands among the grass , looking in all four directions at once , the great earth appears to be a green , round plate without boundaries , a plate pacific and changeless . Occasionally , a lonely , slow song wafts by , and in that voice can be heard the longing for the colorful world beyond the horizon . However difficult it was to bear , the foreign arrivals had to depart the grasslands once again .  
Eastern Taiwan 's inconvenient transportation is well-known , especially the railroad . Because the east is obstructed by the double barrier of the central mountain range and the coastal mountain range , beginning work on the railroad was extremely difficult . The earliest constructed stretch was a simple narrow gauge line from Hwalien to Taitung .  
While researching the article , we came across many moving stories . A couple who , after being " pronounced " infertile , had gone through the long and difficult process of treatment , held each other and wept when the wife finally became pregnant ; a mother who after enduring the pain of the procedures involved gave birth to a baby with a congenital heart defect was neither bitter nor regretful , but full of since re gratitude . . . .  
But this journey is a distant one . Currently the population , lands and culture of the tribal villages are quickly disappearing . As a result , the tribal ceremonies have become mere formalities , put on only for reasons of tourism or politics ; the tribal lodges no longer exist ; the m other tongues and their oral literatures are gradually being forgotten ; traditional social structures have been broken apart ; and tribal elders , chiefs , and leading families have lost their positions of respect . A return to traditional culture would be difficult indeed .  
Sun Ta-chuan , a lecturer in the philosophy department at Soochow University , who is also of Puyuma ancestry , observes that in traditional tribal society leaders inherited their power or were selected by the nobility from within their own ranks , which is quite at odds with the current political system ; this can make it difficult for people to adapt to participating in an electoral system .  
But the old trails run deep into the furthest recesses of the mountain ranges , and were often cut along hunting trails and the tracks worn by wild animals , so that they are difficult for most people to reach , and with little in the way of historical records , searching them out is an extremely difficult task .  
And very recently , with the arrival of spring , climatic conditions are highly unstable , so it is very difficult to ascertain whether it will rain or not . After his weather forecasts have turned out to be totally incorrect , a patient afflicted with bronchitis could not resist calling up TTV in order to complain . " Jen Li-yu 's ability to forecast the weather is not half as accurate as my own bronchial tubes . "  
But after war broke out between China and Japan , the mainland market gradually declined , and then as war spread throughout East Asia , shipping became difficult and many rushwork traders went out of business . After the war ended , things looked up economically , but then mainland China fell victim to civil war , which continued until the Nationalist government withdrew to Taiwan , and the state of the rushwork trade went from bad to worse .  
It is true that the brook masu salmon have survived from ancient times , and they are internationally famous as Taiwan 's precious living fossils . But still , in the greater context of the incessant deterioration of Nature , these fish are not the only creatures who ultimately are finding it difficult to escape extinction . And at the same time , how much hope remains as the salmon struggle against the manmade " New Nature " ?  
At any rate , the investment required to open a computer center is not nearly as monumental as a factory or an overseas branch operation . With the use of satellite communications it really was n't that difficult . As far as Hong Kong and Shanghai is concerned , we were simply turning circumstances to our advantage . " Lo reveals that several dozen employees have returned by this method .  
China 's Minority Peoples For photographers anxious to free themselves from commonplace and boring subjects , China 's ethnic minorities , with their unique customs , rustic appearances , colorful , varied clothing , and rugged , lofty mountains as a backdrop , hold a glamor that is difficult to express .  
And once they have been admitted , it is difficult to discharge them . Chronic illness includes stroke-induced paralysis , pathological changes to the liver and kidney , and rheumatoid arthritis . Patients with those afflictions can not possibly get well and leave the hospital within a short period of time . As a result , those patients who are actually in urgent need of hospitalization can not find a bed covered by insurance ( ie . , in common rooms with three or more beds ) .  
We are surrounded by good things to eat in our prosperous society , and the need to carry heavy things , walk long distances , or perform manual labor is greatly reduced . Our bodies take in more energy than they expend , and while the food is easy to eat , it 's hard to get rid of . So it 's difficult to avoid accumulating fat .  
But later his father suffered a stroke , and the family faced a difficult financial situation . The burden of supporting the household fell entirely on Chou Meng-te 's shoulders , and he had no choice but to leave his undemanding teaching job with its regular salary and find another way to earn a living .  
There 's nothing difficult about running an official publication : " Just handle it like a regular official document . " Topics were set out by the Printed Materials Department , which handled all government publications , and relevant agencies were asked for material and photographs .  
Interestingly , the staff that had been brought up on Lisa Kuan 's strict demands at first found it a bit difficult to adjust to Wang , who is relaxed , has a lively sense of humor , and is warm and genteel in her personal relations . Sunny Hsiao said it well with a metaphor from ROC history : " It was like going from the period of tutelary authoritarianism to that of constitutional democracy . "  
He wrote that " it is easy to move from frugality to luxury , but difficult to move from luxury to frugality . " It is impossible for even the most disciplined and fortunate families to achieve high rank in every generation , not to mention those families in which profligate playboys undo the accumulated achievements of their ancestors .  
Professor Yang Kuo-chu of NTU 's psychology department sums up the situation by saying that in the West , demographic change and equal rights for women have developed over a relatively long period , whereas in Taiwan demographic change has been compressed into a short timeframe , and it is difficult for traditions of male preeminence and of continuation of the male family line to disappear so quickly . These factors , combined with the timely appearance of techniques for determining fetal gender , probably provide the best explanation for the imbalance between male and female births .  
Often many different crops are planted in a single small area ; small towns and large urban areas are not clearly defined and often are mixed together ; and there are rapid changes in construction . These make it difficult to interpret satellite images .  
As in the cultural , agricultural , and economic fields , cross-strait narcotics exchanges and mutual reliance among dealers have also grown significantly these past several years . Cross-strait anti-drug cooperation should be implemented with urgency , but it is stagnating amidst disputes over sovereignty and legal jurisdiction , and it has proven difficult to make any breakthroughs .  
Given the current intense anti-drug efforts and heavy sentences , it is difficult to move drugs within Taiwan , and the price of heroin has increased as supply has been unable to keep up with demand . Depending upon how much major suppliers have in stock , one kilo can be sold for NT $ 15 million .  
Kwan Wen-yen looks at it from the point of view of economic growth . Looking at the current standards of mass sporting events , he says that management of medium-sized 8,000-seat facilities is still inadequate . If the domed stadium is built , it would be OK if it were turned over to the private sector , but if it were managed by the government , based on the current structure , it would be difficult to do the job well .  
For Kuo Mei-fang , who had taken classes in Chinese architecture while in graduate school , had studied classical Chinese , and was familiar with ancient architectural drawings , reading Xin Yi Xiang Fa Yao was not so difficult . By studying it again and again she came to appreciate the tremendous ingenuity of many aspects of Su Song 's original design , and solved many riddles ( see " How the Astronomical Clock Tower Worked " ) .  
Finding foreign partners for joint ventures is not difficult for medium to large-sized companies with substantial financial and technological resources , but " most Taiwanese medium or small businesses have few opportunities to find foreign partners except by becoming satellite companies of Japanese firms , " says Kenneth Lai .  
Rather , starting with ancient Greece , I reread the Western philosophers . I worked hard at standing in their shoes . The process was very difficult , for I discovered that things which in the past I had been educated to accept as true and reasonable gradually became petty and untrustworthy .  
Li describes a six-hour procedure in which he participated : The patient was suffering from a malignant tumor on the common bile duct , which connects to the hepatic duct , bile duct , and pancreatic duct . Because it affected so many organs , the surgery was extremely difficult . Seven persons-the assistant chief of the hospital , a chief resident , a resident , an anesthe-siologist , and three nurses-labored for those six hours to complete the job .  
For example , Chef Chen reveals a dish called " Fresh Mushroom Treasure Chest " ( made from mushrooms deep fried in oil to a golden color and then wokfried with lily bulbs and the tender stalks and leaves of peas ) and another called " Splendid Jade Flute " ( made with zhusheng edible fungus , vegetarian chicken , cane shoots , and green beans ) . Neither is difficult to prepare at home .  
She had less than US $ 10,000 in the bank , but it would be enough for her to " rough it " on a backpack trip through Asia . She was n't worried about her future . She was young and healthy , and had heard that it would be easy to find a job teaching English . With her Berkeley degree and pleasant appearance , she figured it would not be difficult to find such a job .  
The civil code guarantees that the husband will manage , use , and receive the earnings from property . A divorced woman may win custody of her children , but with laws on the division of property incomplete , if her husband is something less than generous and tries to make things difficult for her , she may be left caring for her children without a penny to her name . In principle , the legal code is for " people " ; there should not be any distinctions made on the basis of sex .  
Leaving behind the central plains , they entered Sichuan on paths which were narrow and winding , difficult and dangerous . When , far from home , they heard the cuckoo sing , the legend of the Emperor of Shu turning into a cuckoo drifted into their memories . The rigors of a journey in Sichuan were enough to make the normally robust Li Bai write , " Again the cuckoo sings to the night moon , bringing melancholy to the empty mountains , " and lament that " The roads of Shu are difficult . "  
A soil researcher , Professor Wu says that the red clay widely distributed in tropical countries is usually barren , and it is difficult to coax a good crop from it . However , Chuang Yu-long has overcome this problem , and could rightly be called a model of success in organic farming . When he has the time , in the future Wu plans to write down Chuang 's unique farming experiences .  
With transportation in and out of Pet �n being so difficult , the standard of living is poor . The Mission 's members laughingly call themselves modern day Su Wus ( after an official posted at the edge of the empire to watch sheep until his all male flock should happen to give birth to a lamb ) .  
One educational reformer has commented that , in this age of " free market education " where textbooks have become " intellectual commodities , " it is difficult to expect publishers not to concern themselves with business and other factors not related to education . But the bigger question is , are the rules of the new privatized education game fair ? Are they consistent ?  
While evaluating plans for ROCSAT-2 , the group decided that because synchronous satellites are vastly more complex than low-orbit satellites , and because it would be difficult to redirect the technical and human resources which were being built up through the ROCSAT-1 project , ROCSAT-2 would be redesignated as a low-orbit satellite .  
And , because the Three Kingdoms requires a knowledge of military tactics , it pushes players to study history more deeply outside the game . Tu 's son , a fifth grader , has carefully read a colloquial Chinese translation of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms ( the original is written in the difficult classical Chinese ) in order to better play the game , allowing his father to see the game 's charm firsthand .  
Given that , based on historical experience , forces in an amphibious assault are only about one-third as effective as on land ( i.e . effective fighting capability declines by two-thirds ) , unless the PRC develops transport and supply ships capable of carrying and supporting large numbers of troops , it would be very difficult to invade Taiwan .  
And although these kind of knowledge can be recorded in books , such books are difficult to understand and in the end , it is " technicians " who are key . In a how-to manual on industrial espionage , chapter one might mention that if a company wants to protect itself , it must be very careful with high-level technical people it has hired away from other companies .  
ATM leader Shen explains that some of the land in the reclamation area is of poor quality . The soil is very rocky , making planting of paddy rice difficult , so the land must be cleared to a depth of at least 20 centimeters . Though large stones can be dug up with heavy machinery , small stones have to be removed by hand as they are uncovered during plowing .  
The move toward open agricultural markets was agreed upon by the WTO member nations in the Uruguay round of GATT . With this international consensus and the global trend toward free trade in agriculture , Taiwan is finding it difficult to swim against the current by maintaining its protectionist agricultural policies .  
The center has increased its range of research substantially since its establishment , and the external environment has also become more complex . However , its objectives remain as unchanged as the simple exterior of its building-improving the lives of people in difficult environments and offering them a better future .  
But the distorted value systems on these other shows , in which truth becomes inseparable from fiction , are even more insidious . " Kuo says that most people already find it difficult to extract meaning from reality in all its complexity and suffer information overload . People usually take the easy way out , and turn to television . The uninterrupted flow of dubiously " re-constructed , " or outright fictional , information can temporarily offer solace to their tired souls .  
NHI was initially intended to use a global budgeting system , but this system has proved to be too difficult to implement . However , according to Yang Han-chuan , the BNHI is now working on a pilot program to be tested with dental care in the near future . Chuang Yi-chou says , " The mechanism is a good one , but the system was designed with the whole nation operating off of one budget .  
By paying for each procedure carried out , NHI is encouraging the medical community to emphasize quantity rather than quality of treatment . It is also encouraging doctors to go into easier fields which pay well . For this reason , dermatology , pediatrics and physical rehabilitation have become hot areas to work in , and doctors are leaving hospitals to set up their own private clinics . On the other hand , more difficult areas of medicine such as surgery are suffering from a shortage of doctors .  
Commenting on the results of this most recent meeting of APEC , Sung Chen-chao , a professor in the graduate institute of political economy at National Cheng Kung University , states that APEC has difficulty reaching decisions because it acts by consensus rather than by majority vote . The increase in the number of participating nations means that differences in economic level have also increased . Some of the organization 's less developed members are facing pressures which make it difficult for them to embrace the liberalization of economics and trade .  
" In Taiwan , AIDS is a venereal disease , " says Troy Lee . In the past , LOFAA 's primary mission was caring for AIDS victims . However , the group gradually realized that the key to AIDS prevention is education of those members of the public who are not infected with the virus . " If even sex is difficult to talk about , how can we talk about AIDS ? "  
Over a long period , as the various agencies implemented the policies decided upon by the relevant ministries of the central government , they were never in harmony , nor was there any authority to force these various units to work together for the regulation of waterways . This situation was compounded by the shortage of skilled personnel at the grass-roots level , making implementation of policy even more difficult .  
To avoid having their shares sold off , these tycoons , who were such able stock market operators when the economy was sound , had to devote their firm 's entire resources to defending their share price . This made it difficult to employ their capital effectively-they lived and died with the market .  
On the question of KPS setting up its own channel , Father Raymond Parent notes that when he was a member of the Government Information Office 's nine-member research team on cable television , he felt that the remit set by the GIO was too narrow , and the pace of legal reform too slow . With the chaotic situation of the time , when all cable channels were illegal , it would have been very difficult for KPS , with its limited financial resources , to enter this market .  
Take for example nasopharyngeal cancer , to which Chinese are specially susceptible . Nasopharyngeal cancer originates near the base of the skull , close to vital organs , so there 's little room for safety to make surgery more practicable . In addition , nasopharyngeal cancer is extremely likely to spread to the lymph nodes in the neck or other more remote areas of the body , so it is difficult to get all of the cancer with surgery .  
It required " a grade one vocational qualification [ equivalent to a degree from a junior college of that time ] and a grade two academic qualification [ equivalent to a degree from a three-year technical high school of that time ] . Preparing for the test was difficult . Days were hard after you went to work too , both in the training period and when you actually were working . If you did n't have an interest in machinery , it would have been hard to take any pleasure in the work , " says Cheng .  
That 's when he left behind the fingerprints . " It was these fingerprints that enabled the police to crack the case . The uncanny ability of the police to solve difficult cases has led some to quip that investigators have a crystal ball in their possession . To be sure , forensic science makes the crystal ball work better , but the crystal ball itself is something else entirely-the careful reasoning of seasoned investigators .  
Chiu Chung-hsien is the principal of Taipei County 's Hsiushan Elementary School , which won four first prizes for ensembles at this year 's provincial competition and one national second prize . Chiu says that because most parents do n't know which schools offer music programs , and those students without musical ability are too intimidated to sign up for the test , about one-half to one-third of those who apply are accepted . In short , it is n't that difficult to get into a program .  
All foster parents receive basic training and understand that abused children are different from other children . Nevertheless , as one foster mother put it , " Until you 've actually been through it , you just ca n't imagine how tough it is . " For most prospective foster parents , the task that lies ahead will be more difficult than expected .  
The possibility that the political situation and foreign policy of another country can be completely overturned in half a month makes the job of the ROC Foreign Ministry in seeking formal ties abroad that much more difficult . It also creates more public opinion pressure on the government .  
While a 5,000-year-old cultural legacy was being smashed to smithereens on the mainland , the ROC 's commitment to " revive classical Chinese culture and carry on traditional ways " represented a difficult burden for the small island of Taiwan to bear by itself . President Chiang Kai-shek would serve as head of the " Council for Chinese Cultural Renaissance . " Peking opera and classical Chinese painting were deliberately promoted and local Taiwanese culture suppressed .  
Unlike neighboring Hong Kong in 1997 , there was no public backlash in Macau on the occasion of the handover , and no exodus of emigrants . Everything seemed smooth and orderly . But the people 's primary concern was whether or not the incoming SAR administration would be capable of tackling difficult problems left behind by the Portuguese , particularly economic recession and declining public order .  
Section chief Victor Chu of the GIO , who has been involved in organizing the camp three times , says that all the participants are very satisfied with the course . After returning home most of them produce newspaper accounts of their experience . Unfortunately , it is very difficult for them to apply the technical infomation they learned , because in most cases they lack the hardware and facilities available in Taiwan . Thus they are only able to apply the theoretical insights they picked up to their own media work at home .  
This led to the questions getting more and more difficult . It was the sole basis for determining educational advancement , but it was completely removed from the basic educational level . What we want to do is to expand the base . " As long as the schools put the emphasis on imparting basic knowledge , then they will be meeting the goal of the reforms .  
" When people think about students at star schools they think in terms of students who get good grades , but being a high academic achiever is not the same thing as being gifted , " says Cheng . At Kaohsiung High , which is the most selective school in the Kaohsiung-Pingtung testing zone , quite a few of the students find the textbooks hard to follow . They are so difficult and obscure because their editors designed them to meet the needs of a small group of truly gifted students .  
But a flip side to economic growth , something the new administration needs to address , is the worsening problem of unemployment . In the first quarter of this year the number of unemployed climbed to 270,000 people , and narrowly-defined unemployment rose to a new high of 2.8% . Under the combined pressures of industrial upgrading , internationalization and liberalization , Taiwan 's economy is still facing a number of difficult challenges .  
As Hsia Chen points out , the KMT needed votes so it formed a symbiotic relationship with the financial apparatus at the local level : " Give me your votes , and you can suckle here in return . " Bank directors are often involved with local factions , and operate as influential " vote captains " at election time , so it 's difficult for political forces not to get involved whenever a problem crops up .  
Genetic engineering appears to be infinitely profitable and omnipotent . However , it is worth noting that gene transfer has risks : transferred genes can spread to unintended hosts , they can not be retracted , and they become permanent . If there is a problem , it could very well be difficult to put the genie back in the bottle .  
According to statistics of the Ministry of Finance , 87.5% of the trading volume on the Taiwan stock exchange comes from individual investors . In 1999 turnover was 288% ( that is , total trading volume was 2.88 times the total value of the market ) , which , though considerably down from nearly 600% ten years before , remained four times higher than the New York stock exchange . Despite numerous painful lessons in the past , the habit of chasing a rising market and cutthroat selling in a falling market has proven difficult to change .  
Except for a small number of sea creatures which are attracting international attention because their numbers are dropping sharply-such as the shark , whale , and sea turtle-few marine animals are protected by law , and it is not difficult for aquariums to collect specimens . Since these then become the main selling points to attract visitors , particular attention is therefore devoted to how these precious creatures respond to their new environment .  
However , WTO regulations require that exemptions be declared prior to application for entry . Given Taiwan 's current weak diplomatic position , unless the PRC agrees to the exemption , it will be difficult for Taiwan to get the required support of two-thirds of the 137 WTO member states for this escape clause . In sum , Kinmen people remain optimistic that the arguments in favor of the little three links will win out .  
This cultural illness is particularly serious in United States . American girls begin to be extremely concerned about their appearance from high school on , and many people are constantly depressed about their weight . Though the situation is not so serious in Taiwan , the mass media puts out a virtually unvarying message that beauty equals success . It is difficult for young people to resist the message implied in teenage beauty pageants , love-at-first-sight stories pairing up beautiful girls and handsome guys , and the images of pop superstars .  
Consider the fact that it depends on the central government for less than 10% of its revenues , while the average for Taiwan 's local governments as a whole stands at about 50% . Taipei City can almost make ends meet through its own tax revenues , but other cities are heavily reliant on the central government , and they are trapped in a vicious cycle in which slow economic development makes it difficult for them to broaden their tax base no matter hard they try .  
Q : As you yourself have mentioned , underworld figures often launder their public image by getting involved in politics , and it is extremely difficult to do anything about it . Previous Justice Ministers Liao Cheng-hao and Ma Ying-jeou both had excellent reputations as able and incorruptible men , yet neither was able to overcome the influence of black gold . It almost looks like " mission impossible . " Do you feel confident of your ability to carry out this mission ?  
The construction budget for the new terminal at CKS Airport , which opened in July , included a public art allocation of NT $ 100 million . Deciding how to handle this huge sum proved a difficult task for the project 's executive committee . Many people questioned whether public art has to be limited to the installation of permanent " works of art . "  
The muscles which join their wings to their thoraxes are well developed , and they can beat their front and rear wings separately to control their direction of flight . Most dragonflies can perform the highly difficult maneuvers of flying backwards or straight upwards , and a few of them can even fly across oceans to make long-distance seasonal migrations .  
With their powerful wings , insects of the order Odonata can spread far and wide . Hence , compared with other insects , which have differentiated in response to specific environments , the proportion of endemic species among Taiwan 's dragonflies is not high . The island has only a third as many dragonfly species as butterfly species , and most were recorded by the middle of the 20th century . Lively dragonflies are easy to spot , but observing their lives in detail is more difficult .  
As for the Taiwan red cypress-merihi in Japanese-it is even more magnificent in appearance than the Taiwan yellow cypress . But the Taiwan red cypress 's trunk is often divided , and because it mostly grows in wet river valleys the heartwood is prone to be eaten away by bacteria , producing strangely tangled hollow trees . The crown is also broad and difficult to cut .  
" They live mixed in with greater crested terns , and this makes them really difficult to pick out . But in our film they do show up very clearly , " says Liang Chieh-te , who was commissioned to film greater crested terns by the Lienchiang County Government . The greater crested tern is around 45 centimeters long . Its most distinctive features are that it has a forked tail like a swallow , a crest of black feathers on its head rather like a Mohican haircut , and a yellow beak .  
Apex 's major product at the moment , the alternating pressure pump mattress , is aimed at preventing bedsores , a real nightmare for bedridden patients . Bedsores result from hard mattresses causing parts of the body that bear the most weight ( such as the buttocks and the shoulders ) to be deprived of oxygen and consequently suffer necrosis ( i.e . tissue death ) . This is accompanied by ulceration , suppuration and infestation , from which recovery is very difficult .  
He filmed 20 60-minute tapes and produced the first edited version of the documentary , which was full of sadness . Laway admits his own mood made it difficult for him to get past tragic facts : " Afterwards , I realized this is not the natural temperament of the Amis people , so I re-edited it , creating this more optimistic version . " Laway immediately took the finished product to share with the Amis of Talu-an .  
Understanding the structure of the universe is a long-standing dream of astronomers . In the past our understanding of cosmic structure was based on little more than theoretical speculation . Before 1990 , it was difficult to test the plethora of cosmological theories being put forward by a growing number of brilliant theorists .  
Chen 's real worry is that state-run opera troupes , which are the dominant force in mainland China 's gezai xi , may no longer be so good at extemporaneous adaptation , and it may be difficult for different troupes to develop their own unique styles . After all , the performers earn a fixed salary , use standardized scripts , and sing a set repertoire of songs .  
In this showdown between political organizations , the ambitions and maneuverings of the most prominent party aristocrats are also getting considerable exposure . Looking at the structure of Taiwan 's voting population , at bottom the ratio of 60% blue vs . 40% green is quite firmly established , and parties on both sides are finding it difficult to make inroads into the other camp .  
Taiwan farmers found it increasingly difficult to compete against mainland China pork on the Japanese market . Adding insult to injury , smuggled pigs brought hoof-and-mouth to Taiwan in 1996 , dealing another heavy blow to Taiwan 's livestock industry . The government issued almost NT $ 1 billion in subsidies to 6,667 farmers that agricultural agencies succeeded in encouraging to leave the livestock industry . Taiwan 's 14 million pig population was chopped in half almost overnight .  
In the past there was also an enormous difference between the simple content of elementary school courses and the difficult and dry content of junior high school courses . In future , courses will be designed with continuity from first to ninth grade , and there will no longer be such a break between elementary and junior high school .  
" The integrated curriculum should not be too disruptive for elementary schools , " says Ou Yung-sheng , because the subject divisions in elementary schools were already very broad , and their teaching arrangements are generally close to a single " class teacher " system , with one teacher teaching several different subjects . Therefore integrating the subjects should not be too difficult .  
According to interpretations of the Avatamsaka Sutra , our universe is formed of pearl-like individual objects strung together in a net , so that it is difficult to separate what is real from what is illusion ; past , present , and future exist side-by-side ; and no individual can exist in isolation . As a result , people should live in the present , embrace goodness and do good deeds , so that the universe will tend toward harmony .  
Over the past half century , the dominant thinking in Taiwan has been " the economy comes first . " Today the government is changing tack , adopting " sustainable management . " Although this is difficult to implement-even more challenging , in fact , given the need to maintain competitiveness amidst a global downturn-it is essential .  
Although the government has now decided to move in the direction of liberalization , the numerous " technical issues " that remain continue to make difficult any easing of the current political impasse . Proposals to allow " three links , " to permit Taiwanese firms to invest in semiconductor or upstream petrochemicals production in China , to allow Chinese capital and workers into Taiwan , and even to establish a free port that would make it easier to bring semi-finished goods from China to Taiwan for processing , still remain just that : proposals .  
If it is easy to find a free e-paper that is similar , or if the readers do n't really need the content , it is difficult to achieve the level of appeal required to collect fees , " says Hsu . But it can be done . Currently , e-papers at PChome that do the best with subscriber fees are for language learning and industrial reports . The publication with the most subscribers is iThome , a computer report , with about 10,000 .  
After millions of years of wind and sea erosion , many of the pillars on the basalt islands have been worn down and are now covered with mud . More recently , human activity has made it difficult to distinguish what is so interesting about these basalt islands . Only by approaching cliffs near the edge of the sea or visiting uninhabited peripheral islands can one clearly see the basalt columns with their vertical fractures running from top to bottom .  
The 23-kilometer-long old Mountain Line was built in 1908 , early in the Japanese colonial era . Trains on this line began by winding through the precipices of Sanyi Rural Township , and from there cut through mountains and crossed rivers . This was the last north-south line in western Taiwan to be completed , and the most difficult stretch of track from an engineering point of view , with nine tunnels and three bridges .  
Actually , as an island , Taiwan has always had an international economy . But China is growing bigger every day and cross-strait political tensions remain unresolved . Within Taiwan , the " globalist , " " China " and " Taiwan-first " factions all read this situation differently and their responses to it have been anything but compatible . In fact , they are often at cross-purposes , and the resulting confusion has made it still more difficult for Taiwan to chart a course for the future .  
From the moment they say " I do , " they should be ready in their hearts and willing to take the bad along with the good . Why is it , then , that today 's couples , free to choose their partners , find it so difficult to honor their vows ? Some find it impossible to deal with hardship , and others , even after struggling to make it through a difficult stretch , are somehow unable to enjoy the sweet yields of their struggle .  
Tsao Fu-yung admits frankly that this was a very difficult task . " Just think , we 'd all been in Chinese opera for so long that we had long since grown accustomed to the Peking Opera style of singing , speaking and moving . Now we had to put all that aside and start again with a completely new face-but none of us was at all sure what that new face was supposed to be , and even now we 're still feeling our way forward . "  
Of particular importance are these few sentences that capture the essence of Dan 's thinking : " It 's naturally difficult to search for nothing , yet when the substance is clearly defined you see the emptiness . It 's impossible to paint the spirit , yet when reality is reduced to its essence the spirit will be revealed . A painting that is chaotic and busy is largely superfluous . Only when emptiness and reality are arranged properly will the idea of the picture extend beyond the painting . "  
In a society where " information equals power , " it is apparent that the gulfs between urban and rural , rich and poor will be increasingly difficult to traverse . Disparities in digital technology accordingly will become one of the world 's most controversial issues .  
Apart from uneven levels of quality , the main reason why alternative medicine is not welcomed by the regulatory authorities or mainstream medical practitioners is that it is difficult or impossible to test the effectiveness of alternative treatments by scientific methods .  
The reason is simple : " Because plants do not grow for us to eat them . " The cell structure of most biological materials is very durable , and not easily broken down . Therefore it is difficult for the matter inside to be released , much less absorbed into the human body .  
Chen feels that leaving white space is more difficult to master than the actual artwork , because all that space can easily end up looking excessive , or even downright vacant . That is why he is so careful about blank space . Besides , white and black are two of his favorite colors .  
The most common complaint for children is respiratory infections . This is because local residents have not yet learned to pay close attention to public health norms . People spit wherever they want , while the houses let in little sunlight and have poor ventilation , so children are much more likely to get infected and it is correspondingly difficult to cure them .  
Chen Chin-chin , principal of Taichung Industrial High School , feels the technical and vocational education system , an alternative to the usual route through high school and then college and sometimes referred to as the " second track , " was very difficult to set up in the first place and that it is an integral part of the nation 's wellbeing . So , how can one talk lightly about abolishing it ?  
" There are some battered foreign brides who loathe Taiwanese and think all Taiwanese are evil , and even distrust the social workers themselves , " says Vietnamese-born Sister Mei of the Good Shepherd Sisters . Current law stipulates that even foreign brides who have legal residence must return home if they get divorced , without the possibility of taking their children with them . This last point is very difficult to bear and they frequently feel the social workers are unwilling to help them .  
" In our more than ten years of service we have been deeply moved by the unfortunate situation created by international marriages . The harm and lasting effects on women and children is truly frightful and difficult to gauge accurately , " says Sister Therese Tang , executive director of the Good Shepherd Sisters Social Welfare Services Foundation . The government should set up an appropriate system of preventative measures , she says , but in the end , family problems must be solved by the families themselves .  
The mainland is a massive country , and the distance between urban areas is huge . Profits from distribution and retailing of books and magazines are small , even though the ' planned economy ' is gradually being dismantled , and soon it will be far too difficult to set up a wide-ranging logistics and shipping network . Because of this , some publishers are choosing not to sell through bookstores , instead looking for an alternative way , facing their own technological difficulties on the way .  
In order to strengthen the tuberculosis treatment network , the Department of Health has made preliminary plans to use Taipei 's Hospital for Chronic Diseases , Taoyuan Hospital , Taichung Hospital , the Center for Chest Disease , and Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital as diagnostic referral centers for northern , central , and southern Taiwan , accepting TB patients who have been diagnosed at regular hospitals or whose disease is proving difficult to treat .  
Intending to prevent a recurrence of Bunun resistance and because it was difficult to keep the garrison roads in good repair in the deep mountain areas , the Japanese government went a step further and forced a mass displacement of the Bunun down the mountain to the lower reaches of the Lakulaku River on the Huatung Valley plain . Through contact with the Han Chinese and the Amis people living there , the unique characteristics of Bunun mountain culture were gradually lost .  
Perhaps because Yushan is located in the most remote part of Taiwan 's mountainous regions , and access is difficult , it has largely escaped deforestation , with the exception of the cypress forests of the Nantsaihsien River , which were completely logged out , and outlying areas such as Tungpu and Tataka . The core areas in the center of the national park still boast virgin forests and a vibrant ecology .  
Architecture has long been a most regrettable , unbecoming shortcoming of the " beautiful island " of Taiwan . Shop signs sticking out all over the place , iron window grates plastered all over buildings , and shacks willy-nilly sprouting on rooftops-an architectural crazy quilt more post-modern than post-modern , in " immigrant makeshift " style . People from overseas have a difficult time describing Taiwan cities as " beautiful . " The best they can manage is " unusual . "  
" What 's original with me is that after folding the wing into a very normal flat shape , I improved the structure by further folding the wings into triangle shapes that attached to the middle of the fuselage . Finally , there is the square fold of a stabilizer wing beneath the fuselage . That was the most difficult part .  
The body 's immune responses to these germs-cell-mediated immunity , which is called " type 1 immune response , " and the " type 2 immune response , " known as humoral immunity-are mutually antagonistic . This can result in imbalances , much like when the police deploy all their forces to catch a big criminal and end up letting small-time thieves slip through the net . To an allergic person 's immune system , finding the right balance is as difficult as it is for a seesaw to stay horizontal with children on it .  
" They are always so happy , though , just because I 'm doing the shopping and preparing meals for them , " Day says . Filial piety is n't difficult ; one just needs to cater to another 's pleasures . His father , for example , loves to eat a traditional salted pork dish , so Day practiced until he learned the techniques for making it , mastering each step , from choosing the right cut of meat to the actual cooking and dressing of the meat .  
Biomechanical imbalances can be corrected and a comfortable gait achieved by inserting an arch or spacer in the shoe . The second group have lost the feeling in their feet due to nerve damage , so that they may be injured without realizing it if they bump into things , making them very prone to infection . This group has grown substantially in recent years . Diabetics are particularly difficult to deal with , because their wounds are slow to heal .  
Regular shoes are designed to fit normally arched feet . However , because the soles of flat feet are insufficiently arched , making it difficult to maintain a solid footing , it is best for people with flat feet to add an arch support when exercising , as this will reduce the chance of soreness .  
After these decorative lines are dry , they spray on a layer of yellow paint , and then add gold leaf . Before applying the gold leaf , they 've got to first apply some glue designed for that purpose : " You 've got to precisely control the time that the gold leaf glue dries , because that will affect on the quality of the gold leaf . If it 's too wet , it 's difficult to spread evenly ; if it 's too dry , it wo n't stick . "  
In the era of the knowledge-based economy , ideas are the ultimate source of profits . However , Hsu has observed that Taiwanese children growing up under the rigid educational system have lost out on many opportunities for hands-on learning and learning by doing , making it very difficult to spark creative ideas .  
Chen Chung believes that the small cultivated plots of traditional farming make it difficult to use efficient , labor-saving technologies and thus hinder competitiveness in international markets . The usual remedy for this has been even further exploitation of the land , and as Chen Chung points out with a pained expression , " the result was heavy use of pesticides and fertilizers , increased soil depletion , and environmental pollution . "  
The thrifty gene theory hypothesizes that because of harsh living conditions in Asian countries during ancient times , individuals with a genetic endowment that enabled them to more efficiently store fat as a hedge against times when food was scarce were more likely to survive the natural selection process to reproduce . Now , though the environment has improved and food is no longer difficult to obtain , the thrifty gene continues to exert its effect , with the result that the person easily accumulates body fat and becomes obese-an important risk factor for diabetes .  
" While the adjustments may be difficult for a time , these crises will pass , " he said , stressing that " stronger individual economies and a more robust and efficient international economic and financial system will surely emerge in their wake "  
He said he is extremely pleased with the fact that the financial situation in ROK has reached a major turning point in its most difficult period and attributed the success to the efforts of the ROK government and people He expressed hope that ROK will overcome current difficulties and regain economic vitality at the earliest possible date  
He noted that the lack of meaningful developments to date , while disappointing , had to be seen in the context of the difficult and fundamental changes taking place in the economic , social and political areas of the countries concerned .  
They have had the difficult task of providing subsidized loans to risky ventures and inefficient public enterprises , which often has forced Governments to recapitalize them with financial transfers from an already overburdened government budget .  
Past mediation efforts have been shown to be insufficient because they were limited by a mandate lacking firmness , but also rendered more difficult by the diverse political interests of individual external forces .  
This greatly complicates the future of these countries as they attempt to solve by themselves the difficult economic , political , psychological , cultural and historical problems that they have inherited from the recent past .  
Such strategies are however dangerous and difficult to reverse : surplus fishing vessels , once established in a fishery , may be difficult to displace , with limited alternative incomeearning opportunities , and a loss in economic yield will certainly occur .  
Although reliable data are scarce , it is known that the phenomenon of children in especially difficult circumstances is increasing rapidly as a result of adverse economic conditions , civil conflicts and rapid growth and impoverishment of urban centres .  
It has proved exceedingly difficult to curb the growing tendency of subsidiary bodies to meet on an annual basis , despite an existing legislative mandate for biennial sessions .  
It will be a difficult task to bring about national reconciliation , to reconstruct the destroyed physical infrastructure and to lay the ground for a return to normal life for all citizens traumatized by a civil war with unprecedented massacres .  
The difficult socioeconomic conditions , exacerbated by deteriorating and fluctuating terms of trade , external indebtedness and political instability , which induce internal , regional and international migrations ;  
Promoting the socioeconomic status of disadvantaged ethnic , cultural , occupational or religious groups is also difficult owing to a lack of effective and acceptable means of intervention .  
The deplorable living conditions in many urban areas of the world , coupled with the rapidly deteriorating quality of life in others , posed difficult obstacles to successful crime prevention .  
The Committee was also informed that the existing logistics support base at Split was overloaded and difficult to manage , and that it could not be expanded for additional use without incurring additional costs , such as rental and refurbishment of premises .  
The establishment of an international criminal court involved many complex and difficult issues , such as jurisdiction , applicable law , court structure , prosecution and other matters which must be addressed with utmost care .  The meeting rose at 1.10 p.m .  
The difficult question of the qualifications of the judges ( art . 6 ) was handled well , although it was regrettable that a rigid distinction was drawn between judges with criminal trial experience and judges with recognized competence in international law .  
Although the implementation of economic , social and cultural rights might be expensive and difficult , they should be promoted on an equal basis with civil and political rights .  
When combined with the prevailing culture and political calculation , the cult of performance and the cult of instant satisfaction make it difficult to sustain the constant and patient efforts that are needed for development and social progress .  
As the international community is aware , the Agreement signed at Chapultepec , Mexico , in January 1992 put an end to the armed conflict in El Salvador , marking the conclusion of the first phase of the peace process but the beginning of a complex and difficult period of transition during which the commitments made served as the framework for a developing political , economic and social process , which we are convinced will culminate in the consolidation of democracy . 
Having taken up his difficult and demanding tasks at a particularly important time in the history of the United Nations , Mr . Boutros-Ghali has shown himself , throughout his term of office , to be not only an outstanding intellectual capable of theorizing and conceptualizing problems and of thinking before acting , but also a man of action capable of taking timely decisions on the most difficult issues that every day come before the chief executive of the United Nations .  
We know how difficult was the road leading to the establishment of lasting peace in view of the level of distrust and the acute , accumulated suffering involved .  
We are aware that we have set ourselves a difficult task as a region , but there is no alternative to this path of collective self-reliance if our region is to survive in the current competitive international economic environment .  
While we call upon Iraq to respond fully to the behests of international legality , we must voice our concern over the territorial integrity , sovereignty and unity of Iraq which must be preserved and express sympathy with the brotherly Iraqi people who endure difficult economic and social conditions that should end once their causes cease to exist .  
The Islamic Republic of Mauritania which , since 1984 , has been engaged in a determined battle that aims at restructuring the Mauritanian economy despite difficult domestic , regional and international conditions , has made tangible progress towards restoring the macroeconomic balance and reducing its foreign debt , a fact that is attested to by international financial institutions . 
For its part , and despite its difficult economic and financial conditions , Cameroon , like other developing countries and African ones in particular , confirming its political will and joining in the expansion of the lofty ideals of the United Nations , recently paid up nearly all its arrears in contributions due the Organization .  
El Salvador experienced one of the most severe , complex and difficult crises in Central America in the second half of this century in the 1980s , to be precise , when a military and political conflict began and went on for 12 years .  
Recognizing that it is primarily responsible for its own development , and in keeping with commitments entered into under UN-NADAF , Africa has recently become involved in far-reaching and difficult reforms designed to accelerate the process of democratization , promote human rights and achieve economic , social and cultural development , in a climate of transparency and with the active participation of all positive forces .  
Indeed , since 1990 official development assistance for Africa has continued to decline , and direct foreign investment remains weak in a very difficult international situation characterized by fierce trade competition , which the Uruguay Round agreements have made even more onerous for the African countries . 
Aware of the possible tragic consequences for the entire population of that country that an increase in tension and violence could have , the High Commissioner decided to write to the interim President to express his support for all those who during that difficult period were working for tolerance and mutual understanding .  
In its statement at the International Conference on Population and Development , held in Cairo in 1994 , the Central African Republic commented on the country 's unequal spatial distribution and rapid urban growth , which was difficult to manage and had led to social and cultural crises .  
This important event is a worthy culmination of Mozambique 's progress along the difficult road to peace and consent and has marked the end of a lengthy period of destructive internecine conflict that brought untold suffering to the people of that country .  
The deployment of the Multinational Force in Haiti , on 19 September 1994 , represented the first phase in the international community 's delicate and difficult undertaking to restore to office the democratically elected Government of President Aristide and to assist that Government in the economic , social and institutional reconstruction of its devastated country .  
Although the Marriage Act had been designed to ensure equal treatment for men and women , in reality , women sometimes found themselves in difficult financial circumstances after a divorce ; that eventuality was however covered by the social security system , and if necessary it was also possible to obtain a living allowance from the municipal authority .  
It was noted that while , generally speaking , the International Law Commission was justified in finding it difficult to impose an equivalent obligation on States parties for crimes under international law in articles 20 , subparagraphs ( b ) to ( d ) , in the absence of a secure jurisdictional basis or a widely accepted extradition regime , the basis of the aut dedere aut judicare obligation was not the treaties referred to in article 20 , subparagraph ( e ) , but article 54 of the statute itself .  
Expressing deep concern at the immense human suffering and loss of life which have accompanied recent crises involving refugee flows and other forced displacements , as well as the magnitude and complexity of current refugee problems , which have made more difficult the accomplishment of the High Commissioner 's crucial functions of ensuring international protection for refugees and achieving timely and durable solutions to their plight ,  
Deeply concerned also about the serious consequences of the presence of refugees and externally displaced persons for the already difficult economic and social situation in Djibouti , which is suffering from prolonged drought and the negative effects of the critical situation in the Horn of Africa ,  
Few impediments to progress are more implacable and emotional than that of Israeli settlers who both remain in and continue to settle the occupied territories , and that this could be supported by the Israeli Government in full knowledge of the ultimate and unavoidable consequences is difficult to believe when there is plainly a direct correlation between the violence in the occupied territories and the continued expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank . 
Although in a letter dated 9 February addressed to MINUGUA , the URNG command denied responsibility for the incident and stated its determination to fulfil these commitments , there is reason to believe that the shot came from URNG lines , although it is true that the proximity of the fighting makes it difficult to judge whether the shot was intentional . 
The vast majority of cases involving death have not been adequately investigated or resolved by the competent authorities , and this increases levels of impunity , promoting a widespread feeling of insecurity among the public , and makes it more difficult to distinguish violations of the right to life which could be classified as human rights violations from common crimes without a political motive .  
Although endowed with more sophisticated capacity and resources than others , the Institute has found it difficult at this late stage to adapt quickly to the needs of the land programme , especially as most of its previous experience related to titling of housing in urban areas in which there was a fairly reliable registry and census of properties and relatively easy access .  
However , the principle that harm which does not entail economic loss should be compensated is not a new absolute in law , as can be seen in the universal acceptance , in domestic and international law , of compensation for moral injury , which is as difficult to evaluate in monetary terms as ecological harm .  
It has required , for example , that UNDP continue to adjust and focus its programmes in the countries it serves , shifting its work upstream to broad policies and programmes , reducing the proliferation of isolated projects and addressing difficult goals such as providing the poor with decent jobs and even difficult concepts like good governance and implementation capacity . 
At the recently concluded nineteenth session of the Staff-Management Coordinating Committee ( SMCC ) held at Amman , Jordan , both management and staff representatives had acknowledged that it had been difficult in the past to keep track of the time which staff representatives devoted to staff activities , and had reached agreement on what constituted " a reasonable amount of time " for staff representatives at all levels in the nine major duty stations effectively to discharge their responsibilities .  
In this difficult moment , I wish to express my Government 's full solidarity with the UNPROFOR forces , particularly with the courageous Dutch soldiers operating in the Srebrenica territory , sharing the hardships of the civilian population they are protecting and facing overwhelmingly superior forces .  
At the social level , conditions of life are very difficult , characterized by poor nutrition as a result of low purchasing power , poor health , with widespread diseases such as tuberculosis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , inadequate educational facilities and limited qualified manpower .  
This step taken by the international community following the signing by the Government and UNITA of the Lusaka Protocol , the new instrument setting forth the legal framework for the country 's transition from war to peace , gave a major boost to the peace process and helped curtail initial pessimism as did the positive unfolding of such a difficult and complex process , shrouded at first in a climate of deeply held mutual mistrust and hostility rooted in a long , destructive war .  
The requested reclassifications of three General Service ( Other level ) posts to the Principal level would provide recognition of the additional and difficult functions assigned to very senior staff who have acquired considerable knowledge and experience of a highly complex pension system . 
In drafting the resolution that the Council adopted a few moments ago , it proved particularly difficult to find words adequately to express the real indignation over the lamentable fact that troops of the peace-keeping forces with which the international community is trying generously to help the parties to resolve their conflicts a generosity not adequately reciprocated lost their lives as a result of deliberate action by members of one of these parties .  
The challenge we face is therefore enormous because it is quick , easy and cheap to lay mines , whereas clearing them is expensive , difficult and dangerous .  
To that end , the Ministers emphasized the need for concerted action in the region against the spread of extremism , which exploited the noble and sacred values of their peoples , and against arms proliferation and drug trafficking , and for swift implementation of the measures to combat those problems adopted at the meeting on regional security held at Bamako on 22 and 23 August 1994 .  16 .  The Ministers noted with concern the difficult economic situation in their countries .  
One of the main reasons for the failure is the palliative attitude towards the difficult situation in the Balkans and marginal attention dedicated to preventive actions and to the development of good-neighbourly relations based on mutual respect and equality .  
The humanitarian situation , which is particularly difficult , the observance of human rights , which can neither be renounced nor evaded , and the capacity of the local police to be effective , impartial and professional , are all important issues which must be addressed , on a priority basis , and for which we will also support efforts to show the commitment and the support of the international community .  
However , while developed countries already possess the infrastructure and crucial knowledge required in mustering the necessary resources and maximizing their efficiency and effectiveness , developing countries and countries in transition are found in the very difficult position of easily being outpaced by organized criminal groups .  
The subject was put before the leadership for a second time two years ago by the President of the Republic , but the country 's difficult circumstances , particularly the anomalous situation in northern Iraq , which was subjected to quasi-occupation by the Coalition forces , caused the leadership to delay the matter until the sanctions were lifted and the situation in the north was restored to normal .

NULLThe events described above , coupled with other political and military developments within the Republic of Croatia and the contiguous territories of the former Yugoslavia , as well as the frequently declared intention of the Croatian authorities to recover lost territories by other means if negotiations did not succeed , made it very difficult to resume meaningful negotiations and bring them to a successful conclusion .  
The frequent lack of adequate presence in areas where there are internally displaced populations , combined with insufficient understanding of what internal displacement means , has often made it difficult to know the numbers of internally displaced populations and their specific assistance , protection and development needs .  
Although some of the problems raised , such as remuneration of personnel employed in peace-keeping operations and more extensive use of United Nations Volunteers is of concern to JIU and are actually reflected in its report on staffing of the United Nations peace-keeping and related missions ( civilian component ) ( JIU / REP / 93 / 6 ) , it is difficult to make any substantive comments without access to the original records .  
As a result of the sanctions , it has become increasingly difficult to satisfy minimum existential needs , especially in the case of the unemployed , the employed with low income and family income below a social minimum , pensioners with low pensions and family incomes , families with children , elderly rural households , etc .  
Preschool institutions , homes for children deprived of parental care , disabled children and youth institutions for juvenile delinquents , are also in an increasingly difficult material situation , manifested by a poor quality of food and a considerable decline of standards , including poor hygienic standards , insufficient heating , inadequate maintenance , the impossibility to keep facilities and equipment in proper repair .  
In the situation when the levels of earnings and the standard of living are very low , when even the basic needs for food , accommodation and clothing are difficult to meet , it is more and more difficult for the citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to devote attention to environmental quality and protection .  
The reform seeks to introduce a professionalized and efficient first-level appeal system to replace the current volunteer system which , in an era of increasing management accountability for programme delivery coupled with declining resources and an increasing number of cases , makes it difficult to attract sufficient experienced and qualified staff to discharge these vital functions .  
The Working Group is convinced that , without a long-term strategy benefiting from the effective contribution of all the players , first States and then the international organizations and non-governmental organizations concerned , it is difficult to envisage , even in the more or less distant future , the attainment of so ambitious an objective as universal enjoyment of the right to development .  
Although concrete results have been reached over the past few years in improving the technical infrastructure at the Palais des Nations , the physical distribution of buildings and the relative autonomy of many Secretariat organizational units located in Geneva , made it difficult for the Electronic Services Section of the United Nations Office at Geneva to provide the increasing amount of services required .  
Noting also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation , and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
In that connection , the incapacity of the newly independent States which had emerged from the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to discharge their financial obligations was attributable not only to their extremely difficult social and economic situation , but above all to the fact that the rates of assessment recommended by the Committee on Contributions in 1992 were unfair and excessive compared with their real capacity to pay .  
The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , for its part , had paid its assessed contribution up to the end of the current year , despite the difficult economic circumstances it was suffering ; those difficulties , as everyone knew , had been considerably worsened by the consequences of the embargo and unjust sanctions imposed by the Security Council .  
United States government civilian employees assigned overseas may receive a taxable post differential of up to 25 per cent of basic salary for posting to duty stations where " extraordinarily difficult or notably unhealthful conditions or excessive physical hardships " exist .  
also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation , and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
of the Committee would recall the difficult discussions which had taken place at recent major multilateral trade and economic negotiations on measures to preserve cultural industries and the provisions made in some documents , such as those of the Copenhagen Summit , requiring that liberalized and multifaceted economic actions , including structural adjustment , should be tempered by prudent considerations which reflected the concern to minimize the harm which could be caused to the populations to which they would be applied .  
With respect to the recommendation of the Advisory Committee that the conversion of some temporary posts to permanent posts should be deferred , he said it was difficult to demand a high level of efficiency from the Centre when significant new mandates had been assigned to it without commensurate human and financial resources .  
was not mere rhetorical emphasis to say that the developing countries - regardless of their good will and sense of responsibility - faced a difficult choice between paying their debts to the Organization or attending to their own basic needs .  
Social trust can be increased , however difficult it may be to achieve consensus among those who have been combatants , through a predictable legal system , based on the rule of law , in which everyone can engage in social and economic activities knowing that a fair , impartial and predictable system of adjudication awaits any disputes .  
The causes are as well-known as they are difficult to resolve : double standards ; lack of democracy , of public information and transparency ; informal consultations and secret lobbying ; the obsolete veto power ; and the threat of the veto , which has become an even more dangerous and unacceptable instrument because the consequences of using it are not publicly assumed .  
The negative consequences of such a threat could lead to greater destruction of Lebanon 's infrastructure and reverse the efforts of its Government and people to rebuild all that was destroyed in the civil war , which was a terrible burden on the Lebanese people , who faced the horrors of destruction throughout an extremely difficult and confused period of Lebanon 's modern history . 
It is difficult for us to see how the firing of Katyusha rockets by Hezbollah into northern Israel , condemnable as it is , can be equated with the Israeli artillery bombardments , sea and air attacks and other missile attacks directed at the civilian populations in Lebanese villages , towns and cities , resulting in many deaths , enormous suffering and extensive destruction of property .  
The Committee identified as major factors and difficulties in implementing the Convention : the weak State machinery to effectively maintain the peace process ; the difficult process of national reconciliation ; the breakdown of public infrastructure and private support systems ; the large number of Rwandan refugees and internally displaced persons ; the great number of militias and some civilians who are still armed ; and the shattered economy and extreme poverty .  
Though caught in the vortex of the complex and fluctuating international situation surrounding the Korean peninsula , the Korean people have been able to march forward continuously along the road to socialism which they themselves chose without any vacillation , disappointment or vicissitude , despite the fact that on an untrodden and poorly paved path , every step is difficult .  
Although the international community has succeeded , by dint of serious negotiations , in resolving many difficult problems and has achieved important results in many sensitive areas through the establishment of the World Trade Organization , we are still concerned by the continuing practice of trade protectionism , which runs counter to our belief in the importance of allowing market forces to play their natural role in economic affairs .  
That is why in many African countries today Governments continue with determination to carry out bold and difficult reforms , reflected , inter alia , in the improved and more rational use of public funds , in the opening of our economies to international trade and in the creation of conditions conducive to private enterprise and to the transparent management of public affairs with , most importantly , all sectors of society participating in the work of national development , in the interests of all .  
It is difficult to persevere in the face of harsh and unjustified criticism and insufficient financial resources while engaged in the complex task of revitalizing the United Nations to meet the needs of a world in rapid transformation .  
Despite this difficult situation , Zaire has made it a point of honour to pursue its democratic process , committing itself to reestablishing the authority of the State , rebuilding the basic infrastructure , improving the country 's economic , financial and monetary situation , ensuring the security of persons and property and observing human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
He has provided dedicated leadership at a particularly difficult time in the history of the United Nations , enduring often unwarranted personal criticism even as he was operating in a situation of diminishing resources on the one hand , and escalating , often conflicting , expectations on the other hand .  
The dynamic and extraordinary manner in which Mr . Boutros Boutros-Ghali has accomplished his mission as Secretary-General in difficult circumstances of financial constraints and wars within and among Nations , and his fostering of social and economic development , has earned our sincere gratitude .  
The commitment that we undertook at the 1990 World Summit therefore represented a challenge that we had to accept in extremely difficult circumstances , since we entered the decade in the midst of a deep economic crisis with reduced resources , an oppressive external debt and great demands and needs for social services .  
Moreover , it is precisely in situations requiring difficult choices that the objectives , commitments and Programme of Action adopted in Copenhagen can be given specific meaning , despite various obstacles which limit the leeway of decision makers .  The objectives and commitments of the world social Summit can be inconvenient in practice , or can conflict with other priorities at the local , regional and international levels .  
Since this initiative came to the General Assembly for the first time as a result of Nicaragua 's urgent needs in 1990 at the end of its decade-long armed conflict and of its starting on the path to democracy and economic and social development , we have seen emergency assistance to be a temporary but very effective mechanism to help resolve the difficult problems of transition .  
For our part , we have carefully analyzed our position in the light of the views expressed so far in the discussions and we will soon present our considerations in the form of an informal position paper , which will elaborate on our previously presented views concerning the most important aspects of the Security Council 's future , including one of the most difficult among them : the issue of the size of the Council and the allocation of newly created seats . 
Seemingly intractable , age-old problems have witnessed dramatic developments , stability and economic development .  As my Minister for Foreign Affairs has stated , the Government of Angola is profoundly concerned by the difficult social and economic situation prevailing in the Republic of Cuba as a result of the financial and economic blockade imposed on that member of the General Assembly .  
I am confident that this session of the General Assembly will live up to the expectations of Governments and the hopes of peoples : that all of us will take a new step in humankind 's difficult transition towards a world united in its diversity , a world that is open to universal economic and spiritual development , a world that promises security and stability a world in which States cooperate on an equal footing .  
It should be unconscionable that financial flows to Africa remain so low despite renewed commitments by the international community to the contrary , and even more so when the majority of African countries have undertaken difficult and unpopular structural adjustment programmes that have marginalized the poor further , depleted natural resources and degraded the environment .  
In our endeavours to face the challenges of humanitarian assistance in emergency situations , the role of the United Nations is of utmost importance in providing a proper framework for effective coordination when the international community is called upon to address difficult problems emerging from natural disasters or other phenomena of a complex nature .  
Since 1991 , official development assistance for Africa has been shrinking , and direct foreign investments remain weak in a very difficult international context that is marked by a fierce commercial competition that the Uruguay agreements have made even more onerous for the African countries .  
President , I have long admired the imagination and determination you have brought to the difficult challenges of multilateral diplomacy , and I should like to express my appreciation for the leadership you have demonstrated in taking the General Assembly through its demanding schedule to an efficient and productive conclusion .  
There may be no other single individual who has been as instrumental or as effective in leading the world community in recent years in the difficult search for common ground , particularly on issues relating to environmentally sustainable development .  
It is clear that the difficult , and at times unfavourable , economic situation faced by many developing countries and countries with economies in transition , the dwindling resources allocated by the international donor community for official development assistance ( ODA ) , and unfavourable internal conditions need to be fully addressed in order to successfully implement reproductive health programmes and to reach the goal of reproductive health by the year 2015 .  
Although the Security Council meets far away from the scene of the events we are discussing today , and although we are not subject to the difficulties faced by the people in the field , I believe it is important that the personnel of the United Nations civilian and military should be aware of our solidarity with them and understanding of the difficult tasks and living conditions that they have to face .  
Perhaps 80 per cent of global exposure to particulate air pollution occurs indoors in developing countries and a disproportionate share of exposure to this serious health hazard is borne by women who do the cooking and by children who are indoors with their mothers .  This extremely difficult situation in the developing world is to a very large extent the result of relatively low consumption of modern commercial energy .  
The representative of Norway had said that one of the most difficult challenges facing the international community was the question of ensuring respect for the rights of persons belonging to ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities , while guaranteeing the territorial integrity and political independence of States .  
The basic reasons for the rising divorce rate were the overall situation of political and economic instability , low incomes , difficult living conditions and environmental problems , and inadequate nutrition for children .  
In the specific area of the advancement of women , the emphasis would be placed on reinforcing women 's economic power , power-sharing between men and women , improving access to social services , raising their legal status through reform of the civil codes , reinforcing their role in the culture of peace , supporting women in particularly difficult circumstances and promoting and protecting the girl child .  
It is particularly difficult to apply meaningfully when the respondent is asked to express a value for many functions of the forest that have no established monetary market value , such as provision of cleaner water , which might become available in a hypothetical set of circumstances , such as through reduction in upstream harvesting activities . 
It will be difficult for those who must daily face a lack of the basic necessities of life to commit themselves to a democratic system unless it brings about a genuine improvement in their low standard of living .  
Noting also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
Concerned about the continuing difficult situation of Palestinian women in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , and about the severe consequences of continuous Israeli illegal settlements activities , as well as the harsh economic conditions and other consequences for the situation of Palestine women and their families , resulting from the frequent closure and isolation of the occupied territory ,  
If it was difficult to give proper treatment in an ordinary detention centre , or if a special or a long-term treatment was required , a patient would be sent to special detention institutions where sufficient medical treatment was available .  
We are addressing ourselves to you , Mr . Secretary-General , in the difficult and critical circumstances in which we find ourselves , in order to assure you once again that we reject and condemn the policy of blockade and closure being pursued by the Government of Israel and to convey to you our extreme displeasure and great concern at the dire consequences the blockade measures are having and at the ongoing closures that have been imposed by Israel on the entire Palestinian people in the areas subject to the Palestinian National Authority . 
As one form of outreach , set up special advisory centres for women and the girl child who might be in trouble or in difficult or irregular situations , including those involved in drug abuse or illicit trafficking , those engaged in prostitution and pornography , runaways , street children , the homeless and those experiencing psychological difficulties or trauma ;  
The possibility that public awareness , educational or other material designed to prevent or reduce illicit demand may draw attention to the availability and means of abuse of prohibited drugs within certain segments of the population is a difficult issue that remains to be resolved .  
Quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of the Basel Convention remains difficult , largely because of a lack of reliable data related to hazardous waste generation ; an absence of comparable data between national authorities ; the absence of accurate baseline data for reported global trade in hazardous wastes ; lack of clear definitions of wastes considered to be " hazardous " ; and the absence of one major industrialized country and several developing countries as parties to the Convention .  
At the same time , we wish to stress our belief that a complete and absolute solution to the problem of extremism and terrorism is linked to bringing an end to the unfair and unjust practices against our people , to the achievement of further political progress in the peace process and to improvements in the living conditions and the difficult economic situation of our people .  
Although it is difficult to make precise statements about the contribution of the various components of domestic demand to overall growth ( because of the often large statistical discrepancies in the national accounts ) , it does appear that fixed investment is now playing an increasingly important role in the economic recovery of eastern Europe .  
While unnecessary , wanton humiliations of the law-breaking State would surely be inappropriate , one finds it difficult to see - for example - how a State guilty of such a crime as a deliberate armed attack and invasion , or deliberate , systematic , massive violations of human rights or self-determination should not be required to offer guarantees that , while preserving its independent statehood and territorial integrity , could be viewed as incompatible with such a formal attribute of a State as its " dignity " .  
As the umbrella term children and youth in especially difficult circumstances covers a wide range of disparate target groups , it is evident that no single strategy will be effective in preventing or responding to the problems of substance abuse to which they are exposed .  
Links should be established or reinforced with media to avoid the negative reporting on children and youth in especially difficult circumstances and to further specific messages to enhance positive , social values fostering favourable conditions for accepting these children back into society .  
Giving a high priority to eradicating the most extreme forms of poverty by trying to reach the poorest of the poor raises not only practical questions of how it can be done in practice with limited resources , material and administrative but also difficult questions of social justice . 
In summary they are those whose ownership of assets or access to productive resources and whose capacity to participate in new opportunities is so low as to make it difficult for them to have the basic minimum of consumption and services required for a decent life .  
In other words , if the tax rules for various types of investment vehicles were not completely consistent , taxpayers could use derivatives to choose the tax treatment that they most desired ; moreover , achieving complete consistency was difficult if not impossible because various instruments differed in ways that were traditionally considered highly relevant to taxation , such as the predictable returns of a debt instrument versus the unpredictable returns on most equity investments . 
Although at times difficult political , economic and technical problems had to be solved , common sense and the two sides ' commitment to their international obligations always won out .  
At the same time , we are pleased to note that the members of the Security Council have been able to resist the temptation to use threatening language and an approach based on force , which could only have complicated the work of the Special Commission and in the final analysis made it more difficult to achieve the major goal set out in Security Council resolutions : a lasting post-crisis settlement in the Persian Gulf .  
The information transmitted is often designed to bring about the provisional arrest of a criminal with a view to subsequent extradition .  The organization also has an analytical crime intelligence unit working on international crime and producing reports that are extremely useful in connection with offences such as money-laundering , where transnational movements are very difficult to trace .  
Although it may be difficult to present these situations in terms of precise and measurable indicators , it is suggested that both qualitative and quantitative indicators are important in relation to indicators of violence against women migrant workers and that specific indicators for the following can be developed in due course .  
The political maturity displayed during and after the general elections by Pierre Buyoya , who gracefully handed over power to the victor , was unceremoniously shattered once again , giving way to a difficult situation which has left the country fragmented and has compounded the problem of mistrust among conflicting parties .  
Coupled with the ongoing process of difficult transition from a centrally planned to a market-oriented economy , the special economic problems resulting from the implementation of the sanctions regime more than four years ago now continue to exert their negative impact on the national economy and on the overall social and economic situation in the country .  
Some delegations underlined the difficult situation and the special needs and requirements of developing countries as a result of environmental degradation and emphasized the need for international support to deal with those problems through projects prepared and implemented by UNEP , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and other relevant organizations .  
Some delegations felt that the development of new norms and new standards and instruments mentioned in paragraphs 19.2 and 19.3 ( n ) was not an appropriate goal , and that the universal ratification of basic international human rights treaties mentioned in paragraph 19.3 ( a ) represented goals which were too ambitious and difficult to be realized during the plan period .  
Although it may be difficult to present these situations in terms of precise and measurable indicators , it is suggested that both qualitative and quantitative indicators are important in relation to indicators of violence against women migrant workers and that specific indicators for the following can be developed in due course .  
The documents also detail the advantages of the Saddam river project in the marsh area , and explain the reasons for the imposition of some of the severe punitive measures of a preventive and temporary nature dictated by the difficult conditions experienced by Iraq as a result of the economic sanctions imposed on it .  
The information received recently by the Special Rapporteur hardly suggests any improvement in the treatment of detainees in prisons and detention centres , which he described in earlier reports .  11 / Those reports give an account of the overcrowding , terrible sanitary conditions , inadequate and substandard food , limited medical care , beatings , restrictions on family visits , the problems of having common criminals share living quarters with political prisoners , and the jailing of many political prisoners far from their home towns , which makes contact with their families extremely difficult .  
In spite of the difficult world economic climate , Tunisia has also managed to achieve encouraging results , illustrated in a rate of growth in national product averaging 4.8 per cent over the last four years ; an increase in non-agricultural industrial exports at an annual rate of 13 per cent ; and an improvement in employment potential , with demand for employment fully absorbed for the first time ; while at the same time the country 's financial equilibrium has been preserved and its external debt brought under control .  
While the State bears the cost of wages and supplementary social charges for no fewer than 14 days when work is suspended ( decree No . 1447 of 31 December 1987 ) , to enable public officials to celebrate a variety of religious , political and social holidays , private enterprises would find it difficult to support such charges , which place a substantial burden on production costs .  
Following the visits of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to a number of the country 's rural and urban areas , during which he noted the inhabitants ' difficult living conditions , the Select Ministerial Council decided to establish a national programme to remedy the situation in districts lacking basic infrastructures . 
Turning to the report of the Secretary-General on privileges and immunities of officials of the United Nations and the specialized agencies and related organizations ( A / C . 5 / 51 / 3 ) he said that the important , sensitive and sometimes difficult task of maintaining the personal safety and security of the staff of the United Nations system was fully recognized by the European Union which appreciated that many of the operations in which staff were expected to serve were complicated and dangerous .  
While it was gratifying to note that the percentage of women in posts subject to geographical distribution had risen by 1 per cent over the past year , his delegation was concerned that , because of the financial crisis , it had been difficult for the Organization to meet its targets for the percentage of women in decision-making and policy-making posts .  
In addition , price measures might suffer from a number of practical problems : the changing nature of output and the increased heterogeneity of products made it very difficult to compile consistent price measures over time ; service industry outputs were notoriously difficult to define and to price ; and measuring the price of governmental outputs presented major conceptual problems .  
As in the preceding months , the mission of observers continues to received numerous allegations of massacres , killings , infringements of personal freedom and security , forced disappearances and arbitrary detentions in the interior of Burundi , especially in the provinces of Muramvya , Gitega , Kayanza , Cibitoke and Bubanza , allegations which are difficult or take a long time to verify because of the aforementioned security constraints . 
With respect to article 4 of the Convention , and in the light of the current difficult economic situation , the Committee emphasizes the importance of the allocation of resources to the maximum extent possible for the implementation of economic , social and cultural rights of the child at both central and local levels , in accordance with the principles of the Convention , in particular those relating to non-discrimination and the best interests of the child ( arts . 2 and 3 ) .  
The fierce international competition and the ever growing ability of well established firms to penetrate remote and underdeveloped markets makes it increasingly difficult for enterprises in low-income countries , in particular the LDCs , to survive , let alone compete , unless strong supportive action is taken so as to redress the structural handicaps confronted by these firms .  
The design of the mobility element attempted to strike a balance between different needs : ( a ) for organizations without rotation policies , and / or with a large proportion of their staff at headquarters , it recognized that the first move was the most difficult to effect ; ( b ) for staff with extensive field networks , which consequently had systematic rotation policies , it made provision for the additional toll exacted by frequent moves , more often than not without a home base .  
Turning to chapter V of the Commission 's report on international liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law , she said that it would be difficult to achieve a universal legal system which covered liability and compensation for harm arising out of acts which were unspecified , particularly in view of the variety of activities and harm that were potentially involved .  
HARRIS ( United States of America ) said that article 3 posed the greatest conceptual difficulties of all the draft articles , because it was always difficult to express the relationship between a new comprehensive agreement and existing bilateral and multilateral agreements on a particular subject .  
It was difficult to believe that euthanasia was now perceived by some as an acceptable alternative to caring for the sick and elderly and disabled persons .  
In the area of backstopping of peacekeeping operations ( financed by the peacekeeping support account ) or the start-up of the international tribunals , for instance , the General Assembly had , until recently , agreed only to ad hoc and temporary financial arrangements under which it has been difficult for the Secretariat to recruit staff in a planned and orderly manner .  
Noting the arduous and difficult conditions in which UNRWA carried out its work to assist Palestinian refugees , he said that , at the regional level , Israel was continuing its occupation and escalating its acts of aggression against the Palestinians , and that it had imposed an economic embargo and a curfew , and had destroyed homes and closed schools .  At the international level , donor Governments had not made their contributions to UNRWA activities , and the new Israeli Government had announced that it was repudiating all the principles of the peace process .  
In those circumstances UNRWA was forced to perform new tasks which had been entrusted to it after the beginning of the peace process , in particular to meet the growing humanitarian needs , ensure the necessary level of services to the Palestinian population , sometimes in extremely difficult circumstances , facilitate the advancement of the peace process with the help of investment and job creation projects , help establish Palestinian State bodies in the autonomous areas and meet the growing needs despite a reduction in budgetary resources .  
Noting also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
The spokesman for the African Group ( Morocco ) said that it was difficult to be optimistic about the possibilities for the African continent to achieve economic and social development , given the negative net external financial flows experienced by the region .  
Noting also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
A general definition of the activities covered , as contained in article 1 , was satisfactory , since it would be difficult to list all the activities and substances to which the articles applied , not least because of the constant advances of science and the concomitant increase in lawful activities ; and also because of the need progressively to eliminate certain chemical substances deemed to be harmful to the environment and to prohibit certain activities that were currently lawful , such as deforestation .  
The maintenance of a significant United Nations presence in Haiti in the form of military elements , particularly against the backdrop of the far more drastic crisis situations in other regions of the world and the extremely difficult financial situation of the Organization , could be perceived as a manifestation of double standards , especially when one takes into account the totally different attitude towards other truly critical and more volatile flashpoints .  
UNICEF 's multifaceted activities have included the massive struggle waged to control the menace of epidemic diseases in the 1950s ; efforts to integrate children 's needs into the overall development agenda in the 1960s ; the commitment to provide basic social services to children in the 1970s ; the campaign for child survival and development in the 1980s ; and , in the closing decade of this century , efforts to support Governments in ensuring the protection of the rights of children , in particular those in especially difficult circumstances .  
The developments which took place prior to the Dayton Peace Agreement proved once again that a lack of firm and prompt international response to aggression leads to further aggravation of crises , causes untold human suffering and makes it all the more difficult to find solutions .  
This hope and faith fuel the efforts of my Government which , under the difficult circumstances of the transition period , and bearing the onerous burden of the consequences of the civil war , is resolving the complex problems involved in transforming the highly centralized economy that we inherited into a market economy .  
Concerning the procedural aspects of the question , it had become clear that the establishment of a permanent international criminal court posed difficult political and technical problems .  
In other cases , however , the joint pursuit of these goals has proved more difficult than expected , at times contributing to political instability , social disarray and economic disappointment .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; these countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
Responding to this productive mood , and convinced that we could advance the process if we continued , our delegations proposed and the Fourth Committee agreed to defer action on the draft resolution and continue the informal dialogue to tackle the more difficult issues still outstanding .  
In response to that suggestion it was observed that in legal systems that recognized insolvency proceedings of natural persons , such as individual traders or merchants , it would sometimes be difficult to establish a clear distinction between the debtors business and personal affairs , and that proceedings apparently falling in the latter category might well have influence on the debtors assets and liabilities .  
For some States it was doubtful whether a workable framework for judicial cooperation could be established exclusively by way of a national statute , in particular since it was difficult to incorporate in it the concept of reciprocity .  
Quite apart from the exceptional amount of public interest this case aroused in those countries , and the variety of difficult and challenging issues it raised fundamental issues of the law of treaties , environmental law , the law of international watercourses and of State succession and State responsibility the case presented a number of distinctive features which called upon the Court 's resourcefulness . 
The need for that assistance and support remains urgent amid the current difficult circumstances faced by the Palestinian people of the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip , in view of the stagnation of the peace process and Israeli coercive measures , including closures and restrictions on the movement of workers and commodities to and from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip which represent an additional burden increasing the suffering of the Palestinian people .  
There can be no doubt that in adopting such provocative and extremist measures , which run radically counter to the will and direction of the international community , the Netanyahu Government is in fact pursuing a premeditated and programmed policy designed to demolish the forthcoming negotiations with the Palestinians , collapse the peace efforts of the United States of America and fabricate a climate of escalation that will make saving the peace process desperately difficult , if not impossible .  
I should like to conclude my remarks by expressing the Government of Japan \ x { e5b8 } deep appreciation to all the countries and international institutions that are engaged in the noble and difficult tasks , both civilian and military , that are required for the implementation of the Peace Agreement .  
Landmines exact a high human , social , economic and environmental cost and make it difficult to create the conditions needed for sustainable development in afflicted regions .  
The latter includes : ( i ) general actions related to shelter , services and settlement-wide issues ; ( ii ) actions for families in especially difficult circumstances ( including those in critical housing conditions , the homeless , female headed households and evicted families ) ; and ( iii ) specific actions for children ( mainly children in especially difficult circumstances ) .  
While proximity to the countries is a definite advantage in developing geographical specialization - something difficult to achieve by entities outside the region - the marked heterogeneity among the countries of the ESCAP region calls for special skills , localized knowledge , and competence for adopting , whenever required , a case-by-case approach .  
At police stations , the forms of torture and ill-treatment reported include kicking ; beating ; application of electric shocks by means of batons or small electrical generators ; the use of self-tightening handcuffs ; deprivation of food ; exposure to alternating extremes of hot and cold temperatures ; enforced standing in difficult positions ; enforced standing in cold water ; prolonged shackling of detainees spread-eagled to a wall ; placing of heated objects on the skin ; and striking with iron rods on the joints or hands .  
I am firmly convinced that with the final fine tuning of these ultimate requirements , this United Nations compensation operation will pass into history as a model of effectiveness , correction and fairness in the delicate and difficult circumstances that led to its creation , and that its work , its rules and its results will guide and shape the outcome of future compensation operations .  
In such conflicts , particularly in the case of a civil war , it is often difficult to determine which party is guilty of violating the peace , and the sanctions themselves may be indiscriminate , non-specific and , consequently ineffective and may only increase the already excessive burdens and sufferings borne by the innocent civilian population .  
In addition to the poverty in which Venezuela 's population was living , the Committee was extremely concerned at the absence of any practical plans at the grass-roots level for putting forward women 's demands , and at the fact that it was difficult to secure passage of legislative proposals for meeting women 's needs .  
Statements were made that judicial cooperation in general , including cooperation in insolvency matters , was governed by bilateral or multilateral treaties , which typically provided for cooperation based on reciprocity .  For some States it was doubtful whether a workable framework for judicial cooperation could be established exclusively by way of a national statute , in particular since it was difficult to incorporate in it the concept of reciprocity .  
A number of members of the Committee expressed concern that in the current situation of dwindling financial resources throughout the United Nations system , there was a tendency in many organizations to cut the funding for public information activities , as public information work was difficult to define in quantitative terms .  
In some cases , the allocation for TCDC is not separately identified from the budgetary allocation for the overall operations of the national focal point as an agency of the Government , and since there may not be a detailed system of accounting , it is difficult to determine how much is being dedicated to the actual promotion of TCDC .  
Every study conducted on remnants of war in North Africa has concluded that the Libyan territory situated between Egypt and Tunisia was transformed into a stockpile of deadly and destructive weapons , and that it is difficult to give exact information about those weapons , since the mines cleared by one party to the conflict were re-laid by the other party , making it difficult to give any precise details as to their number and type .  
Concerned about the continuing difficult situation of Palestinian women in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , and about the severe consequences of continuous Israeli illegal settlements activities as well as the harsh economic conditions and other consequences for the situation of Palestinian women and their families , resulting from the frequent closure and isolation of the occupied territory ,  
The extensive fighting in the north and south of the country has displaced a significant proportion of the population and made it difficult for humanitarian aid agencies to conduct a consistent and effective relief programme .  
Whether through such a mechanism or direct allocations of budgetary expenditures by donors , the funds will need to be in place as increasing numbers of countries pass through the process .  50 .  Countries that begin the process are being told that at the end of an extended period of difficult adjustment measures they will still be in a parlous situation unless they receive a special degree of debt relief .  
It is becoming difficult for a single firm to muster all the resources required to be innovative and competitive in the global markets , and firms are therefore aligning themselves with others , including competitors , with complementary capabilities or resources . 
After the lifting of the sanctions the special economic problems resulting from the implementation of the sanctions regime coupled with the ongoing process of difficult transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy and the accumulation of losses related to the implementation of the sanctions against the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Iraq continue to exert a negative impact on the national economy and on the overall social and economic situation in Bulgaria .  
VIII . 177 .  The Advisory Committee was informed that the arrangements for common and joint services in Vienna that had been in place since 1979 and were based on a tripartite agreement between IAEA , UNIDO and the United Nations , have changed to the extent that certain programmes have become increasingly difficult to maintain at the previous levels .  
This was made possible by the fact that the leaders of the major countries of Europe and North America , in the current difficult situation , have shown the political will to accommodate mutual interests and find compromise solutions designed to keep the world from returning to confrontation .  We continue consistently to oppose the expansion of the North Atlantic Alliance as an outdated and , hence , counter-productive policy direction .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; those countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
I am seriously concerned by an increasing trend towards restrictive asylum policies in many Western countries , including rejection of asylum seekers at borders , interdiction at sea and the narrow interpretation of the refugee definition , including limiting to persecution by State actors .  The distinction between refugees and economic migrants in Western countries is sometimes difficult to establish in practical terms .  
After the lifting of the sanctions the special economic problems resulting from the implementation of the sanctions regime coupled with the ongoing process of the difficult transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy continued to exert a negative impact on the overall social and economic situation in Bulgaria .  
Allow me to reiterate here the great importance of the support of the international community in assisting the member States of the Standing Advisory Committee to carry out the positive measures they have adopted , in a context that must be described as particularly difficult , in order to strengthen subregional security through increased cooperation , as is reflected in document A / 52 / 283 , which contains the report of the ninth ministerial meeting of the Standing Advisory Committee , held in Libreville , Gabon , from 7 to 11 July 1997 .  
After prolonged and difficult talks , the protocol concerning the redeployment in Hebron , concluded on 17 January 1997 , inspired the hope that confidence and mutual trust between Palestinians and Israelis would increase and create a positive environment for subsequent negotiations that could be successful .  
I also take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the entire international community for their immense political , diplomatic and material support to Sierra Leone , and to my Government and people in these difficult times .  
The allegations of summary , arbitrary and extrajudicial executions reported to him from many parts of the country were not surprising , because Iraqi legislation routinely prescribed the death penalty , even for minor offences , and also because the special security services and important figures in the regime had the power to take peoples lives at will ; the Iraqi Government made no attempt whatsoever to change that state of affairs , which it even justified on the grounds that the situation was difficult and that crime was on the increase .  
In rural settings , where women have little access to resources to pay for transport and where roads are likely to be poor and vehicles rare , the physical barriers involved render the use even of routine prenatal care services complicated and use of services for complications and emergencies is difficult .  
Earth observation of coastal regions were still in a pre-operational stage , key constraints being the lack of continuously operational Ocean Colour Sensors , lack of appropriate algorithms with local and timely calibration , low frequency of measurements , difficult access to data , unfriendly integration scheme with other data sources and poor information dissemination .  
Furthermore , on the subject of human rights , our countries have also gone through a difficult and often painful process in their transition to democracy and in the quest for fundamental human rights , a process that resulted in sad and tragic episodes but also taught valuable lessons that can and should be shared with other parts of the world .  
We believe that , for an environment conducive to progress in the peace process to be maintained , particularly at this difficult time , it is essential that the Palestinian people see and experience for themselves the positive economic and social effects of the political changes that would be brought about by a comprehensive peace settlement between Israel and its neighbours .  
In such conflicts , particularly in the case of a civil war , it is often difficult to determine which party is guilty of violating the peace , and the sanctions themselves may be indiscriminate , non-specific and , consequently ineffective and may only increase the already excessive burdens and sufferings borne by the innocent civilian population .  
As a State that has experienced first-hand all the hardships of civil war and has travelled the difficult road towards national reconciliation with active support and assistance from the United Nations , Tajikistan is convinced of the need to preserve strong and efficient peacemaking mechanisms .  
The fact that we have managed to defend the most important social benefits in decades , in such difficult and unusual conditions , strengthens the thesis that in a framework of social justice and an equitable distribution of wealth , certain basic goals of social development can be reached in situations where economic growth is limited , even negative .  
The Rwanda Tribunal is faced with the very difficult task of adjudicating persons responsible for the most egregious crimes imaginable by the human mind : the crime of genocide , crimes against humanity and serious violations of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflicts .  
Bearing in mind those facts and the requirements of our national societies in an international context that is marked by globalization and the interdependence of the phenomena affecting it , and recognizing that it is difficult for the Central American countries to deal with them individually , we must be more creative in order to ensure that our political and economic integration at the international level will be positive in terms of our goals of democratization and sustainable development .  
While it is prepared to consider the question of a thematic debate , whose utility has yet to be proven in the light of recent sessions , my delegation nevertheless continues to believe that it would be difficult to accept the idea of adding other matters to the agenda that have no bearing on the subject matter already addressed .  
The differing provisions of each treaty may make the creation of formal legal linkages complex and difficult , but we see scope for developing political links between the four existing or potential nuclear-weapon-free zones .  
All conferences stressed that every child has the right to be nurtured and protected by its family and that families and society must work together to improve the situation and protect the rights of all children , particularly those in especially difficult circumstances , for example children in areas of armed conflict , children who lack adequate family support , urban street children , abandoned children , children with disabilities , children addicted to narcotic drugs , and the girl child .  
These obstacles include the difficult legacy of the past , contradictory legislation and regulations , administrative delays due to conflicts of interest , differing conceptions of economic and social development , ineffective consultation with the populations concerned , notably on the use of territorial resources , and finally endemic violence .  
In the report on this subject prepared two years ago for the Commission for Social Development , it was emphasized that , in a period of rapid change , it was particularly difficult to identify significant trends and distinguish transient from lasting changes affecting society .  
The lack of sufficient and reliable data on water availability , its use and quality in many areas of the world makes effective national , regional and global water resource assessment difficult , if not impractical .  
We also remain hopeful that on the basis of the continued commitments of member States of the Conference to the shared goals of global disarmament it will be able to resolve the many difficult issues on its agenda , including the contentious issue of a fissile cut _ off .  
While progress in adopting and implementing policies and programmes to promote and facilitate the transfer and diffusion of ESTs is well documented , it has been extremely difficult to make reliable estimates on the actual transfer of ESTs to developing countries and the real size and growth of EST markets , or on the share of investments that can be clearly assigned to financing of the transfer and diffusion of ESTs .  
Noting the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
The Government faces a very difficult task and heavy responsibility in its obligation to protect all citizens of the Turkish Republic from the scourge of terrorism while simultaneously protecting all human rights of all the people of Turkey . 55 .  Secondly , while the press and other media are vivid , the Special Rapporteur finds that , at times , the press is not inspired by a vision of itself as a professional force that serves to inform all members of the public .  
In addition to the general problems involved with an international criminal court , the material differences in the environmental law of different countries made the international hearing of environmental cases difficult , particularly with regard to the choice of law .  
As the distinction was difficult to apply in practice , the Commission should in the future base its work on any given topic on international conventions and custom and the recognized principles of law and should then proceed to consider what contributions to progressive development might be acceptable to the international community .  
Given the gravity of the concerns highlighted , the mandate remains a most sensitive and difficult one since it relates to a State Member of the United Nations where governmental authority is absent and a State administration non _ existent , with the adverse impact this implies on the observance and protection of basic human rights and freedoms .  
We would like to express our delight and gratitude to the entire military and civil staff of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan for the devotion and bravery they demonstrated in complicated and often life-threatening situations as they carried out the very difficult duties assigned them by the Security Council .  
The reason for this is that , although children unquestionably require protection from enlistment in the ranks of these groups , the political and military circumstances of these entities vary to an extent that makes it not only difficult to subject them to a standard rule but also dangerous to accord them international legal status , which might be misinterpreted as granting them implicit recognition .  
Also taking note , with appreciation , of the significant policy reform efforts undertaken by the least developed countries , which in many cases have been wide ranging and difficult to implement ; that these efforts should be pursued further ; and that structural adjustment poses real challenges and resource issues for these countries ; and in this context , encourages the international community to support these further reform efforts by the least developed countries including helping to minimize any social cost of adjustments ,  
Many NGOs have demonstrated an ability not only to serve segments of the community that are difficult to reach , such as adolescents or women living in poor communities , but also to provide high quality services , to work in inaccessible or sensitive areas and to test innovative approaches .  
Also taking note , with appreciation , of the significant policy reform efforts undertaken by the least developed countries , which in many cases have been wide ranging and difficult to implement ; that these efforts should be pursued further ; and that structural adjustment poses real challenges and resource issues for these countries ; and in this context , encourages the international community to support these further reform efforts by the least developed countries including helping to minimize any social cost of adjustments ,  
There was no major humanitarian crisis in 1996 but daily life for the average Somali person continued to be very difficult , especially in the southern half of the country .  
In particular , the disproportionate increase in multilateral debt , which is usually more difficult to service and can not be rescheduled , has intensified the problem of the debt overhang in the region and rendered the process of debt renegotiation more intractable , despite the latest initiative for the " highly indebted poor countries " . 
Deeply concerned at the impact of the conflict on the humanitarian situation and on the social and economic infrastructure of Tajikistan , and aware that the sharp decline in the provision of social , health and education services , lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes and the sharp drop in the real income of most families have made it increasingly difficult for large sections of the population in Tajikistan to meet their basic needs ,  
In fact , it is extremely difficult to establish a regulatory regime which is both expert and independent of capture by well-endowed enterprises ( who may be supported by strong ministers ) , nor perverted by short-term political interests .

However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; these countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
In any case , the Inspectors ' suggestion that such teams should be assisted by the local United Nations Resident Coordinators would be difficult to reconcile either with the Member States ' view that developmental and humanitarian activities in the field should not be mixed with political activities or with UNDP 's need to work in close cooperation with Governments .  
In looking ahead toward post _ START III negotiations , nuclear arms reductions would be far more difficult without a ban on new fissile material production for weapons embodied in a treaty that provides confidence that the international community would detect clandestine production .  
Although the world economy was becoming more integrated through trade and other financial flows , and offers mutual benefits and growing opportunities for economic expansion to participating countries , it also generated social dislocation and demands difficult policy adjustments .  
One Government stressed that a necessary condition for the success of a conference was that the interests of sending , receiving and transit countries be served by it and that , if consensus proved difficult to achieve at the global level , a more realistic approach would be to pursue a process of regional consultations , ensuring that the regional groupings involved reflected migration realities and were not necessarily tied to the configuration of the regional commissions . 
Today 's cities were faced with a lack of financial resources and socio-economic and demographic pressures ; the gap between rich and poor was widening , providing basic social services was increasingly difficult , health , environmental and security problems were getting worse and unsustainable patterns of production and consumption were becoming widespread . 
The situation was particularly difficult for the developing countries since the liberalization of their foreign transactions made them increasingly vulnerable to the unpredictable fluctuations of private capital flows in the international financial markets .  
Those audits disclosed various financial control weaknesses and recurring problems , such as delayed or unreliable financial and narrative reporting , making it difficult for UNHCR to determine the extent to which funds were being used for the intended purposes .  
Striking a balance between the static and dynamic components of competition is particularly difficult for developing countries in todays globalizing world , where the gaps - whether measured in terms of income , productivity performance or technological capacities - are greater than ever , and where small market size , limited availability of entrepreneurs and of production inputs , outmoded technology , inefficient distribution and communications systems or poor information flows combine to create barriers to market entry .  
While understanding the difficult economic situation and the difficulty of reaching durable solutions to the refugee problem , the Committee expressed its concern with respect to the precarious material and psychological conditions of women refugees .  
The application of the exclusion clauses traditionally raises complex , practical and difficult legal questions , not least in the context of very unsettled and ambiguous circumstances surrounding continuous displacement in the Great Lakes region of Africa .  
Russia , and most of the other countries with transition economies , possessed a developed industrial , scientific and technological base , now operating under difficult transitional conditions .  
His delegation would work towards an acceptable definition of the concepts involved and the establishment of a clear standard of proof in respect of legal persons or criminal organizations , but considered that it would be difficult to reach consensus .  
Peacekeeping operations with a humanitarian component were increasingly coming to the fore , and raised a number of difficult political , legal and operational problems .  
The Committee noted that the improved economic performance of LDCs in recent years was mainly attributable to their own sound macroeconomic policy reforms , undertaken under most difficult domestic and external conditions .  
The Board noted that the improved economic performance of LDCs in recent years was mainly attributable to their own sound macroeconomic policy reforms , undertaken under most difficult domestic and external conditions .  
The Board noted that the improved economic performance of LDCs in recent years was mainly attributable to their own sound macroeconomic policy reforms , undertaken under most difficult domestic and external conditions .  
At the policy level , there is a lack of properly articulated policies on sustainable development , and very little or no integration of environmental dimensions in socio-economic policy planning at the national level , which makes it difficult to harmonize priorities at the regional and subregional levels , and to develop coherent and subregional programmes .  
The Government of Rwanda has been regrouping rural populations of the north _ west in grouped settlements , as opposed to the traditional patterns of scattered settlements which leave the people exposed to the action of the rebel groups , while making difficult their access to services such as public education and health , electricity and water .  
We are particularly concerned that poverty continues unabated ; financial resources have taken a downturn ; the transfer of environmental technologies has not materialized ; human-induced climate change has increased ; trade and investments have become more difficult for developing countries ; and globalization has unleashed new threats to sustainable development .  
The view was expressed that the draft articles seemed to be premised upon a highly centralized State with comprehensive regulatory powers ; it would be difficult or even impossible to implement those principles effectively in federal States , where regulatory authority was shared .  
Second , financial aspects , recognizing that it is very difficult to rely on mobilizing domestic financial resources in very poor and populous countries where natural resources are degraded , and international cooperation will need to play a very key role .  
However , considering the value of these forests to local populations , it will be difficult to adequately identify quality changes , especially change in species composition and biological diversity , which is mostly induced by the common practice of selective cutting of highly valuable trees .  
Likewise , when we are aware of the zeal with which alleged terrorists are tracked down , in every corner of the globe , it is difficult to understand why , despite the tireless appeals launched by the overwhelming majority of States , nothing significant has ever been carried out at the national level to prevent the recruitment and use of mercenaries , which , as has been proved , contributes to the flouting of the rules of international humanitarian law . 
The unknown and unpredictable costs associated with such risks as contractual disputes , unfunded liabilities , business interruption or losses due to civil strife , natural disasters , etc . , make it difficult to use a strict formula to determine the protection needed .  
The developing countries difficult situation was further compounded by their lack of technological capabilities , since commodities were becoming less important ( particularly in view of the growing use of manufactured products ) , trade preferences were being eliminated and a new trend had arisen in the commodities futures markets and was threatening to destabilize the earnings of countries dependent on such goods . 
It made it more difficult for developing countries to make use of their traditional comparative advantages , such as cheap labour and abundant natural resources , since industrial and technological capacity with a solid infrastructural base , adequate human resources and business development were increasingly determinants of economic growth and sustainable development .  
The crisis had proved difficult to manage , partly because of its rapid spread to other countries , but more importantly because the usual prescriptions had either proved ineffective or would have involved a much longer transition , which would have caused greater losses of output and social distress .  
If , in addition , one considered the frequent violations of the human rights of the Palestinian and Arab population , the severe conditions under which members of that population were held in custody and the frequent closures of Palestinian territory , it was easy to understand how difficult it was for the Palestinian population to hold on to the optimism and hope engendered by the various peace agreements that had been concluded since 1991 .  
The absence of a consolidated text of the various provisions tends to inhibit focused and systematic attention to migrants as a specific vulnerable social group , and makes the tasks of the relevant advocacy bodies more difficult .  
Mention should be made of the social problems existing in EPZs : local landlords take advantage of the accommodation shortage to charge enormous rents for sub _ standard accommodation ; transport services and social infrastructure ( especially child _ care facilities ) are often non-existent ; friction between the EPZ workers and local residents is common and real integration of workers in local communities is difficult to achieve , in particular because of the high turnover in many Zones .  
The Russian Federation was implementing the provisions of the conference under difficult economic conditions , but within a firm legal framework which included a national plan of action for the advancement of women to the year 2000 and specific federal programmes .  
Under difficult conditions , FRY thus preserved fundamental rights stemming from employment and exerted considerable efforts in the attempt to secure minimum safety at work , where the effects of sanctions and the international blockade were especially inhuman .  
The employed person 's salary is augmented in case of work in conditions which are more difficult than normal for a particular job ( climate , noise , vibrations , irradiation , humidity , harmful gases , biologically harmful substances , physical strain , work with dirty materials , danger caused by tools or objects , means of transport , waste materials , electricity , explosions , heat , corrosive materials , etc . ) , which need to be made specific by special or individual collective agreements .  
During the period of the United Nations Security Council sanctions , it was very difficult , or even impossible , for FRY to import medicaments , raw materials for medicaments , medical supplies , instruments and their spare parts , materials for personal protection of workers , measuring instruments and their spare parts , various chemicals which are required for various analyses in health care and micro-climate tests of working conditions , scientific and technical books , etc .  
These are particularly difficult times for the families of mineworkers and industrial workers who have no revenues from the land ( poverty ratio of 44.33 per cent ) , poor urban families with a large number of children , families with mentally or physically handicapped members , adults or elderly persons without relatives unable to fend for themselves , pensioners with a minimum pension , urban families who have provided shelter to refugee families from war-torn areas of the former Yugoslavia , etc .  
Reaffirms that juvenile justice remains a high priority in the work of the Centre for International Crime Prevention and the institutes comprising the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network , in particular as children and young people , both those in conflict with the law and those in difficult circumstances who may be potential future criminals , are easy prey for criminal organizations closely linked with activities of transnational organized crime ;  
Notwithstanding its own difficult economic situation , which , in fact , is complicated by economic losses caused by the ongoing military actions in Yugoslavia , Ukraine is contributing to international efforts by providing humanitarian aid to refugees from Kosovo .  
It was imperative that the international community , especially the major donors , whether they were States or financial institutions , should not abandon the Palestinian people in such a difficult economic , political and social situation .  
I urge the Council to endorse the electoral support plan submitted by MINURCA , which is based on the minimum that is required , in the difficult circumstances prevailing within the Central African Republic , to ensure an acceptable level of observation of the freedom and fairness of the election process .  
In some cases , the small size of their public sectors makes it difficult to provide adequate regulation , particularly if the offshore sector has grown more rapidly than regulatory capacity .  
Internationally recruited staff members serving at designated duty stations having very difficult conditions of life and work shall be granted once a year , under conditions established by the Secretary-General , an additional shipment entitlement to the duty station by the most economical means of up to 50 kilograms or 0.31 cubic metres , in respect of the staff member and each eligible family member for whom the Organization has paid travel costs to the duty station .  
A focused , transparent and accountable Centre was also worthy of support and commitment from Member States , and he urged the Commission at its current session to send a positive financial signal in that regard , otherwise some very difficult decisions would have to be made .  
Earlier in the present report ( para . 261 ) the Special Rapporteur noted the generalized opinion that , in the light of the situation endured by indigenous peoples today , the existing mechanisms , either administrative or judicial , within non-indigenous spheres of government have been incapable of solving their difficult predicament .  
The problem was that , according to the normal understanding , where an obligation was breached and the exhaustion rule applied , the applicable international law was the law applicable at the time the harm was done and not at the time the local remedies were exhausted ; indeed it was difficult to specify that time because of the different ways in which local remedies could be exhausted .  
Since this was likely to prove particularly difficult at the international level and be of limited relevance to international commercial transactions , the additional benefit to be expected from using an enhanced electronic signature as opposed to a mere electronic signature might need to be clarified .  
Without continued efforts at international cooperation , however , smaller and many developing countries may find it difficult to never build up an adequate scientific and educational base for sustainable space technology and application programmes .  
One country stressed that a necessary condition for the success of a conference was that the interests of sending , receiving and transit countries be served by it and that if it proved difficult to achieve a consensus at the global level , a more realistic approach would be to pursue a process of regional consultations , ensuring that the regional groupings involved reflected migration realities and were not necessarily tied to the configuration of the regional commissions .  
This requires addressing difficult and controversial issues such as schoolgirl pregnancy , adaptation of the content of educational curricula and textbooks to the objective of equipping girls with the knowledge and skills necessary for them to avoid early pregnancy , and broadening the objectives and purposes of education to provide the future generations of women in Uganda with options unavailable to the past and current generations of women .  
As for shortcomings that still need to be addressed , difficult circumstances at the field level have constituted a major cause of interruptions , delays or otherwise hindering the smooth implementation of technical cooperation activities .  
The trend towards ballistic missile defence would be difficult to reverse because the political support in the United States for its development was considerable ; large investments had already been made and committed to further research and development ; and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty was often perceived as an obsolete arms control agreement preventing the protection of the territory of the United States .  
Many small island developing States find it increasingly difficult to access concessional development finance due to the application of criteria by some members of the international community , which focus on their relatively higher per capita gross national product levels without taking full account of their actual levels of development , vulnerability or standard of living in real terms .  
Lack of governmental coordination at the national level : Responsibility for family issues and programmes concerning individual family members ( for example , children , women , youth and so forth ) is usually shared between numerous ministries and agencies within a given country , giving rise to many coordination challenges and making it difficult to develop and implement comprehensive strategies for families , children and so on ;  
The weakening of economic performance in the past two years due to , inter alia , unfavourable climatic conditions and weak commodity prices , together with a more challenging global economic environment , suggest that the recent economic performance of the least developed countries might be difficult to sustain without further diversification of their economies so as to reduce their vulnerability to exogenous shocks .  
I do not want to conclude without paying my delegation 's special tribute to the entire staff men and women of UNAMET and all other humanitarian personnel , particularly those who still remain voluntarily and courageously in Dili , for their tireless efforts , devotion and sometimes sacrifices that they have so valiantly demonstrated in the face of an extremely difficult environment throughout the process , since the popular consultation up to now .  
It provides such channels as absence of currency controls at borders ; increased and instant capital flows at the international level , making it difficult to isolate suspicious transactions ; dollarization of economies , thereby facilitating the circulation of dirty cash ; and a multiplication of the development of offshore financial services to attract foreign investments .  
Then , at the most critical and difficult time in our history , when the Soviet Union and the socialist bloc collapsed and the country was deprived of the fundamental markets and sources of supplies it could count on to withstand the ferocious economic warfare waged against an island located only 90 miles from the United States coast , that country decided to act more ruthlessly still against Cuba : the blockade was intensified to the maximum , in a case of truly vulgar and repugnant opportunism .  
These conflicts are made even more difficult by the huge rise in banditry , illicit trafficking in narcotics and psychotropic substances and the uncontrolled circulation of arms , especially small arms and light weapons , in a continent characterized by porous borders .  
A comprehensive approach was needed in addressing Africa 's structural constraints , including its weak infrastructure and high transport costs , which continued to undermine the expected gains from economic reforms , making it difficult to attract adequate foreign private investment .  
In order to carry out those difficult but necessary changes , Africa needed the international communitys support , including increased financial and humanitarian assistance , contributions to peacekeeping efforts , reduction of the debt burden , better access to export markets and incentives for foreign direct investment .  
Given the difficult financial situations faced by many Member States , however , he called on UNRWA to explore creative measures to alleviate its financial difficulties through alternative sources of income such as contributions from the private sector and expanded joint programmes with international organizations .  
Those who are satisfied with their global economic performance under existing rules are steadfastly opposed because they do not want to do anything that would jeopardize what they see as the crucial , and already difficult , basic mission of increasing trade openness .  
The development of the developing countries was hampered by a debt burden equivalent to a huge proportion of their export revenues ( over 50 per cent in Latin America and nearly 30 per cent in Africa ) and by protectionism ; rigid quality standards that were difficult to meet ; and falling commodity prices .  
Significant regularities observed in countries belonging to each of the really existing systemic families led to a comparative assessment where favourable , and adverse trends were mixed on both sides , making objective economic comparison more difficult ( see table 2 ) .  
It was to be hoped that the questionnaire would meet with the widest possible response , but Governments might find it difficult to provide all the information requested , as the concept of a unilateral act might be as undefined at the national level as it was at the international level .  
Estimates of the number of militia fluctuate for a variety of reasons : some minor leaders and some of the rank and file are returning to East Timor ; militia are often collocated with local West Timorese and displaced persons , making it difficult to distinguish between the two ; with some militia involved in criminal activity , their identity as a pro-integration group is becoming blurred ; and significant elements of the militia leadership appear to be reviewing their plans for the future .  
Some studies indicate that criminal groups are slowly abandoning their involvement in visible economic activities and are diverting criminal profits towards the more secretive financial sector . 7 This diversion is said to make detection more difficult and the confiscation of assets problematic . 
Many still wish to return to the properties they occupied prior to the war , but return has been made difficult by complicated property laws that have not been implemented and by the difficult economic , security and political realities facing those who would now be part of ethnic minorities in their pre-war communities .  
The Committee commends your efforts at supporting the Middle East peace process and at bringing about a comprehensive , just and lasting settlement of the question of Palestine , providing the varied economic assistance to the Palestinian people , carrying out the difficult task of rehabilitating the Palestinian economy , as well as making the socio-economic development of the Palestinian society viable and sustainable . 
We are troubled to see that in a world dominated by a single military and technological Power , we are today less safe than during the difficult years of the cold war .  
At the most critical and difficult time in our history , when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the socialist bloc collapsed , and with them the basic markets and sources of supply that the country could count on to withstand the ferocious economic warfare waged against an island only 90 miles from the United States coast , they decided to be yet more unyielding in their approach to Cuba : with truly vulgar and repugnant opportunism , the blockade was intensified to the maximum .  
The Governments of these countries , faced as many of them are with heavy debt burdens and severe structural adjustment programmes , will find it difficult if not impossible to bear the costs of adequate social measures .  
It would be difficult to explain to the growing number of people who live in pockets of poverty throughout the industrialized world that in Copenhagen , four years ago , we decided to help them and integrate them into the framework of the tremendous social development that prevails in their countries .  
In the four years since the Summit , the developing countries have enjoyed little in the way of the technical and financial cooperation for development that was committed and certainly they have not engaged the path to rapid , broad-based sustainable development.It is in fact somewhat difficult to undertake a review of progress made in follow-up activities when the economic picture today is bleaker than it was at the time of the Summit .  
The action plan could include management initiatives for regional fisheries bodies , monitoring and surveillance , penalties , port access arrangements , boat and gear identification , vessel registers , independent observers , product certification , trade and marketing documentation and memorandums of understanding between producing and consuming countries.Illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing is a difficult issue for Governments to deal with . 
These included reduction of the infant mortality and under-five child mortality by one third and of maternal mortality by half , cutting down by 50 per cent the number of children under five suffering from malnutrition , enabling every child to attend primary school , immunizing 90 percent of the worlds infants and protecting children in especially difficult circumstances , particularly in situations of armed conflict .  
Notwithstanding the difficult economic and social conditions existing in many African countries and the environmental and desertification-related problems , the continent is doing all it can to create conditions for sustained economic growth and sustainable development in Africa .  
Mr . Kuchel ( United States of America ) : Many difficult compromises were reached in the negotiation of this convention , and we believe the agreement that resulted is a reasonable one accommodating diverse interests , which will prove to be useful addition to the developing body of international law relating to the peaceful exploration and use of outer space .  
Not only have we had to battle against established customs and the preachings of a number of conservative sectors , we also although this may be difficult to believe have had to deal with a number of non-governmental organizations which , when they did not get the budgetary support they expected , joined the campaign being waged by some parts of the media and certain political sectors and , betraying their principles , acted in opposition to the reproductive health programmes .
