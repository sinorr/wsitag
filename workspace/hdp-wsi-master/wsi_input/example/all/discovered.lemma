A while back we went to the mainland to conduct interviews and discovered that you are the chairman of the Tan Kah Kee International Institute , which was established in honor of the famous Southeast Asian Chinese who founded Xiamen University .  
In the past decade or so , Lin Tsung-sheng has been to a primeval mountain forest that even the Yangmingshan National Park Headquarters has yet to check out . He has followed upstream more than 140 major and tributary waterways in the Tatun mountain area and discovered that " the national park that gets five million visitors a year is really just the surface . " Tatun has many startling secrets hidden under its dense bamboo tree cover . "  
Each piece displayed a different character , depending upon the light , shape , and coloring . Each had a different story to tell , from cool and aloof to hot and passionate . People discovered to their great delight that the world of glass is a varied and colorful place .  
Tsai says that the song was written about a friend of his who was imprisoned for being in a criminal gang . The friend had applied for leave from prison to visit his sick grandmother . When he was refused , he escaped from jail . When he was discovered and reincarcerated , his sentence was raised from five to 12 years .  
Archaeologists have discovered remains of underground sewers amid the ruins of Qin , Han , Sui and Tang dynasty cities both large and small . They were made from fired clay , not reinforced concrete as are modern sewers . But when such pipes in these cities were connected one after another , they formed rather comprehensive sewage systems .  
Analyzing the replies more closely , we discovered that the positive opinions were mainly centered on such aspects as Japan 's good infrastructure and its people 's unity , law-abiding nature and efficiency , while negative opinions were mainly to do with the Japanese being aggressive , cruel , treacherous and materialistic .  
Super slim , super fastThis year Lu Chen-fang , a lecturer at the Chang Geng College of Nursing , did a survey of more than 700 second-year nursing students at nine nursing colleges in northern Taiwan . The survey discovered that fully 87% of those of normal weight ( meaning within 10% of the standard weight for their height ) and of those who were slightly thin ( 10-20% below their standard weight ) thought themselves to be " too fat . "  
With many of Taiwan 's wild animals having become " disadvantaged groups " or having even been driven to the verge of extinction by pressure from human development , it became a matter of necessity to pass the Wildlife Conservation Law to protect endemic and rare species . But at the same time , previously unknown species of tree frogs , shrews , bats , spiders and many other animals which , though unfamiliar , enrich the list of Taiwan 's endemic species , have recently been " discovered " in the wild .  
Since the endemic Mikado pheasant was first recorded 80 years ago , no other new bird species has been discovered in Taiwan , and in recent years although mammals such as bats or shrews have been newly recorded here , the island 's forests have been logged up to elevations of 2500 meters , and today if mammals have remained undiscovered it is because of their hidden or inaccessible habitat or their nocturnal habit .  
Although many people remain skeptical about duplicating the characters of the ancient masters , thirtysomething artist Tu Chung-kao expresses the opinion that throughout history the number of literate people was exceedingly large , and to be able to make a lasting impression for all time is no mean feat . The great masters that are held up for imitation today discovered long ago the best way to achieve the most beautiful composition and shape for each character . Copying them is essential .  
Rather , starting with ancient Greece , I reread the Western philosophers . I worked hard at standing in their shoes . The process was very difficult , for I discovered that things which in the past I had been educated to accept as true and reasonable gradually became petty and untrustworthy .  
For instance , I used to get into earnest discussions with everyone about artistic methods and schools and about what was unique to Chinese art . But after I read the Western masters I discovered that they had thought about many of these issues hundreds or even thousands of years ago , and I found that those things which I deemed so special about Chinese art also exist in Western culture . And so in looking back , those past discussions seem pretty laughable .  
Since the 1980s , when US researchers confirmed that taxol ( derived from the Pacific yew , Taxus brevifolia , which belongs to the same genus as the Taiwan yew , Taxus mairei ) is effective in treating ovarian and breast cancers , clinical trials have been conducted or are planned to test the drug against more than 60 types of tumor . As more and more suitable applications are discovered , the demand for taxol is expected only to rise .  
A few years ago there was an incident which shook society . A Buddhist medical worker who could not bear to witness the suffering of the severely ill in their last stages and the hardships imposed on families for the long-term care of " human vegetables , " " played God " and let some of them die . He was discovered and prosecuted .  
In recent excavations of ancient tombs from the Spring and Autumn period , in the tomb of Lady Gouyu , younger sister of Lord Jing ( ruled 516-476 BC ) of the state of Song , a bronze basin was discovered which contained nothing but a large quantity of Sichuan peppercorns . This is surely the most direct proof one could ask for of the esteem in which our ancestors held spices .  
Grabbing the bird , I discovered that the webbing of her foot had been pierced by a hook caught in a rope used by the local aquaculturists . The swan 's blood was turning the water around her red . I quickly tried to pull out the fish hook with my hands , but the hook was too deeply caught in the flesh , and I ended up cutting my own index finger instead . All the while , the injured bird was splashing and struggling to fly away , drenching us with lake water .  
It was discovered that in maledominated jobs-the military and police , construction workers , machinists-men use various roundabout methods to " mark their territory . " Thus posters of naked women , impossible to avoid seeing , are put up in factories . Or construction workers will urinate openly right in front of passing women . It even happens that women scholars doing field research or female students supporting labor rights may find themselves in dangerous situations in such environments .  
" For example , I discovered the Focolare Movement , founded fifty years ago by an Italian woman , Chiara Lubich . Besides spreading Catholic doctrine and beliefs , she also emphasized experimental lifestyles . She organized associations or cooperative societies in which people lived a simple life in close communion with nature . Today they still have communities and farms in West Africa and in Latin America . "  
The discovery of oracle bone inscriptions rebuilt knowledge of a royal dynasty which some had suspected was imaginary , and the many neolithic sites discovered in mainland China over the past few decades have not only shown up even earlier traces of written language , but have also debunked the idea which we learned from childhood , that China 's central plain was the cradle of Chinese civilization .  
After a trip abroad , he discovered that Chinese Muslims had little understanding of their own religion 's doctrines , and were in dire need of an accurate Qur'an and other materials for interpreting it . He thus spent more than 20 years translating three Chinese texts altogether : one in classical Chinese , one in jingtangwen ( an old form with specific religious terms left in their original form , that is , not translated into a common equivalent ) , and one in the vernacular .  
Take for example coverage of a demonstration in January 1993 , held by two groups ( mostly those opposed to " Taiwanese consciousness " ) to " Support the Lee-Hau System ; Support Another Term as Premier for Hau Pei-tsun . " After comparing the headlines and contents of the various newspapers , Chang discovered that the Taiwanese-oriented Liberty Times emphasized negative themes such as " the situation was disorderly , " and " the demonstration won little public support . " In follow-up commentaries the paper was critical of the demonstrators .  
The water lily , which grows from the depths to above the surface of water , seems to bring a tremendous hidden vitality out of nowhere , hinting at the true source of creation . Many ancient Egyptian myths are connected to the water lily . In Egypt , where they worshipped the sun , they have discovered designs in which the sun god Ra sits as a child on a water lily .  
They quickly discovered that while she looked elegant and refined , she was broad-minded , direct and easy to get along with . Though she could n't speak Hakka , she could chat away half the day with them using signs and gestures . Though an artist , she spent her days working in the fields . Running up and down the mountain , she was soon as tan and as strong as the local farming wives .  
Having studied at an agricultural high school , Li thought she was fully prepared to farm . But facing it firsthand , she quickly discovered that farm work was n't as easy or as laid back as she had imagined . And after becoming more closely involved with Chiungchiao Keng 's people , she gradually came to understand the town 's problems as well .  
After the PPI mapped out hunting grounds , it was discovered that these covered less than one-fifth of Wutai Rural Township . Also , because of forbidding topography or traditional taboos , some untouched areas were left between the hunting grounds . This fits right in with theories of effective management of natural resources .  
In 1947 , scientists at General Electric discovered quite by accident that their synchrotron accelerator was radiating a thin layer of light . This light comprised large amounts of infrared radiation , visible light , ultraviolet radiation and X-rays . Furthermore , it was 10,000 times brighter than the light created in traditional X-ray tubes . Virtually any substance or fine structure could be viewed very clearly under its radiation .  
Li Yih-yuan has discovered that the logic of the almanacs-to seek safety through knowing when to act and when not to-has , in modern commercial society , been transformed . It has been adapted to daily life , especially to the pragmatic pursuit of profit .  
On the contrary : birdwatchers have discovered that ever since accumulating soil from construction work upstream and an ever-decreasing flow of water caused sandbars to appear in the stretch of river near Huachiang Bridge , more and more ducks and geese have gathered there , and they have gradually extended their domain upriver to the Kuangfu , Huachung , Chungcheng and Yungfu bridges , so that the goose and duck park has had to be enlarged and its name changed .  
An ad hoc task force comprising both civilian and military investigators is now hard at work on the case , but has discovered signs that many documents have either been lost or falsified . Many worrisome questions remain unanswered : How many people are involved ? How high up does the case reach ?  
When someone has exhausted all avenues of appeal in the heavenly bureaucracy , the god which steps in fortuitously to save the day is one with an immortal facet to its character . These are the gods to which people turn for help . They make trouble for authority . Unlike the god Chenghuang , who must stay put at Chenghuang Temple , where his actions are held in check by a multi-tiered celestial bureaucracy , Lu Dongbin is often discovered wandering far away from the shrine in southeast Taipei that is devoted to his worship .  
He met the subject of the piece , Li Jung-lin , nine years previously when Li handled the funeral of his mother . But it was only two years ago , when Lin 's mother 's grave was robbed , and Li , wearing a gas mask , personally went into the grave to repair the damage to the coffin , that Lin really came to understand this man . He discovered that Li has quite remarkable views on death , human dignity , and on the poor self-regulation of the funeral industry .  
ICM researcher Chen Ta-chih first studied both folk prescriptions and those prescriptions found in ancient medical texts . He discovered that just as modern Western treatments call for injections into the penis or doses to be taken directly in the urinary canal , ancient Chinese medical texts included many similar external applications to treat impotency .  
" In researching Chinese medicine , both developing new medicines and respecting the ancient Chinese medical principles are essential , " argues Chen Chieh-pu . Synthesizing chemical components or extracting new drugs from natural herbal , mineral or animal substances has long been an important process in mainstream medicine . Quinine , which is used to treat malaria ; the cardiotonic rehmannin ; the painkiller morphine ; and antibiotics , which are widely used and have saved so many ; were all discovered in natural herbal medicines or fungi .  
" But I gradually discovered that I was not suited to heterosexual marriage . If I did n't take cognizance of my homosexual orientation , and continued in the marriage , it would not have been fair to my wife or family . I had to be honest with myself and my family , so my former wife and I agreed to a divorce . "  
Liu Tseng-kui , a research associate at the Academia Sinica 's Institute of History and Philology , created History Links ' basic structure out of his personal collection of website bookmarks , accumulated over years of combing overseas websites for historical data for his research . In the course of his research , Liu discovered that while there was no dearth of literary and historical websites in Taiwan , there were few online collections of links to such sites . He therefore assembled his own site last year , dividing his vast collection of bookmarks into categories .  
In one media report , a doctor was quoted as saying : " It has been discovered that if women who have been single for a long time have introverted personalities , and are self-absorbed , their emotional life often becomes very bizarre . As they repress their sexual desires , their hormone secretions fall out of balance , and they are susceptible to tumors in the reproductive system .  
Why could n't a gas station be set up on the island ? The provincial government discovered that the sticking point was obtaining the land . If suitable sites were n't on national government land , then they were owned by temples . But after the provincial government negotiated with the National Property Bureau and discussed the matter with local residents , the island was finally able to get its gas station .  
Council for Cultural Affairs vice chairman Wu Chung-li says that in the future , traditional theater will be incorporated into the overall project . In the future , will Taiwan produce a true celebrity of the theater ? And will young people become avid fans of theatrical stars ? Though these questions are impossible to answer , many students have already discovered the bountiful universe that is the theater .  
As women have rewritten their gender characteristics , some reassessment has been made of the male box . It has been discovered that this rigid box has not only crushed women and children under it , it has also deformed men-those allegedly advantaged by it . It has stifled their emotions , destroyed their health , reduced the happiness they get out of daily life , and made them lonely and violent .  
After years of research on " split-brain " epileptics ( epileptics whose corpus collosum-a neural structure linking the two sides of the brain-has been cut to limit seizures to one side of their brain ) , Sperry discovered that the left brain is responsible for language , logical thinking and analysis . The right brain , on the other hand , seems to be involved with images , imagination and intuition .  
As early as 1975 , brain specialists had discovered that the cerebral cortex , unique to primates , was responsible for intellectual activities such as language and reasoning . The limbic system lies below the cortex and pre-dates it . Sometimes called the " mammalian brain , " it is involved in the expression of emotions . On the lowest level lies the brain stem , sometimes called the reptilian brain .  
A year ago , when SET established its news department with a focus on what is termed " community news " ( meaning crime , sex and other sensational topics ) , it originally expected to lose about NT $ 5 million a month . Now , a year later , they have discovered that they have actually been making money , and they have decided to turn into an all-news station , adding staff in anticipation of the media wars that are sure to erupt during the presidential election campaigns .  
In the lore of Chinese medicine , Shen Nong is credited with having discovered countless medicines by trying out various herbs on himself , but even he would have to be amazed at the willingness of people in modern Taiwan to experiment on themselves . Many people think of cancer as a death sentence . If they are unlucky enough to be hit , they become desperate and will risk any kind of treatment , however unorthodox . In fact , this is not hard to understand .  
Over 50 bronze heads were discovered at Sanxingdui , and they feature a wide variety of headgear , including gold masks , fancy hairstyles , braided head bands , and curly hair that seems to surge forward like breakers at the beach .  
Now that the Sanxingdui exhibit has brought over a huge bronze statue of a man and many other exotic items , another blockbuster exhibit from the mainland has been scheduled for October . The autumn event will feature the superbly preserved silk paintings found at the Mawangdui site in Hunan Province as well as the stunning jade pieces discovered in Guangzhou at the royal tomb of the Nanyue kingdom . Going in the other direction , a private Taiwanese collection ( Ku Yue Ko ) was put on exhibit four years ago at the Palace Museum in Beijing .  
As " artistic supervisor of character design , " Chang set about crafting the overall style of Mulan , and he discovered an element from classical Chinese painting that proved useful in animation-the " gossamer sketching " method of delineating human figures . In particular , the curving lines that form the hands of Buddhist deities , giving the effect of floating clouds or flowing water , became the artistic basis for the film 's character design .  
Then I came back to work to apply what I 've learned , " explains Hsing . She originally studied land management , but discovered that Taiwan lacks any comprehensive land management policy , leading to rampant overdevelopment and speculation . She decided to go study urban planning . " And then I discovered that urban planning is closely related to environmental management and public policy , so I went from program to program . "  
There are also a number of architectural elements in the exhibit , including banisters , column capitals , tiles , and flagstones from the king 's palace . These items have all just been excavated in the past five years , and are highly significant finds as they come from the oldest royal palace ever discovered in China . The exhibit also reproduces a beautiful stream paved with small , closely packed dark-gray pebbles interspersed with larger yellowish pebbles .  
It was here that Yen Tsang-po , who has long been a leading light among Taiwanese geologists , discovered sedimentary rock dating back 200 million years , the oldest ever found in Taiwan . An analysis of what he found tells us the basic story of Taiwan 's formation . For untold eons , what is now Taiwan lay upon the ocean floor collecting sediment that had been washed out to sea from the Asian mainland .  
We discovered that China in the Year 1 was in the Han dynasty , which established the foundations of Chinese systems in many areas . It was an era also of dynastic struggles , filled with heroes and striking personalities . At the Year 1000 , the Song dynasty had reunified China . Its weakness forced it into a form of " economic diplomacy " to fend off the peoples of the north , yet at the same time this demilitarization of external relations led to splendorous achievements in culture and wealth for society as a whole .  
He explains : " From both the psychiatric literature and clinical experience , doctors discovered that there 's a peculiar phenomenon with people suffering psychological disorders . Once they 're in hospital , the disorders can be controlled quite well , but when they return home , not long thereafter the symptoms re-emerge . " Doctors thus became curious about the family backgrounds of their patients , and social workers were sent to investigate . The result has been the discovery of many dysfunctional families .  
He finally left Taiwan in 1947 . When I went to Japan last January and paid my respects at his grave , I discovered that his gravestone was inscribed in Atayal . I used to cry every time I talked about this wonderful doctor , but I 'm getting a little less emotional about it as time goes by . I have to hurry up and get the book written . "  
The Republic of Palau , situated on an archipelago in the Micronesia region of the South Pacific , occupies a strategic position both for international transport and in military terms . It has a total area of 488 square kilometers and a population of something over 18,000 . After being " discovered " by the Portuguese in 1783 , Palau was subsequently ruled by Spain and Germany . After WWI it was made a Japanese protectorate , and after WWII was governed by the US under a UN trusteeship .  
At a time when multi-track admissions have yet to meet with widespread support among parents and teachers , an unfortunate incident occurred at the end of February . It was discovered that students at about a dozen junior high schools had been leaked the answers to the mock joint exams . This led to fears that the multiple track admissions policy was not as fair as the joint entrance exam .  
According to the first-century Roman historian Pliny the technique was discovered around five thousand years ago by Phoenician traders on the Mediterranean coast . A crew of traders camping on the beach rested their cooking pots on bricks of natron , a sodium-carbonate-based mineral that they were transporting , and noticed that vitreous strips were formed when the heated mineral fused together with sand .  
In his remarks , entitled " Information Technology Changing the Face of the World , " Dr . Magee described his own experience with technology . Relying on advanced remote medical care technology ( and help from the business community ) , he discovered that modern technology really can make humanitarian assistance more successful and more effective .  
The whole trip takes about half the day . She had thought that these stores were only crowded on the weekends , but on a rainy weekday in November she decided she did n't feel like cooking and went to buy some prepared foods at the RT-Mart 's deli department . She discovered that there was n't a single open parking space among the hundreds on the first and second floors of the parking structure . She was quite surprised to find that business was so good on a weekday .  
The devastating 21 September earthquake of 1999 left Taiwan 's landscape covered in scars , but researchers discovered that the places least damaged by the quake were areas of natural forest . In mountain regions where the rainfall is most abundant , the geology most fragile and erosive forces most powerful , the false cypresses , with their massive trunks and mighty root systems , cling tightly to the frail earth .  
When the regulations were announced , 90% of major international producers , including NEC and Fujitsu , discovered that their previous efforts in the field had been wasted . Startek , however , had correctly guessed that recognition standards would be based on key points for each print . Startek is now one of only three firms anywhere in the world that can provide the proper fingerprint recognition software , and its products are technically the most advanced .  
In the year 2000 , Liang Chieh-teh , a maker of documentary films , shot a nature film about terns on Matsu , and he accidentally discovered some Chinese crested terns there . The species had only been sighted five times before , and many assumed it was extinct or described it as a " legendary bird . "  
Two decades later , the Japanese botanist Fukuyama Noriaki also collected pleiones from Mt . Hsiakalo in Hsinchu . This time the flowers were a pure , snowy white , and the onion-like bulbs were a glistening green color , unlike the previously discovered purple bulbs . Overjoyed at his discovery , Fukuyama named this new variety the snow-white pleione ( Pleione formosana var . nivea ) .  
Besides medical work , another major contribution of Maxwell 's missionary work was the translation of a vernacular Bible . Since Pingpu indigenous people were the main focus of his missionary work , Maxwell traveled frequently to Aboriginal parishes . There he discovered that contracts for buying and selling of land between Pingpu people and Han Chinese were written using the romanized writing system that was a legacy of the Dutch occupation .  
The legend says that these former slaves later slaughtered a group of British soldiers who had landed on the island to explore it . When a British naval vessel discovered the soldiers ' fate , the sailors piled brush at the mouth of the cave in which the slaves were hiding , doused it in oil , and set it alight . The fire burned for three days , killing all of the several hundred slaves inside . This sad event is the origin of the cave 's name .  
A dynamic bronze horse from the Eastern Han period was discovered in Gansu . It suggests a mythical flying horse , empowered with divine capabilities , which Chinese at that time believed horses possessed .  
But as she joined in a brief preliminary sacred dance , she opened her eyes and found herself , one hand raised in the air , the other held below , spinning like a child . She suddenly discovered that it was as if the spinning part were merely the exterior , while she herself was as calm as the eye of a storm . Later , she immersed herself in the quarter-hour whirling , and not only did not feel faint , but actually experienced greater clarity than usual .  
Busy as a bee just to make a living , rushing ahead out of fear of falling behind . In the midst of the hustling e-generation , when competition has become the key in which our lives are orchestrated , and pressure has become a constant , how to put one 's heart at ease and live care-free ? Although trendy prescriptions are legion , some have discovered that returning to the ancestral practice of Chinese calligraphy-using a brush-is modern man 's most " soothing " remedy .  
When a Japanese technician discovered groves of towering ancient trees on Mt . Ali at the end of the 19th century , the Japanese colonial administration hired a forester to survey the mountain 's timber . He found excellent stands of timber-red cypress , yellow cypress and Taiwan yew trees that were upwards of a thousand years old and that required as many as ten men to encircle . To get these giant trees to market , the Japanese began to construct the Alishan Mountain Railway in 1906 .  
After the gold veins of the took shape , they were raised upward as the land surface rose . Within the last million years , erosion effects have gradually exposed the gold to the surface , and gold particles from shallow veins have been washed into rivers . It was possible to run across gold in the Keelung River , which is how it was discovered in the first place .  
In addition to the acute harm caused by large quantities of poisonous chemicals , in the late 1980s people discovered that despite the increasing level of controls over the use of chemicals , even low levels of some compounds could still lead to chronic effects such as tumors , birth defects and genetic mutations .  
Although they had not " done " anything , she broke out in a cold sweat . Her concern reminded me of the time a few years ago when I discovered a 15-year-old student whom I was tutoring engaged in a raucous game of mahjongg with three classmates , each of them accompanied by a girlfriend !  
When she discovered her 16-year-old older daughter was pregnant , her first reaction was to give her a few hard slaps . With no man in the family to give her support , she worried that when the news got out her daughter would get expelled from school , so she decided to take her to get a secret abortion . She also threatened her daughter not to tell her boyfriend , worrying that he would tell everyone after they broke up and cause her daughter great shame .  
As a matter of fact , after assuming the KMT chairmanship in March 2000 , Lien Chan stated that after a comprehensive examination of party assets and commercial investments , it had been discovered that during Lee Teng-hui 's presidency , when Liu Tai-ying was director-general of the KMT 's Investment and Business Management Committee , there were eight highly controversial investment cases with combined total losses of NT $ 9.8 billion .  
Over the last 20 years scientists have discovered that materials behave differently at nanometric levels than they do in amounts visible to the naked eye . Just as the fundamental properties of a substance will change in a vacuum or at low temperatures , substances at nanometric sizes will undergo various physical and chemical changes . By singling out certain characteristics-such as strength or ductility-you can then go on to create countless products with new functions . Take , for instance , gold .  
When Yang made his first trip to mainland China in 1989 , he never expected that CHM would become the professional preoccupation of the rest of his life . Traveling only to see the scenery , he incidentally discovered that major pharmaceuticals manufacturers from around the world had set up shop in the PRC , hoping to find buried treasure . That 's when he decided to go into the business of gathering , inspecting , and trading raw materials for CHM , and even cultivating basic sources of botanical pharmaceuticals .  
Yang once decided to grind pearl down to nano levels , and discovered that he had destroyed the amino acid , releasing a foul odor and ruining the raw material .  
" Parents should set their kids free , and not just so as to lighten the burdens on their kids , " Lu says . " In the past , while putting all their expectations on their kids , parents stifled their own potential for growth . " He discovered that many seniors felt bitter upon entering old age and discovering that they could not live close to their children . It affected their mental outlook for the entire latter period of their lives .  
In 2001 , Natural Beauty commissioned a communications company to conduct a survey in which they discovered that 87% of those polled in Shanghai reported having heard of Natural Beauty . An additional 81% identified Natural Beauty as a Chinese brand of cosmetics , and 92% agreed that Natural Beauty products suited Asian women .  
Recently a friend studying in Germany returned to Taiwan , and said with obvious feeling that despite the flourishing of the Aboriginal movement in Taiwan over the past ten years , when he returned to the village where he had done field work seven or eight years ago , he discovered the same old thing : lonely old people , kids who quit school halfway through , and emptiness in the tribal community . " Have n't you noticed this gap ? " he asked .  
He eventually discovered that the paper most suitable for sky lanterns was the kind used under the steamed turtle buns presented as an offering to the Lord of Heaven on the ninth day of the first lunar month . And so every year on the eve of the Lantern Festival he would volunteer to work at the local cake shop in exchange for a few sheets of uncut white paper .  
In order to better understand the English-language education conundrum facing elementary schools throughout Taiwan , Control Yuan members Lu Hsi-mu , Lin Shih-chi , and Yin Shih-hao compiled an investigative report entitled " Problems in Elementary School English Education " at the close of last year . In it they discovered that rural schools were quite often unable to hire accredited English instructors .  
The Chinese first made lacquer ware some seven millennia ago . Archeologists have discovered that the Hemudu Culture produced red lacquer on a wood base , and numerous archeological digs over the past few decades at burial sites dating back two to three millennia have turned up perfectly preserved lacquer ware surrounded by badly rotted artifacts made of wood and other materials . Records of Artisanry mentions the kings Shun and Yu ( both of whom ruled roughly 3,200 years ago ) making lacquer ware items .  
On May 10 , an elderly person living alone in an apartment in the Huachang Public Housing Project in Taipei 's Wanhua District was discovered to have passed away at home several days previously , and two women living in neighboring apartments ( one of whom died shortly thereafter ) were apparently infected . The entire community was quickly sealed off , with more than 700 persons subjected to compulsory quarantine , making this the first community in Taiwan to be sealed as a result of a SARS outbreak .  
Since AIDS was discovered in 1981 , shattering the illusion that mankind had won the battle against infectious diseases , they have posed an ever growing danger . Modern medicine has proven ill-equipped to cope with infectious diseases caused by new viruses as well as old diseases that have staged a comeback . The SARS virus is the latest attack by microorganisms .  
Two years later , with the help of geologist Lin Chao-chi and a mineral exploration company , Pan Ke-yung went to Tingku Village in Pali to take a look . Lin Chao-chi discovered numerous fragments of iron ore slag , remnants of primitive iron smelting . Because there was no record of metal making in that area by either Han Chinese or Japanese , Lin concluded that this was probably a prehistoric iron smelting site .  
Indeed , in recent years , with the government promoting the reuse of neglected spaces ( much as it promoted " holistic community building " a few years earlier ) , the seeds of creativity and idealism have been planted in cities , towns and rural hamlets . Idle and abandoned century-old buildings , whether publicly or privately owned , have sprung to life again . Meanwhile , a connection has been discovered between preserving memories of the past and promoting the arts .  
In 1994 , led by teachers Lu Hung-wen and Huang Kuei-kuan , a group of students from the Peitou Elementary School investigated the natural resources of their local area . They sought out documented information on the " Peitou Hot Springs Public Baths , " which have close ties with the development of Peitou itself . From this information , they discovered that the long-forgotten , overgrown , and run-down " haunted house " was in fact the site of that very same pool complex , Southeast Asia 's largest and most luxurious public pool in its day .  
For Wang Steak , which has annual revenues in Taiwan in excess of NT $ 1 billion and long ago extended its operations to the US , entry into the PRC was obviously rather late . Park Cheng explains : " We did a survey of white-collar workers several years ago and discovered that although Shanghai once did have areas controlled by Britain and France , nobody in Shanghai chose ' Western food ' as their preferred option for dinner out . "  
Society should not only encourage young people to have more diversified dreams , it should let them see behind truly successful people-and especially those who have devoted genuine effort to their dreams and stuck to their guns , or those who have had the courage to change their ways when they discovered that they had mistaken the illusory for the real .  
But in fifth grade , his teacher discovered that this " problem student " could draw powerful and intriguing pictures . The teacher signed Lee up for a province-wide primary-school drawing competition in which , incredibly , he won a prize . This prize seemed to set free the previously locked-up spirit of this small Aboriginal child .  
One year , Kung planted his plots with a kind of mini-gourd , and the entire crop was hit by a mutation , causing the gourds to be more pear-shaped instead of their usual hourglass-like shape . He took this mutant variety in to a seed company , who discovered after some trials that that variety of mini-gourd was particularly susceptible to mutation in cold temperatures-Kung had planted them during winter . The seed company planted another row during summer , which produced gourds of the normal shape .  
Chen Yuan-tsung , director of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences , Academia Sinica , says that what makes neonatal screening different from embryonic screening is that it aims to detect rare metabolic disorders that can be treated or prevented if they are discovered at an early stage . Infants are therefore given the chance to grow up healthy , or to suffer from fewer sequelae .

The cloud leopard 's den : Auvini 's work is multi-faceted , and it mainly involves publishing newspaper articles about his interviews and research , which focus on traditional customs , tribal history , myths , legends , taboos , etc . He has discovered rules that anthropologists overlooked governing how the Haocha people placed their dead in their own homes . For example , men who died from natural causes were buried in front of the central pillar , whereas women were placed beneath a platform by the window .  
But strange to say , despite the inn 's many advantages , fewer and fewer guests graced its doors , and the wine would often turn to vinegar before it could be sold . Searching for the explanation , the inn-keeper finally discovered that everyone was afraid of the ferocious dog which he kept at the inn , and naturally no one dared to come and drink there . Thus the saying goes : " A fierce dog will leave wine sour and unsold . "  
Luxe has a sixteen-year history of eel farming behind it , with the major market for that product being Japan . It was through familiarity with Japan that the company discovered that Japanese also are very fond of moth orchids . Given the definite market there , the company decided that moth orchids were suitable for large scale commercial production .  
Early on , heavenly bodies were named after mythical figures , nations or cities or otherwise already deceased " scientific legends " Wu Chien-hsiung 's outstanding accomplishments in physics earned her the admiration of researchers at Nanjing 's Mt . Zijin Observatory , who named the star they discovered after her .  
In 1993 , another dinosaur incident on the mainland startled people worldwide . When digging , country folk in Hunan 's Xixia County accidentally came across " black stone eggs , " which they then went on to sell as an ingredient for Chinese medicine . It was only after thousands had been dug up and sold that a Nanjing customs inspector discovered that these black " stone eggs " were in fact being viewed as priceless dinosaur eggs elsewhere in the world !  
Lin Shih-chieh , who transferred from the China Junior College of Industrial and Commercial Management in Taipei to Tzu Chi Junior College of Nursing out of curiosity , recalls that in Taipei his main hobbies were smoking , drinking , and playing billiards . But when he got to Tzu Chi in Hualien , his personality changed , and after participating in volunteer work and the Buddhist study camp , he discovered that " it 's much more meaningful to expend effort for others than to just try to have fun for oneself . "  
Over thirty years , I wrote five books in Chinese . Since becoming ill , in less than half a year I have written two . I have discovered that my potential can be devoted to writing . This confidence is also something that readers have built up for me .

In the past decade or so , Lin Tsung-sheng has been to a primeval mountain forest that even the Yangmingshan National Park Headquarters has yet to check out . He has followed upstream more than 140 major and tributary waterways in the Tatun mountain area and discovered that " the national park that gets five million visitors a year is really just the surface . " Tatun has many startling secrets hidden under its dense bamboo tree cover . "

Archaeologists have discovered remains of underground sewers amid the ruins of Qin , Han , Sui and Tang dynasty cities both large and small . They were made from fired clay , not reinforced concrete as are modern sewers . But when such pipes in these cities were connected one after another , they formed rather comprehensive sewage systems .  
Analyzing the replies more closely , we discovered that the positive opinions were mainly centered on such aspects as Japan 's good infrastructure and its people 's unity , law-abiding nature and efficiency , while negative opinions were mainly to do with the Japanese being aggressive , cruel , treacherous and materialistic .  
Super slim , super fastThis year Lu Chen-fang , a lecturer at the Chang Geng College of Nursing , did a survey of more than 700 second-year nursing students at nine nursing colleges in northern Taiwan . The survey discovered that fully 87% of those of normal weight ( meaning within 10% of the standard weight for their height ) and of those who were slightly thin ( 10-20% below their standard weight ) thought themselves to be " too fat . "  
With many of Taiwan 's wild animals having become " disadvantaged groups " or having even been driven to the verge of extinction by pressure from human development , it became a matter of necessity to pass the Wildlife Conservation Law to protect endemic and rare species . But at the same time , previously unknown species of tree frogs , shrews , bats , spiders and many other animals which , though unfamiliar , enrich the list of Taiwan 's endemic species , have recently been " discovered " in the wild .  
Since the endemic Mikado pheasant was first recorded 80 years ago , no other new bird species has been discovered in Taiwan , and in recent years although mammals such as bats or shrews have been newly recorded here , the island 's forests have been logged up to elevations of 2500 meters , and today if mammals have remained undiscovered it is because of their hidden or inaccessible habitat or their nocturnal habit .  
Although many people remain skeptical about duplicating the characters of the ancient masters , thirtysomething artist Tu Chung-kao expresses the opinion that throughout history the number of literate people was exceedingly large , and to be able to make a lasting impression for all time is no mean feat . The great masters that are held up for imitation today discovered long ago the best way to achieve the most beautiful composition and shape for each character . Copying them is essential .  
Rather , starting with ancient Greece , I reread the Western philosophers . I worked hard at standing in their shoes . The process was very difficult , for I discovered that things which in the past I had been educated to accept as true and reasonable gradually became petty and untrustworthy .  
For instance , I used to get into earnest discussions with everyone about artistic methods and schools and about what was unique to Chinese art . But after I read the Western masters I discovered that they had thought about many of these issues hundreds or even thousands of years ago , and I found that those things which I deemed so special about Chinese art also exist in Western culture . And so in looking back , those past discussions seem pretty laughable .  
Since the 1980s , when US researchers confirmed that taxol ( derived from the Pacific yew , Taxus brevifolia , which belongs to the same genus as the Taiwan yew , Taxus mairei ) is effective in treating ovarian and breast cancers , clinical trials have been conducted or are planned to test the drug against more than 60 types of tumor . As more and more suitable applications are discovered , the demand for taxol is expected only to rise .  
A few years ago there was an incident which shook society . A Buddhist medical worker who could not bear to witness the suffering of the severely ill in their last stages and the hardships imposed on families for the long-term care of " human vegetables , " " played God " and let some of them die . He was discovered and prosecuted .  
In recent excavations of ancient tombs from the Spring and Autumn period , in the tomb of Lady Gouyu , younger sister of Lord Jing ( ruled 516-476 BC ) of the state of Song , a bronze basin was discovered which contained nothing but a large quantity of Sichuan peppercorns . This is surely the most direct proof one could ask for of the esteem in which our ancestors held spices .  
Grabbing the bird , I discovered that the webbing of her foot had been pierced by a hook caught in a rope used by the local aquaculturists . The swan 's blood was turning the water around her red . I quickly tried to pull out the fish hook with my hands , but the hook was too deeply caught in the flesh , and I ended up cutting my own index finger instead . All the while , the injured bird was splashing and struggling to fly away , drenching us with lake water .  
It was discovered that in maledominated jobs-the military and police , construction workers , machinists-men use various roundabout methods to " mark their territory . " Thus posters of naked women , impossible to avoid seeing , are put up in factories . Or construction workers will urinate openly right in front of passing women . It even happens that women scholars doing field research or female students supporting labor rights may find themselves in dangerous situations in such environments .  
" For example , I discovered the Focolare Movement , founded fifty years ago by an Italian woman , Chiara Lubich . Besides spreading Catholic doctrine and beliefs , she also emphasized experimental lifestyles . She organized associations or cooperative societies in which people lived a simple life in close communion with nature . Today they still have communities and farms in West Africa and in Latin America . "  
The discovery of oracle bone inscriptions rebuilt knowledge of a royal dynasty which some had suspected was imaginary , and the many neolithic sites discovered in mainland China over the past few decades have not only shown up even earlier traces of written language , but have also debunked the idea which we learned from childhood , that China 's central plain was the cradle of Chinese civilization .  
After a trip abroad , he discovered that Chinese Muslims had little understanding of their own religion 's doctrines , and were in dire need of an accurate Qur'an and other materials for interpreting it . He thus spent more than 20 years translating three Chinese texts altogether : one in classical Chinese , one in jingtangwen ( an old form with specific religious terms left in their original form , that is , not translated into a common equivalent ) , and one in the vernacular .  
Take for example coverage of a demonstration in January 1993 , held by two groups ( mostly those opposed to " Taiwanese consciousness " ) to " Support the Lee-Hau System ; Support Another Term as Premier for Hau Pei-tsun . " After comparing the headlines and contents of the various newspapers , Chang discovered that the Taiwanese-oriented Liberty Times emphasized negative themes such as " the situation was disorderly , " and " the demonstration won little public support . " In follow-up commentaries the paper was critical of the demonstrators .  
The water lily , which grows from the depths to above the surface of water , seems to bring a tremendous hidden vitality out of nowhere , hinting at the true source of creation .

They quickly discovered that while she looked elegant and refined , she was broad-minded , direct and easy to get along with . Though she could n't speak Hakka , she could chat away half the day with them using signs and gestures . Though an artist , she spent her days working in the fields . Running up and down the mountain , she was soon as tan and as strong as the local farming wives .  
Having studied at an agricultural high school , Li thought she was fully prepared to farm . But facing it firsthand , she quickly discovered that farm work was n't as easy or as laid back as she had imagined . And after becoming more closely involved with Chiungchiao Keng 's people , she gradually came to understand the town 's problems as well .  
After the PPI mapped out hunting grounds , it was discovered that these covered less than one-fifth of Wutai Rural Township . Also , because of forbidding topography or traditional taboos , some untouched areas were left between the hunting grounds . This fits right in with theories of effective management of natural resources .  
In 1947 , scientists at General Electric discovered quite by accident that their synchrotron accelerator was radiating a thin layer of light . This light comprised large amounts of infrared radiation , visible light , ultraviolet radiation and X-rays . Furthermore , it was 10,000 times brighter than the light created in traditional X-ray tubes . Virtually any substance or fine structure could be viewed very clearly under its radiation .  
Li Yih-yuan has discovered that the logic of the almanacs-to seek safety through knowing when to act and when not to-has , in modern commercial society , been transformed . It has been adapted to daily life , especially to the pragmatic pursuit of profit .  
On the contrary : birdwatchers have discovered that ever since accumulating soil from construction work upstream and an ever-decreasing flow of water caused sandbars to appear in the stretch of river near Huachiang Bridge , more and more ducks and geese have gathered there , and they have gradually extended their domain upriver to the Kuangfu , Huachung , Chungcheng and Yungfu bridges , so that the goose and duck park has had to be enlarged and its name changed .  
An ad hoc task force comprising both civilian and military investigators is now hard at work on the case , but has discovered signs that many documents have either been lost or falsified . Many worrisome questions remain unanswered : How many people are involved ? How high up does the case reach ?  
When someone has exhausted all avenues of appeal in the heavenly bureaucracy , the god which steps in fortuitously to save the day is one with an immortal facet to its character . These are the gods to which people turn for help . They make trouble for authority . Unlike the god Chenghuang , who must stay put at Chenghuang Temple , where his actions are held in check by a multi-tiered celestial bureaucracy , Lu Dongbin is often discovered wandering far away from the shrine in southeast Taipei that is devoted to his worship .  
He met the subject of the piece , Li Jung-lin , nine years previously when Li handled the funeral of his mother . But it was only two years ago , when Lin 's mother 's grave was robbed , and Li , wearing a gas mask , personally went into the grave to repair the damage to the coffin , that Lin really came to understand this man . He discovered that Li has quite remarkable views on death , human dignity , and on the poor self-regulation of the funeral industry .  
ICM researcher Chen Ta-chih first studied both folk prescriptions and those prescriptions found in ancient medical texts . He discovered that just as modern Western treatments call for injections into the penis or doses to be taken directly in the urinary canal , ancient Chinese medical texts included many similar external applications to treat impotency .  
" In researching Chinese medicine , both developing new medicines and respecting the ancient Chinese medical principles are essential , " argues Chen Chieh-pu . Synthesizing chemical components or extracting new drugs from natural herbal , mineral or animal substances has long been an important process in mainstream medicine . Quinine , which is used to treat malaria ; the cardiotonic rehmannin ; the painkiller morphine ; and antibiotics , which are widely used and have saved so many ; were all discovered in natural herbal medicines or fungi .  
" But I gradually discovered that I was not suited to heterosexual marriage . If I did n't take cognizance of my homosexual orientation , and continued in the marriage , it would not have been fair to my wife or family . I had to be honest with myself and my family , so my former wife and I agreed to a divorce . "  
Liu Tseng-kui , a research associate at the Academia Sinica 's Institute of History and Philology , created History Links ' basic structure out of his personal collection of website bookmarks , accumulated over years of combing overseas websites for historical data for his research . In the course of his research , Liu discovered that while there was no dearth of literary and historical websites in Taiwan , there were few online collections of links to such sites . He therefore assembled his own site last year , dividing his vast collection of bookmarks into categories .  
In one media report , a doctor was quoted as saying : " It has been discovered that if women who have been single for a long time have introverted personalities , and are self-absorbed , their emotional life often becomes very bizarre . As they repress their sexual desires , their hormone secretions fall out of balance , and they are susceptible to tumors in the reproductive system .  
Why could n't a gas station be set up on the island ? The provincial government discovered that the sticking point was obtaining the land . If suitable sites were n't on national government land , then they were owned by temples . But after the provincial government negotiated with the National Property Bureau and discussed the matter with local residents , the island was finally able to get its gas station .  
Council for Cultural Affairs vice chairman Wu Chung-li says that in the future , traditional theater will be incorporated into the overall project . In the future , will Taiwan produce a true celebrity of the theater ? And will young people become avid fans of theatrical stars ? Though these questions are impossible to answer , many students have already discovered the bountiful universe that is the theater .  
As women have rewritten their gender characteristics , some reassessment has been made of the male box . It has been discovered that this rigid box has not only crushed women and children under it , it has also deformed men-those allegedly advantaged by it . It has stifled their emotions , destroyed their health , reduced the happiness they get out of daily life , and made them lonely and violent .  
After years of research on " split-brain " epileptics ( epileptics whose corpus collosum-a neural structure linking the two sides of the brain-has been cut to limit seizures to one side of their brain ) , Sperry discovered that the left brain is responsible for language , logical thinking and analysis . The right brain , on the other hand , seems to be involved with images , imagination and intuition .  
As early as 1975 , brain specialists had discovered that the cerebral cortex , unique to primates , was responsible for intellectual activities such as language and reasoning . The limbic system lies below the cortex and pre-dates it . Sometimes called the " mammalian brain , " it is involved in the expression of emotions . On the lowest level lies the brain stem , sometimes called the reptilian brain .  
A year ago , when SET established its news department with a focus on what is termed " community news " ( meaning crime , sex and other sensational topics ) , it originally expected to lose about NT $ 5 million a month . Now , a year later , they have discovered that they have actually been making money , and they have decided to turn into an all-news station , adding staff in anticipation of the media wars that are sure to erupt during the presidential election campaigns .  
In the lore of Chinese medicine , Shen Nong is credited with having discovered countless medicines by trying out various herbs on himself , but even he would have to be amazed at the willingness of people in modern Taiwan to experiment on themselves . Many people think of cancer as a death sentence . If they are unlucky enough to be hit , they become desperate and will risk any kind of treatment , however unorthodox . In fact , this is not hard to understand .  
Over 50 bronze heads were discovered at Sanxingdui , and they feature a wide variety of headgear , including gold masks , fancy hairstyles , braided head bands , and curly hair that seems to surge forward like breakers at the beach .  
Now that the Sanxingdui exhibit has brought over a huge bronze statue of a man and many other exotic items , another blockbuster exhibit from the mainland has been scheduled for October . The autumn event will feature the superbly preserved silk paintings found at the Mawangdui site in Hunan Province as well as the stunning jade pieces discovered in Guangzhou at the royal tomb of the Nanyue kingdom . Going in the other direction , a private Taiwanese collection ( Ku Yue Ko ) was put on exhibit four years ago at the Palace Museum in Beijing .  
As " artistic supervisor of character design , " Chang set about crafting the overall style of Mulan , and he discovered an element from classical Chinese painting that proved useful in animation-the " gossamer sketching " method of delineating human figures . In particular , the curving lines that form the hands of Buddhist deities , giving the effect of floating clouds or flowing water , became the artistic basis for the film 's character design .  
Then I came back to work to apply what I 've learned , " explains Hsing . She originally studied land management , but discovered that Taiwan lacks any comprehensive land management policy , leading to rampant overdevelopment and speculation . She decided to go study urban planning . " And then I discovered that urban planning is closely related to environmental management and public policy , so I went from program to program . "  
There are also a number of architectural elements in the exhibit , including banisters , column capitals , tiles , and flagstones from the king 's palace . These items have all just been excavated in the past five years , and are highly significant finds as they come from the oldest royal palace ever discovered in China . The exhibit also reproduces a beautiful stream paved with small , closely packed dark-gray pebbles interspersed with larger yellowish pebbles .  
It was here that Yen Tsang-po , who has long been a leading light among Taiwanese geologists , discovered sedimentary rock dating back 200 million years , the oldest ever found in Taiwan . An analysis of what he found tells us the basic story of Taiwan 's formation . For untold eons , what is now Taiwan lay upon the ocean floor collecting sediment that had been washed out to sea from the Asian mainland .  
We discovered that China in the Year 1 was in the Han dynasty , which established the foundations of Chinese systems in many areas . It was an era also of dynastic struggles , filled with heroes and striking personalities . At the Year 1000 , the Song dynasty had reunified China . Its weakness forced it into a form of " economic diplomacy " to fend off the peoples of the north , yet at the same time this demilitarization of external relations led to splendorous achievements in culture and wealth for society as a whole .  
He explains : " From both the psychiatric literature and clinical experience , doctors discovered that there 's a peculiar phenomenon with people suffering psychological disorders . Once they 're in hospital , the disorders can be controlled quite well , but when they return home , not long thereafter the symptoms re-emerge . " Doctors thus became curious about the family backgrounds of their patients , and social workers were sent to investigate . The result has been the discovery of many dysfunctional families .  
He finally left Taiwan in 1947 . When I went to Japan last January and paid my respects at his grave , I discovered that his gravestone was inscribed in Atayal . I used to cry every time I talked about this wonderful doctor , but I 'm getting a little less emotional about it as time goes by . I have to hurry up and get the book written . "  
The Republic of Palau , situated on an archipelago in the Micronesia region of the South Pacific , occupies a strategic position both for international transport and in military terms . It has a total area of 488 square kilometers and a population of something over 18,000 . After being " discovered " by the Portuguese in 1783 , Palau was subsequently ruled by Spain and Germany . After WWI it was made a Japanese protectorate , and after WWII was governed by the US under a UN trusteeship .  
At a time when multi-track admissions have yet to meet with widespread support among parents and teachers , an unfortunate incident occurred at the end of February .

She was quite surprised to find that business was so good on a weekday .  
The devastating 21 September earthquake of 1999 left Taiwan 's landscape covered in scars , but researchers discovered that the places least damaged by the quake were areas of natural forest . In mountain regions where the rainfall is most abundant , the geology most fragile and erosive forces most powerful , the false cypresses , with their massive trunks and mighty root systems , cling tightly to the frail earth .  
When the regulations were announced , 90% of major international producers , including NEC and Fujitsu , discovered that their previous efforts in the field had been wasted . Startek , however , had correctly guessed that recognition standards would be based on key points for each print . Startek is now one of only three firms anywhere in the world that can provide the proper fingerprint recognition software , and its products are technically the most advanced .  
In the year 2000 , Liang Chieh-teh , a maker of documentary films , shot a nature film about terns on Matsu , and he accidentally discovered some Chinese crested terns there . The species had only been sighted five times before , and many assumed it was extinct or described it as a " legendary bird . "  
Two decades later , the Japanese botanist Fukuyama Noriaki also collected pleiones from Mt . Hsiakalo in Hsinchu . This time the flowers were a pure , snowy white , and the onion-like bulbs were a glistening green color , unlike the previously discovered purple bulbs . Overjoyed at his discovery , Fukuyama named this new variety the snow-white pleione ( Pleione formosana var . nivea ) .  
Besides medical work , another major contribution of Maxwell 's missionary work was the translation of a vernacular Bible .

When a Japanese technician discovered groves of towering ancient trees on Mt . Ali at the end of the 19th century , the Japanese colonial administration hired a forester to survey the mountain 's timber . He found excellent stands of timber-red cypress , yellow cypress and Taiwan yew trees that were upwards of a thousand years old and that required as many as ten men to encircle . To get these giant trees to market , the Japanese began to construct the Alishan Mountain Railway in 1906 .  
After the gold veins of the took shape , they were raised upward as the land surface rose .

Over the last 20 years scientists have discovered that materials behave differently at nanometric levels than they do in amounts visible to the naked eye . Just as the fundamental properties of a substance will change in a vacuum or at low temperatures , substances at nanometric sizes will undergo various physical and chemical changes . By singling out certain characteristics-such as strength or ductility-you can then go on to create countless products with new functions . Take , for instance , gold .  
When Yang made his first trip to mainland China in 1989 , he never expected that CHM would become the professional preoccupation of the rest of his life . Traveling only to see the scenery , he incidentally discovered that major pharmaceuticals manufacturers from around the world had set up shop in the PRC , hoping to find buried treasure . That 's when he decided to go into the business of gathering , inspecting , and trading raw materials for CHM , and even cultivating basic sources of botanical pharmaceuticals .  
Yang once decided to grind pearl down to nano levels , and discovered that he had destroyed the amino acid , releasing a foul odor and ruining the raw material .  
" Parents should set their kids free , and not just so as to lighten the burdens on their kids , " Lu says .

Since AIDS was discovered in 1981 , shattering the illusion that mankind had won the battle against infectious diseases , they have posed an ever growing danger . Modern medicine has proven ill-equipped to cope with infectious diseases caused by new viruses as well as old diseases that have staged a comeback . The SARS virus is the latest attack by microorganisms .  
Two years later , with the help of geologist Lin Chao-chi and a mineral exploration company , Pan Ke-yung went to Tingku Village in Pali to take a look . Lin Chao-chi discovered numerous fragments of iron ore slag , remnants of primitive iron smelting . Because there was no record of metal making in that area by either Han Chinese or Japanese , Lin concluded that this was probably a prehistoric iron smelting site .  
Indeed , in recent years , with the government promoting the reuse of neglected spaces ( much as it promoted " holistic community building " a few years earlier ) , the seeds of creativity and idealism have been planted in cities , towns and rural hamlets . Idle and abandoned century-old buildings , whether publicly or privately owned , have sprung to life again . Meanwhile , a connection has been discovered between preserving memories of the past and promoting the arts .  
In 1994 , led by teachers Lu Hung-wen and Huang Kuei-kuan , a group of students from the Peitou Elementary School investigated the natural resources of their local area . They sought out documented information on the " Peitou Hot Springs Public Baths , " which have close ties with the development of Peitou itself . From this information , they discovered that the long-forgotten , overgrown , and run-down " haunted house " was in fact the site of that very same pool complex , Southeast Asia 's largest and most luxurious public pool in its day .  
For Wang Steak , which has annual revenues in Taiwan in excess of NT $ 1 billion and long ago extended its operations to the US , entry into the PRC was obviously rather late . Park Cheng explains : " We did a survey of white-collar workers several years ago and discovered that although Shanghai once did have areas controlled by Britain and France , nobody in Shanghai chose ' Western food ' as their preferred option for dinner out . "  
Society should not only encourage young people to have more diversified dreams , it should let them see behind truly successful people-and especially those who have devoted genuine effort to their dreams and stuck to their guns , or those who have had the courage to change their ways when they discovered that they had mistaken the illusory for the real .  
But in fifth grade , his teacher discovered that this " problem student " could draw powerful and intriguing pictures . The teacher signed Lee up for a province-wide primary-school drawing competition in which , incredibly , he won a prize . This prize seemed to set free the previously locked-up spirit of this small Aboriginal child .  
One year , Kung planted his plots with a kind of mini-gourd , and the entire crop was hit by a mutation , causing the gourds to be more pear-shaped instead of their usual hourglass-like shape . He took this mutant variety in to a seed company , who discovered after some trials that that variety of mini-gourd was particularly susceptible to mutation in cold temperatures-Kung had planted them during winter . The seed company planted another row during summer , which produced gourds of the normal shape .  
Chen Yuan-tsung , director of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences , Academia Sinica , says that what makes neonatal screening different from embryonic screening is that it aims to detect rare metabolic disorders that can be treated or prevented if they are discovered at an early stage . Infants are therefore given the chance to grow up healthy , or to suffer from fewer sequelae .  
Genetic screening after the embryonic stage and infancy is very controversial , because groundbreaking treatments still remain to be discovered for a large number of hereditary diseases . Even when screening tests indicate the presence of a disorder before any symptoms appear , no radical cures are available . This can cause considerable unnecessary distress .  
In its Mental Health Index Survey , completed late last year , the Mental Health Foundation discovered that approximately one half of the 1,000 individuals surveyed admitted that a slight increase in stress causes them to blow up . Even more shocking is the fact that 19 participants gave themselves " zero " when asked to quantify their mental health . Clear warning signals are flashing for the mental health of Taiwanese .  
In addition , based on the latest research , it has been discovered that the chaotic state when the universe and heavenly bodies came into existence , the most primordial molecular compound is lithium hydride . This finding also has practical uses , as it provides concepts and clues for continuing investigation .  
With this , the owner finally relented and parted with his beloved gramophone . In 1998 , while in India , Lin discovered a 1921 British-made large-horned two-track stereophonic gramophone . This machine utilized one phonographic needle to feed two separate acoustic pickups featuring diaphragms of different thickness to produce high and low notes . This was one of the earliest two-track stereo systems .  
Most recently , the competent Iraqi authorities concerned made a careful examination of the Kuwaiti list contained in document S / 1995 / 39 and informed the Secretariat that the necessary steps would be taken to return any property discovered as a result of the previous investigation ( Iraqi letter dated 27 February 1995 , circulated as a Security Council document ) .  
adds a dramatic picture of new , appalling violations of humanitarian law that have taken place more recently in the Banja Luka region : a large-scale resumption of ethnic cleansing ; new cases of persons unaccounted for ; and chilling evidence , discovered in Sanski Most , of mass executions .  
The Special Rapporteur informed the Commission that he had received allegations concerning secret trials , allegedly held before the Special Military Court in Lagos , of a group of more than 30 military officials and civilians accused of being involved in an attempted coup d ' \ x { 5f4b } at which was discovered in March 1995 .  
This rising trend , which had developed in such a short period , is indicative of the size of the resources discovered , which in addition are considered to be of very high quality .  
To contribute to the search for a common denominator based on the peace agreements that would win the support of broad sectors of the population , MINUGUA , at the request of the parties , held an extensive round of consultations through which it discovered that there was some readiness on the part of sectors of society to work together on specific issues .  
The shuttle had mapped 90 per cent of the earths surface with unprecedented precision , and astronauts on board had discovered and confirmed ancient impact craters on earth , tracked deforestation , monitored coral reefs , studied air and water pollution and documented the effects of drought , floods , volcanoes and hurricanes .
