This is an important cause of tension in the Taiwan situation .

We advocate : The five principles - - the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty , non-aggression , non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence - - and other established principles regarding international relations constitute the political base for safeguarding peace and security .

On this globe we live , if rich countries become richer and poor countries become poorer , if one side continues to accumulate wealth and the poverty of the other side aggravates , if some big powers interfere in internal affairs of other countries everywhere and practice hegemony and power politics by relying on their powerful economy , science and technology and military strength , and if many developing countries can not take part in international affairs on an equal footing and receive unfair treatment or even groundless humiliation , the world will not have peace and development .

Among repertoires of representative works , these include excerpts with the most remarkable masterly skills to give interpretations of the characters ' internal as well as emotional states at their height .  The excerpts that contain the masterly skills do not reflect all that Chinese operatic art has to offer .  But they represent the perfect moment of concentration when all attention is on one masterly stroke in the entire performance .  
The GN sets out the minimum standard of corporate governance that is expected of an authorized insurer .

As regards the findings of the internal review , the Steering Committee concluded that the number , ranking and remuneration packages of senior executives in 13 selected subvented bodies were in order ; three organizations would be subject to separate review in 2003 ; and actions should be taken to modify remuneration packages and practices of senior executives in the remaining four organizations .  
In respect of the constitutional developments after 2007 , a subject which is close to the heart of many people , I have also outlined a timeframe even though we have not yet set a detailed timetable .  We are pursuing in 2003 internal research .  We hope that in 2006 we would be in a position to take forward local legislation .  So the likelihood is that in 2004 or 2005 , we will be conducting public consultation .  
" Our aims for moving forward E-government are similar to the areas identified by Accenture , including improving the quality of online services by making them more customer-friendly ; exploiting E-government opportunities to streamline departmental internal processes ; and improving the usage of our online services .  
Accordingly , we started an internal review in 2001 and , in the light of operating experience , international e-business development and technological advancement , drew up a set of preliminary proposals for public consultation in early 2002 .  
Facing the double threat , Chiang Kai-shek formulated a farsighted policy of " maintaining internal security first and then expelling foreign invasion . " In 1934 the Communists were finally driven out of Kiangsi province . They fled to the bleak northern section of Shensi , with only 2,000 to 3,000 followers remaining . People of seven provinces were thus freed from Communist harassment .  
The " target " is sometimes treated with an anesthetic to reduce the pain of cuts and wounds . Combining internal kungfu and an eagle 's -claw hand with a knowledge of the nervous and circulatory systems can lead to the fearsome technique of " striking the vital points , " featured in many a book and movie .  
Changes in internal secretions within the mother 's body during pregnancy are the cause , making it rather easy to develop swelling of the gums . Expectant mothers often have a poor appetite and abnormal eating habits . If they neglect oral hygiene , they may easily develop cavities and inflamed gums . Pain relievers are rarely prescribed to relieve the pain to protect the health of the unborn infant , and consequently the expectant mother has to endure the pain .  
Under the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion , sections one through four of article twelve , permission will not be granted to those who : A . participate in the communist party or other rebellious organization or their activities ; B . participate in violent or terrorist organizations or their activities ; C . are suspected of involvement in important activities of internal disruption or external attacks ; D . outside the Taiwan area have been involved in serious crimes or who are habitual criminals .  
Its stumbling reform measures have given rise to such adverse side effects as graft , corruption , and soaring prices at the same time as they whetted the ardent hopes of the people for complete reform , resulting in the mass movements in Tienanmen Square . - - The bloody suppression in Tienanmen Square not only exposed the true nature of the Communists ' tyrannous regime , it also pointed up the internal contradictions among the political ruling class .  
Firstly , the Yin &amp; Yang principles described in the I-ching ( Classic of Changes ) can indicate many polarities such as the sun &amp; moon , day &amp; night , light &amp; dark , motion &amp; rest , internal &amp; external , cold &amp; heat , hard &amp; soft , and male &amp; female .  
Data indicates that if the mainland authorities launch an attack on Taiwan regardless of internal democratic opposition and the cost in casualties - - one third to one quarter of their combined forces manpower - - then they have three possible options for military action : The first is attacking the islands one by one , starting with Kinmen , Matsu and the Pescadores , at the same time using their air and sea dominance , and missiles , to strike military , political and economic targets on Taiwan itself .  
You can see new opportunities in a few phenomena of the early 1990s : The unreasonable explosion in real estate prices has left many empty offices with no one to rent them , as many investors have moved elsewhere because land prices are too expensive , so that recently there has been a softening in real estate . Also , Chinatown has internal forces for its own development : A league opposed to high land prices , with various clan and hometown friendship associations at the core , has appeared , hoping to force rents back down .  
People who have disabilities within the following categories : impaired vision ; impaired hearing or balance ; speech or linguistic impediments ; bodily disabilities ; learning disabilities ; multiple disabilities ; malfunction of important internal organs ; facial deformities and wounds ; coma or senile dementia ; autism ; others ( as defined by the central authorities ) .  
Five years later the low wall around the city had been completed , and artillery placements were added to all four gates ( north , south , east , and west ) to ward off attacks from indigenous peoples or foreign military units . The internal and external walls were each twenty feet thick , and there was a moat around the outside . Such was China 's southernmost county seat .  
Over the last 80 years , the entire internal and external layout of this Japanese-occupation building has remained unchanged . Seeing the sunlight streaming in from the courtyard , casting the pattern of the long rows of windows into its quiet and lonely red-carpeted corridors , one feels a trance-like sense of historical space and time welling up irresistibly inside one .  
It is not hard to discover that most people with a hunched posture have oversensitive nerves . If they eat foods with mixed sweet and savory flavors , this will irritate the internal organs , throwing their function into disorder . In this situation the foods eaten can not be properly digested and absorbed , and the person 's body type will develop towards one with a protruding lower or upper abdomen . (  
Under the assimilation policy , the Japanese issued the Taiwan education law , eliminated differential education , implemented the common study system , recognized improperly documented marriages , set basic principles for internal governance , and more .  
The Lausanne competitiveness assessment is divided into eight evaluations , covering 225 separate items .

By the late Qing dynasty ( 1616-1911 ) , when Western influence spread through the Orient , the pressure from internal strife and external aggression reduced folk music to the percussion troupes which played at weddings , funerals and other such occasions . It was actually the Buddhist and Taoist monks of a few large temples who preserved the tradition of larger scale performances , such as the drum music of Chenghuang Temple in Xi'an , or the wind and percussion playing of the monks of southern Jiangsu .  
Director of the Chunghwa Telecom union Chang Hsu-chung said : " We have become too used to being the dominant player in the market . The result of slack internal management , laziness and shirking in state-owned enterprises is that employees have become like a frog in warm water waiting to be slowly boiled . Because we are too used to a cosy , comfortable life we have lost our vitality . "  
The reason for the change in their itinerary was that , like every other previous foreign excursion by top-ranking officials of the ROC , Vice President Lien 's trip was met the entire way with pressure from Beijing . Firstly , after the senior officials of the ROC and Iceland met , PRC foreign affairs spokesman Shen Guofang issued a strongly worded criticism . He asserted that Prime Minister Oddson was interfering in " the internal affairs of China " and damaging relations between the PRC and Iceland , and that Iceland would be responsible for the consequences .  
It is true that after the financial crisis struck there was no massive fall in the value of the Yen , but the combination of external pressures and internal difficulties-in the form of an overall default rate on bank lending of 14% , the collapse of several financial institutions , and the economic sluggishness which has dogged Japan for the last seven years-has been enough to leave the Japanese government bruised and battered .  
He avers that married couples have been through a long process of falling in love , marriage , and living together , which provides a foundation of emotional attachment and understanding . When divorce becomes inevitable , the two people have already been through repeated internal struggles .  
Government officials also paid considerable attention to the debate . Premier Vincent Siew said that it looks as if the DPP 's policy orientation toward the PRC is not much different from the government 's current policy in focusing on substantive issues , exchanges , and equal negotiations . If the DPP can achieve an internal consensus , and if the various political parties can achieve consensus among themselves , in future negotiations with the PRC , Taiwan can present a unified position .  
Disaster struck again in October at the 10,000-man tug-of-war organized by the Taipei City Government when the rope broke , causing two people to lose arms and others to suffer internal injuries .

Daoism retained the ancient belief in immortality , and developed various theories on how to create elixirs both external and internal . Daoists believed that through physical and mental exercises , or by ingesting elixirs hidden in sacred mountains , a person might transcend his corporeal form and become an immortal , to frolic in the heavenly paradise with the kings and emperors of yore and the gods of nature such as the wind , rain , thunder and lightning .  
When she came to Taipei three years ago , she did not choose a foreign firm , in which internal communication is normally done in English . Rather , she entered a local urban planning firm , in which only Chinese was spoken , and learned her Chinese the hard way .  
Hu Tsu-ching , an associate professor of political science at Soochow University , warns that there are several problems that must be addressed : The Kosovo government-in-exile is mired in internal strife , and it must be decided which " Kosovo " to assist . Ways must be found to ensure that the aid provides practical help to the refugees , and is not diverted into private pockets . With regard to the proposed training program in Taiwan , there are problems of language , health clearance , and so on .  
Ever since 1991 when the ROC amended its constitution , it has defined cross-strait relations as state-to-state relations or at least a special state-to-state relationship , rather than an internal relationship between a legitimate government and a renegade group , or between a central government and a local government .  
3 . Regulations on a national financial stabilization fund : This law will empower the government to intervene to protect the stock market . In the event of " threats to national stability " - such as major internal or external events , rapid movements of international capital-the government will be able to draw on an NT $ 500 billion fund .  
With modern science taking steps toward the spiritual world , " Taiwan is naturally best situated to take a world-leading role in this work . " Lee Si-chen points out that both Taoism and Buddhism have unique views about the operations of the universe . Furthermore , the Chinese in Taiwan have inherited from their ancestors both the active practice of qigong ( the movement of internal energy ) and the reflective practice of meditation . Research into these has been extensive , to a degree unimaginable in the West .  
In the Ming dynasty , qigong was incorporated into the study of martial arts and the cultivation of " internal " strength became a prerequisite to the study of the jian . With sufficient internal strength , anyone could be a Zhang Wuji . Gradual realization becomes sudden realization . Going further , what was tangible becomes intangible .  
The PRC is reported to be the main cause of the diplomatic rupture . Macedonia has been beset in recent years by both internal and external threats .

Late 1996 saw the launching of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ( SOHO ) satellite , which was built in a collaborative project between the European Space Agency and NASA . SOHO 's missions include studying the sun 's internal structure and outer atmosphere , and the solar wind . But satellite observations are immensely costly , and satellites have a limited service life and a high risk of failure .  
Before the advent of acoustic imaging , the degree of understanding of the sun 's internal structure that could be gained from its surface oscillations was very limited . For instance , scientists were already aware that the cycle of sunspot activity is related to the way the north and south magnetic poles of the sun are reversed every 11 years . But where was the sun 's magnetic field located ?  
While a comprehensive energy policy is one approach , there are also others . " In the future , " explains Lu Jhy-ming , " the COP will move in the direction of environmental regulations to stimulate business to be more willing to reduce emissions , and products that require higher levels of greenhouse gases to make will be increasingly discriminated against in trade . " Companies which are fast on their feet have already jumped ahead and set internal reduction targets .  
From my personal perspective as someone involved in many different fields , and also from the East Asian perspective , this is a good thing . Classical Western art is very structured , and over the centuries has built up a formidable degree of internal consistency . But it is this very internal consistency that turns Western art into a closed system . When art evolves to a certain point , it becomes what is known in Buddhism as " worldly wisdom , " which means to regard " the seeming " as real .  
I think if we had invited artists from outside the field of visual arts to come and critique " An Award for Taipei Biennale , " they could have provided some very trenchant insights , because the impact of modern art on classical art has been a matter of the external challenging the internal . External concepts pounded away at an internally closed system .  
" In the last few years , the government has come out with a number of preferential tax policies , with bizarre results , " says Steve Tsui . " Even in years when the rate of economic growth has been decent , tax revenues have continued to fall . " Under these circumstances , economic growth alone can not rescue government finances . The tricky part is going to be dealing with the internal structural factors built into the tax system .  
The causes of suicide are complex , have physiological , psychological , social , and cultural implications , and are the result of multiple internal and external factors .  
Both Mori and another Japanese expert who spent much time deep in Taiwan 's mountain regions , naturalist Kana Tadao , concluded , " Generally speaking the tribespeople have a powerful sense of blood ties , with this feeling being strongest among the Bunun . " For example , whereas the Atayal , high mountain dwellers like the Bunun , had internal divisions and even wars among themselves , the Bunun were very loyal to the group , maintaining unity against outsiders .  
ding stressed that in the current situation today , no matter what changes on the japanese political scene , the cpc will positively develop its friendly exchanges and cooperation with the sdpj on the basis of the principles of independence , total equality , mutual respect and non interference in each other 's internal affairs

Mr . MARTENS ( Federal Republic of Germany ) said that the need for detailed rules of humanitarian law , unnecessary in an ideal world , had been clearly demonstrated by the recent escalation of internal and international armed conflicts .  
The proposed initiative was designed to offer ways for the reasonable expression of plausible aspirations of that nature through free options ranging from limited and basic selfadministration to virtual internal selfgovernment .  
As all who had emerged from long periods of colonial rule were well aware , factors both internal and external could reduce independence to a mere legal formality unless it had solid economic foundations .  
In addition to the external disputes of international organizations , relatively important internal disputes could also arise which did not lend themselves to settlement by reference to the model established by national constitutional or administrative norms .  
The internal difficulties experienced by Yemen during the course of the year had been exploited by external forces with the objective of impeding the development of a free , democratic and prosperous society in Yemen .  
The first involved more efficient prevention , especially to address the problems of victims of internal conflicts , actual or potential victims of the situation in States that have recently emerged from authoritarian rule , and citizens of developing countries in flight from inhuman poverty or socio-economic instability .  
New democracies virtually everywhere are confronting the common challenge of ensuring the peaceful processes of political transformation , the establishment and consolidation of internal democratic institutions and norms , and structural readjustment accompanied by socially oriented economic transformations backed up by a system of measures and guarantees for social justice in society .  
In addition , temporary expedients such as putting " cold " surgery on waiting lists , making real reductions in services in some fields , such as paying for surgery and not internal medicine , and reducing the level of reimbursement of patients ' hospital bills and " capping " the total amounts have all been applied .  
We have come to realize the growing importance of effective regional tools in addressing this new type of mostly internal conflicts , where the rule of law and accountable national administrations are often non-existent , where warlords and other unscrupulous leaders lead campaigns of intimidation , ethnic cleansing and genocide in an atmosphere of nationalism and hatred .  
With renewed waves of human rights violations occurring worldwide , mostly in internal conflicts or ethnic strife , our Organization has to step up its early-warning and preventive capacities , develop an integrated response mechanism encompassing field visits and monitors , a closer integration of the human rights element in peace-keeping activities and ensuring effective interaction in the implementation of political , peace-keeping , human rights and humanitarian mandates .  
However , throughout the entire history of the Asian continent , instability and protracted regional conflicts have often , unfortunately , constituted the political background , and this has significantly complicated the solution of problems of internal development .  
In practice , however , the basic and universal principles of sovereignty and sovereign equality continue to be ignored or violated by reason of the unequal and undemocratic set-up of international relations and through impositions upon , and interference in , the internal affairs of other countries , for different reasons and with a variety of justifications .  
Peace can only be maintained by observing such norms governing international relations as respect for State sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence , and by establishing , in accordance with the United Nations Charter , a new international political and economic order that is just and fair .  
International conflicts have been replaced by internal ones , characterized by political , economic , ethnic and religious tensions that often imply grave humanitarian crises and human rights violations .  
As we see it , the value of democratization is primarily that , having become an integral part of the internal political processes , it provides a basis for reconciliation , tolerance , full application of , respect for and defence of human rights , and the development of social practices based on the peaceful search for constructive solutions .  
The increase in the number of Member States to 185 ; the end of the cold war and the concomitant , regrettable radicalization of nationalism and group identity , which cause internal and inter-State conflicts ; and the perverse effects of the economic and financial crisis on the democratization of institutions and on human rights all these events and challenges highlight the urgent need to carry out a reform of the United Nations in general and of the Security Council in particular . 
We do recognize also that there are some legitimate considerations that have to be addressed in the negotiating process , including internal territorial delineations and means to rebuild the confidence of the population in the political processes and mechanisms that are designed to secure respect for human rights .  
A painful and futile internal conflict , brought on by intransigence and ideological utopianism , added to the waste of public resources and Governments overwhelmed by the nation 's problems , led Peru into a deep internal crisis with grave international consequences . 
All of us here are aware that threats to international peace and security arise from the deterioration of the social , economic and institutional fabric of States , and that their worst effects , such as internal armed conflicts , drug trafficking , corruption and the inevitable sequel of those ills , poverty , are the seed-bed in which international conflicts tend to germinate . 
It should be remembered that this progress has been made in an internal and external economic context that has been generally unfavourable , because of the continuing constraints that are impeding any process of stable and sustained development .  
In addition and still within the context of prevention countries whose institutions and infrastructures have been destroyed by a long period of internal war today need more assistance from the international community to help them rebuild their economies and improve the living conditions of their peoples , for without sustained economic and social development , internal tensions will continue to germinate and threaten to erupt into bloody conflict .  
The Turkish Grand National Assembly has been closing its eyes to the numerous examples of flagrant violation of human rights in Turkey itself , particularly to the internal war of the Turkish Army against the Kurds , who are denied fundamental national and political rights .  
At the same time , on the domestic front , Turkey is not prepared even to discuss a multi-ethnic and multicultural concept , hence flagrantly and on a large-scale basis violating the human , national and political rights of the Kurds , waging a real internal war against them .  
The causes are many : the earlier supply of weapons to client States by the parties to the cold war , internal conflicts , competition for commercial markets , criminal activity and the collapse of governmental law and order functions ( which both gives free rein to the criminals and creates a legitimate reason for ordinary citizens to acquire weapons for their own defence ) .

Mrs . BEZLEPKINA ( Russian Federation ) said that during the period of reorientation resulting from Russia 's adoption of democratic values and ideals the country 's internal resources were strained and its people were struggling with a falling standard of living .

Even though reliable statistics on the exact numbers of disabled persons in the region have yet to be compiled , indications are that in recent years cases of disability have increased dramatically in a number of African countries as a result of natural disasters , protracted internal armed conflict , famine and malnutrition , and the resurgence of once-controlled diseases such as tuberculosis .  
I have the honour , concerning the letter dated 3 April 1995 from Mr . H.E . Christos Zacharakis , Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations addressed to you ( S / 1995 / 257 ) , and in reference to Security Council resolution 817 ( 1993 ) , to remind you that the name of any Member State is an exclusive right and an internal affair of the State , which right has been respected and established in international legal norms and in the basic principles of the United Nations .  
FAO provides for international travel , essential internal travel , medical and insurance coverage and a supplement to the living expenses of the expert directly paid to him or her , while the host country provides for boarding , lodging and laundry and the releasing country pays the salary of the expert .  
For a regime that has initiated and coordinated the war and ethnic cleansing against our Republic ( I call your attention here to the New York Times article of 13 April 1995 , citing internal documents of the Serbian secret police as evidence of Belgrade 's promotion of acts that constitute violations of humanitarian law and of the Genocide Convention , and which constitute aggression ) , formal recognition is the minimal step to be expected .  
Subparagraph ( c ) was viewed as calling for further clarification : it was suggested that an exhaustive list of offences should be provided , to dispel the confusion created by the terms " serious violations " and " grave breaches " of the Geneva Conventions and to indicate whether the provision covered not only international but also internal armed conflicts taking into account the statute for the Rwanda Tribunal and the current reality of armed conflicts .

This was the case for countries that had fixed exchange rates and whose economies were characterized by inordinate inflation and for still others that experienced volatile movements of exchange rates , which often changed much more than internal prices over time , as a result of capital flight and speculation as well as other effects of international capital markets .  
Countries may experience disruption of their governmental systems from at least three major sources : massive natural disasters , such as earthquakes , cyclones , or volcanic eruptions ; internal civil strife ; or external conflict / war with neighbouring States .  
In addition to selecting schools to be upgraded or built , the issue of equity between regions and genders should be assessed , with studies on selected policy matters , such as reducing imbalances for disadvantaged groups and increasing internal efficiency , in order to enable policy makers to make decisions based on in-depth analyses of local conditions and on comparative analysis of countries facing similar problems .  
In addition , it could serve as a mechanism for political dialogue among the participating States in order to define common principles and interests with respect to both their internal stability ( State subject to the rule of law , human rights ) and external stability ( fundamental principles of good-neighbourliness among States , including general security questions ) .

My delegation is confident that a termination of the brutal hostilities and human carnage that Rwanda has endured for a good part of this century can most effectively be pursued through political means that emphasize peaceful solutions while being cognizant of the regional dimensions of the issues that confront Rwanda and impact its internal and external security .  
The threat posed to the internal security and stability of sovereign States , as well as to international security , by the dramatic increase of organized transnational crime in the past decade is growing and will continue to grow and become more menacing if concerted and decisive action on the part of the international community is delayed .  
The imposition of coercive economic measures ignores such principles as the sovereign equality of States , non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States , and violates international legal instruments with the intent of forcibly imposing the political will of the sending State and subverting the political , economic and social regime of the target State .  
Where it is itself directly concerned , the Russian Federation is firmly guided by the principles of the sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and the freedom of international trade and navigation as mentioned in resolution 49 / 9 , and continues to support normal trade and economic relations with Cuba based on common interest and mutual benefit .  
We always believe that however complicated a dispute between States or an internal conflict in a country may be , we should encourage the parties concerned to seek peaceful solutions through negotiation and dialogue , for this is the only right and effective way to a comprehensive and durable settlement .  The practices of imposing sanctions , using military force or even expanding a war in order to stop it are not conducive to a settlement .  
Beyond the ensuing moderate improvement in its staffing situation , OIOS understood this decision as a significant and encouraging endorsement of its efforts to make internal oversight an effective , credible and independent component of the management structure of the United Nations . 
However , the coexistence of different groups is not always peaceful , and problems relating to minorities are today one of the major sources of international and internal conflicts involving widespread and at times massive human rights violations with severe repercussions for the peace and stability of the community of nations .  
The formal financial system in Africa has faced a number of internal and external constraints , including inadequate technical and managerial capacity , antiquated legal and regulatory frameworks , inappropriate macroeconomic policies and pronounced government intervention , that not only hampered its growth but actually caused significant disintermediation in a number of countries .

The idea of minimum humanitarian standards , formally born in Turku , Finland , presented , in his opinion , an attempt to integrate existing human rights and humanitarian norms into one set of principles relevant to situations of internal violence .  
Those mechanisms will have to be established in a broad and realistic manner , with the help of international cooperation , and will have to cover not only financial compensation but also measures to support and assist those families and communities which suffered the worst consequences of the internal armed conflict .  
The Mission hopes that the Guatemalan armed forces , in the context of their considerable efforts to put an end to the internal armed conflict and to accept the institutional changes set forth in the Peace Agreements , will noticeably increase their cooperation in clarifying and punishing crimes and human rights violations in which some of their members may be implicated .  
Despite the insecurity and precarious balance of terror that have marked three years of civil war in Burundi , it still has an organized Government that is capable of acting , unlike other countries torn apart by internal conflicts .  
The characteristics of those criminal groups , which closely resemble those of groups operating in other countries , their hierarchical structure , internal code of conduct , resources available and ability to penetrate the market , make local organized crime a highly dangerous feature for the newly established social and economic setting of Belarus .  
It is paradoxical that UNEP , an organization that has over the last 20 years played a major role in the development of systems designed to monitor the global environment , has no discernible internal system for monitoring the substantive progress of and results produced by its projects or programmes .  
The Committee is also concerned at the lack of an integrated strategy on children as well as of a fully effective monitoring mechanism for all areas covered by the Convention and in relation to all groups of children in urban and rural areas , especially those affected by the consequences of the economic problems and by the internal conflict .  
Although more countries are adopting the programme approach , constraints identified in the UNDP 1996 internal assessment included : ( a ) a lack of clarity and training in the subject ; ( b ) the complexity of the instrument , including procedures for financial management ; ( c ) a lack of guidance on how Governments should evaluate their own programmes and conduct capacity assessments in the public sector and civil society ; ( d ) the need to harmonize procedures of donors at country level .  
Accordingly , and as long as the faction leaders , the militias and other irregular armed forces continue their conflict in Somalia and until a peaceful settlement is reached , international humanitarian law related to internal armed conflict applies in the whole territory of Somalia irrespective of whether the specific area is engulfed in active fighting .  
After 15 days of torture and ill treatment , he was found lying near the border fence , unable to walk because he had been tortured with corrosive chemicals which had burned his lower limbs , inflamed internal tissue and damaged the bones .  
50 The expert encouraged the working group , in drafting the optional protocol , to take a realistic approach in relation to non-governmental armed groups , in the light of the fact that the vast majority of contemporary armed conflicts were internal . 
Noting also that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
It had therefore recommended that more economical and efficient methods should be found to carry out the mandate of UNPA ; that , in order to ensure that the strategic decisions of senior management were based on accurate information , the full cost of operating UNPA should be disclosed , including the cost of services which were currently provided by the United Nations to UNPA for free ; and that the internal control systems of UNPA should be strengthened .  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
Serve as a mobilizer of ideas and a catalyst for action to identify and promote new policy options at the national , subregional and regional levels for the removal of constraints on the economic and social development efforts of these countries , with emphasis on the adoption of measures for increased mobilization of domestic and foreign resources , trade and private sector development , public sector reform , and provision of economic advice , on request , to Governments with limited internal capacity .  
In the light of the major changes that have occurred in the past 50 years in the sphere of human rights , it is a little surprising to recall that until very recently , and throughout virtually all mankind 's history , the absolute power to determine which rights they allowed their subjects and to establish internal mechanisms for protecting them lay with sovereigns ( monarchs , emperors , etc . ) and later with States .  
Thus , both international war and internal armed conflicts , just as states of tension or domestic disturbances caused by political , economic , social or cultural factors , when accompanied by clashes , acts of violence , vandalism , inter _ ethnic confrontations , terrorist attacks , etc . and provided they represent an actual or at any rate imminent threat to the community as a whole , constitute a public danger or public emergency in the meaning conferred on those terms by the international instruments referred to above .  
A relatively intense internal armed conflict ( where it is assumed that the intensity of hostilities and the level of organization of the combatants is below that required by the above Protocol ) , in which case the provisions set forth in article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions apply .  
Given the complementary and non _ exclusive nature of the protective norms of international law , it is extremely important to consider the positive linkage that exists with international humanitarian law and , in particular , at what point article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions , which also establishes fundamental guarantees during internal armed conflicts , enters into force .  
The Slovak party has informed representatives of the Commission of the European Union as well as the States members of the latter on all legislative , legal and internal political aspects relating to the preparation and subsequent conduct of the referendum on membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , including the fourth question on direct presidential elections which proved to be invalid from the legislative point of view .  
In the absence of a ratification making it possible to apply a universal jurisdiction clause to the country where the crime was committed , States may for efficiency 's sake take measures in their internal legislation to establish extraterritorial jurisdiction over serious crimes under international law committed outside their territory which by their nature are within the purview not only of internal criminal law but also of an international punitive system to which the concept of frontiers is alien .  
Moreover , societies that are increasingly divided into two blocs , the rich and the poor , could not fully enjoy the benefits of their accomplishments because they will constantly be threatened by social strife and internal turmoil , a situation not conducive to the promotion and observance of human rights .  
We firmly believe that the meeting of the two leaders would signal the start of the necessary process of healing the deep psychological and political trauma left by more than 20 years of bitter internal conflict .  
In this respect , they reaffirmed all 10 principles referred to in the Helsinki Final Act : sovereign equality ; respect for rights inherent in sovereignty ; refraining from the threat or use of force ; inviolability of frontiers ; territorial integrity of States ; peaceful settlement of disputes ; non-intervention in internal affairs ; respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the freedom of thought , conscience , religion or belief ; equal rights and self-determination of peoples ; cooperation among States ; and fulfilment in good faith of obligations under international law .  
Thus promotion of exports of health services required the designing of strategies to improve domestic capacity , create export potential without adversely affecting national health services , identify excess supply of health services and potential markets for such services and overcome internal and external barriers .  
While there are many similarities between the practice of forced evictions and internal displacement , population transfer , mass expulsions , mass exodus , ethnic cleansing and other practices involving the coerced and involuntary movement of people from their homes , lands and communities , forced evictions constitute a distinct practice under international law .  
However , internal acts that may have effects on the international plane , such as fixing the extent of the various kinds of maritime jurisdiction ( territorial sea , contiguous zone , economic zone , baselines , etc . ) , should be included to the extent that such unilateral acts create legal situations which are opposable in conformity with international law .  
The presence of the multinational protection force affectively blocked the risk of Albania sliding towards anarchy or even internal political conflict and allowed the various international organizations and individual States willing to provide practical help to Albania to organize assistance in a secure environment .  Thus a notable improvement in the situation in the country was brought about in a short period of time , restoring confidence in national prospects .  
In contrast , least developed countries which have been unable to resolve serious internal conflicts , maintain political stability or consistently implement the necessary economic reforms have experienced , at best , continued economic stagnation and , at worst , economic collapse .  
The transnationals that work in the countries where there are no internal legal frameworks and / or administrative mechanisms that are capable of enforcing and / or providing such involvement of indigenous communities should accept a constructive obligation to respect the guidelines and the fundamental human rights of indigenous peoples . 
The operation in Albania was a unique multinational intervention in the sense that the situation in the country , as grave as it was , was one of internal unrest sparked by financial crisis , not the usual kind of armed conflict between opposing sides which the Security Council most often deals with .  
It should be noted that the countries concerned have paid priority attention to certain important dimensions , such as the mission of national steering committees for the process , internal efforts to mobilize financial resources and the intensification of the consultative process based on efforts to achieve a convergence of views with the main bilateral and multilateral partners .  7 .  At the subregional level , all of the competent organizations are now fully engaged in the formulation of subregional action programmes .  
About 30 needs assessment / diagnostic missions , on request , on programme design and project formulation on governance ; civil service reform ; human resource management and development ; information technology for public management ; local governance ; decentralization ; post-conflict rehabilitation ; budgeting and budgetary systems ; mobilization of internal and external resources ; financial management capacities ; tax reforms and tax administration ; the role of the State and private sector in development ; and the peace-development link ; ( ii ) Seminars and workshops . 
They shall abide strictly by the principles of mutual respect for their State sovereignty and independence , equality and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , non-use of force or threat of force , territorial integrity , inviolability of borders , peaceful settlement of disputes , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , conscientious fulfilment of their international obligations , and other universally recognized norms of international law .  
In order to eliminate the causes of the refugee problem , it was necessary to establish a new international political and economic order based on increased international cooperation to promote progress and development in the developing countries , the peaceful settlement of disputes , respect for State sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States . 
The Programme shall be implemented in particular but not exclusively , in the following fields : political , legal , administrative , internal affairs , economic , social , cultural , educational , reconstruction and return and the media .  
The safeguarding of peace and the promotion of closer and sustained cooperation among Mediterranean countries should enable the enjoyment of complete sovereignty by all the peoples of the region , free and protected by established and accepted territorial borders and adhering to a mutual policy of non-interference and non-intervention in the internal affairs of each other .  
Improvement in the overall quality of both primary and secondary education would require tackling the internal inefficiencies in the existing system and improving services in keeping with the nations need for an educational content responsive to the changes occurring in the national market economy .  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
Humanitarian emergency situations have become more frequent , more widespread , more complex and longer lasting , combining inter-State and internal conflicts , large-scale displacements of people , mass famine , disruption of economic , political and social institutions and , in some cases , natural disasters .  
In addition to delaying or denying entry visas , initial work permits and internal travel permits to international non-governmental organizations , the Government also attempted to introduce new uncompetitive bidding procedures for local food procurement by obliging humanitarian agencies to purchase food through government parastatals .  
The International Atomic Energy Agency is continuing its activities and studies in such key areas as : creation of an international nuclear information system ; problems of migration of radionuclide contaminants in soils , forests and lakes ; training for the safe operation and management of nuclear power plants ; radiation monitoring and protection and radioactive waste management ; and reduction of internal radiation doses to the population .  
In performing that function , his mandate has crystallized into three main areas of work : ( a ) the development of an appropriate normative framework for meeting the protection and assistance needs of the internally displaced ; ( b ) the promotion of effective institutional arrangements for meeting those needs ; ( c ) focusing , through country visits , on specific situations of internal displacement that the representative , through dialogue with the Government and other actors concerned , aims to ensure are effectively addressed .  
In his reports to the Commission and the General Assembly , the representative has provided information on the magnitude of internal displacement worldwide , has identified specific needs of the internally displaced for protection and assistance , including highlighting the particular problems faced by women and children , has assessed the extent to which those needs are being met under existing normative and institutional frameworks and has reported in detail on specific country situations that he , through his country visits , has studied first-hand .  
This deepened understanding of the problem of internal displacement and of the existing international normative and institutional frameworks through which it is addressed has significantly enhanced the prospects of effective response to the needs of the internally displaced .  
Evaluating the extent to which international , regional and national responses address specific crises of internal displacement will be essential both for ensuring that specific situations are effectively addressed and for furthering the development of strategies at the regional and global levels .  
The first , entitled Masses in Flight : The Global Crisis of Internal Displacement , a provides a global and regional overview of the problem of internal displacement , examines the legal framework for addressing it , details intergovernmental efforts at both the international and regional levels , and non-governmental efforts and offers strategies for improving the response at the global , regional , subregional , national and local levels during the various stages of displacement , covering prevention , protection and assistance in actual situations and the promotion of durable solutions .  
The special difficulties involved in investigating violations of human rights and humanitarian law in circumstances of internal armed conflict and the prevailing limitations in this respect in Rwanda should be explicitly recognized in the reports of the Field Operation .  
As concerns general operating expenses , the significant reduction is attributable in large part to several energy-saving measures undertaken , such as shutting down the internal air-conditioning fan supply after certain hours ; reduced communications requirements from favourable rates negotiated with and paid to commercial carriers ; and lower requirements for rental and maintenance of premises as a result of release of space , for new cleaning and other contracts and for rental and maintenance of furniture and equipment arising from such action as the move of the mainframe to the International Computing Centre in Geneva .  
Recognizing also that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community , the implementation of priority political , economic , social and environmental programmes and projects in the process of consolidating peace continues to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability of financial resources , delays in the disbursement of internal and external funds , lack of continuity , deficiencies in the implementation of other initiatives having an impact on the implementation of a number of projects and by the special characteristics of a complex process ,  
It is worth noting as background to this that , between April 1994 and September 1997 , the special authorities responsible for internal security and order obtained information about more than 30 planned terrorist attacks against Cuba organized and prepared in Miami , in the United States , more than 15 of which involved the use of explosives of the type known as C _ 4 .  
Noting also that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
It also requires building bridges for multilateral cooperation , at both the bilateral and the collective level , on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence , confidence-building , non-interference in the internal affairs of others , mutual respect for regional sovereignties and the resolution of disputes by peaceful means rather than the use of force , in accordance with the rules of international law and the Charters of both the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the United Nations .  
Here again it must be recalled that the combined efforts of the United Nations and the OAU and the lucid and commendable actions of President El Hadj Omar Bongo , President of the Gabonese Republic and also of the international mediation committee , have , unfortunately , not managed to find a political way out of this grave internal crisis , the prolongation of which is a serious threat to peace in the subregion and the continent .  
We note that , unfortunately , our neighbour , Turkey , is indulging in dangerous policies that run counter to the deep historical , religious and human relations between Iraq and Turkey . Turkey has repeatedly continued to violate our sovereignty , interfere in our internal affairs and invade our territory , on the basis of flimsy pretexts .  
During those discussions we explained that the solution to the Kurdish problem inside Turkey could not be achieved by committing armed aggression against Iraq , or by interfering in its internal affairs , in collaboration with foreign Powers the United States and Britain but rather by fully observing the principle of mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the two countries and by cooperation between their Governments to ensure security and stability on both sides of the international border .  
Transnational criminal organizations have , in fact , existed for a long time , but the globalization of international relations with regard to the economy , commerce , telecommunications and the rapid progress of technology , as well as the disappearance of ideological blocs , have permitted the activities of transnational criminal organizations to expand and have increased their power to such an extent that they are now a permanent threat to the foundation and internal security of States , to their cultural and artistic heritage and to the environment of the planet .  
This leads me to say that a country such as Yemen , which mainly depends on foreign aid to carry out its internal policy that is , its economic , social and cultural development has to take into account , in seeking the financial and technical assistance needed to achieve the objectives of the internal policy , certain basic considerations that might seem to others supplementary and not mandatory .  
At the internal level , the relation between the Government and its citizens is based , as I said before , on constitutional legitimacy ; on equality among all citizens , whether male or female ; on equality in rights and obligations of men and women alike ; on the freedom of individuals and groups ; on the freedom of association to parties , trade unions and civilian community organizations ; on freedom of the press ; and on the protection of human rights .  
Some of the countries on our continent are facing famine , endemic diseases , AIDS , fratricidal wars internal factors that exacerbate poverty inside those countries , to which are added such external causes as the fall in the price of commodities , the burden of foreign debt , barriers to access to foreign markets and the drastic drop of nearly 30 per cent in official development assistance .  
That outcome was averted thanks to initiatives taken and to the resolve of the Governments of Central America and friendly countries , which took the proper steps to find a negotiated political solution that responded to the aspirations of the Central American peoples , and in particular to the sovereign right of States to live in peace and freely to determine their own future free from any foreign interference in matters that are essentially within their internal jurisdiction . 
In addition to these illegal Israeli settlement activities , numerous reports and documents of the United Nations provide ample description of the systematic inhumane practices of the Zionist regime , including arbitrary mass arrests , detention and shooting of Palestinians , sealing or demolition of homes and internal closure of the territories .  
As in previous years , the responses indicated that the major causal factors of mass exoduses are international and internal conflicts , as well as systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
Furthermore , it was noted that unbalanced international political relations were often an important factor in the occurrence of mass exoduses through the threat to use force or interference in a country 's internal affairs , as was happening in the case of Iraq , where direct or indirect interference by the United States of America and some of its allies was creating tension , encouraging some of the population to leave , particularly for neighbouring countries .  
There is a need for better designed projects at the national level , with particular attention being paid to environmental impact and economic performance , together with policies aimed at creating an environment that encourages private-sector investment ( internal and external ) and donor support .  
The best strategies explicitly recognized the contingent nature of strategic thinking and would involve an iterative process requiring continuous dialogue amongst the principal actors in order to adjust strategies to changing internal and external conditions .  
In this connection , the Mission underscored the importance of excluding from the extinction of liability those human rights violations which had occurred outside the strict framework of the internal armed conflict , and the major responsibility of the judicial authorities for complying with the spirit of the law by disallowing an extinction of criminal liability for those crimes which , under domestic law or the international treaties ratified by Guatemala , are imprescriptible or are not subject to such an extinction .  
Whereas : Through the Platt Amendment and its continued intervention and meddling in the internal affairs of the country , the United States of America usurped part of the national territory by installing the Guant \ x { 5ad5 } amo naval base , imposed corrupt and despotic regimes , including the ignominious and bloody tyrannies of Machado and Batista , and since 1959 has systematically attacked Cuba with the declared objective of putting an end to its independence , eliminating Cuban nationality and forcing the population into servitude ,  
The continued existence of the problem of internal displacement combined with the ongoing need to search for solutions require that the capacity of the Representatives mandate and of the United Nations human rights machinery in general be strengthened in order to meet these challenges in a comprehensive and effective manner .  
If applicable , assists the Director in preparing methods and procedures for verification of human rights during internal armed confrontation , commitment to strengthening the system for the protection of human rights , commitment relating to security forces and the bearing of arms , military conscription and voluntary nature and behaviour of paramilitary forces ; assists also in following up the verification and evaluating the findings of regional offices . 
Furthermore , arms sales are also a blatant violation of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 1993 Principles Governing Conventional Arms Transfers , where it is categorically stated that each participating State has to consider the internal and regional situation in and around the recipient country , in the light of existing tensions or armed conflicts , and is obliged to avoid transfers which would be likely to endanger peace , introduce destabilizing military capabilities into a region or otherwise contribute to regional instability .  
In order to protect borders effectively it is necessary for countries to enter into bilateral and mulitlateral agreements on transborder police cooperation to deal with organized or unorganized attempts at illegal migration ; set up an information support system for flexible cooperation between internal and external security forces ; train police officers and embassy staff regarding counterfeit documents ; and pay close attention to security aspects of the issuance of visas .  
The best strategies explicitly recognized the contingent nature of strategic thinking and would involve an iterative process requiring continuous dialogue amongst the principal actors in order to adjust strategies to changing internal and external conditions .  
The internal oversight units , in particular the audit units , should be authorized to submit , through their respective executive heads , periodic comprehensive reports and ad hoc reports on specific issues to their governing bodies .  
It is recommended that the reporting procedures of funds and programmes follow similar lines as those established for the Office of Internal Oversight Services in paragraph 5 ( e ) of resolution 48 / 218 B . Therefore , internal oversight units should be authorized to submit , through their respective executive heads , periodic comprehensive reports and ad hoc reports on specific issues to their governing bodies .  
By its own definition , Executive Outcomes is a company devoted to providing highly skilled and confidential military advisor services and to furnishing personnel , mainly military and highly skilled , to provide strategic and tactical training services in countries requiring sophisticated , effective support for the adequate control of their socio-political reality , to put an end to internal conflicts and to encourage the development of economic activities related to natural and mineral resource development .  
What this report does want to draw attention to are the dangerous grey areas and the limits which need legal safeguards in order to prohibit such advisory services from becoming active armed participation in internal conflicts or in matters of the internal security of citizens that are connected with the exercise of the rights and political freedoms provided for in international human rights instruments .  
More recently , with the rapid growth of mandated activities , the Secretary-General had been able to turn to Member States to provide gratis personnel to support activities in peacekeeping , disarmament , humanitarian assistance , international tribunals , economic and social research , internal oversight services , administration and management .  
First , effective horizontal lines of communication between the existing internal oversight functions should be established in every agency and vertical lines of reporting to the executive management level should be clearly defined and shortened .  
Strongly urges all parties in Somalia to respect human rights and international humanitarian law pertaining to internal armed conflict , to support , as recommended by the independent expert , the re _ establishment of the rule of law throughout the country , in particular by applying internationally accepted criminal justice standards , and to protect United Nations personnel , humanitarian relief workers and representatives of non _ governmental organizations and of the international media ;  
The Government of Croatia will look to cooperate with the international community in finding a proper way to harmonize the complex matrix of sometime conflicting interests of the two groups , while focusing its efforts on protecting civil liberties , human and minority rights , as well as maintaining internal security and regional peace and stability .  
Further reaffirms that electoral assistance to Member States should be provided by the United Nations only at the request and with the consent of specific sovereign States , in strict conformity with the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States , or in special circumstances such as cases of decolonization , or in the context of regional or international peace processes ;  
It also was necessary to exclude international juridical events , such as various notifications which did not entail an intention on the part of the author to become bound thereby , including fairly common situations in which internal juridical acts became , at the international level , simple juridical events .  69 .  Whatever the final scope of the topic turned out to be , his delegation would follow with particular interest the Commissions work on the regime of unilateral acts , particularly the question of their revocability .  
Turkeys military intervention in northern Iraq and the aerial bombardment of that region , which had provoked a massive population exodus southwards , constituted unacceptable interference in Iraqs internal affairs and had been widely condemned by the international community . 
Recognizing also that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community , the implementation of priority political , economic , social and environmental programmes and projects in the process of consolidating peace continues to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability of financial resources , delays in the disbursement of internal and external funds , lack of continuity , deficiencies in the implementation of other initiatives having an impact on the implementation of a number of projects and by the special characteristics of a complex process ,  
Noting further that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
Strongly urges all parties in Somalia to respect human rights and international humanitarian law pertaining to internal armed conflict , to support , as recommended by the independent expert , the re _ establishment of the rule of law throughout the country , in particular by applying internationally accepted criminal justice standards , and to protect United Nations personnel , humanitarian relief workers and representatives of non _ governmental organizations and of the international media ;  
Among the inhibiting domestic structures and growth-constraining factors in Africa are the internal social disarticulation at almost all levels of production ; weak and undiversified production base ; economic delusion and fragmented domestic factor and product markets ; low level of endogenous human resource development and capacity utilization ; and weak physical , institutional and technical capacities .  
Although the measures introduced in 1995 to restore internal and external balance to the Hungarian economy have made considerable progress in this direction , their impact on domestic demand and especially on household consumption has been more severe and more long-lasting than expected .  Economic growth in Slovenia also continued to slow down in 1996 , despite earlier forecasts of an acceleration .  
In addition to general problems facing developing countries , those island Territories also suffer handicaps arising from the interplay of such factors as geographic isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters , the fragility of their ecosystems , constraints in transport and communications , isolation from market centres , limited internal market , lack of natural resources and serious gaps in technological capacities ( in human and material terms ) . 
The High Contracting Parties shall base their relations with each other on the principles of mutual respect , sovereign equality , territorial integrity , the inviolability of borders , the peaceful settlement of disputes , the non-use of force or threat of force , including economic and other means of pressure , the right of peoples to control their own destiny , non-interference in internal affairs , observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms , cooperation among States , and conscientious fulfilment of international obligations and other universally recognized norms of international law .  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
Humanitarian emergency situations have become more frequent , more widespread , more complex and long lasting , combining interstate and internal conflicts , large-scale displacements of people , mass famine , disruption of economic , political and social institutions , and , in some cases natural disasters .  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
Thus promotion of exports of health services required the designing of strategies to improve domestic capacity , create export potential without adversely affecting national health services , identify excess supply of health services and potential markets for such services and overcome internal and external barriers . on service providers . 
This exercise involved extensive external and internal consultations throughout 1994 and 1995 and culminated in the introduction in January 1996 of a modified organizational structure consisting essentially of redefined divisional responsibilities and the creation of a Corporate Strategy and Quality Assurance Section to facilitate a corporate approach to the delivery of services .  
Thus , Cameroon , for its part , has worked to develop internal legal provisions and appropriate structures , including , in particular , a law on the forest and animal regime ; the institutionalization and organization of educational seminars on environmental problems ; the creation of a national advisory commission for environment and sustainable development ; and the development of a national plan of action for environmental management .  
However , internal acts that may have effects on the international plane , such as fixing the extent of the various kinds of maritime jurisdiction ( territorial sea , contiguous zone , economic zone , baselines , etc . ) , should be included to the extent that such unilateral acts create legal situations which are opposable to other States and are permitted by international law .  
All States should recognize the negative impact on anti _ trafficking activities by customs , border-control and law enforcement authorities created by absence or loss of effective exercise of sovereignty in any part of a State because of internal strife , foreign occupation or other causes , which may give rise to illicit transit traffic in drugs , and should condemn any violation of national borders and territorial integrity ;  
They shall abide strictly by the principles of mutual respect for their State sovereignty and independence , equality and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , non-use of force or threat of force , including economic and other means of exerting pressure , territorial integrity , inviolability of borders , peaceful settlement of disputes , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , conscientious fulfilment of their obligations , and other universally recognized norms of international law .  
Where a dispute is submitted to the International Court of Justice pursuant to the provisions of the above paragraphs , both the proceedings before the municipal court and any measures of enforcement or protection pronounced or about to be pronounced shall be suspended pending the judgement of the said Court . Bolivia wishes to state that the contents of the draft articles on jurisdictional immunities of States conflict with neither the provisions of the Political Constitution of the State nor those of other norms of Bolivias internal legal order .  
However , the increased international attention to , and importance of , transparency of transfers and possession of conventional arms are justified by the fact that these conventional arms cause serious human suffering in international and internal conflicts and are not subject to legal regimes in many parts of the world .  
These mechanisms consist , among others , of annual financial reports , semi-annual reports , quarterly reports , audited reports by internal and external auditors , field visits by agency personnel , regular monitoring by geographical desks , narrative reports on progress , regular operational reporting and meetings , as well as mid-term and final reports on activities and finance ( see table 6 below ) . 
The Government of China maintains that sovereign equality , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs and other norms governing international relations must be respected , and that each country is entitled to choose its own social system and mode of development in the light of its specific national conditions .  
The Islamic Republic of Iran , as a Member of the United Nations and a concerned State , while reiterating the principle of the inalienable right of States to choose their political , social , cultural and economic systems , calls upon the Member States to resist such unlawful actions and to make every effort to eliminate their adverse impacts ; and thus preserve the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , in particular those pertaining to national sovereignty , political independence , territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States .  
As far as the Russian Federation directly is concerned , it is firmly guided by the principles of the sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and freedom of international trade and navigation mentioned in the resolution and supports , and intends to continue to develop normal commercial and economic ties with Cuba based on mutual interest and reciprocal advantage and put into practice in strict conformity with generally accepted international norms without any form of discrimination and on the basis of world prices .  
The exercise of power through the application of illegal means such as unilateral actions and the imposition of coercive economic measures against other countries in order to achieve unjustifiable objectives is the prominent example of an emerging unilateralism that is extremely arrogant and self-centred , that feeds on hegemony and expansionism and that entails serious interference in the internal affairs of other countries to the point of sabotage and subversion .  
Furthermore , arms sales to south Cyprus also constitute a violation of the 1993 Principles Governing Conventional Arms Transfers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , where it is categorically stated that each participating State has to consider " the internal and regional situation in and around the recipient country , in the light of existing tensions or armed conflicts " and are obliged to " avoid transfers which would be likely to endanger peace , introduce destabilizing military capabilities into a region , or otherwise contribute to regional instability " .  
Experts identified five main areas of potential policy incoherence : between macroeconomic policy and microeconomic policy ; between public and private sector bodies involved in SME support services ; between the federal and local levels ; between implementation and design ; and between internal and external policies .  
The Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation had held its first ministerial meeting in Mauritius in March 1997 and adopted its charter , the basic principles of which were respect for sovereign equality , territorial integrity and political independence , non-interference in internal affairs , peaceful coexistence and mutual advantage .  
Among the complex tasks of reviving the economy there is one solid priority : the formation of a national market and a continuously growing solvent internal consumer demand with an increasing share in the production structure .  
No internal control structure , however detailed and comprehensive , can by itself guarantee efficient administration and complete and accurate records or be foolproof against fraud , especially when those involved hold positions of authority or trust .  
His delegation believed that two factors were essential for that revitalization , namely , the adoption by developing countries of sound , sustained internal policies and the existence of a favourable global economic environment .

Iraq and its people are daily being subjected by the United States and its dependency , the United Kingdom , to heinous acts of international terrorism , inasmuch as the governments of these two countries are maintaining no-flight zones in the national airspace of the Republic of Iraq , as well as to their frantic attempts to interfere in Iraq 's internal affairs and to their insistence on maintaining the unjust embargo imposed on Iraq in 1990 .

Brahimi called a home-grown solution one which is credible , legitimate and sustainable and leads to a broad-based Government which is responsible , representative , stable and accountable ; enjoys both internal and external stability ; respects the human rights of the Afghan people ; and will never again allow the country to be used as a breeding ground for terror or drug trafficking .  
Mr . Kolby ( Norway ) : Many of todays wars are internal , protracted , fought in developing countries along ethnic , linguistic or religious divides , fuelled by illicit economic activity and fought with small arms and light weapons , and they involve a high proportion of non-State actors . 
Five years of neutrality have provided them with the opportunity for peaceful and constructive labour in conditions of internal harmony and stability , the laying of a stable material and spiritual foundation for accelerated economic reform , the gradual introduction of democratic standards and institutions , and the elevation of the country in the near future to the ranks of the worlds modern developed States .  
The ongoing series of hostile operations and the flagrant violations of Iraqs territory and airspace that are being committed by the Turkish armed forces only confirm Iraqs repeated warnings against the consequences of the duplicitous policy being pursued by Turkey vis - - vis the anomalous situation in northern Iraq and against Turkeys participation in perpetuating that situation by open interference in the internal affairs of Iraq .  
However , a glance at the present pattern of armed conflicts , whether internal or international , and the fact that mercenaries are involved in most of them would seem to confirm the opinion held by the Office of the Special Rapporteur , namely , that mercenary activities are continuing in many parts of the world and that the presence of mercenaries is still connected with situations that affect the self-determination of peoples as well as peace , political stability , life , physical integrity , freedom and security .  
These developments have contributed to improving protection of individuals in all situations through , for example , the elaboration of the rules applicable in internal armed conflict , the establishment of individual criminal responsibility under international law for violations of laws applicable to all armed conflicts and the clarification of the conditions under which a State may be held responsible for acts by non-State entities .  
Following submission of the first part of the compilation to the Commission in 1996 , and at the request of the Commission and on the basis of the compilation , the Representative and the legal team , which included experts from international agencies and organizations whose mandates were directly relevant to the needs of the displaced , began to develop a comprehensive normative framework of protection and assistance for the internally displaced in the form of guiding principles on internal displacement . 
The statement provided an opportunity to recall the inclusive and broad-based process through which the Principles were developed , their basis in existing international human rights and humanitarian law and refugee law by analogy , and to inform delegates of the ways in which the Principles were proving valuable to international organizations , NGOs , displaced communities and also to Governments . 23 .  As a sign of the increased and welcome emphasis on internal displacement , a panel discussion on the issue was convened during the Segment , moderated by the Emergency Relief Coordinator a.i .  
Though important steps were taken in accordance with the Programme for Reform to close this gap - the designation of the Emergency Relief Coordinator as the focal point for coordinating the international response to the assistance and protection needs of internally displaced persons , the designation of focal points on internally displaced persons in many of the relevant agencies and NGOs , and more regular discussion of issues of internal displacement in the IASC - the response to specific situations of internal displacement has remained ad hoc and still largely focused on assistance .  
It stressed the need to do so in particular so that inter-agency arrangements for internally displaced persons are predictable , characterized by accountability within the United Nations system , universal in their application and equipped to meet the immense humanitarian challenge presented by the global crisis of internal displacement .  
As indicated in last years report , although the major task of studying the global crisis of internal displacement and existing legal and institutional frameworks for addressing it is largely complete , there nonetheless remain issues on which additional research and consideration are required .  
In the view of the delegation , this , independently of and alongside international financial assistance and technical cooperation , constituted the main source of genuine internal resources which were an important factor for the generation of economic and social development in developing countries .  
The vulnerability of the population is compounded by the continuing effects of the drought , the escalating conflict , massive internal displacement , the disruption of the livelihoods of farmers and labourers normally engaged in poppy cultivation , the absence of significant economic recovery , and the lack of a single effective national authority .  
The success of a number of civic movements in winning mayoral elections , the appointment of a Guambian governor in the Department of Cauca - the first indigenous ethnic minority-group representative ever to be elected - and , in general , the maintenance of democratic institutions in a context of internal armed conflict all bear witness to the unbending will of the Government and the State in general to respect political rights .  74 .  There have also been many large demonstrations calling for peace and protesting against violations of fundamental rights .  
The objectives and expected accomplishments detailed in table 27A . 10 above are expected to be achieved on the assumption that : ( a ) sufficient resources will be made available for maintaining the efficient internal justice system ; and ( b ) programme managers will be supportive to the functioning of the internal justice machinery and extend their full cooperation in the implementation of the judicial decisions .  
In the area of information management , priority is attached to completing the implementation of a global information system on human resources , including an automated system of collecting and processing vital data on staff members and applicants with a view to facilitating related processes with respect to filling vacancies with internal and external candidates , including those from the national competitive examinations .  
Express our deep concern that the socio-economic development of our continent is being hampered by widespread internal conflicts which are due , among other causes , to violations of human rights , including discrimination based on ethnic or national origin and lack of democratic , inclusive and participatory governance ;  
Two other repeated problems noted by internal audits were : ( a ) senior country office staff routinely approved purchase orders in the absence of a written delegation of authority from the resident representative and ( b ) lack of proper segregation of duties in procurement functions .  
That same political commitment to an enhanced regular resource base for UNDP is again reflected by the fact that a number of programme countries have pledged to the regular resource base of the organization , often despite considerable internal constraints . 
Donors and some recipient countries consulted for the present triennial comprehensive policy review confirmed the high relevance of this effect of UNDAF as a means to enhance the internal dialogue within the system on country-level cooperation38 and in the promotion of a common understanding of strategic directions . 39 Decentralization and delegation of authority by most organizations have strengthened this team-building effect . 
In 1997 , as part of my programme for reform , I established a structure of four executive committees at the Under-Secretary-General level to act as internal decision-making mechanisms for the five main areas of concern : peace and security ; economic and social affairs ; development cooperation ; humanitarian affairs ; and human rights as a cross-cutting theme .  
Apart from the shared feature that their host countries were not involved in a violent internal or international conflict , the common features included the possibility , or even the likelihood , of armed conflict , consent of the States concerned to the peacekeeping operations as the form of prevention , and the authorization of the operation by the Security Council .  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territorys deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
We express our deep concern that socio-economic development is being hampered by widespread internal conflicts which are due , among other causes , to violations of human rights , including discrimination based on ethnic or national origin and lack of democratic , inclusive and participatory governance ;  
The Government of Kuwait also provided information on a series of legal , practical and other measures that it had taken , including accession to international conventions , promotion of forms of international cooperation through bilateral agreements , support for regional endeavours and , at the internal level , measures to develop its national legislation and regulations .  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territorys deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
Having examined draft guideline 2.1.4 ( Absence of consequences at the international level of the violation of internal rules regarding the formulation of reservations ) , [ 8 ] the Special Rapporteur wondered whether article 46 of the Vienna Conventions on defective ratification , which was a pragmatic and balanced provision , should be transposed to reservations and interpretative declarations .  
He had concluded that that was not necessary either for practical reasons ( it would be extremely difficult , if not impossible , to establish a clear-cut violation of internal law in respect of reservations ) or for technical reasons ( the internal procedure in respect of reservations is often empirical and difficult of access ) ; there , too , the Commissions opinion would be valuable to him . 
With greater support from the General Assembly and the Commission , the Special Rapporteur will thus be enabled to continue to investigate such phenomena as the role of mercenaries in internal or international armed conflicts affecting the right of peoples to self-determination and at the same time to consider other phenomena in which mercenaries have a criminal involvement , such as illicit trafficking , terrorism and the formation of mercenary teams by private security companies , which use them to intervene in the internal affairs of States with which the companies sign contracts .  
In view of the suggestions that emerged from the first expert meeting and the text of Commission on Human Rights resolution 2001 / 3 , it is recommended that the Special Rapporteur should continue to study mercenary activities as a means of impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination but should also take into account other situations in which mercenaries are involved , including illicit trafficking , terrorism , the use of mercenaries by private security companies to intervene in the internal affairs of States and organized crime .  
The evaluation report envisages a range of flexible service delivery and implementation modalities , with an expanded use of direct services by UNDP as an essential component combined with a coherent accountability and oversight framework and clear performance standards with the requisite internal capacities .  
The forms of conflict most prevalent in the world today are internal communal violence , ethnic cleansing , terrorism , private wars financed by the international trade in diamonds or oil and involve a proliferation of armed groups .  
The end of the internal armed conflict and of an institutional policy that violated human rights represented a qualitative and quantitative improvement .  
To standardize police training and adapt it to the Sierra Leone environment , the Section has finalized arrangements with the UNAMSIL Civilian Police to produce a training manual for the police , internal human rights awareness training for incoming UNAMSIL peacekeepers and military observers occurs on a regular basis and the Section provided training on human rights and humanitarian law for the Pakistani Brigade in Pakistan prior to its deployment to UNAMSIL .  
In the light of that request , the Government of Panama wishes to state for the record that it deems the issue under discussion to be an internal matter for the Chinese people , to be resolved through respectful dialogue and mutual understanding , and it considers that supporting this request by a large number of States Members of the United Nations in no way affects the cordial relations of friendship and collaboration that Panama aspires to maintain and strengthen with the Peoples Republic of China .  
Among the most significant aspects , the Government emphasized the importance given to the effective implementation of international accords on the matter , the fact that a lack of internal legislation should not hinder the protection of internationally recognized human rights , the provision of non-discrimination and equality of all persons , and the adoption of sanctions against the abuse and ill-treatment of certain vulnerable groups .  
In other words , States that were previously in a position to ensure a legal regime of information exchange at their own internal level find themselves defenceless , in the new situation , against the transmission from abroad to their territory of information which may be unlawful or destructive , including pornography , disinformation , information indicative of racial discrimination or intolerance , information aimed at inciting social , national or religious hatred , information of a subversive nature or information emanating from and serving the interests of international criminal and terrorist groups .  
Poverty , along with other situations of marginalization that engulf the lives of so many of the worlds people , including the denial of human dignity , the lack of respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms , social dislocation , intolerable refugee situations , internal and external displacement and physical and psychological oppression , are breeding grounds just waiting to be exploited by terrorists .  
A worldwide campaign of solidarity was needed to meet all those growing challenges with a view to strengthening international cooperation and transparency based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations , and of international law , namely , equality among States , non-intervention in the internal affairs of States , the right of peoples to self-defence , to self-determination and to oppose foreign occupation , and respect for cultural diversity and diversity of beliefs .  
The participants acknowledged that the spread of internal conflicts requires enhanced international and regional cooperation to tackle their root causes and committed themselves to improving coordination of their efforts in the fields of preventive action and peace-building .  
Today aggression , intervention , interference in the internal affairs of other States , occupation of other countries territories by force , irredentism , racism and the threat or actual use of force , which had been considered relics of the past , manifest themselves along with rampant terrorism and other new forms of violence , deportations , ethnic cleansing , genocide and massive violations of human rights .  
Thus , the Russian economy was steadily recovering ; that , combined with internal stability , a huge internal market and tremendous intellectual and economic potential made the Russian Federation a very attractive partner .

Although there had , indeed , been progress in raising awareness and in the codification of environmental law , the internal and external conditions were no more favourable for sustainable development than they had been in 1992 : poverty had increased , environmental degradation had worsened and the accelerated pace of globalization was creating problems of sustainability and equity .  
The necessary elements of a policy mix would address optimal instruments of industrial policy , human resource development and macroeconomic policies , including fiscal policies which avoid onerous internal taxation of construction firms and high tariffs on essential equipment .  
Eight members to be appointed by the President of the Council following formal consultations with the Bureau and regional groups through their coordinators , on the basis of broad consultations with indigenous organizations , taking into account the diversity and geographical distribution of the indigenous people of the world as well as the principles of transparency , representativity and equal opportunity for all indigenous people , including internal processes , when appropriate , and local indigenous consultation processes .

Xinhua News Agency , Washington , September 10 ( Reporters : Tan Weibing , Yan Feng ) - The " Washington Post " of the 10th quoted a U.S . senior intelligence official , who is familiar with internal discussions of U.S . government , as saying that U.S . still has no solid proof of Iraq 's link to international terrorist organizations .  This is so even though U.S . Central Intelligence Agency has already tried every possible means to collect and analyze intelligence on Iraq .  
Wu Yuhua , director of Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice , said that the pilot program , which has been in place for a year , shows that the system of corporate attorneys has played a positive role in establishing modern corporate systems , facilitating the scientific , standardized , and legal process of internal corporate management , saving corporate costs , increasing corporate competitiveness , safeguarding corporate production and operation and other aspects .  
Tieying Li pointed out that China would actively promote the strategic restructuring of state-owned enterprises using the principle of " grasping the large ones and letting the little ones go " as a major premise .  When rebuilding state-owned enterprises into limited companies and stock companies with multiple principle investments and reasonable stock rights structure , and when using capital as the link for structuring parent-subsidiary corporate systems to smooth out reasonable internal group relations , we need to prevent administrative " mandatory matching " and " arbitrarily creating piles " .  
Actually , in view of the fact that the " TSEA " has directly undermined efforts exerted by both China and the United States since the establishment of their diplomatic relations in 1979 in improving and developing their bilateral relations , that it has violated the principled stand on " one China , " and that it has directly interfered in China 's internal affairs , it will definitely aggravate tension in the Taiwan Strait , intensify the regional arms race and further push Taiwan to war rather than protect Taiwan 's security .  
All the membership states of the United Nations should abide by the aims and principles of the " Charter of the United Nations " as well as those relevant UN resolutions to follow those norms governing international relations like mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , and so on and refrain from supporting Taiwan by whatever patterns to join the United Nations as well as other international organizations which can only by joined by sovereignty states .  
and carry out internal restructuring of overall agriculture , by " returning farmland to forest " in mountain areas , " returning farmland to grassland " in pastoral areas , and " returning farmland to fishery " in lake areas ; that is , we should abandon the method of developing agriculture and grain production at the cost of sacrificing the ecological environment , and open up a broad space for increasing new products that suit the demand of the international market and have competitive advantage .  
The current reform of breakthrough significance is the new setup that coordinates and unifies the separate internal and external trade systems for agricultural produce , that is , achieving integration of domestic and foreign trade in this produce in the form of joint management or joint operations , and adopting the new form of agency services in foreign trade .  
We urge the United States to observe the basic principles governing international relations , correct its erroneous doings , and stop interfering in the internal affairs of other countries by using the so-called human rights issue .  
The two countries ' foreign ministers called for the unconditional respect for the right of the people of all countries to choose social systems , value concepts , and ways of development in line with their countries ' conditions .  They considered the interference in the internal affairs of sovereign countries on humanitarian grounds and in the name of protecting human rights constitute acts that violate the purpose and principle of the United Nations Charter .  
the western regions have been under large-scale development ; the country 's opening up has been expanding with each passing day ; and the day of acceding to WTO [ World Trade Organization ] is drawing near all these have provided implementing the strategy of national rejuvenation through science and education with a limitless objective demand , an inexhaustible internal motive force , and a favorable external environment .  
It is necessary to properly handle the direction and intensity of macro regulation and control , combine internal demand expansion , structural readjustment , scientific and technological progress , and opening up to the outside work , accelerate the fundamental transformation of the economic structure and economic growth modes , and strive to uplift the development of the national economy to a new stage .  
Judging from the actual needs of the current national economic growth , Xiang Huaicheng said , the proactive fiscal policy still requires the necessary policy efforts in order to achieve the goals of ultimately expanding internal demand and promoting steady economic growth and to provide guarantee for quality and efficient development in national economic restructuring and scientific and technological advancement .  
The secondary industry should work hard to readjust the internal structure ; enhance the technical innovation capability ; apply advanced technologies and high technologies to transform and upgrade traditional industries and to transform metallurgical , chemical , machinery , building materials , and some other basic industries ;  
and no support for Taiwan membership in international organizations in which statehood is required ] commitments .  Nevertheless , the United States has repeatedly gone back on its own commitments , sold large quantities of advanced weapons to Taiwan , seriously violated China 's sovereignty , wantonly interfered in China 's internal affairs , and encouraged the swollen arrogance of the " Taiwan independence " forces in splitting up the motherland .  This is an important cause of tension in the Taiwan situation .  
Training program should be enhanced .  We should help grassroots cadres in rural areas raise their awareness and abilities to lead the masses to readjust the economic structure , and to develop the rural economy , help them raise policy level , enhance legal system concept , change work style , particularly help them raise their levels and capabilities on the correct understanding and handling of the people 's internal contradiction in rural areas in the new period .  
This absurd move , which violated China 's sovereignty , wantonly interfered in its internal affairs , and breached the basic norms of international relations , has aroused strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition from the Chinese people .  
If other countries followed US hegemonist logic and bad example , and , as authorized by their parliaments , made irresponsible remarks and unwarranted charges concerning the internal affairs under the jurisdiction of other countries , what normal international order could there be , and would the world not be in total chaos !  
Sun Yuxi answered that last year , the US-led NATO used force against Yugoslavia , a sovereign country , using the Kosovo issue as an excuse .  This seriously violated the UN Charter and norms governing international relations and set an extremely dangerous precedent of armed intervention in the internal affairs of another country .  
However , we are principled on developing Sino-US relations ; that is , we should strictly abide by the three Sino-US joint communiques and basic norms of international relations , especially the principle of mutual respect of each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and of mutual non-interference in each other 's internal affairs .  
Meanwhile , some national and religious conflicts and some problems left over by history have yet been solved ; the conflicts over territorial land , territorial seas , and natural resources have risen one after another ; and some countries have even attempted to bring in foreign forces to take a hand in the interference in others ' internal affairs .  
We advocate : The five principles - - the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty , non-aggression , non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence - - and other established principles regarding international relations constitute the political base for safeguarding peace and security .  
Whoever has a basic strategic insight would come to this conclusion : Respecting China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and developing comprehensive cooperation with China will bring about more realistic and long-term strategic interests than interfering in China 's internal affairs ; playing around with " Taiwan independence " forces will not only cause them to lose these interests , but also bring about greater losses in strategic interests .  
North-south conflicts were intense in US history , so that European powers represented by the United Kingdom could bully and humiliate the United States by taking advantage of its internal conflicts .  The United States settled its internal conflicts via the Civil War and achieved national reunification , it was only until then that solid foundations were laid for its strong power in the 20th century .  
It is necessary to reiterate time and again and earnestly put into practice the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , persistent peaceful settlement of international disputes , sovereign equality of all countries , respect for the national conditions of countries , seeking common ground while shelving differences , and the principle of closer mutually-beneficial cooperation for common development .  All these principles should be observed by each and every country .  
The principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual nonaggression , mutual noninterference in internal affairs , persistence in settling international disputes through peaceful means , equality of sovereignty for all countries , respect for the national condition of every country , seeking harmony while reserving differences , and stepping up mutually beneficial cooperation for common development should be continually reiterated , efforts should be made to practice them , and they should be acted on by all countries .  
However , the United States ignored facts and again put forward an anti-China motion at the meeting of the UN Commission for Human Rights to meet the needs of its domestic political and party struggle , in a vain attempt to make use of the so-called human rights issue to interfere in China 's internal affairs and vilify China 's international image .  
On this globe we live , if rich countries become richer and poor countries become poorer , if one side continues to accumulate wealth and the poverty of the other side aggravates , if some big powers interfere in internal affairs of other countries everywhere and practice hegemony and power politics by relying on their powerful economy , science and technology and military strength , and if many developing countries can not take part in international affairs on an equal footing and receive unfair treatment or even groundless humiliation , the world will not have peace and development .  
In short , the economic globalization trend and China 's reform and opening up have provided guarantee that the capital adequacy ratio reaches its standard , which is not only the rule of game for the international banking industry , but also the internal demand for the development of a socialist market economy and the promotion of the healthy growth of the banking industry in China .  
Because , as internal disputes are getting white hot and technical and political defects of the NMD program are being exposed daily , the US . Government 's confidence in this program is dropping lower and lower .  
The integrated system , which is composed of the direct-and-dispatch command , satellite - positioning , imagery-transmission , radio honeycomb communication , internal communication , display-and-control , and other sub-systems , and gave flexible and highly efficient direct-and-dispatch commands to and conducted whole-course monitoring and control on the units .  
In the 1999 Kosovo war , the United States further turned " humanitarian assistance " into a pretext for interfering in the internal affairs of a sovereign state , raising the " non-war military operation " to a strategic level .  
Under the new international and internal situations , whether or not the Chinese armed forces can keep pace with the military developments in various parts of the world , can win the high-tech wars that might occur in the future , and maintain the character , true color and work style of the people 's armed forces rest primarily with the construction of party organizations in the armed forces ; and also with the mental state , work style , discipline , organization , fighting capabilities and leadership of party organizations in the armed forces .  
Over the last five years , in the face of all difficulties arising in the very complicated internal and external environments and economic ad social life , we have always regarded speeding up development as a basic guiding ideology in the economic work , upheld employing methods of development to revolve issues in our forging ahead , adopted a series of policies and measures to promote economic developments , and maintained relatively fast speed developments . 
This requires the maintenance of the democratic centralist system and the effective implementation of the collective leadership system and the regulations for making decisions through collective discussion .  The internal supervision and the check-and-balance capacity inside leading bodies must be increased .  
People present at a meeting also indicated : No doubt the recent " canonization " is a bad thing , yet it also serves to sound the alarm for us .  It has helped to sober us ; and has enabled us to see more clearly the true features of the Vatican which interferes in China 's internal affairs by using a religious issue , and see more clearly the political plot of western hostile forces to stage an infiltration against China on the pretext of religion .  
The party and government 's handling of this historically rare incident again showed that the party central with Jiang Zemin at the core possesses the extraordinary ability to drive internal politics and foreign relations and sharp leadership skills for handling all kinds of complex situations .  
Compared to the rather complicated and profound changes of last year , the international situation this year has been relatively stable with no major collisions .  What is particularly conspicuous is the fact that various countries have been making adjustments to their internal and external policies that are oriented to the new century .  
Having witnessed improved economic life , people have started recognizing or supporting the SAR Government 's measures aimed at developing the economy , including measures for severely cracking down on illegal economic activities , for protecting intellectual property rights , for rectifying the market order , for building a much better international image for Macao , for raising the government work efficiency , for improving an internal investment environment , for inviting more outside investment or capital , and so on .  
S . relations with a strategic vision and from the long-term perspective .  In the future , we will continue to work hard with the new administration in the United States to actively advance bilateral relations to make new improvements and new progress , based on the principles of the three Sino-U.S . aftertime , especially mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , non-interference in one another 's internal affairs , and equality and mutual benefit .  
When promoting the optimized upgrading of the national economic structure , although we must not neglect changes in the industrial structure , or the significance of raising the relative proportion of the tertiary industry on the basis of optimized internal structures in the primary and secondary industries , at the same time we must not neglect to promote structural optimization and upgrades in the other areas .  
Faced with an ever-worsening internal and external security situation , Russia has carried out readjustments to its diplomatic line and pursued a more active and pragmatic foreign policy , in a bid to restore Russia 's great power status and its influential role in world and regional affairs .  
With the passage of time , the sequence of historical evolution became even more discernible , and the inevitable occurrence of this historical phenomenon became even clearer : first , the development of capitalism got all countries involved in the capitalist system , and as developed capitalist countries were engaged in the export of commodities and capital , they at the same time exported their internal contradictions , the human suffering brought along by capitalism .  
Socialism has opened up the way to the solution of the contradiction between the productive forces and relations of production inherent in capitalism , and , while liberating the productive forces of socialist countries to the utmost extent , at the same time objectively promoted the improvement of capitalist system .  Capitalism 's internal contradictions got somewhat smoothed out , and capitalism was given a new opportunity for development ; this , in its turn advanced socialist production and the development and progress of human civilization as a whole .  
Based on the Law of Officers on Active Service in the People 's Republic of China , by implementing systems of officer selection from ordinary universities and colleges , promoting outstanding soldiers and graduates through military academies , the practices have broadened the selection resources of military officers through both channels of internal promotion : military training and external recruitment from ordinary schools of high learning .  In this way , the basic qualities of prospective officers have a sound basis .  
As everyone knows , the Kosovo war was a war of aggression in which the United States mustered the NATO states to intervene in barbaric fashion in the internal affairs of a small and weak country while waving the banner of " human rights transcend sovereignty , " heedless of the UN charter and the accepted norms of international relations , and without UN authorization .  
The emergence of key and difficult problems makes some new demands on the organizational structure , the internal division of effort , the means and methods , and the scope of application of ideological and political work , and in the mutual relationships among these things .  How to draw new boundaries and achieve new standardization of these things , and make them form up an integrated whole which is full of vitality , is an important aspect of strengthening and improving ideological and political work in the new situation .  
The Mormon Church , for instance , boasts of 4.6-million followers .  Evil cults have their own characteristics : authoritative leader , anti-social mode of actions , absolute loyalty to chieftains and to the group one belongs , consciousness of being persecuted , mysterious and secret internal organization , arbitrary self-advertisement , exclusiveness , strict discipline , ideological control and manipulation of fellow believers , compelled service and preaching activities .  
But , we should also realize that any fundamental , continual social and historical change is always accompanied by interactions between the mainstream and the tributaries , struggles between the positive and negative sides and between the progressive and backward sides , and influence and constraints from various internal and external factors , resulting a situation of unprecedented diversity and complexity .  
In early February this year , the China Securities Regulatory Commission urged all fund management corporations to conduct self-examinations according to requirements .  Corporations were required to check relevant facts if any problems are discovered and to designate persons to be responsible for correcting problems in restructuring , investment concepts , internal control , workers ' professional performances , and disciplinary procedures .  
Cai added : Over the past few years , neo-interventionism centered on such theories as " human rights overriding sovereignty , " " sovereignty being limited , " and others have caused a great clamor , and certain countries have adopted a double standard on the issue of human rights and have interfered in other countries ' internal affairs on the pretext of humanitarianism , and this has posed a new threat to the world peace and security .  
Cai stated : The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , namely , mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-interference in internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence , have formed the core of the international law in modern times .  
At the same time , comprehensive auditing will be conducted and strengthened in the fields of budgetary management , equipment , capital construction , reform items , and the enforcement of economic and financial discipline .

At present , Chen Shui-bian and the fundamentalist faction of the DPP have already been surrounded by Taiwan 's political and economic crises , are exposed to attacks on all sides and are plagued with both internal and external troubles .  There is no other way out for them except abandoning the " Taiwan independence " program , transforming themselves , accepting the " one-China principle , " and correcting their incorrect line and policies .  
Revolving around the political steadfastness and ideological and moral purity of troops , the entire military and armed police force regard resisting " red lanterns and green wine " [ feasting and revelry ] and preventing the erosion of decadent ideology and culture as a breakthrough point to vigorously grasp the education and consolidation of ideologies , styles , and disciplines as well as the internal and external relations .

The open letter emphasized : " The Chinese Government 's ban of the cultish organization of ' Falungong ' is a correct measure and the actual deed to safeguard the country 's political power and social stability , the sound mind and body of the people and the personal interests of the Chinese people .  It is to uphold the basic human rights of the Chinese people , which is purely an internal affair of China . "

This is also a typical expression of the dual standards for human rights of the United States . China expresses its strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition [ qiang lie bu man he jian jue fan dui ] to this move made by the United States .

In respect of the constitutional developments after 2007 , a subject which is close to the heart of many people , I have also outlined a timeframe even though we have not yet set a detailed timetable .  We are pursuing in 2003 internal research .  We hope that in 2006 we would be in a position to take forward local legislation .  So the likelihood is that in 2004 or 2005 , we will be conducting public consultation .

Facing the double threat , Chiang Kai-shek formulated a farsighted policy of " maintaining internal security first and then expelling foreign invasion . " In 1934 the Communists were finally driven out of Kiangsi province . They fled to the bleak northern section of Shensi , with only 2,000 to 3,000 followers remaining . People of seven provinces were thus freed from Communist harassment .  
The " target " is sometimes treated with an anesthetic to reduce the pain of cuts and wounds .

Changes in internal secretions within the mother 's body during pregnancy are the cause , making it rather easy to develop swelling of the gums . Expectant mothers often have a poor appetite and abnormal eating habits . If they neglect oral hygiene , they may easily develop cavities and inflamed gums .

Data indicates that if the mainland authorities launch an attack on Taiwan regardless of internal democratic opposition and the cost in casualties - - one third to one quarter of their combined forces manpower - - then they have three possible options for military action : The first is attacking the islands one by one , starting with Kinmen , Matsu and the Pescadores , at the same time using their air and sea dominance , and missiles , to strike military , political and economic targets on Taiwan itself .  
You can see new opportunities in a few phenomena of the early 1990s : The unreasonable explosion in real estate prices has left many empty offices with no one to rent them , as many investors have moved elsewhere because land prices are too expensive , so that recently there has been a softening in real estate . Also , Chinatown has internal forces for its own development : A league opposed to high land prices , with various clan and hometown friendship associations at the core , has appeared , hoping to force rents back down .  
People who have disabilities within the following categories : impaired vision ; impaired hearing or balance ; speech or linguistic impediments ; bodily disabilities ; learning disabilities ; multiple disabilities ; malfunction of important internal organs ; facial deformities and wounds ; coma or senile dementia ; autism ; others ( as defined by the central authorities ) .  
Five years later the low wall around the city had been completed , and artillery placements were added to all four gates ( north , south , east , and west ) to ward off attacks from indigenous peoples or foreign military units . The internal and external walls were each twenty feet thick , and there was a moat around the outside . Such was China 's southernmost county seat .  
Over the last 80 years , the entire internal and external layout of this Japanese-occupation building has remained unchanged . Seeing the sunlight streaming in from the courtyard , casting the pattern of the long rows of windows into its quiet and lonely red-carpeted corridors , one feels a trance-like sense of historical space and time welling up irresistibly inside one .  
It is not hard to discover that most people with a hunched posture have oversensitive nerves .

By the late Qing dynasty ( 1616-1911 ) , when Western influence spread through the Orient , the pressure from internal strife and external aggression reduced folk music to the percussion troupes which played at weddings , funerals and other such occasions .

Director of the Chunghwa Telecom union Chang Hsu-chung said : " We have become too used to being the dominant player in the market . The result of slack internal management , laziness and shirking in state-owned enterprises is that employees have become like a frog in warm water waiting to be slowly boiled . Because we are too used to a cosy , comfortable life we have lost our vitality . "  
The reason for the change in their itinerary was that , like every other previous foreign excursion by top-ranking officials of the ROC , Vice President Lien 's trip was met the entire way with pressure from Beijing . Firstly , after the senior officials of the ROC and Iceland met , PRC foreign affairs spokesman Shen Guofang issued a strongly worded criticism . He asserted that Prime Minister Oddson was interfering in " the internal affairs of China " and damaging relations between the PRC and Iceland , and that Iceland would be responsible for the consequences .  
It is true that after the financial crisis struck there was no massive fall in the value of the Yen , but the combination of external pressures and internal difficulties-in the form of an overall default rate on bank lending of 14% , the collapse of several financial institutions , and the economic sluggishness which has dogged Japan for the last seven years-has been enough to leave the Japanese government bruised and battered .  
He avers that married couples have been through a long process of falling in love , marriage , and living together , which provides a foundation of emotional attachment and understanding . When divorce becomes inevitable , the two people have already been through repeated internal struggles .  
Government officials also paid considerable attention to the debate . Premier Vincent Siew said that it looks as if the DPP 's policy orientation toward the PRC is not much different from the government 's current policy in focusing on substantive issues , exchanges , and equal negotiations . If the DPP can achieve an internal consensus , and if the various political parties can achieve consensus among themselves , in future negotiations with the PRC , Taiwan can present a unified position .  
Disaster struck again in October at the 10,000-man tug-of-war organized by the Taipei City Government when the rope broke , causing two people to lose arms and others to suffer internal injuries .

When she came to Taipei three years ago , she did not choose a foreign firm , in which internal communication is normally done in English . Rather , she entered a local urban planning firm , in which only Chinese was spoken , and learned her Chinese the hard way .  
Hu Tsu-ching , an associate professor of political science at Soochow University , warns that there are several problems that must be addressed : The Kosovo government-in-exile is mired in internal strife , and it must be decided which " Kosovo " to assist . Ways must be found to ensure that the aid provides practical help to the refugees , and is not diverted into private pockets . With regard to the proposed training program in Taiwan , there are problems of language , health clearance , and so on .  
Ever since 1991 when the ROC amended its constitution , it has defined cross-strait relations as state-to-state relations or at least a special state-to-state relationship , rather than an internal relationship between a legitimate government and a renegade group , or between a central government and a local government .  
3 . Regulations on a national financial stabilization fund : This law will empower the government to intervene to protect the stock market .

With modern science taking steps toward the spiritual world , " Taiwan is naturally best situated to take a world-leading role in this work . " Lee Si-chen points out that both Taoism and Buddhism have unique views about the operations of the universe . Furthermore , the Chinese in Taiwan have inherited from their ancestors both the active practice of qigong ( the movement of internal energy ) and the reflective practice of meditation . Research into these has been extensive , to a degree unimaginable in the West .  
In the Ming dynasty , qigong was incorporated into the study of martial arts and the cultivation of " internal " strength became a prerequisite to the study of the jian . With sufficient internal strength , anyone could be a Zhang Wuji . Gradual realization becomes sudden realization . Going further , what was tangible becomes intangible .  
The PRC is reported to be the main cause of the diplomatic rupture . Macedonia has been beset in recent years by both internal and external threats .

Late 1996 saw the launching of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ( SOHO ) satellite , which was built in a collaborative project between the European Space Agency and NASA . SOHO 's missions include studying the sun 's internal structure and outer atmosphere , and the solar wind . But satellite observations are immensely costly , and satellites have a limited service life and a high risk of failure .  
Before the advent of acoustic imaging , the degree of understanding of the sun 's internal structure that could be gained from its surface oscillations was very limited . For instance , scientists were already aware that the cycle of sunspot activity is related to the way the north and south magnetic poles of the sun are reversed every 11 years . But where was the sun 's magnetic field located ?  
While a comprehensive energy policy is one approach , there are also others . " In the future , " explains Lu Jhy-ming , " the COP will move in the direction of environmental regulations to stimulate business to be more willing to reduce emissions , and products that require higher levels of greenhouse gases to make will be increasingly discriminated against in trade . " Companies which are fast on their feet have already jumped ahead and set internal reduction targets .  
From my personal perspective as someone involved in many different fields , and also from the East Asian perspective , this is a good thing . Classical Western art is very structured , and over the centuries has built up a formidable degree of internal consistency . But it is this very internal consistency that turns Western art into a closed system . When art evolves to a certain point , it becomes what is known in Buddhism as " worldly wisdom , " which means to regard " the seeming " as real .  
I think if we had invited artists from outside the field of visual arts to come and critique " An Award for Taipei Biennale , " they could have provided some very trenchant insights , because the impact of modern art on classical art has been a matter of the external challenging the internal . External concepts pounded away at an internally closed system .  
" In the last few years , the government has come out with a number of preferential tax policies , with bizarre results , " says Steve Tsui . " Even in years when the rate of economic growth has been decent , tax revenues have continued to fall . " Under these circumstances , economic growth alone can not rescue government finances . The tricky part is going to be dealing with the internal structural factors built into the tax system .  
The causes of suicide are complex , have physiological , psychological , social , and cultural implications , and are the result of multiple internal and external factors .  
Both Mori and another Japanese expert who spent much time deep in Taiwan 's mountain regions , naturalist Kana Tadao , concluded , " Generally speaking the tribespeople have a powerful sense of blood ties , with this feeling being strongest among the Bunun .

To increase Governments ' understanding of the main internal and external problems and obstacles impeding the development of foreign trade and foreign direct investments in the ECE region and the implications for these areas of implementing the Uruguay Round decisions by the beginning of the twenty-first century with a view to contributing to the adoption of policies facilitating and promoting intraregional trade and investment cooperation ;  
The tasks identified by the Secretary-General included availability and management of water , sustainable food security , capacity - building for governance , social and human development and mobilization of external and internal financial resources for African development .  
The Government of the Sudan , which continues to affirm that it wholeheartedly desires good relations with all States , respecting their sovereignty and refraining from interference in their internal affairs , is saddened by the incessant series of aggressive acts directed against it by the Eritrean Government with a view to undermining its security , integrity and national unity and considers them to be hostile action incompatible with the international standards that should govern relations between States .  
Improvement in the overall quality of both primary and secondary education will require tackling the internal inefficiencies in the existing system and improving services in keeping with the nation 's need for an educational content responsive to the changes occurring in the national market economy .  
The progress achieved in the peace negotiations and the temporary suspension of offensive and counterrevolutionary activity have created new conditions capable of permitting decisive progress in fulfilling the commitment to eradicate the suffering the internal armed confrontation has caused for the civilian population and of building confidence in the peace process .  
UNDP has defined the conditions for success to include : objectives established and communicated ; internal and external risks identified and assessed ; policies established , communicated and practised ; and measurable performance targets and indicators included in objectives and plans .  
UNDP has supported a Central American initiative to establish a Central American Network for Democratic Governance , which would act as an internal regional mechanism for dialogue and concerted action and would also help to identify weaknesses in the functioning of the Government which might be responsive to specific training activities ;  
The objectives of the review were to determine whether the management structure of the civilian component was appropriate in providing the necessary support service to UNPF , to assess the adequacy of management systems and internal controls and to ascertain whether the use of United Nations resources ( human , physical and financial ) was adequately planned , organized , directed and monitored , and whether value for money was achieved .  
Since the adoption by the General Assembly of its resolution 49 / 108 , UNIDO has advanced a major process of programmatic and managerial reform , responding to changed industrial realities and support requirements both by a substantive reformulation of its priorities and focus and by internal reforms in management and organizational structure with a view to increasing effectiveness , efficiency and impact .  
As to the nature and causes of small arms ' destabilizing accumulation and transfer , in his January 1994 Supplement to an Agenda for Peace , the Secretary-General identified four basic reasons : earlier supply during the cold war , internal conflicts , competition for commercial markets and criminal activity combined with the collapse of governmental law and order .  
The United Nations is the main international organization requested by Governments to undertake tasks such as facilitating dialogue between warring parties , preventing renewal of internal armed conflict , strengthening infrastructure , improving local security and facilitating electoral processes .  
Later , some mercenaries established ties with paramilitary forces of the resistance groups and extreme right-wing groups , while others are said to be operating in other countries ; finally , the company which reportedly serves as a model for companies offering , on the worldwide free market , security services which hitherto were the exclusive responsibility of the internal security forces of each State is registered in South Africa .  
On the contrary , he exhibits blatant prejudice and ill intentions calculated to cause damage and harm to Iraq in response to the wishes of other parties hostile to Iraq with a view to interfering in its internal affairs , fragmenting its national unity and dividing its people .  
In many recent articles , major British newspapers have reported overt United States interference in Iraq 's internal affairs and the fact that the CIA employs numerous " assets " inside Iraq to carry out clandestine operations against Iraq 's national Government .  
The strengthening of the monitoring , internal audit , inspection and evaluation , and investigation functions provided for in the resolution is an important and integral part of the Secretary-General 's management plan , as outlined in his current and his previous annual reports on the work of the Organization , and is all the more essential at a time of major resource constraints .  
Kazakstan calls on the parties to the conflict on all concerned States in the region and on the international community to take urgent measures to halt the military action , ensure non-interference in the internal affairs of the sovereign Islamic State of Afghanistan and guarantee its territorial integrity .  
Funding of humanitarian projects ; ( ii ) capacity-building ; ( iii ) internal and external training programmes ; ( iv ) creation of a conducive atmosphere for cooperation with international NGOs and United Nations agencies .  
Expert seminars have been held on the effects of racism and racial discrimination on the social and economic relations between indigenous peoples and States ( Geneva , 1989 ) , on schemes of internal self-government for indigenous peoples ( Nuuk , 1991 ) , on practical experience in the realization of sustainable and environmentally sound self-development of indigenous peoples ( Santiago , 1992 ) , and on practical experiences regarding indigenous land rights and claims ( Whitehorse , 1996 ) .  
On the matter of internal deportations and forced relocations , the Special Rapporteur concluded that government policies violated the freedoms of movement and residence and , in some cases , constitute discriminatory practices based on ethnic or religious affiliations .  
Those international conventions constitute internal law as of the time they are sanctioned , are applicable ex officio by the courts and by all public services and have increased validity pursuant to paragraph 1 of article 28 of the Constitution , which stipulates that : " The generally acknowledged rules of international law , as well as international conventions as of the time they are sanctioned by law and become operative according to the conditions therein , shall be an integral part of domestic Greek law and shall prevail over any contrary provisions of the law .  
Whereas the current situation in eastern Zaire is purely internal , the international community can not remain aloof without seeking solutions aimed at halting the intensification of ethnic cleansing and genocide in eastern Zaire .  
The fundamental changes in the world scene and the promise they held in the early 1990s , which many celebrated as the " new world order " , must not be allowed to degenerate into a dismal landscape of internal armed conflicts , widespread ethnic rivalries , unbridled nationalism and a multitude of humanitarian problems adversely affecting human well-being in all continents .  
The establishment of adequate internal controls at an early stage was a key requirement which should be borne in mind for future peacekeeping missions , since it would provide reasonable assurance that financial and administrative matters were properly handled during the life of the mission .  
The Conference decided to take appropriate follow-up measures at the regional level within the framework of the United Nations , with a view to actively pursuing ways and means of bringing about cessation of internal hostilities and facilitating the ongoing peacemaking efforts , in contact and collaboration with various Afghan groups , pertinent international organizations and States with interest and influence .  
The problem lay in the grey areas and the limits that had to be set to prevent such advisers from becoming active in internal armed conflicts or in internal security affairs that affected the exercise of internationally recognized civil and political rights and freedoms .  
The hiring of mercenaries to guarantee internal security and public order in African States could be regarded as a threat to the inalienable sovereign responsibility of States for their own internal order and security and to their responsibility to prevent the repression of their citizens or the violation of their human rights ; and the international community should examine the extent to which it considered the recruitment of mercenaries to be legal .  
The Government of the United States of America , in giving illegal protection to Iraqis who have committed serious crimes against their country and to foreigners ( Americans and others ) and in introducing them into Iraq illegally in order to achieve illegal goals that jeopardize its security , stability , territorial integrity and political regime , is committing a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and an act of aggression against an independent Member State of the United Nations and is guilty of blatant interference in its internal affairs .  
LDCs also suffer from an extremely limited internal savings capacity and underdeveloped financial markets , geographical disadvantages ( as in the case of many land-locked and small island LDCs ) , inadequate infrastructure , poor communications and low education levels which are reflected , inter alia , in weak managerial and administrative capacity and in a severe shortage of skilled and trained manpower .  
With regard to the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of peoples to self-determination , the report of the Special Rapporteur gave ample proof of the growing involvement of mercenaries in armed conflict , especially internal armed conflict , and raised important questions on the gaps in national and international legislation relating to such activities , and as to whether the existence of companies selling security services to countries in exchange for concessions should be tolerated .  
The persistence of problems , such as poor procurement planning , inadequate attention to the internal audit function , and failure on the part of implementing agencies to comply with agreements , could only be interpreted as a signal that the administrations concerned were still failing to give due priority to ensuring that agreed recommendations of the Board were fully implemented .  
He reiterated the principles relevant to peacekeeping which had been adopted at the Eleventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries , held in Cartagena in 1995 , to the effect that peacekeeping operations should strictly adhere to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , particularly the principles of respect for the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States and non-interference in their internal affairs , and should be based on the consent of the parties concerned and the principle of impartiality .  
While it was neither desirable nor feasible to adopt inflexible procedures for all peacekeeping operations , such operations must be guided strictly by the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations , in particular , respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of States and non-interference in their internal affairs .  
The use of alleged human rights violations as a pretext for interfering in the internal affairs of States must cease , and progress in the human rights field must be accompanied by tangible advances in economic and social development .  
In recent years , the total number of such personnel has increased very significantly and activities performed by them have expanded to backstopping of peacekeeping operations , disarmament and humanitarian assistance , and to areas which have , in the past , been carried out exclusively by staff members , such as economic and social research , internal oversight services , administration and management .  
In response to invitations by the General Assembly , and its request that the Secretary-General approach Governments for voluntary contributions in cash or in kind , individual Governments have contributed the services of personnel to support activities in peacekeeping , disarmament , humanitarian assistance , international tribunals , economic and social research , internal oversight services , administration and management .  
Functions assigned to gratis personnel have expanded from the traditional field of technical assistance projects to the backstopping of peacekeeping operations ( particularly in the logistics area ) and other activities such as disarmament , humanitarian assistance , mine clearance , investigation and prosecution of persons for serious violations of international humanitarian law ; more recently , functions assigned to gratis personnel have extended also to economic and social research and analysis , internal oversight services and administration and management .  
In the context of ending 35 years of armed conflict , it emphasizes in particular the need to overhaul the security functions of the State : under a reformed Constitution , the police are to be restructured , strengthened and consolidated in a new National Civil Police , which will assume responsibility for internal security ; intelligence gathering activities are to be reorganized and regulated ; and the army will limit its role to external defence and will adjust its doctrine , training , deployment , size and budget accordingly .  
In accordance with United Nations Administrative Tribunal jurisprudence , the consolidated measures set out in administrative instruction ST / AI / 412 specified that a woman candidate , whether internal or external , should be given preference only when her qualifications met all the requirements for the vacant post and when her qualifications were substantially equal or superior to those of competing male candidates ( para .  NULL  
" Noting also that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
The Inspectors ' references to such provisions as " identifying women candidates who meet the minimum qualifications for any vacant post " and measures to limit to internal circulation vacancy announcements where " fully qualified and suitable women candidates have already been identified from within the Organization or from the roster or another direct source of recruitment " are taken out of context as a demonstration of " reverse discrimination " .  
Deeply concerned about the rising level of crime in many parts of the world , jeopardizing political stability and the internal and external security of States , his country supported the draft United Nations framework convention against organized crime submitted by Poland ( A / C . 3 / 51 / 7 ) , and other relevant initiatives . 
The functions assigned by the Decree to the Commission relate to the implementation and enforcement of international humanitarian law on the basis of proposals submitted to the national authorities on legislative and regulatory provisions and measures to guarantee the implementation of the basic international instruments in this regard .  NULLAs to the wording of the resolution under consideration , it is important to draw attention to its authors ' awareness of the exclusion from the scope of Protocol II of situations of internal disturbances and tensions , as not being armed conflicts .  
Cuba considers that the unfair and unequal international political and economic order , underdevelopment , the unequal distribution of income among countries and within countries and , in some cases , the actions of other States and the implementation of measures of coercion are also responsible for the outbreak and continuation of internal conflicts and the suffering they cause .  
We therefore organized national workshops and two regional workshops to discuss internal problems , to collect input from the persons directly concerned , including those responsible for violations and the victims and those in charge of the administration of justice and those to whom it is administered , to publicize the progress of the research and to make the final results known .  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
Humanitarian emergency situations have become more frequent , more widespread , more complex and long lasting , combining interstate and internal conflicts , large-scale displacements of people , mass famine , disruption of economic , political and social institutions , and , in some cases natural disasters .  
Liechtenstein first introduced in 1991 an initiative on the right of self-determination , the ultimate goal of which is to enable States facing internal problems be they between the central Government and communities or between communities within States to cope with these problems in a peaceful and flexible manner on the basis of international law and through constructive dialogue . 
With the successful conclusion of the military observer Mission in Guatemala , the definitive ceasefire between the Government and the URNG has established the necessary conditions for the promotion of peace and development in a subregion of the Americas which has been particularly vulnerable to pernicious blends of internal strife and external interference .  
The ICRC is particularly concerned with emergency situations arising from armed conflict and internal violence , which are often marked by widespread and urgent needs among the civilian population and by the breakdown of political , economic and civic institutions .  
Member States have an ongoing commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter and the norms of international law , which are founded on total and mutual respect for the territorial integrity and political systems of other States and non-interference in their internal affairs ; the non-use of force ; and the peaceful settlement of conflicts through negotiations .  
It has the intention of continuing the dialogue initiated there on a number of bilateral issues , including trade , which is in perfect agreement with our foreign policy agenda , which will seek , after overcoming our internal armed confrontation , to pursue a better understanding and strengthening of our international relations , thus contributing to a better understanding among peoples , including a brighter future for China and Guatemala . I should be grateful if you would arrange for this letter to be circulated as a document of the Security Council . 
At a time of universal consensus that the international protection of human beings against gross and systematic violations of their basic human rights is no longer considered as interference with the sovereignty and internal affairs of the State , we also have to recognize the legal , moral and political responsibility of the international community , above all the powerful States in the region , to prevent acts of genocide and to protect the population against other gross and systematic violations of human rights .  
Whereas the internal armed conflict that Guatemala has experienced for over three decades resulted from the closing of political opportunities for democratic expression and participation and from the adoption of measures of political repression against individuals and organizations linked or identified with the Government overthrown in 1954 ,  
In respect of persons who were involved in the internal armed conflict owing to institutional mandates , the National Reconciliation Act shall contain specific provisions equivalent to those previously mentioned , in that they shall extinguish criminal liability for common crimes perpetrated with the aim of preventing , thwarting , suppressing or punishing the commission of political crimes and related common crimes , where such crimes were directly , objectively , intentionally and causally related to that aim , unless it is demonstrated that there is no relationship between the criminal act and the stated aim .  
Consequently , if the proposals are to apply both at the international level and at the national level , they must be articulated in such a way that those to be implemented at the international level have a counterpart in the standards and mechanisms designed to be applied in the internal system of States .  
Nevertheless , such regulation is included in separate legal texts concerning particular areas of public life where protection of personal data is needed , notably internal affairs , citizenship and personal status issues , medical care and , to a certain extent , the execution of penal sanctions .  
This was done solely in pursuit of internal and external political objectives : to prove that the international community _ NGOs and intergovernmental organizations , all alike _ is involved in attacking Zaire ; that it supports the Government of Rwanda ; and that Zaire is not responsible for the arms trafficking in the refugee camps of which the Security Council accuses it .  
The purpose of the workshop was once again to make the international community more aware of the very serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law which are committed by Government authorities , armed groups or individuals in situations of internal disturbances , crises and tensions , including latent or low _ intensity conflicts .  
Dr Yves Sandoz , Director of International Law and Policy , International Committee of the Red Cross , noted that the starting point of the Workshop was the recognition that protection afforded to the victims of internal violence covered by international humanitarian law was inadequate ; the Workshop was an attempt to escape from the endless debate on the applicability of international law and of human rights instruments in clarifying rules applicable in all situations .  
The idea of minimum humanitarian standards , formally born in Turku , Finland , presented , in his opinion , an attempt to integrate existing human rights and humanitarian norms into one set of principles relevant to situations of internal violence .  
Those mechanisms will have to be established in a broad and realistic manner , with the help of international cooperation , and will have to cover not only financial compensation but also measures to support and assist those families and communities which suffered the worst consequences of the internal armed conflict .  
The Mission hopes that the Guatemalan armed forces , in the context of their considerable efforts to put an end to the internal armed conflict and to accept the institutional changes set forth in the Peace Agreements , will noticeably increase their cooperation in clarifying and punishing crimes and human rights violations in which some of their members may be implicated .  
Despite the insecurity and precarious balance of terror that have marked three years of civil war in Burundi , it still has an organized Government that is capable of acting , unlike other countries torn apart by internal conflicts .  
The characteristics of those criminal groups , which closely resemble those of groups operating in other countries , their hierarchical structure , internal code of conduct , resources available and ability to penetrate the market , make local organized crime a highly dangerous feature for the newly established social and economic setting of Belarus .  
It is paradoxical that UNEP , an organization that has over the last 20 years played a major role in the development of systems designed to monitor the global environment , has no discernible internal system for monitoring the substantive progress of and results produced by its projects or programmes .  
The Committee is also concerned at the lack of an integrated strategy on children as well as of a fully effective monitoring mechanism for all areas covered by the Convention and in relation to all groups of children in urban and rural areas , especially those affected by the consequences of the economic problems and by the internal conflict .  
Although more countries are adopting the programme approach , constraints identified in the UNDP 1996 internal assessment included : ( a ) a lack of clarity and training in the subject ; ( b ) the complexity of the instrument , including procedures for financial management ; ( c ) a lack of guidance on how Governments should evaluate their own programmes and conduct capacity assessments in the public sector and civil society ; ( d ) the need to harmonize procedures of donors at country level .  
Accordingly , and as long as the faction leaders , the militias and other irregular armed forces continue their conflict in Somalia and until a peaceful settlement is reached , international humanitarian law related to internal armed conflict applies in the whole territory of Somalia irrespective of whether the specific area is engulfed in active fighting .  
After 15 days of torture and ill treatment , he was found lying near the border fence , unable to walk because he had been tortured with corrosive chemicals which had burned his lower limbs , inflamed internal tissue and damaged the bones .  
50 The expert encouraged the working group , in drafting the optional protocol , to take a realistic approach in relation to non-governmental armed groups , in the light of the fact that the vast majority of contemporary armed conflicts were internal . 
Noting also that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
It had therefore recommended that more economical and efficient methods should be found to carry out the mandate of UNPA ; that , in order to ensure that the strategic decisions of senior management were based on accurate information , the full cost of operating UNPA should be disclosed , including the cost of services which were currently provided by the United Nations to UNPA for free ; and that the internal control systems of UNPA should be strengthened .  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
Serve as a mobilizer of ideas and a catalyst for action to identify and promote new policy options at the national , subregional and regional levels for the removal of constraints on the economic and social development efforts of these countries , with emphasis on the adoption of measures for increased mobilization of domestic and foreign resources , trade and private sector development , public sector reform , and provision of economic advice , on request , to Governments with limited internal capacity .  
In the light of the major changes that have occurred in the past 50 years in the sphere of human rights , it is a little surprising to recall that until very recently , and throughout virtually all mankind 's history , the absolute power to determine which rights they allowed their subjects and to establish internal mechanisms for protecting them lay with sovereigns ( monarchs , emperors , etc . ) and later with States .  
Thus , both international war and internal armed conflicts , just as states of tension or domestic disturbances caused by political , economic , social or cultural factors , when accompanied by clashes , acts of violence , vandalism , inter _ ethnic confrontations , terrorist attacks , etc . and provided they represent an actual or at any rate imminent threat to the community as a whole , constitute a public danger or public emergency in the meaning conferred on those terms by the international instruments referred to above .  
A relatively intense internal armed conflict ( where it is assumed that the intensity of hostilities and the level of organization of the combatants is below that required by the above Protocol ) , in which case the provisions set forth in article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions apply .  
Given the complementary and non _ exclusive nature of the protective norms of international law , it is extremely important to consider the positive linkage that exists with international humanitarian law and , in particular , at what point article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions , which also establishes fundamental guarantees during internal armed conflicts , enters into force .  
The Slovak party has informed representatives of the Commission of the European Union as well as the States members of the latter on all legislative , legal and internal political aspects relating to the preparation and subsequent conduct of the referendum on membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , including the fourth question on direct presidential elections which proved to be invalid from the legislative point of view .  
In the absence of a ratification making it possible to apply a universal jurisdiction clause to the country where the crime was committed , States may for efficiency 's sake take measures in their internal legislation to establish extraterritorial jurisdiction over serious crimes under international law committed outside their territory which by their nature are within the purview not only of internal criminal law but also of an international punitive system to which the concept of frontiers is alien .  
Moreover , societies that are increasingly divided into two blocs , the rich and the poor , could not fully enjoy the benefits of their accomplishments because they will constantly be threatened by social strife and internal turmoil , a situation not conducive to the promotion and observance of human rights .  
We firmly believe that the meeting of the two leaders would signal the start of the necessary process of healing the deep psychological and political trauma left by more than 20 years of bitter internal conflict .  
In this respect , they reaffirmed all 10 principles referred to in the Helsinki Final Act : sovereign equality ; respect for rights inherent in sovereignty ; refraining from the threat or use of force ; inviolability of frontiers ; territorial integrity of States ; peaceful settlement of disputes ; non-intervention in internal affairs ; respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the freedom of thought , conscience , religion or belief ; equal rights and self-determination of peoples ; cooperation among States ; and fulfilment in good faith of obligations under international law .  
Thus promotion of exports of health services required the designing of strategies to improve domestic capacity , create export potential without adversely affecting national health services , identify excess supply of health services and potential markets for such services and overcome internal and external barriers .  
While there are many similarities between the practice of forced evictions and internal displacement , population transfer , mass expulsions , mass exodus , ethnic cleansing and other practices involving the coerced and involuntary movement of people from their homes , lands and communities , forced evictions constitute a distinct practice under international law .  
However , internal acts that may have effects on the international plane , such as fixing the extent of the various kinds of maritime jurisdiction ( territorial sea , contiguous zone , economic zone , baselines , etc . ) , should be included to the extent that such unilateral acts create legal situations which are opposable in conformity with international law .  
The presence of the multinational protection force affectively blocked the risk of Albania sliding towards anarchy or even internal political conflict and allowed the various international organizations and individual States willing to provide practical help to Albania to organize assistance in a secure environment .  Thus a notable improvement in the situation in the country was brought about in a short period of time , restoring confidence in national prospects .  
In contrast , least developed countries which have been unable to resolve serious internal conflicts , maintain political stability or consistently implement the necessary economic reforms have experienced , at best , continued economic stagnation and , at worst , economic collapse .  
The transnationals that work in the countries where there are no internal legal frameworks and / or administrative mechanisms that are capable of enforcing and / or providing such involvement of indigenous communities should accept a constructive obligation to respect the guidelines and the fundamental human rights of indigenous peoples . 
The operation in Albania was a unique multinational intervention in the sense that the situation in the country , as grave as it was , was one of internal unrest sparked by financial crisis , not the usual kind of armed conflict between opposing sides which the Security Council most often deals with .  
It should be noted that the countries concerned have paid priority attention to certain important dimensions , such as the mission of national steering committees for the process , internal efforts to mobilize financial resources and the intensification of the consultative process based on efforts to achieve a convergence of views with the main bilateral and multilateral partners .  7 .  At the subregional level , all of the competent organizations are now fully engaged in the formulation of subregional action programmes .  
About 30 needs assessment / diagnostic missions , on request , on programme design and project formulation on governance ; civil service reform ; human resource management and development ; information technology for public management ; local governance ; decentralization ; post-conflict rehabilitation ; budgeting and budgetary systems ; mobilization of internal and external resources ; financial management capacities ; tax reforms and tax administration ; the role of the State and private sector in development ; and the peace-development link ; ( ii ) Seminars and workshops . 
They shall abide strictly by the principles of mutual respect for their State sovereignty and independence , equality and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , non-use of force or threat of force , territorial integrity , inviolability of borders , peaceful settlement of disputes , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , conscientious fulfilment of their international obligations , and other universally recognized norms of international law .  
In order to eliminate the causes of the refugee problem , it was necessary to establish a new international political and economic order based on increased international cooperation to promote progress and development in the developing countries , the peaceful settlement of disputes , respect for State sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States . 
The Programme shall be implemented in particular but not exclusively , in the following fields : political , legal , administrative , internal affairs , economic , social , cultural , educational , reconstruction and return and the media .  
The safeguarding of peace and the promotion of closer and sustained cooperation among Mediterranean countries should enable the enjoyment of complete sovereignty by all the peoples of the region , free and protected by established and accepted territorial borders and adhering to a mutual policy of non-interference and non-intervention in the internal affairs of each other .  
Improvement in the overall quality of both primary and secondary education would require tackling the internal inefficiencies in the existing system and improving services in keeping with the nations need for an educational content responsive to the changes occurring in the national market economy .  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
Humanitarian emergency situations have become more frequent , more widespread , more complex and longer lasting , combining inter-State and internal conflicts , large-scale displacements of people , mass famine , disruption of economic , political and social institutions and , in some cases , natural disasters .  
In addition to delaying or denying entry visas , initial work permits and internal travel permits to international non-governmental organizations , the Government also attempted to introduce new uncompetitive bidding procedures for local food procurement by obliging humanitarian agencies to purchase food through government parastatals .  
The International Atomic Energy Agency is continuing its activities and studies in such key areas as : creation of an international nuclear information system ; problems of migration of radionuclide contaminants in soils , forests and lakes ; training for the safe operation and management of nuclear power plants ; radiation monitoring and protection and radioactive waste management ; and reduction of internal radiation doses to the population .  
In performing that function , his mandate has crystallized into three main areas of work : ( a ) the development of an appropriate normative framework for meeting the protection and assistance needs of the internally displaced ; ( b ) the promotion of effective institutional arrangements for meeting those needs ; ( c ) focusing , through country visits , on specific situations of internal displacement that the representative , through dialogue with the Government and other actors concerned , aims to ensure are effectively addressed .  
In his reports to the Commission and the General Assembly , the representative has provided information on the magnitude of internal displacement worldwide , has identified specific needs of the internally displaced for protection and assistance , including highlighting the particular problems faced by women and children , has assessed the extent to which those needs are being met under existing normative and institutional frameworks and has reported in detail on specific country situations that he , through his country visits , has studied first-hand .  
This deepened understanding of the problem of internal displacement and of the existing international normative and institutional frameworks through which it is addressed has significantly enhanced the prospects of effective response to the needs of the internally displaced .  
Evaluating the extent to which international , regional and national responses address specific crises of internal displacement will be essential both for ensuring that specific situations are effectively addressed and for furthering the development of strategies at the regional and global levels .  
The first , entitled Masses in Flight : The Global Crisis of Internal Displacement , a provides a global and regional overview of the problem of internal displacement , examines the legal framework for addressing it , details intergovernmental efforts at both the international and regional levels , and non-governmental efforts and offers strategies for improving the response at the global , regional , subregional , national and local levels during the various stages of displacement , covering prevention , protection and assistance in actual situations and the promotion of durable solutions .  
The special difficulties involved in investigating violations of human rights and humanitarian law in circumstances of internal armed conflict and the prevailing limitations in this respect in Rwanda should be explicitly recognized in the reports of the Field Operation .  
As concerns general operating expenses , the significant reduction is attributable in large part to several energy-saving measures undertaken , such as shutting down the internal air-conditioning fan supply after certain hours ; reduced communications requirements from favourable rates negotiated with and paid to commercial carriers ; and lower requirements for rental and maintenance of premises as a result of release of space , for new cleaning and other contracts and for rental and maintenance of furniture and equipment arising from such action as the move of the mainframe to the International Computing Centre in Geneva .  
Recognizing also that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community , the implementation of priority political , economic , social and environmental programmes and projects in the process of consolidating peace continues to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability of financial resources , delays in the disbursement of internal and external funds , lack of continuity , deficiencies in the implementation of other initiatives having an impact on the implementation of a number of projects and by the special characteristics of a complex process ,  
It is worth noting as background to this that , between April 1994 and September 1997 , the special authorities responsible for internal security and order obtained information about more than 30 planned terrorist attacks against Cuba organized and prepared in Miami , in the United States , more than 15 of which involved the use of explosives of the type known as C _ 4 .  
Noting also that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
It also requires building bridges for multilateral cooperation , at both the bilateral and the collective level , on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence , confidence-building , non-interference in the internal affairs of others , mutual respect for regional sovereignties and the resolution of disputes by peaceful means rather than the use of force , in accordance with the rules of international law and the Charters of both the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the United Nations .  
Here again it must be recalled that the combined efforts of the United Nations and the OAU and the lucid and commendable actions of President El Hadj Omar Bongo , President of the Gabonese Republic and also of the international mediation committee , have , unfortunately , not managed to find a political way out of this grave internal crisis , the prolongation of which is a serious threat to peace in the subregion and the continent .  
We note that , unfortunately , our neighbour , Turkey , is indulging in dangerous policies that run counter to the deep historical , religious and human relations between Iraq and Turkey .

Christian Tomuschat , the Commissions Coordinator , detailed its main conclusions and recommendations the fruit of a year and a half of work on the human rights violations and acts of violence which occurred during the internal armed conflict .  In its conclusions , the Commission stated that at least 83 per cent of the victims were Mayan and attributed institutional responsibility for 93 per cent of the violations to agents of the State , principally members of the army .  
However , the internal conflict had considerably diminished the pool of financial and human resources required for economic growth , and the underground economy spawned by drug trafficking had caused huge distortions , not only of economic data but also of social indicators .  
In the framework of the ongoing internal armed conflict , serious , gross and systematic human rights violations and large-scale breaches of international humanitarian law have forced a growing number of individuals and entire communities to leave their homes .  
Participants concluded that while the underlying causes of displacement in Colombia are multiple ( the internal armed conflict , land disputes , large-scale development projects , etc . ) , violations of human rights and humanitarian law are most often the immediate cause of displacement .  It was therefore argued that a drastic improvement in respect for human rights in Colombia would be the most effective way to prevent displacement .  
Having concluded that displacement is the result of violations of human rights and humanitarian law , workshop participants went on to discuss how internal displacement is not only the result of armed conflict but a strategy to militarily control disputed areas populated by communities perceived as supporters of the enemy .  
The Haitian National Police remains an extremely fragile institution , weakened by internal shortcomings ( administrative , disciplinary and operational ) and external pressures ( ebbing public support and an aggressive Fanmi Lavalas campaign against its leadership ) .  
Mr . Wehbe ( Syrian Arab Republic ) said that his delegation viewed draft resolution A / C . 3 / 54 / L . 8 , which advocated abolition of the death penalty , as a flagrant violation of the principle of mutual respect for the sovereignty of States and of non-interference in their internal affairs .  It represented an attempt to force other States to change their political , judicial , social and cultural structures .  
A comprehensive internal regulatory and oversight regime for public office and service aimed at preventing conflicts of interest and ensuring the preservation and proper use of resources assigned to public officials and to persons who provide public services , as well as a proper understanding of their responsibilities and the rules governing their activities ;  
Measures to prevent the corruption , by organized criminal groups , of public officials and persons who provide public services , such as feasible measures to detect and monitor the transborder movement of cash , subject to safeguards to ensure proper use of information , and to establish sufficient internal accounting controls to enable their personnel to detect acts of corruption ;  
The internal movement of the capitalist economy was stressed by Marx and Schumpeter alike , who shared the idea of the ambivalent effects of such perpetual change , that appeared as both creative and destructive ( although they differed as to its causes and in their evaluation of the balance between creation and destruction ) .  
The plastic explosive was smuggled in the soles of boots or inside hand cream , shampoo or deodorant bottles , the electric circuits inside radios from which the speakers had been removed , and the detonators inside highlighters with no internal liquid .  
The Nordic countries and Poland , in their responses , agreed that there was a need to address any lack of protection of persons in situations of internal violence , which fell outside the scope of common article 3 of the four Geneva Conventions and of Additional Protocol II thereto , and when effective implementation of human rights might be limited by derogations in exceptional circumstances .  
In this connection , Poland , Switzerland and the National Womens Council of Catalonia stated that fundamental standards were intended to ensure the effective protection of human beings in all situations , especially during situations of internal violence when some of the most horrible atrocities are committed , both by Governments and by non-State actors .  
In order to address that lack of protection of persons in situations of internal violence , of which five major situations had been identified , it would be useful to identify and draw upon international human rights , refugee and humanitarian law , applicable at all times , to all circumstances and to all actors , both governmental and non-governmental , as well as any individual .  
The third issue raised by ICRC concerned the proposal of the Secretary-General that further analysis would be needed to identify the extent to which the human rights abuses which are most prevalent in situations of internal violence can be attributed to the proper and faithful application of derogation clauses set out in international treaties .  
ICRC suggested that many purposes could be envisaged : a document meant to facilitate the dissemination of the relevant norms , an instrument aimed at clarifying the substance of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflict , a text aimed at clarifying the responsibility of non-State actors , or a document aimed at bridging the gap ( if one existed ) between international humanitarian law and human rights law in situations of internal violence .  
According to Turkey , the content of fundamental standards of humanity should be limited to international human rights law and not include international humanitarian law , as they concerned situations of internal violence which did not reach the threshold of an armed conflict .  
Over the last 50 years , and especially since the end of the cold war , the decrease in the number of international armed conflicts has been offset by an increase in the number of civil wars and other situations of internal violence , which are characterized by massive and systematic violations of human rights .  
Noting further that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territorys deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
There is a renewed global interest in issues relating to exclusion from refugee status , not least because internal conflicts are being conducted in flagrant disregard of international human rights and humanitarian law , and because both persecutors and their victims are often forced by events to seek refuge together .  
Many specific aspects of such a comprehensive approach to conflict prevention are addressed in the General Assembly : social cohesion , the eradication of poverty , the protection of minorities and human rights , democratic governance , peacekeeping and the rule of law in internal and international relations .  
As regards the issue of humanitarian intervention and limited sovereignty , we associate ourselves with the majority of Member States , especially States of the South , that referred to the contravention by such ideas of international law , the Charter and the principal guidelines in contemporary law such as sovereignty , political independence and territorial integrity , as well as non-interference in the internal affairs of others .  
Reflecting the fundamental new direction that international relations have recently taken , the Courts subject matter has also dramatically expanded to include a wide variety of issues : maritime boundaries , territorial sovereignty , the use of force , non-interference in the internal affairs of States , diplomatic relations , hostage-taking , the right to asylum , nationality , expropriation of foreign property and rights of passage .  
Hence , the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries was constituted in the light of the values of peace , democracy , rule of law , human rights , development and social justice , bearing in mind the principles of sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and respect for their territorial integrity .  
In the context of the process of growing interdependence , even as calls are being made for free access to financial markets , goods , services , it is paradoxical to witness situations in which obstacles to such interaction are erected unilaterally and without regard for their effects upon the human development of a people even more so when we see that those obstacles are erected by applying internal norms with extraterritorial scope or effects that run counter to international public law .  
We are happy to conclude from the Secretary-Generals report that these advances of democracy have been strengthened in spite of internal social difficulties , compounded by regional and international criminal networks .  
The proliferation of conflicts , internal as well as international , of which civilian populations are the innocent victims , can only reaffirm to us the need to work towards the ideal embodied in that tradition by encouraging States , in conformity with the United Nations Charter , to resolve their differences through peaceful means .  
The significant internal and outward migration for economic reasons of young men particularly to the United States and young women particularly to Europe , especially Spain in recent times ; high rates of maternal mortality ; and the undoubtedly limited sexual and reproductive rights and the rights of women call for specific measures .  
We must take on the often difficult challenge of recognizing and addressing the intimate but complex links between both international and internal migration and other population and development issues.Canada is committed to continuing an active multilateral approach to migration which has as its cornerstone protection of the human rights of all migrants .  
It had consistently maintained that United Nations peacekeeping operations should be carried out in strict compliance with the principles of respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of States and non-interference in their internal affairs , as stated in the Charter of the United Nations , and on the basis of the traditional fundamental principles of peacekeeping such as the consent of the parties , impartiality and the non-use of force except in self-defence .  
They included observing the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , especially the principles of State sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of Member States ; following the three basic principles guiding peacekeeping operations , namely the consent of the parties concerned , strict neutrality and non-use of force except in self-defence ; and settling disputes through peaceful means , such as good offices , mediation and negotiation .  
The independent experts had identified the shortcomings that had made the development of IMIS difficult , including the lack of a corporate information technology plan for the Secretariat , the continuous lack of adequate internal staff , the gross underestimation of the level of effort required for report-writing , and delays in setting up operations support within user offices .  
He stressed the importance of the fundamental principles underlying international negotiations , namely , respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States , refraining from the threat or use of force , the peaceful settlement of international disputes , equal rights , self-determination and non-interference in the internal affairs of States .  
This silence is alarming inasmuch as there are situations in which a country ' s press reports in abundant detail on the presence of companies involved in matters of national security and public safety without regard for human rights and in open contradiction with constitutional provisions that categorically state that internal order and security are the exclusive responsibility of the State .  
The propiska , in the form of a stamp in internal passports , restricted individuals to one legal place of residence and , on that basis , regulated many aspects of daily life as it was required in order to work , attend school , get married and engage in other important civic activities .  
Examining the challenge of averting internal population displacements , the workshop recognized that prevention is a multifaceted undertaking , involving a range of related tasks : eliminating poverty and promoting sustainable development ; ensuring respect for human and minority rights ; establishing equitable and democratic forms of government ; encouraging the peaceful resolution of disputes ; ending social injustice and averting the growth of ethnic or communal antagonisms .  
In order to ensure the effective dissemination and promotion of the Guiding Principles , participants agreed that international humanitarian organizations and national NGOs should facilitate the organization of local _ level workshops on the issue of internal displacement in general and on the application of the Guiding Principles in particular .  
If any costs are to be apportioned , they must be borne by all the parties concerned . 4 . All must respect the sovereignty , security and independence of Iraq in a responsible manner and must refrain from interfering in its internal affairs , first and foremost by eliminating the illegal no-flight zones in the north and south of the country .  
The three-wall system is composed of a thin external layer made of aluminium spaced with an intermediate bumper made of a combination of ceramic fibres and high-strength fabric mixed with Epoxy resin ; the internal wall made of aluminium alloy is the module structure to be protected .  
The Bank and other agencies that play key roles in developing multilateral PPPs can not get too deeply involved in the internal control and supervision of national basic data collection in participating countries .  
Those approached for consultation include representatives of the office of the Secretary-General and of the ERC , relevant United Nations and other international agencies and organizations engaged in human rights , humanitarian and development work , and academic experts familiar with the issue of internal displacement and the mandate .  
Considering the size and nature of the Missions real estate , which includes 166 observation posts and 14 primary United Nations camps locations including accommodations , offices and other premises , and in line with the recommendation of the internal auditors , it is important that a civil engineer be assigned to oversee the planning , repair and renovation of the premises in order to ensure the most economic , efficient and effective utilization of resources .  
This new Government will concentrate on implementing vigorous measures aimed at increasing State income so that the State can honour its obligations , both internal ( payment of salaries , pensions and scholarships and provision of basic social services ) and external ( particularly to the Bretton Woods institutions ) within a context of transparent management of the civil service and State enterprises . 
During the period under review , a number of small island developing States in all regions have been affected by adverse economic developments which have impaired their financial capacity to implement even priority sustainable development measures.This is particularly true for the Pacific small island developing States , where a combination of internal and external factors have impinged adversely on their economic performance .  
The Government of Iraq , condemning in the strongest terms these official actions by the United States , the United Kingdom and Turkey as irresponsible and illegal , requests you to intervene directly with the Governments of these States and to urge them to desist from their persistent interference in the internal affairs of Iraq and to honour the Charter of the United Nations , which affirms respect for the sovereignty , political independence and territorial integrity of Member States .  
Secondly , we are somewhat concerned that the reference at the end of the fourth preambular paragraph to human rights and fundamental freedoms could be misconstrued by certain quarters in order to promote objectives which are in fact contrary to the stated objectives of this draft resolution and to promote interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States .  
A policy catalogue and case book on the elements of good urban governance ; a report on normative standards and benchmarks for good urban governance ; a set of capacity-building manuals on urban governance structures and institutions at local levels ; a report on internal self-evaluation ; sets of modular media and information kits on urban governance ; enabling policy and strategy frameworks on good urban governance ; a report entitled World Charter of Local Self-Government ; ( iii ) Press releases .  
Governments should improve the management and delivery of services for the growing urban agglomerations and put in place enabling legislative and administrative instruments and adequate financial resources to meet the needs of all citizens , especially the urban poor , internal migrants , older persons and the disabled .  
The suggestion of the Commissions Working Group on the topic to delete any reference to the nature or purpose of State activities in determining whether the activities should be considered commercial transactions , and thus subject to the internal jurisdiction of another State , touched upon one of the most controversial points in the entire draft .  
We are grateful that the international community is increasingly focusing its efforts not so much on dealing with the direct consequences of the past internal conflict in our country but rather on providing comprehensive assistance to the consistent implementation in Tajikistan of socio-economic and democratic reforms , which are strongly supported by the leadership of our country .  
He said he hoped the working group would be able to draft a declaration in which States were encouraged to consider a broad range of autonomy for indigenous groups in managing their local and internal affairs , including economic , social and cultural matters .  
Although , he recognized the views expressed by some Governments and academics that the right to self-determination included both an external and an internal aspect and that the latter applied to groups within existing States , he argued that there was not yet international consensus in that respect .  
As the main determinants of transparency , environmental reports of TNCs , internal and external , voluntary and mandatory , must provide a credible portrait of their global activities .  
In addition , Ukraine had inherited the internal contradictions of a planned administrative system , which had accumulated over several decades a system that was rigid , totally militarized and structurally unbalanced .  
More remarkable is that recently two senior police officers were successfully investigated by the internal police disciplinary commission for corruption and were fired an inconceivable scenario just a short time ago .  
Demands of labour mobility accompanying the growth of the market economy in some developing countries have created a transient internal population , with low and insecure wages and poor access to housing , medical care and schooling for their children .  
In the economic sphere , specific aspects , such as internal and external financing , modern services , and variations in the value of physical and financial stocks will be considered . 
Along with pressures emanating from increasing global integration economic , social , cultural there are strong internal pressures applied to Governments to provide quality services with fewer resources .  
Provision was also made for modest increases in internal oversight and capital expenditures , as well as for special political missions whose mandates , though set to expire in 1999 , might be renewed for part or all of the coming biennium .  
As a postconflict country , Liberia is still a fragile political setting , with limited internal resources , growing poverty , and dwindling external assistance , which constitute important factors militating against smooth transition .  
On the internal front , the continued institutional weakness of GuineaBissaus national police , including its chronic lack of adequate logistical support , has hampered its ability to deal effectively with the rising incidence of banditry .  
Finally , he said that Governments , organizations and the entire international community must work together to create favourable internal and external conditions for gradual economic growth and successful , socially oriented sustainable growth for all States .  
In response to those changes in the internal and external environment , the United Nations had elaborated a set of core values and competencies , improved human resources planning , streamlined the personnel manual and expanded the staff training program .  
Within a short space of time , what had hitherto been internal , national provincial border has become international in nature , with all the political , legal , and not least social and humanitarian ramifications .  
While this debt may be manageable under rapid growth circumstances and in an otherwise favourable economic environment , their situation leaves them very vulnerable to abrupt changes in internal or external factors .  
The internal barriers to SME adoption of ecommerce include limited understanding of the complexity of electronic operations , inadequate skills and high initial investment required to develop a viable ecommerce strategy .  
Because countries have different social systems , ideologies , value systems and religious beliefs , it is necessary in international relations to strictly abide by the basic principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , non-aggression , non-interference in the internal affairs of other States , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence .  
We also express , together with all other Arab States , our concern that Somalia become again a united , fully sovereign and independent State able to defend the vital interests of the Somali people , following the attempts by evil forces external and internal to tear apart the social and political fabric of its society and destroy its economic infrastructure .  
It consists of the need to help the people of Afghanistan establish a responsible , representative , accountable and stable Government which enjoys internal and external legitimacy ; is committed to respecting and promoting the rights of all its men , women and children ; enjoys peaceful and friendly relations with all its neighbours ; and is able to ensure that Afghanistan will never again be used as a breeding and staging ground for terrorists or drug-traffickers .  
The overall goal is to find what Mr . Brahimi called a home-grown solution one which is credible , legitimate and sustainable and leads to a broad-based Government which is responsible , representative , stable and accountable ; enjoys both internal and external stability ; respects the human rights of the Afghan people ; and will never again allow the country to be used as a breeding ground for terror or drug trafficking .  
Mr . Kolby ( Norway ) : Many of todays wars are internal , protracted , fought in developing countries along ethnic , linguistic or religious divides , fuelled by illicit economic activity and fought with small arms and light weapons , and they involve a high proportion of non-State actors . 
Five years of neutrality have provided them with the opportunity for peaceful and constructive labour in conditions of internal harmony and stability , the laying of a stable material and spiritual foundation for accelerated economic reform , the gradual introduction of democratic standards and institutions , and the elevation of the country in the near future to the ranks of the worlds modern developed States .  
The ongoing series of hostile operations and the flagrant violations of Iraqs territory and airspace that are being committed by the Turkish armed forces only confirm Iraqs repeated warnings against the consequences of the duplicitous policy being pursued by Turkey vis - - vis the anomalous situation in northern Iraq and against Turkeys participation in perpetuating that situation by open interference in the internal affairs of Iraq .  
However , a glance at the present pattern of armed conflicts , whether internal or international , and the fact that mercenaries are involved in most of them would seem to confirm the opinion held by the Office of the Special Rapporteur , namely , that mercenary activities are continuing in many parts of the world and that the presence of mercenaries is still connected with situations that affect the self-determination of peoples as well as peace , political stability , life , physical integrity , freedom and security .  
These developments have contributed to improving protection of individuals in all situations through , for example , the elaboration of the rules applicable in internal armed conflict , the establishment of individual criminal responsibility under international law for violations of laws applicable to all armed conflicts and the clarification of the conditions under which a State may be held responsible for acts by non-State entities .  
Following submission of the first part of the compilation to the Commission in 1996 , and at the request of the Commission and on the basis of the compilation , the Representative and the legal team , which included experts from international agencies and organizations whose mandates were directly relevant to the needs of the displaced , began to develop a comprehensive normative framework of protection and assistance for the internally displaced in the form of guiding principles on internal displacement . 
The statement provided an opportunity to recall the inclusive and broad-based process through which the Principles were developed , their basis in existing international human rights and humanitarian law and refugee law by analogy , and to inform delegates of the ways in which the Principles were proving valuable to international organizations , NGOs , displaced communities and also to Governments . 23 .  As a sign of the increased and welcome emphasis on internal displacement , a panel discussion on the issue was convened during the Segment , moderated by the Emergency Relief Coordinator a.i .  
Though important steps were taken in accordance with the Programme for Reform to close this gap - the designation of the Emergency Relief Coordinator as the focal point for coordinating the international response to the assistance and protection needs of internally displaced persons , the designation of focal points on internally displaced persons in many of the relevant agencies and NGOs , and more regular discussion of issues of internal displacement in the IASC - the response to specific situations of internal displacement has remained ad hoc and still largely focused on assistance .  
It stressed the need to do so in particular so that inter-agency arrangements for internally displaced persons are predictable , characterized by accountability within the United Nations system , universal in their application and equipped to meet the immense humanitarian challenge presented by the global crisis of internal displacement .  
As indicated in last years report , although the major task of studying the global crisis of internal displacement and existing legal and institutional frameworks for addressing it is largely complete , there nonetheless remain issues on which additional research and consideration are required .  
In the view of the delegation , this , independently of and alongside international financial assistance and technical cooperation , constituted the main source of genuine internal resources which were an important factor for the generation of economic and social development in developing countries .  
The vulnerability of the population is compounded by the continuing effects of the drought , the escalating conflict , massive internal displacement , the disruption of the livelihoods of farmers and labourers normally engaged in poppy cultivation , the absence of significant economic recovery , and the lack of a single effective national authority .  
The success of a number of civic movements in winning mayoral elections , the appointment of a Guambian governor in the Department of Cauca - the first indigenous ethnic minority-group representative ever to be elected - and , in general , the maintenance of democratic institutions in a context of internal armed conflict all bear witness to the unbending will of the Government and the State in general to respect political rights .  74 .  There have also been many large demonstrations calling for peace and protesting against violations of fundamental rights .  
The objectives and expected accomplishments detailed in table 27A . 10 above are expected to be achieved on the assumption that : ( a ) sufficient resources will be made available for maintaining the efficient internal justice system ; and ( b ) programme managers will be supportive to the functioning of the internal justice machinery and extend their full cooperation in the implementation of the judicial decisions .  
In the area of information management , priority is attached to completing the implementation of a global information system on human resources , including an automated system of collecting and processing vital data on staff members and applicants with a view to facilitating related processes with respect to filling vacancies with internal and external candidates , including those from the national competitive examinations .  
Express our deep concern that the socio-economic development of our continent is being hampered by widespread internal conflicts which are due , among other causes , to violations of human rights , including discrimination based on ethnic or national origin and lack of democratic , inclusive and participatory governance ;  
Two other repeated problems noted by internal audits were : ( a ) senior country office staff routinely approved purchase orders in the absence of a written delegation of authority from the resident representative and ( b ) lack of proper segregation of duties in procurement functions .  
That same political commitment to an enhanced regular resource base for UNDP is again reflected by the fact that a number of programme countries have pledged to the regular resource base of the organization , often despite considerable internal constraints . 
Donors and some recipient countries consulted for the present triennial comprehensive policy review confirmed the high relevance of this effect of UNDAF as a means to enhance the internal dialogue within the system on country-level cooperation38 and in the promotion of a common understanding of strategic directions . 39 Decentralization and delegation of authority by most organizations have strengthened this team-building effect . 
In 1997 , as part of my programme for reform , I established a structure of four executive committees at the Under-Secretary-General level to act as internal decision-making mechanisms for the five main areas of concern : peace and security ; economic and social affairs ; development cooperation ; humanitarian affairs ; and human rights as a cross-cutting theme .  
Apart from the shared feature that their host countries were not involved in a violent internal or international conflict , the common features included the possibility , or even the likelihood , of armed conflict , consent of the States concerned to the peacekeeping operations as the form of prevention , and the authorization of the operation by the Security Council .  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territorys deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
We express our deep concern that socio-economic development is being hampered by widespread internal conflicts which are due , among other causes , to violations of human rights , including discrimination based on ethnic or national origin and lack of democratic , inclusive and participatory governance ;  
The Government of Kuwait also provided information on a series of legal , practical and other measures that it had taken , including accession to international conventions , promotion of forms of international cooperation through bilateral agreements , support for regional endeavours and , at the internal level , measures to develop its national legislation and regulations .  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territorys deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
Having examined draft guideline 2.1.4 ( Absence of consequences at the international level of the violation of internal rules regarding the formulation of reservations ) , [ 8 ] the Special Rapporteur wondered whether article 46 of the Vienna Conventions on defective ratification , which was a pragmatic and balanced provision , should be transposed to reservations and interpretative declarations .  
He had concluded that that was not necessary either for practical reasons ( it would be extremely difficult , if not impossible , to establish a clear-cut violation of internal law in respect of reservations ) or for technical reasons ( the internal procedure in respect of reservations is often empirical and difficult of access ) ; there , too , the Commissions opinion would be valuable to him . 
With greater support from the General Assembly and the Commission , the Special Rapporteur will thus be enabled to continue to investigate such phenomena as the role of mercenaries in internal or international armed conflicts affecting the right of peoples to self-determination and at the same time to consider other phenomena in which mercenaries have a criminal involvement , such as illicit trafficking , terrorism and the formation of mercenary teams by private security companies , which use them to intervene in the internal affairs of States with which the companies sign contracts .  
In view of the suggestions that emerged from the first expert meeting and the text of Commission on Human Rights resolution 2001 / 3 , it is recommended that the Special Rapporteur should continue to study mercenary activities as a means of impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination but should also take into account other situations in which mercenaries are involved , including illicit trafficking , terrorism , the use of mercenaries by private security companies to intervene in the internal affairs of States and organized crime .  
The evaluation report envisages a range of flexible service delivery and implementation modalities , with an expanded use of direct services by UNDP as an essential component combined with a coherent accountability and oversight framework and clear performance standards with the requisite internal capacities .  
The forms of conflict most prevalent in the world today are internal communal violence , ethnic cleansing , terrorism , private wars financed by the international trade in diamonds or oil and involve a proliferation of armed groups .  
The end of the internal armed conflict and of an institutional policy that violated human rights represented a qualitative and quantitative improvement .  
To standardize police training and adapt it to the Sierra Leone environment , the Section has finalized arrangements with the UNAMSIL Civilian Police to produce a training manual for the police , internal human rights awareness training for incoming UNAMSIL peacekeepers and military observers occurs on a regular basis and the Section provided training on human rights and humanitarian law for the Pakistani Brigade in Pakistan prior to its deployment to UNAMSIL .  
In the light of that request , the Government of Panama wishes to state for the record that it deems the issue under discussion to be an internal matter for the Chinese people , to be resolved through respectful dialogue and mutual understanding , and it considers that supporting this request by a large number of States Members of the United Nations in no way affects the cordial relations of friendship and collaboration that Panama aspires to maintain and strengthen with the Peoples Republic of China .  
Among the most significant aspects , the Government emphasized the importance given to the effective implementation of international accords on the matter , the fact that a lack of internal legislation should not hinder the protection of internationally recognized human rights , the provision of non-discrimination and equality of all persons , and the adoption of sanctions against the abuse and ill-treatment of certain vulnerable groups .  
In other words , States that were previously in a position to ensure a legal regime of information exchange at their own internal level find themselves defenceless , in the new situation , against the transmission from abroad to their territory of information which may be unlawful or destructive , including pornography , disinformation , information indicative of racial discrimination or intolerance , information aimed at inciting social , national or religious hatred , information of a subversive nature or information emanating from and serving the interests of international criminal and terrorist groups .  
Poverty , along with other situations of marginalization that engulf the lives of so many of the worlds people , including the denial of human dignity , the lack of respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms , social dislocation , intolerable refugee situations , internal and external displacement and physical and psychological oppression , are breeding grounds just waiting to be exploited by terrorists .  
A worldwide campaign of solidarity was needed to meet all those growing challenges with a view to strengthening international cooperation and transparency based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations , and of international law , namely , equality among States , non-intervention in the internal affairs of States , the right of peoples to self-defence , to self-determination and to oppose foreign occupation , and respect for cultural diversity and diversity of beliefs .  
The participants acknowledged that the spread of internal conflicts requires enhanced international and regional cooperation to tackle their root causes and committed themselves to improving coordination of their efforts in the fields of preventive action and peace-building .  
Today aggression , intervention , interference in the internal affairs of other States , occupation of other countries territories by force , irredentism , racism and the threat or actual use of force , which had been considered relics of the past , manifest themselves along with rampant terrorism and other new forms of violence , deportations , ethnic cleansing , genocide and massive violations of human rights .  
Thus , the Russian economy was steadily recovering ; that , combined with internal stability , a huge internal market and tremendous intellectual and economic potential made the Russian Federation a very attractive partner .  
Recognizing that , in addition to the general problems of development , small island developing States experience specific problems arising from their smallness , remoteness , geographical dispersion , vulnerability to natural disasters , fragile ecosystems , constraints on transport and communication , isolation from markets , vulnerability to exogenous economic and financial shocks , limited internal markets , lack of natural resources , limited fresh water supply , heavy dependence on imports and limited commodities , depletion of non-renewable resources and migration ,

In this way Bahrain criminalizes terrorist acts , and they constitute a crime against the external or internal security of the State whether the offence is committed in Bahrain or elsewhere , whether by a national or an alien and whether the person concerned is a primary perpetrator or an accessory to the crime .  
Although there had , indeed , been progress in raising awareness and in the codification of environmental law , the internal and external conditions were no more favourable for sustainable development than they had been in 1992 : poverty had increased , environmental degradation had worsened and the accelerated pace of globalization was creating problems of sustainability and equity .  
The necessary elements of a policy mix would address optimal instruments of industrial policy , human resource development and macroeconomic policies , including fiscal policies which avoid onerous internal taxation of construction firms and high tariffs on essential equipment .  
Eight members to be appointed by the President of the Council following formal consultations with the Bureau and regional groups through their coordinators , on the basis of broad consultations with indigenous organizations , taking into account the diversity and geographical distribution of the indigenous people of the world as well as the principles of transparency , representativity and equal opportunity for all indigenous people , including internal processes , when appropriate , and local indigenous consultation processes .
