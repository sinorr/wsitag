The center of the typhoon is expected to continue moving northwest by north at the speed of about 20 kilometers per hour , possibly brushing the eastern coast of Zhejiang before heading north and entering the southern waters of the Yellow Sea during the daytime tomorrow .  Or it may hit the northern coastal areas of Zhejiang between tonight and early tomorrow morning .  
Influenced by the storm , from daytime to night today , it is still windy 6-8 degrees in the middle and northern part of the South Sea and and coastal area in Guangdong . It is downpour in the west of Guangdong , in the middle and and north of Guangxi , southern and western part of Hunan and most part of Guizhou . It is rainstorm in some places in western part of Guangdong , middle and western part of Guangxi , southern part of Hunan and eastern part of Guizhou .  
Up to now , 34 cities and counties in this province are listed as coastal open economy cities and counties , covering 44% of the whole province 's total area , among which , there are 7 national level development zones of various kinds and some provincial level economic development zones and provincial level agricultural development zones as well .  
From instituting the household contract responsibility system to the establishment of coastal special economic zones , from planned economy to socialist market economy , and from the initial stage of socialism to the idea of " benefiting three things " - - every one of this series of reforms drawing forward the overall situation is attributable to guidance by the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts .  
Third , it is necessary to speed up the pace of scientific and technological development by giving full play to the human resource and technology advantages in the eastern coastal areas , applying modern technologies to transform the traditional industries , developing high-tech and new technology industries , and establishing innovation mechanisms in the light of the laws that govern technological and economic development . 
In socialist construction , areas inhabited by minority nationalities in our country have scored achievements attracting worldwide attention .  Owing to the limitations of natural conditions and for historical reasons , however , there is still a certain gap between the minority-nationality regions and the more developed inland and eastern coastal areas in the levels of economic and cultural development .  
Xinjiang 's oil and cotton have initially become its advantages .  Fourth , the western region can absorb the valuable experience accumulated in the practice of foreign trade and economic cooperation in the coastal areas of the eastern region to constantly improve and develop its environment and conditions for foreign trade and economic cooperation and to speed up the formation of an opening-up economy , thus saving a lot of time and energy for opening up wider to the outside world and for developing its economy .  
Guizhou used to have a relatively weak industrial foundation ; thanks to the construction and readjustment of remote regions away from coastal areas over the past more than 30 years , a military industrial system has been established in Guizhou , with the three major bases of aviation , space flight , and electronics as its main body .  Today , these three major bases have become an important force in Guizhou 's economic development .  
It is true that in comparison with the coastal areas in the country 's eastern region , the western region has a relatively lower industrialization level and an irrational industrial structure on the whole , and its gap with the eastern region has been further widened ever since the beginning of reform and opening up ; however , the central cities in the western region , such as Xian , Chongqing , Chengdu , and Guiyang , as well as certain industries and trades still maintain each 's own relative advantages .  
at the same time , these development zones need to have more macroscopic guidance and assimilate the successful experience from the coastal development zones , so as to become the experimental plots and windows for the grand western development and opening up , and play the role of demonstration , radiation , and contribution in the business solicitation and foreign capital importation for the entire central and western regions .  
The publication and implementation of " the Provisions " indicate that China has advanced a big step in developing legal system governing public security and border patrol .  They have very important significance in demonstrating China 's efforts to strengthen the administration over vessels along the coasts , to prevent and crack down on marine crimes , and to safeguard social order along coastal regions and at sea .  
In particular , the eastern coastal areas should make efforts to establish the socialist market economy before other areas , realize the goal for the reform and development of the state-owned enterprises before other areas , complete the readjustment of the economic structure , and optimize and upgrade the industry before other areas , and realize basic agricultural modernization before other areas .  In short , they should work hard to realize modernization before other areas and make greater contribution to building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
In order to raise the strategizing competence of captains in the context of modern naval warfare , this detachment adjusted the content of training and took its vessel formation from yellow waters into blue waters , from training under general inshore conditions to rapid-reaction training under complex conditions in the coastal waters .  
Located in border and coastal areas , Dandong city has many chemical plants .  To step up preparations for military struggles and prevent sudden environmental pollution incidents , the Dandong city government and the army units stationed there gathered materials relevant to the urban unclear and chemical plants attacked during the Gulf War and Kosovo War and drew up a meticulous and thorough emergency plan .  
We must strengthen our efforts to cut off the supply of illegal drugs in Yunnan , Guangxi , and other border areas in China 's southwest , northwest , and northeast regions as well as in the southeast coastal region by increasing the use of scientific and technological equipment , intensifying investigation and arrests , firmly stopping the influx of illegal drugs , and strictly preventing the flow of precursor chemicals out of the restricted areas .  
Owing to various factors , such as historical and geographic conditions , most of our country 's key economic bases are distributed in economically developed coastal areas , areas with transport facilities , and large and medium-sized inland cities .  Thus , it will be easy for enemies to destroy in a concentrated manner our closely distributed economic bases .  
Judging from the craft 's own characteristics , they can be used for powerful surprise attacks in a short period from its good mobility , easy concealment nature , accurate firing power and strong antipersonnel force .  Therefore , Taiwan 's military considers those crafts as an important component part in fighting at coastal waters .  
Relevant military and civilian personnel generally think that frequent exercises not only have rigorously trained the front-support contingent participating in sea battles , but also have strengthened the military-government and military-people relationships in coastal regions and raised the national defense awareness of the masses in these regions .  
Ever since the time when peace and development were defined as the main theme of our time , a series of major strategic changes have been made in the principles that guide the work of the party , the state , and the army , for example , the formulation of a long-term objective of " three-step development " for the country 's modernization building ; the comprehensive establishment of coastal economic zones ; an all-positioned opening up in the country 's eastern , western , southern , , northern , and central regions ;  
However , as Sichuan is an interior province with a large population , a weak economic foundation , an unreasonable economic structure , and an uneven condition of regional development , it is still below the average level of the whole country 's economic growth , and still lags behind the coastal areas in the east .  
Therefore , the central and western regions can not simply copy the policies of the coastal regions if they are to achieve breakthroughs and greater development in attracting foreign investment .  They must take measures that are suited to the local conditions , give play to their own unique strengths , pioneer new ideas and new models , and adopt more active and effective measures to further open up to the outside .  
Mutual exchanges between Jinmen and Mazu on the one hand and Fujian 's coastal areas on another hand have been going on since a long time ago .  The so-called " mini three links " currently implemented by Taiwan authorities merely transformed such exchanges from " underground " to " the surface . "  Or just as what the Taiwan mass media pointed out , the measure would merely " decriminalize " the existing exchanges and does not have any realistic significance .  
It is necessary to speed up the development of central and western China and , at the same time , continue to let eastern coastal areas play a leading role in promoting structural renovation , scientific and technological innovation , the process of opening up to the outside world , and economic growth .  This is an important part of and a strategic step toward the readjustment of the economic structure .  
He said , international law applies to every country , and this US plane we are speaking of is not an ordinary plane but a military reconnaisance plane which entered China 's airspace without permission after colliding with and destroying a Chinese plane due to carrying out maneuvers contrary to regulations over China 's coastal waters , and landed at a Chinese military airfield .  
According to the principle of state responsibility stated in international law , the US Government must apologize to the Chinese Government and people , stop immediately all its reconnaissance activities along the coastal areas of China , actively cooperate with the Chinese Government to conduct a comprehensive and thorough investigation of this incident , and compensate in a rapid , complete , and effective manner for the personnel and property losses on the part of the Chinese side .  
In the China-US military aircraft collision accident that took place in the airspace over the coastal area of Hainan Island , the US military surveillance plane in China 's Hainan airspace bumped into and damaged a Chinese fighter and illegally landed on Chinese territory .  The United States did not feel slightly ashamed and uneasy for this but shifted the blame to China . It claimed that " China should be responsible for the accident " and that " China 's fighters should not monitor US surveillance planes that came to spy on China . "  
Sources told us that this large-scale exercise in the South China Sea was based on the background of an incident in the Taiwan strait , with the United States as the main imaginary enemy ; it was imagined that , given the intervention of the US Pacific Fleet , one of the focal points of the exercise to " resist the enemy outside coastal areas and territorial seas " was to counter US military information warfare and reconnaisance .  
According to an earlier report in Jiefangjun Bao , since the Taiwan strait crisis broke out , the United States has frequently sent reconnaisance planes to come and go close to China 's coastal airspace in order to step up its gathering of military intelligence on China , and they have even waited for opportunities to sneak into China 's airspace ; Chinese and US warplanes have frequently engaged in midair confrontation and chases , and this collision was by no means a case of accidentally " going too far . "  
During the meeting , relevant consular officials of the Chinese Foreign Ministry pointed out to the US Embassy and Consulate officials mentioned above that after the US military reconnaissance plane bumped against and destroyed a Chinese military plane in the airspace over the coastal waters of China , it , without the permission of the Chinese side , intruded into China 's territorial airspace and landed on an airport in China . This has violated relevant provisions of the international law and relevant Chinese laws .  China has the right to investigate the entire incident .  
A vast ocean separates China and the United States . China has never sent a single soldier to areas near the US continent , nor has China dispatched a reconnaissance plane to US coastal areas .  The United States , on the contrary , has never stopped conducting hostile surveillance , probing flights and harassing activities toward China since the founding of New China .  
Pursuant to the UN Convention on Maritime Law , a foreign aircraft 's " freedom of flight " over another country 's exclusive economic zone is preconditioned by observance of the relevant coastal country 's law and international law , forbidden from activities that may harm the coastal country 's sovereignty , safety , and national interests .  
The Chinese side has also pointed out that when the surveillance aircraft that caused the trouble flew into the airspace over China 's special economic zone , it should respect the provisions concerning the rights of this coastal country .  This act , which is very unfriendly to China , has seriously threatened China 's national security and severely damaged the consensus reached in May last year between China and the United States on avoiding dangerous military actions at sea .  
The reconnaissance behavior of the US military surveillance plane violated the provisions of the " UN Convention on the Law of the Seas " concerning the necessity of respecting the rights of respective coastal nations in overflight of exclusive economic zones , thus posing a serious threat to China 's national security .  
The Chinese Government and people have the right to know why the US sidefrequently dispatched military surveillance planes to China 's coastal waters tocarry out activities , why the US plane violated operational rules and suddenlyveered , bumped into , and destroyed the Chinese plane , and why the US planeintruded into China 's territorial airspace and landed at a Chinese airportwithout permission . 
Ignoring the international law , the US plane had intruded intothe special economic zone in China 's coastal area , and made a turn to bump anddestroy a Chinese military aircraft .  This is an ironclad fact and can not bedenied .  However , what has been hard for people to understand is that after theincident , the US side has refused to admit its fault .  
To exercise sovereign right and exclusive jurisdiction over its exclusive economic zone , the coastal state is entitled to draw up relevant laws and rules to restrict the overflight freedom enjoyed by another state 's aircraft in the airspace over the exclusive economic zone .  Doing so , the coastal state can safeguard the aerial traffic order and flight safety in the zone and protect its legal rights and interest .  
The United States has for many years kept conducting military reconnaissance activities along China 's southeast coastal areas , and US military planes have repeatedly appeared in the skies of China 's coastal areas and have even intruded into the line of China 's territorial waters for reconnaissance .  The US plane that bombed into and destroyed China 's fighter this time is a US military reconnaissance plane equipped with sophisticated electronic reconnaissance devices as well as military intelligence gathering professionals .  
The frequent military reconnaissance activities that the United States have conducted in China 's coastal areas despite the repeated solemn representations from the Chinese Government are never out of a good peaceful purpose , but have an obvious nature of hostility and have posed a serious threat to China 's security and interest .  Meanwhile , these reconnaissance activities have obviously surpassed the scope of " overflight freedom " and violated the principle of " overflight freedom , " as stipulated in the " UN Convention of the Law of the Sea .  
China 's military plane tailed after and conducted surveillance over the US military reconnaissance plane , which intruded into the airspace of our coastal exclusive economic zone to conduct military reconnaissance activities , according to the international law and China 's law .  Exercising sovereign right in the exclusive economic zone , and safeguarding the national defense security is just and legal behavior .  
From China 's northern borders where spring is much in the air to southern China where trees are turning green and from the coastal areas where the ground is full of fallen flowers to the headstreams of the Chang Jiang and Huang He where snow and ice begin to thaw , the public securities organizations have taken rapid actions to form a huge and comprehensive anti-crime network .  
The incident where the US surveillance plane repeatedly infringed on our coastal waters , and rammed and destroyed the Chinese military aircraft , made the Chinese people further understand that hegemonism truly exist in the world , and aroused their fighting will to make China strong and their determination to seize the opportunity to accelerate economic development .  
Wang has conducted surveys of some joint venture enterprises in the coastal region of southern China , an area which is seen by many domestic and foreign companies as an excellent processing base , and as long as the design and standards for electronic products are provided , there are various ready-made associated facilities there , from raw materials and parts / components to assembly , etc .  
These provisions indicate that " other rights " of a coastal country over its exclusive economic zone include its sovereignty and territorial integrity being free from violation as well as its right to protect its national security and peace and other rights granted by international law .  
As mentioned above , the US military reconnaissance plane abused free overflight in airspace over China 's coastal waters , violated flying rules , bumped against and destroyed a Chinese plane , and entered China 's territorial airspace and landed on China 's military airfield without authorization .  That already constituted an incident of serious violation of international law .  
This commentator 's article entitled " ' Routine Duty ' or Malicious Provocation ? " published by the organ of the Central Military Commission held that the surveillance activities of US planes along China 's coastal areas were more than just hostile activities that grossly encroached upon China 's sovereignty and threatened China 's security , but they also seriously affected the healthy and steady development of bilateral relations and would do untold damage to both the Chinese and US sides and to the international community .  
Wang Zhile surveyed some joint venture enterprises in southern China 's coastal area , which is regarded by many domestic and foreign corporations as the best processing base .  One only has to provide the designs and standards for electronic products , because all kinds of necessary factories , from raw materials , spare parts , to assembly , are already there .  
In Beijing , in last night 's " News Network Show , " the CCTV unusually devoted three and a half minutes to snapshots of " large-scale drills " of the PLA , showing Su-27 fighters engaged in all-weather operations over inland , highland , and coastal areas and indicating that the new-generation fighters have developed full fighting capacity .  
From northern frontiers bathing in a luxuriant spring to the south land dressing in green , from the coastal areas full of fallen flowers to the high plateaus of melting snow , the armed police units are all carrying out raids with triumphant results .  
After the national work conference on public security was held , public security border guards have taken measures to speedily launch the " strike-hard " rectification struggle , and severely crack down on cross-border criminal activities such as stowing away , smuggling , guns running , and drug trafficking , thus making positive contributions to safeguarding social and public stability in both border and coastal regions .  
Leaders at all levels have taken the lead in supervising the campaign at the frontline , and all units have studied and determined the key points for the " strike-hard " rectification by considering local conditions .  They have firmly adopted a system whereby units at a higher level will oversee the operations of those at the lower level .  A grand " strike-hard " struggle has vigorously and orderly been launched in the motherland 's border and coastal regions .  
In this grand " strike-hard " struggle , public security frontier guards throughout the country have stressed their tasks in striking out at illegal migration .  They have formed a tight preventive line along the coastal regions and in ports to strike at the activities on " sea , land , and air . "  
We have made brilliant achievements in aiding and developing poverty-stricken areas , however , we should be aware that the production means and living in the poor areas have not yet been basically improved .  These poor areas are hardly capable of resisting natural disasters , their levels of production and social growth are comparatively low , and the gap between them and coastal developed areas keeps expanding .  
To make the new project of aiding and supporting poor areas successful , we call for continued arduous efforts on the part of the party and the people throughout the country and further support from various social sectors and coastal developed areas .  
Japan regards its southwest oceangoing shipping line stretching from Southeast Asia to the Persian Gulf as its " economic lifeline " .  Relying on its special relationship with the United States , Japan has readjusted its strategy at sea in a step-by-step manner from " annihilating enemies in coastal waters " to " ocean defense " as well as " ocean offense and defense " , which is of considerable offensive tints .  
A year after a sharp change took place in the Taiwan Strait situation , Taiwan people built their own views and judgement on Taiwan authorities ' threats of " fighting a decisive war offshore " and " bombing the coastal cities on the west side of the strait " .  
The MND organized more than 100 officers to participate in the operation of the " Lecheng " plan , which includes many plans and special projects and requires a wide range of cooperation .  Frequent meetings every month enabled US officers on active service to visit all Taiwan 's sensitive and important military areas , such as the Air Force Operation Command , the Army 's missile bases , and the Navy submarine base , and to conduct field investigations of the coastal areas where the Chinese communists may conduct landing .  
In the first 10 years plus since the implementation of reform and opening up , the gap between the level of Tibet 's economic and cultural development with the inland and the inland as well as the coastal developed areas in the east showed a trend of further widening instead of shrinking because Tibet was restricted by natural conditions and because of historical reasons .  
Guam is about 1,500 nautical miles from the Philippines . The US deployment of massive forces at this important " strategic supporting point " reflects the strategic thinking of the new Bush administration and will be conducive to launching a long-distance precision attack against the mainland 's coastal regions by US military within 12 hours .  
These reporters visited almost all the companies and forward posts in the coastal and frontier areas of the country and sent out more than 400 news reports , zealously eulogizing frontier servicemen 's heroic achievements and mental outlook of fighting arduously and bravely making contributions .  Besides , these reports have vividly demonstrated the historically great changes in coastal and border defense and fully reflected the border areas ' new progress in army-government and army-people unity and material and spiritual civilizations .  
The province has fully exploited the material support provided for coastal defense and security management by rapid economic development .  Drawing on science and technology , Jiangsu has abandoned the past method of simply relying on patrols and inspections of beaches .  Instead , the province has included public order , production , transit , ships , ports , and military facilities in coastal areas into the land-sea-air comprehensive management system .  
The province has dealt with coastal defense in accordance with the law by enacting the " Interim Provisions on Coastal Defense Development and Management of Jiangsu Province . " It has established " capable , highly efficient , and authoritative " leading management institutions in various administration levels .  While implementing scientific management in establishment of units , doing rational planning , and separating regions for management , it has attached importance to coordinated administration to solve the difficulty in cross-command in coastal defense and security management .  
Lianyungang and other localities have brought into full play the role of high-tech facilities of military bases in the field of coastal defense surveillance and have built and improved a multilevel surveillance and intelligence network for the sea and coastal regions ( including islands ) .  This has enhanced the coastal defense monitoring capability in ocean and territorial airspace , not merely restricted to coastal beaches , thus solving the difficult problem in coastal defense management .  
When constructing new ports , roads , and railways and optic fiber and ground satellite projects , counties and cities in the coastal regions have fully considered the practical needs for coastal defense and incorporated them into unified planning and construction .  This is to ensure coordination in coastal defense management and economic development of coastal regions .  
The army is trying to raise its field air defense and mobile assault capability , the navy is forming a combat equipment system for sea-borne mobile and land-based defense of coastal waters , and the air force is forming a system that will be equipped for both attack and defense , a high - , medium - , and low-altitude , long - , medium - , and short-range integrated system of disposition combined with an antiaircraft intelligence network that can defend our national territory .  
As early as in the eighties , Deng Xiaoping , the chief architect of China 's reform and opening up program , already put forth the concept of coordinating the nation 's economic development .  According to the concept , central and western China should first give consideration to the national interests by supporting the opening up and development of coastal areas in the east .  Then , when the east has reached a certain stage of development , it should help central and western China speed up its development with even more resources in return .  
With its great efforts over the past 50 years , the Chinese Navy has initially built a modern marine operational force composed of the crack troops of five branches - - surface warships , submarines , naval air force , coastal guard , and the marines .  The Chinese Navy is capable of carrying out various kinds of operational tasks on coastal waters .  
The surface warship unit represents a backbone force of the Chinese Navy in carrying out defense strategic task on coastal waters .  It is also the earliest branch established by the Navy . The Chinese Navy has expanded its surface warship unit .  Now it has guided missile destroyers , guided missile escort ships , and guided missile boats as its major fighting capacity .  
More than a half of the state-owned units ' fixed assets investment have been placed in the eastern region , where five special economic zones , the Pudong Development District , 14 coastal open cities , and still more economic development zones have been established , and some preferential policies have been adopted to accelerate development , promote reform , and expand openness in this region , so that the economy in the eastern region has developed rapidly . 
Invited member Zhao Jiazhi , who rushed here from the old industrial base of Jilin Province , indicated that , in attending the session this time , he aimed most at gaining understanding of major arrangements made by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council that are oriented toward the new century , especially arrangements on how to develop the western region and coastal regions .  
The central authorities adopted the policy decision of accelerating the development of the vast western region last year .  This is a strategic shift in China 's economic construction .  For a large country like China , it is undoubtedly not enough to have only a developed and prosperous eastern coastal region .  
We Yi noted : The state has already extended a number of preferential policies to the western region to encourage the region to introduce foreign investment , and the western region should therefore acquire an adequate understanding and make a good use of these policies .  Meanwhile , it should also draw on the experiences of the country 's eastern coastal areas in introducing foreign investment .  
At the same time , he also proposed that departments concerned should re-appraise the reasonability and serviceability of the existing national defense engineering system in southeast coastal areas based on the Central Military Commission 's military strategic principle for the new period , should rebuild this system in line with the requirements of the future high-tech war , and should intensify the building of military facilities and future battlefields in order to meet the demands of the military struggles against Taiwan .  
Reportedly , after drawing from the experience of the military pressure exerted during Taiwan 's presidential elections in 1996 and also for the sake of avoiding unnecessary conjecture , the air force , navy , and missile troops along the southeast coastal areas have received orders to suspend all their military exercises one week before and after Taiwan 's current presidential elections .  The military action will be focused on stepped up monitoring and patrols .  
According to reports , the second-generation guided missile destroyers developed by China itself are equipped with short-range air defense missiles , fully-automated guns and auxiliary guns , and the antisubmarine defense system composed of the late-model sonar antisubmarine helicopters and torpedoes .  For the first time a single vessel has the combat capacity which covers the three dimensions of coastal , air , and antisubmarine defenses .  
The implementation of the large-scale western development is China 's major policy decision oriented to the new century , which , like the eastern coastal region that previously took the lead in development and contributed to the sustained and rapid economic development in the entire country , will certainly provide enormous market and development prospects for the eastern and central regions and energetically promote greater economic prosperity throughout the country .  
It has been disclosed that most of the A-Category group armies of Nanjing and Guangzhou theaters deployed along the southeast coastal frontline have been equipped with warships in their establishments .  In this connection , the crack troops which have been formed and carefully selected from the two theaters have been sent to the navy stage by stage and group by group to receive professional training with sea-crossing and landing operations as the content .  
The historical contribution of the Taiwan Strait area and the Western Pacific coastal area in the 21st century , and whether it will create wealth or engender more conflict , will be decided based on whether the leaders of Taiwan , poised at a crossroads , can accurately judge the trends of the times , distinguishing true historical opportunities from false , in order to successfully negotiate the difficult situation in which they find themselves .

The developed coastal areas and suburban districts of large and medium cities should proceed from their local superiority and give priority to the development of agriculture with fine quality and high efficiency as well as agriculture that earns foreign exchange .  
To consolidate its sector dealing with Taiwan affairs in light of the new situation , the CPC is about to institute a major reshuffle of the relevant mechanism , including increasing the military 's involvement in Taiwan affairs as well as the number of Taiwan affairs offices nationwide , especially the size of such offices in coastal areas . 
Fujian is located along the coastal areas in southeast China . It will make comprehensive preparations to provide logistical support for the probable war in the future [ wei lai ke neng chu xian de zhan zheng ] .  The preparations consist of increased investments on infrastructural construction projects , including airports , harbors , and highways .  
For example , the special national policies for the eastern coastal regions created fast economic development and quick increases in wages in those areas .  This is an obvious example .  
According to today 's " Jiefangjun Bao , " since the beginning of July , Nanjing Military Region has sent units of a whole division and regiment to the coastal forefront to conduct maritime military training , forming a military training picture of a grand scene at sea along the meandering coastal line .  More than 10,000 officers and men of a certain infantry division were organized into a formation and crossed the sea in arms in stormy conditions .  Neither the front nor the end of the formation could be seen ;  
To guarantee the quality of maritime training , the Nanjing Military Region organized leaders of all units to check the areas scheduled for maritime training and formulated careful training plans on the basis of comprehensively mastering the regular weather patterns , the morning and evening tides , the sea currents , and the characteristics of beaches and coastal sea beds .  
Later he headed troops to give strategic chase to Kuomintang troops , liberating eastern China and many coastal islands .  After the founding of the New China , Comrade Su Yu was successively appointed deputy chief and chief of general staff of the People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] .  Proceeding from the actual conditions of the army and state and the international environment , he made many major proposals to the CMC , making important contributions to building a modern defense and army .  
The quality of the environment of surface water of various municipalities , provincial capitals , cities of special economic zones , coastal cities and key tourist cities must meet the state standards .  
As revealed by informed sources , the mainland 's public security authorities have launched several nationwide campaigns to " strike at the underworld " since the beginning of the second half of this year .  Several coastal areas in the southeast , including Shenzhen , Zhuhai , Zhongshan , and Shantou in Guangdong , Fuzhou and Xiamen in Fujian , and Shanghai , are believed to be the localities where underworld activities are most rampant .  These localities have become major places for the public security authorities to " strike at the underworld . "  
Although the forms of expression and the numbers of people involved in criminal and evil forces vary between the coastal areas and the interior and between town and country , and some organizations are lax and some tight , their antisocial essence is completely identical and they do very great social harm .  
The police estimated that after the crackdowns in the fourth quarter of this year and in the first half of next year , they should be able to eliminate some of the larger local triads , fully curb the activities of foreign triads in the mainland , and bring about an obvious improvement in public order in the coastal areas .  
He also disclosed : The flight squadrons currently stationed in the southeast coastal region are all crack troops with the most advanced equipment and weaponry in the Chinese air force , the most superb military technology , and the pilots with the greatest wealth of experience that can take off and conduct operations in all weather .  
Vice Minister of Agriculture Liu Chengguo said : From now on , the coastal areas and outskirts of large and medium-sized cities in east China will mainly be engaged in the production of cash crops with a high value-added and specialty farm produce for export ; the central region will lay particular emphasis on giving play to its advantages in producing premium grain , special-purpose grain , and feed grain ; and the western region will return the grain plots to forestry and husbandry and vigorously develop ecological agriculture .  
Pressured by recent developments , he was forced to lift restrictions on the direct exchange of goods and people between the two islands of Jinmen [ Kinmen ] and Mazu [ Matsu ] and coastal Fujian . However , this is not direct " three links " in the real sense of the word and can not meet the strong desire and pressing demand of the people on both sides of the Strait . It also lags behind the objective situation of growing cross-Strait personnel and economic exchanges .  
Recently , compelled by the situation , they lifted the ban on direct cargo shipping and visitor traffic between Kinmen-Matsu and the coastal areas of Fujian . But this is not direct " three links " in a true sense and can not satisfy the strong wish and urgent demand of the public on both sides .  Furthermore , it lags behind the objective situation where the exchange of visits , economic interaction , and trade between the two sides have been steadily growing .  
The two delegations made the visit exactly after the Taiwan authorities announced the opening of goods and personnel exchanges between Kinmen and Matsu on one side and the coastal areas of Fujian on the other .  The event attracted close attention from mass media inside and outside Taiwan . Both ARATS and the two party delegations from Taiwan agreed that the so-call " mini three links " adopted by the Taiwan authorities by making a big fanfare was of no substantive significance .  
The article , entitled " Uphold the One China Principle , Promote Direct Cross-strait ' Three links , ' " says that the so-called " mini three links " refer to links between Jinmen and Mazu and the Fujian coastal region .  On 13 September 2000 , through an assessment report on the so-called " mini three links , " the Taiwan authorities planned to adopt a gradual and partial method in opening limited Jinmen-Xiamen and Mazu-Fuzhou freight and passenger links , and applied the principle of " first freight , then passengers ;  
Over the past year , ever since the beginning of the large-scale development of the western region , the people of the entire county have made use of this rare opportunity , laid a solid infrastructural foundation , and stepped up their cooperation with coastal areas in the country 's eastern region .  As a result , our advantage of having rich natural resources is being turned into a practical economic advantage .  
In view of our country , following the reform and opening up and economic construction for more than 20 years , the productive forces in our country have climbed onto a new stage , the system of socialist market economy has been initially established , the scale and level of opening up to the outside world have been greatly increased , the talented people of science and technology , management , and other specialized professions are growing rapidly , and a number of center cities with relatively stronger competitiveness have emerged in the coastal areas .  
County Chief Rou Zi Gu Li Ba Yi of Tashiku Erqiantajike Autonomous County said that within one year of the launching of the great strategy of developing the west , the county had strengthened cooperation with the eastern coastal region and turned ample resources into an economic advantage .  The strategy , he said , has already brought tangible benefits to the impoverished county located 4,000 meters above sea level on the Pamirs plateau that had been singled out to receive special government support .  
The new museum is located at the ruins of the Lei Yue Mun Fort , which was a defence work built by the British army in the 19th century .  The SAR Government has preserved and maintained the historical relics , and has rebuilt it into a museum for the benefit of the public , so that they may have a better understanding of Hong Kong 's coastal defence .  It is undoubtedly another cultural contribution to our community .  
The weather was fine and sunny on April 13 but it became cloudy with some light rain patches again that evening as an intense replenishment of the northeast monsoon reached the south China coastal areas .  Winds strengthened from the east and persisted the next day .  
A northeast monsoon reached the south China coastal areas on May 6 .  As winds freshened from the northeast , there was continual rain and temperatures fell to 17 degrees , the lowest in the month , in the late afternoon .  This was the fourth lowest daily minimum temperature recorded in May .  
A cold front crossed the south China coastal areas on the morning of November 1 .  It brought a few rain patches to the New Territories . Winds strengthened from the north and the weather was mainly cloudy .  
The content and the extent of the site , however , remained unclear till 1997 as the AMO conducted an intensive archaeological survey and discovered that it was in fact a typical ancient sandbar site of South China coastal area , which was well-preserved underneath a playground . 
Since the country went ahead with reform and open door policy in 1978 , Hong Kong businesses have been actively involved in investment and trade in the coastal provinces , developing external trade in tandem with local enterprises .  Plenty of valuable experience has thus been gained which can be used for reference in the development of western region . " he added .  
They visited more than six major and many minor ungazetted beaches along the coastal areas in Tuen Mun , Tsuen Wan , Sai Kung and the southern part of Hong Kong and removed rubbish washed ashore or left by inconsiderate beach-goers .  
A weak cold front arrived at the south China coastal areas on October 4 .  The weather in Hong Kong turned hazy at first and became cloudy with thundery showers in the afternoon .  Around 80 millimetres of rainfall were recorded over parts of the Lantau Island .  
" Recycling Cinema " is a continuation of Ellen Pau 's longstanding interest in exploring different ways to frame the spatial and temporal aspects of mobility and location in an urban context .  In her video series , she investigates the simple visual experience of viewing a coastal highway to contemplate the moods of the mind and the silent pathos of loneliness .  
Mr Leung also pointed out that a critical mass of middle class consumers had been formed in the PRD as well as in the Yangtze River Delta and other coastal cities following a breakneck development in China . The combined " middle-class " consumer population is estimated at over 200 million , with a market volume estimated at over US $ 560 billion , growing at a rate of about 10 per cent per annum .  
Falling within this area are coastal areas mainly below the 20-metre contour .  This zone is intended to conserve and retain the natural coastlines and the sensitive coastal natural environment including attractive geological features , physical landform or areas of high landscape , scenic or ecological value .  
With the completion of the North Link Railroad between Suao and Hualien , a major port city at the northern end of the narrow coastal plain due to be completed by the end of this year , further development in eastern Taiwan is possible .  
Covering an area of 163 kilometers on the western coastal plain , Taichung 's location has aided economic development of the city . Taichung 's harbor and verdant outlying fields provide fresh fish and produce for busy city markets , and both the city and surrounding area are served by an efficient network of roads and railways , linking Taichung to centers in the north and south of Taiwan .  
However , the east coast is shown as blank , and the central highlands are simply indicated by painted peaks , because the sheer mountains , and fierce tribes of those regions meant that Ching rule was ineffective beyond the coastal plain to the west .  
No clear plan was set out for upgrading Taichung to a metropolis , nor for opening Taichung Harbor to direct cross-strait shipping ; the high-speed railway was diverted to a coastal route via new towns far from Taichung city ; the third international airport was planned for southern Taiwan ; no increases in numbers of universities and colleges were envisaged under the plan ; and the mass transit system urgently needed to solve Taichung 's transportation problems would n't be ready until the year 2020 ! "  
Currently , in the coastal areas all around the island , smugglers are mostly bringing in agricultural products with a relatively high value , like peanuts , garlic , mushrooms , dried lilies , red beans , betel nuts , sticky rice , Chinese medicines and fish products . Beef , pork , lamb and intestines are also smuggled in , as well as rare animals like Tibetan Mastiffs .  
In Pingtan , boats from afar : Let 's return to the fishing industry . Taiwan is surrounded by the sea on all sides , and conditions for the development of the fishing industry were originally excellent , but because of the pollution caused by industrial development and improper fishing methods , the Taiwan coastal and inshore fishing industries have fallen on hard times .  
Chen Wu-hsiong , the head of the Council of Agriculture 's Planning Department , points out that peanuts and garlic are crops grown in coastal regions of the south . Dried lilies and mushrooms are traditional crops grown in mountainous regions of eastern and central Taiwan . These areas share the characteristic of being relatively poor and barren and not well suited for growing other crops . Furthermore , families have farmed the same land for generations .  
We would probably note that the trends starting in the 1980 ' s , i.e . the loosening of trade and investment restrictions , continued as mainland China gradually opened up . Development spread from the southern coastal provinces to the North and through the interior . China was transformed , the " Sleeping Dragon " awoke , jolted from its long slumber by the calls of two of the " Little Tigers , " Hong Kong from within and Taiwan from the outside . ( edited by Teng Sue-feng / photos by Vincent Chang )  
Then there was the outbreak of a disease that left people with blackened feet in the coastal area of southern Chiayi which has been proved by experts on contagious diseases to have been related to the protracted use of underground water containing too much arsenic for drinking . "  
The objective international situation has changed and the Western economies have long been stuck in a period of economic malaise . The Asia-Pacific area , however - - especially the Southeast Asian region , including Indochina , Taiwan , Hong Kong and coastal mainland China - - has produced a rich economic stimulus . People have money and their purchasing power has increased dramatically . "  
The Tourism Bureau has been developing a recreational area in the woodland coastal area in Tungshih rural township in Chiayi County . They built a huge service center and parking lot in the area . Perhaps by the time they 're ready to open , the woodland will have withered because of destruction of the living environment . "  
A swimming pool at the beach : Six years ago Taiwan had still not lifted martial law , and strict controls over beach areas hindered the chances for intimacy between the sea and this island people . Today most of the restrictions on approaching coastal areas have been removed , but now we are cut off from the sea by dikes we have built ourselves .  
Eastern Taiwan 's inconvenient transportation is well-known , especially the railroad . Because the east is obstructed by the double barrier of the central mountain range and the coastal mountain range , beginning work on the railroad was extremely difficult . The earliest constructed stretch was a simple narrow gauge line from Hwalien to Taitung .  
Twisting around rivers , green mountains and verdant valleys , the railway accompanies the ample and profound Pacific in an interlude when it runs parallel to the coast , occasionally crossing paths with the coastal highway . The railway winds a circuitous path around the mountain peaks , ducking in and out between pitch black shadow and shimmering light .  
Starting in the north at the mouth of the Hualien River , the designated area runs southward as far as Little Yehliu ; on the west it is bounded by the coastal mountain range running north-south parallel to the Central Mountain Range ; and in the east it runs into the Pacific Ocean .  
In the coastal regions of every Asian country along the western Pacific ocean live large numbers of marine turtles , but many of the islands where they are distributed lack reliable monitoring and protection . Sea turtles have even gotten innocently embroiled in local wars or been negatively affected by the capers of private individuals . For this reason international conservation groups intend to devote the year 1995 to the West Pacific Marine turtle , hoping to encourage research and protection of marine turtles in this region .  
As such , with its view of a wide expanse of water and green coastal ridges , the area is said to have especially auspicious geomantic properties . Thus the hillsides are covered with cemeteries advertised as " Fit for an Emperor or King , " " Home of the Dragon and Den of the Tiger , " or " Paradise . " For businessmen to build these cemeteries - - the most expensive and delightfully-sited on the island - - they had to first level the mountainsides and uproot the woods .  
Since 1993 , as part of a major government crackdown , the government has thus far closed down over 30 underground amphetamine laboratories . Nearly 14 tons of raw materials , finished products , and semi-finished products were uncovered . The industry 's history then repeated itself , only this time it was Taiwan drug manufacturers putting up the capital and providing the equipment and technology , as factories moved westward to coastal China ( especially Fujian ) . Goods produced there are either sold to Taiwanese businessmen or shipped out to Taiwan , Japan , and Korea .  
Archaeologist Chang Kuang-chih argues that Tapenkeng Culture may have been an old culture spread widely in southeast coastal China . It may have been one of the two agricultural cultures that developed in parallel in China at that time , the other being the familiar Yangshao Culture which is mainly distributed around the midstream portions of the Yellow River .  
Taiwan in those days was wilderness , but the wide-open land and bountiful resources continued to attract Han Chinese from the coastal areas of Fujian and Guangdong . According to historical sources , the population of coastal Fujian and Guangdong in that era was highly concentrated , with mountainous areas outweighing habitable ones , which further intensified the attraction of Taiwan for the Han .  
Taiwan 's " plum rains " were particularly heavy this year . The storms brought by the stationary front that creates the plum rains in June quickly raised water levels in the island 's reservoirs to dangerous levels . In the center and south of the island , from the mountains to the coastal plains , there were almost daily reports of flooding and landslides .  
The main areas affected by land subsidence run down the western coastal plain from Changhua through Chia-yi , Yunlin and Tainan to Pingtung . Fish farming is prevalent in these counties , and ponds dot the entire area . The excessive pumping of ground water by these fish farmers is so severe that the elevation of towns and village in the area is dropping . This creates problems with drainage leading to frequent flooding .  
Such projects included the building of the Shihmen and Tsengwen Reservoirs and the Central Cross-Island Highway . The provincial government implemented compulsory education through grade nine , encouraged development of coastal marshes and hilly districts , rezoned agricultural land , took steps to prevent excessive concentration of urban land ownership , built public housing , and developed industrial parks . All these measures were taken to create the conditions that would enable Taiwan to vault from the category of developing nation into the ranks of the newly industrialized economies .  
But over recent years , in the pursuit of economic growth , Taiwan has heavily exploited its natural resources . For example , coastal land reclamation and the development of new industrial zones have destroyed valuable wetlands , and when the wetlands are lost the birds ' paradise is lost with them .  
But most worrying are the fish farms spread all over Taiwan 's coastal regions . In some places , abalone pools have been dug into the marine erosion terraces , while in others illegal and excessive pumping of groundwater for aquaculture , along with extraction for domestic , industrial and agricultural use , has caused serious land subsidence in areas covering almost 1,000 square kilometers .  
As the coastal region continued to thrust upward , the shallowest sections of coral reef rose above sea level , resulting in a layer of limestone . This rock has been mined for many years by the cement industry , but has begun to be depleted in recent years .  
In 1928 , the Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Peking was terminated , and a new Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Amity and Commerce was signed . Although the Macau problem was left unresolved , the ROC reclaimed numerous governing rights from the Portuguese , including powers over customs , coastal trade , and riverine transport ; also , Portuguese consular jurisdiction was terminated . The exhibit shows how the ROC tried to eliminate the unequal treaties .  
And it is not only the ocean that is beautiful ; Palau 's land scenery is also absorbing . The " Rock Islands , " known as " a garden on the sea , " have extensive white sand beaches and a rich variety of coastal plant life , as well as amazing waterfalls .  
First , he says , it 's not too far from Taipei , so it makes for a convenient daytrip for foreigners passing through Taipei . Second , the northeastern coastal area is a popular recreation corridor , with excellent places to see in Chinshan , Tanshui , Yangmingshan National Park , Yehliu , Keelung , and Ilan . Even before the museum was established , there was a ready-made stream of visitors passing through the area looking for worthwhile places to go .  
Furthermore , the Kuroshio current and the mainland coastal current converge here , the upwelling current off Taiwan 's eastern rift valley brings up organic salts from the ocean depths , and a seabed valley forms a natural barrier . Under these conditions , many organisms have developed into unique species , and the sea off Ilan contains a cornucopia of marine life .  
However , explains Huang Wu-ta , director of the Taiwan Institute of Urban History , the conditions did not yet exist that would have allowed Jiaozaitu to serve as the capital . The overland transportation network during the late Qing dynasty was extremely poor , and people traveled north-south in Taiwan mainly via the sea . This factor marginalized Jiaozaitu , which had no port . Central Taiwan 's key population center was farther south in the coastal city of Lukang .  
Fish noodles are a special type of noodle particular to China 's southeast coastal region . They are made from four parts cornstarch and six parts eel , drum , and other high-grade fish . The mass is then rolled , pressed , cut , and dried in the sun .  
The head of the team , Wang Chao-yi , points out that the high quality pebbles found underground in the Kuanyin alluvial plain have been disastrous as idle farmland has drawn illegal gravel mining , and the gravel pits have then been used as landfills , leaving behind a ravaged landscape . Since 1994 , residents of Paochang Village in Kuanyin Rural Township have been trying to protect the environment by blocking off coastal roads to gravel and garbage trucks . Unfortunately , new problems keep cropping up .  
In the same way , the demand for seafood increased when Taiwan 's economy took off . Taking advantage of this favorable situation , aquaculture began sprouting up on the west coast . At one point , coastal counties were waterlogged with fully 58,000 hectares of fish farms , causing massive erosion problems . With the widespread smuggling of seafood from the PRC in recent years , aquacultural land in Taiwan has dropped to 40,000 hectares as fisheries have shifted operations to mainland China .  
Here at the other end of the Earth in Taiwan , the wise words written in the Bible 2000 years ago are borne out : on Linshan Point , a windswept promontory jutting out into the sea from Taiwan 's north coast , between the sandy beach and the rock face there grows a carpet of tough coastal plants , including a scattering of short-stemmed flowers .  
At a symposium on the control of environmental hormones held in April , Professor Liu Li-lian , director of the Institute of Marine Biology at National Sun Yat-sen University in Kaohsiung , described the results of a coastal survey in southern Taiwan . The natural ratio of males to females in oyster drills is about one to one , " so when I noticed that the Thais clavigera we were catching had all turned male , I knew something was wrong , " said Liu with alarm .  
On some tours , as well as birdwatching and learning about coastal plants , tourists also ride out to the tidal zones to see how oysters are raised and collected . At low tide , they enjoy the sight of crabs digging their holes , and visit ponds where hard clams are grown . Later , as the tide rises , they return to the shore to enjoy magnificent views of the sea over the now-submerged oyster beds .  
The first typhoon to strike Taiwan this year , Typhoon Mindulle , swept in from the southwest at the start of July , bringing with it torrential rains and powerful winds and causing massive landslides and coastal flooding . Once again , having been through the disasters of the 921 earthquake of 1999 and 2001 ' s Typhoons Toraji and Nari , the people of central Taiwan faced the hardship of losing livelihoods and loved ones .

A : The cross-strait industrial relationship has been complementary for the past 20 years , but now economic development in the mainland is gradually bringing us into competition with one another . This is true of our ports , as well . Once completed , the mainland 's southeast coastal ports will represent a real challenge to their counterparts in Taiwan .  
An approach to marine pollution prevention " , GESAMP Report and Studies , No . 30 , 1986 .  Heavy trawls may be considered " green " on deep muddy grounds but " red " in shallow estuaries and coastal zones or coral reefs .  
As part of the effort to expand the production base for trade , island developing countries need to strengthen regional capabilities for the effective surveillance and monitoring of marine and coastal resources and activities in the exclusive economic zones .  
Such cooperation was aimed at preserving the marine environment and living resources , disposing of toxic wastes , developing coastal infrastructure and taking joint action to promote sustainable development in border areas .  The meeting rose at 5.40 p.m .  
It would call upon States to take measures to ensure that no fishing vessels entitled to fly their flags fish in areas under the national jurisdiction of other States unless duly authorized by the competent authorities of the coastal State or States concerned , such authorized fishing operations being carried out in accordance with the conditions set out in the authorization .  
Furthermore , other recent endeavours , including the 1995 Agreement on straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks and the work of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , reflect the determination of the international community to develop and strengthen the global legal order for the sustainable development of the living and non-living resources of marine and coastal waters .  
That institution will be responsible for studying data and other forms of information presented by coastal States regarding the outer limits of the continental shelf when the shelf extends beyond nautical 200 miles and for giving scientific and technical advice to States in preparation of this data when such assistance is requested .  
New Zealand welcomes the strengthened commitment that coastal States and States fishing on the high seas have made reflected in the provisions of the Convention to improve the status of essential fisheries resources , both through agreed conservation measures for high-seas areas and through the exercise by coastal States of responsible management of the sovereign resources within their exclusive economic zones .  
Nuclear tests pose a potential risk to the health and security of the people of coastal States and to their natural resources and environment , contrary to the precautionary principle on international environmental law contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development , the Convention on Biological Diversity , the United Nations Framework Convention on Climatic Change , the Treaty of Maastricht and other international instruments .  
Many species , such as migratory species , species dependent on the timing of ice-melting , Arctic communities , marine , coastal and peripheral populations , genetically impoverished species , mountain and alpine communities , and species that inhabit dry lands , semi-arid and arid ecosystems , are all likely to be adversely affected by global warming ; the climatic changes predicted may bring about catastrophic losses in genetic resources and species and ecosystem diversity .  
The breadth of an adjacent area of the high seas , measured from the outer boundary of an economic zone , shall be determined , up to a maximum of 70 nautical miles , on the basis of the best available scientific data by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or by agreement between the coastal and other States concerned .  
Activities planned for 1996-1997 are expected to result in ( a ) a knowledge base upon which management strategies and plans can be formulated and implementation initiated to ensure the protection and sustainable development of marine and coastal areas ; and ( b ) establishment of mechanisms and policy options for the development of environmental protection and sustainable management and plans .  
Field projects . ( i ) Establishment of four port reception facilities in the Mediterranean ; ( ii ) two field projects on the assessment of threats to marine mammals ; ( iii ) one marine biodiversity assessment ; ( iv ) strengthening of four institutional arrangements for integrated coastal zone planning and management ; and ( v ) 10 projects to assist Mediterranean countries to set up their legislation concerning specially protected areas .  
Within the project on " Coastal Marine Pollution Monitoring and Training : Asia Pacific Mussel Watch " , UNU is seeking to analyse and monitor key hazardous chemicals and substances in the coastal marine areas of the Asia-Pacific region , including relative levels of important agricultural and industrial halogenated hydrocarbons in the eastern Pacific .  
While poverty results in certain kinds of environmental stress , the major cause of the continued deterioration of the global environment is the unsustainable pattern of consumption and production , particularly in industrialized countries , which is a matter of grave concern , aggravating poverty and imbalances .  Rising sealevels as a result of global warming cause a grave and immediate threat to people living in island countries and coastal areas .  
Building upon earlier activities and based on qualitative and quantitative assessments of the coastal and marine pollution loads from land-based sources in the eastern African subregion , including the Comoros and Seychelles , the planned development of a regional overview and strategy will lead to the implementation of various additional activities , such as monitoring programmes .

The Sustainable Dar es Salaam Project ( SDP ) supports the City Council in developing sustainable solutions to priority environmental issues such as solid waste , servicing urban land , air quality , surface water , coastal area resources , recreational and tourism resources and urban agricultural production .  
The General Assembly has proclaimed 1998 to be the International Year of the Ocean . 158 / This initiative is expected to generate important cooperative efforts in the United Nations system 159 / and stimulate greater global awareness of the oceans and greater cooperation for the effective protection and management of marine and coastal areas and resources . 
Australia was a founding member of the International Coral Reef Initiative whose aims included promoting education programmes , improved coastal management and coordinated research and monitoring at the global , regional and national levels to ensure that coral reef resources were managed in a sustainable fashion .  
Calls upon States to take the responsibility , consistent with their obligations under international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and resolution 49 / 116 , to take measures to ensure that no fishing vessels entitled to fly their national flags fish in areas under the national jurisdiction of other States unless duly authorized by the competent authorities of the coastal State or States concerned ; such authorized fishing operations should be carried out in accordance with the conditions set out in the authorization ;  
In many cases , the unrestricted use of technology , the growing demand for goods and services from the ocean , uncontrolled population growth and continuous migration to coastal areas have led to the depletion of living resources and the degradation of the coastal and marine environment as well as of the economic conditions of some of the major sectors exploiting the ocean .  
Chapter 17 of Agenda 21 called for governmental action , with the assistance of the specialized agencies of the United Nations system when required and with the active participation of the people and sectors involved and that of the non-governmental organizations , in order to : ( a ) improve the use and conservation of coastal resources through integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas , including exclusive economic zones ( programme area A ) ; ( b ) increase marine environmental protection from land-based and sea-based sources of pollution  
Oceans and coastal areas are a finite economic asset yet to be fully understood by Governments , as is also the consequent need for their prudent and rational exploitation , and given commensurable priority in national development plans ;  
It will provide the basis for national and international action to reduce pollution of the oceans from land-based activities , contributing , inter alia , to : ( i ) improvement of coastal habitats and productivity ; ( ii ) reduction of threats to food security and safety ; ( iii ) reduction of hazards to human health ; and ( iv ) increased control over coastal activities to stop and reverse the process of alteration of the coastal zone .  
Protection of the atmosphere , in regard to : ( i ) absorption of greenhouse gases ; ( ii ) climate change and its potentially drastic effects on marine living resources ; ( iii ) energy optimization programmes and reduction of dangerous substances in exhaust gas emissions ; and ( iv ) reduction in the use of chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) in at-sea and coastal ocean industries ; ( g ) Chapter 10 .  
Calling the attention of the international community to the role of oceans and coastal areas as a major governing force of the planetary ecosystem , as well as a determining factor of human life , recommend that greater priority be accorded at national , regional and international levels to the action set out in chapter 17 of Agenda 21 ;  
Recognizing further the progress made during the post-UNCED process in developing international and regional standards and action plans relevant to the protection and management of coastal and marine environments and to the sustainable use and conservation of its resources , recommend that Governments : ( i ) continue to use existing mechanisms and forums to foster further progress ; ( ii ) actively participate in regional action plans , programmes and other cooperative arrangements ; and ( iii ) take advantage of international collaboration , particularly in the area of financing ;  
National , subnational and local policies and development plans must be carefully re-examined to ensure optimal land use and geographically better balanced economic development , including the protection of indispensable agricultural land ; land that sustains biodiversity , water quality and groundwater recharge ; fragile areas , including coastal areas ; and other sensitive areas in need of protection . 83 bis .  
The Working Group also stressed the need for increased support for training and capacity-building in the field of integrated management of coastal areas , and stressed the need for taking action to protect all critical habitats of marine living resources in the coastal zone , including coral reefs , mangroves , mudflats and estuaries .  
It also asked Governments and agencies of the United Nations system to promote programmes for guiding management and corrective actions to control pollution in the larger coastal urban settlements , specifically in the treatment of sewage and waste disposal , both domestic and industrial , as well as to control pollution in river systems caused by mining industries .  
Urge concerned Governments , United Nations agencies and organizations , multilateral development banks , donor institutions , local communities , non-governmental organizations , the private sector and the scientific community to support the implementation of the ICRI Framework for Action , launching local or national coral reef initiatives as part of their plans for coastal integrated development and management ;  
In cases where the continental margin extends beyond 200 nautical miles , the coastal State , if it meets specific technical criteria , can establish the outer limits of the legal " continental shelf " up to 350 nautical miles from the baselines , or up to 100 nautical miles seaward of the 2,500-metre isobath , whichever is further seaward .  
The limits to be defined in the submission from a coastal State with a continental shelf that extends beyond 200 nautical miles are to be based on distances measured with respect to " the foot of the continental slope " near the edge of the submerged prolongation of its land mass .  
In the course of examination of the coastal State 's submission , the Commission will have to analyse a large volume of complex geodetic , bathymetric , seismic and possibly other geophysical data in order to verify that the geological and geomorphological conditions support the coastal State 's submission .  
The Commission must be mindful of existing or potential offshore boundary disputes between opposite or adjacent coastal States and the proviso in article 76 ( 10 ) of the Convention , which states that " [ t ] he provisions of this article are without prejudice to the question of delimitation of the continental shelf between States with opposite or adjacent coasts " .  
It would be preferable at this first submission stage for the coastal State to present in its package summary A4 maps 14 / indicating the approximate limits of its continental shelf , its territorial sea baselines , the general manner by which the limits were defined and any potential areas of disagreement with other States .  
Population density , availability of key natural resources , per capita income and urban and agricultural conditions differ between the crowded coastal plain and the less densely populated West Bank .  
Furthermore , international law permits the coastal State to conduct only marine scientific research in its exclusive economic zone , not " any kind of research " , as stated in article 14 , subparagraph ( b ) ( ii ) , of the aforementioned Iranian Act .  
The limited information obtained from national sources shows that a number of small island developing States have begun to implement parts of the Programme of Action that have especially high priority at the national level , including institution-building , particularly the strengthening of legislative frameworks ; waste management ; coastal area management ; and to a lesser extent , the preservation of biodiversity .  
A primary responsibility of the regional commissions is to provide advisory services and to strengthen regional networks by which Member States may exchange experience and information , and harmonize national economic , social , environmental and settlement policies and strategies - in particular those that have a critical cross-border impact on , inter alia , migration , shared coastal zones , river basins and ecosystems , watersheds , and pollution and waste management .  
As reported at the consultation of the whole , on 18 September 1996 , at approximately 0200 hours local time , a 350-ton , 106-foot military submarine was found about 100 feet offshore , grounded in shallow water near the coastal city of Kangnung , one of the major ports on the eastern coast of the Republic of Korea .  
Moreover , it was based on several recognized criteria , among them the drawing of a baseline in a way not to depart to any appreciable extent , from the direction of the coast , and also the coastal State 's right to consider the economic interests peculiar to the region concerned , the reality and importance of which are clearly evidenced by long usage . 
The coastal State may , pursuant to article 211 ( 6 ) , under the conditions stipulated therein , adopt special mandatory laws and regulations for the prevention , reduction and control of marine pollution in a clearly defined area in its exclusive economic zone where such special laws and regulations are required for recognized technical reasons in relation to its oceanography , ecology , resource use and maritime traffic conditions .  
According to Indonesia , the proposed axis lines are the result of years of careful study of various factors , such as : the need of international transportation and aviation in transiting Indonesian waters ; the hydrographic and natural marine conditions in and near the relevant axis lines ; the intensity of coastal and inter-island navigation and overflight ; the intensity of fishing activities , particularly of local artisanal fishermen ; the existence of oil and gas exploration and exploitation ;  
Furthermore , there was general agreement that the incentives regarding commercial value , contained in some national salvage law , should not be included in the future instrument ; that warships should be excluded from the scope of application of the instrument ; that an approach based on flag State jurisdiction , and port State jurisdiction , supplemented by existing coastal State jurisdiction , was the more acceptable solution for enforcement ;  
Among other actions , the Subcommittee agreed that the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities would be considered as the cooperative programme framework for programme areas A ( integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas , including exclusive economic zones ) and B ( i ) ( marine environmental protection : land-based sources ) .  
It endorsed the Secretary-General 's initiative to convene a Special Consultative Meeting of entities involved with the carriage of materials subject to the 1993 INF Code and the coastal States concerned for the purpose of sharing information , concerns and ideas and to gain a better understanding of the safety and environmental aspects involved .  
The group of experts on marine and coastal biodiversity , established pursuant to decision II / 10 of the Second Conference of Parties , has not been able to meet as planned ; however , the first step has been achieved in drawing up a roster of nominated experts from which the group will be composed .  
SBSTTA has recommended that this expert group should concentrate on determining the following areas where the Biodiversity Convention can have the greatest effect : integrated marine and coastal area management , marine and coastal protected areas , sustainable use of coastal and marine living resources , mariculture and alien species . 193 Other items of particular note discussed by SBSTTA included the economic valuation of biological diversity and its components , in particular in relation to access to genetic resources ( art . 15 of the Convention ) .  
Calls upon States to take the responsibility , consistent with their obligations under international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and resolution 49 / 116 , to take measures to ensure that no fishing vessels entitled to fly their national flags fish in areas under the national jurisdiction of other States unless duly authorized by the competent authorities of the coastal State or States concerned ; such authorized fishing operations should be carried out in accordance with the conditions set out in the authorization ;  
Viet Nam will continue its consistent policy of settling disputes through negotiation in the spirit of equality , mutual respect and understanding , with due respect to international law , particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , and to the sovereign rights and jurisdiction of coastal States over their respective continental shelves and exclusive economic zones .  
The 1982 Convention , although the most universal and extensive instrument on the law of the sea , nevertheless can not fully reflect the growing concern of coastal States at the state of living marine resources , which often fall victim to uncontrolled and scientifically unsound harvesting on the high seas .  
the three topics mentioned in paragraph 249 of the Commission 's report - diplomatic protection ; ownership of wrecks ; and unilateral acts of States - should be topics of study , although he did not agree with the views outlined in note 9 of addendum 2 of the annexes , since the jurisdiction of the coastal State beyond its territorial sea and contiguous zone was guaranteed by the residual competence granted to it under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea .  
Barbados is improving living conditions by revitalizing the main town centres , developing systems of physical planning and coastal management , and promoting public-private partnerships , disposing of waste and extending water resources .  
For many of today 's major environment and development concerns , the sciences ( including the social and human sciences ) are essential in detecting and analysing the problem , in identifying solutions and in ensuring scientifically sound action .  This has been particularly evident for the ozone depletion issue , and increasingly also for other issues such as climate change , erosion of biological diversity and water and coastal pollution .  
A number of important initiatives have been launched to develop high-level scientific capacities in developing countries ( with particular reference to the least developed countries ) so as to enable these countries to address local problems and to participate fully in regional and international activities related to important issues such as sustainable water and coastal zone management , global change and the conservation and sustainable utilization of biodiversity .  
For instance , there is need to identify ecologically endangered areas where overexploitation of natural resources and rapid population growth create serious problems : forested uplands , coastal fishing areas , small-holder agriculture in lowland areas , arid grazing lands and tropical forests .  
Priority research5 should focus on : coastal areas where populations are growing rapidly and critical resources are being depleted at an accelerated rate , such as on highly urbanized coasts ; soil erosion and desertification , linked with inappropriate land-use practices often brought on by migration patterns ; water scarcity , and misuse and pollution of water resources in both rural and urban areas ; and deforestation resulting from inappropriate shifting cultivation patterns , fuelwood demands , and conversion of forests in upland areas to other uses , linked with demographic pressures among the poorest groups in society .  
Furthermore , they have established programmes to develop the principles of the CBD and facilitate their implementation : on coastal and marine biodiversity ; forest biodiversity ; agricultural biodiversity ; the biodiversity of inland waters ; the rights of indigenous and local communities under the CBD ; and the equitable sharing of the benefits of biodiversity .  
In particular , Parties have through the CBD been actively pursuing a strategy of establishing the legal basis to ensure the integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas , including exclusive economic zones ( programme area A ) and sustainable use and conservation of marine living resources under national jurisdiction ( programme area D ) .  
Recognizing the respect for the environment accorded by the cultures of indigenous peoples of the Americas , and considering the special relationship between the indigenous peoples and the environment , lands , resources and territories on which they live and their natural resources .  Recognizing that in many indigenous cultures , traditional collective systems for control and use of land and territory and resources , including bodies of water and coastal areas , are a necessary condition for their survival , social organization , development and their individual and collective well-being . . .  
Urge all SAARC countries to preserve rare , fragile , ecologically sensitive coastal and marine ecosystems , such as mangroves , coral reefs , sea-grass beds , etc . , for conservation and sustainable use of the resources under national jurisdiction .  
Continuing the international dialogue on the issues of conservation and sustainable use of coastal and marine biodiversity and agricultural biological diversity was also very important , since both issues were essential to food security , which was the focus of the forthcoming World Food Summit ; the work being undertaken by the Intergovernmental Panel on forests was likewise crucial to that discussion .  
In view of the above-mentioned points , my Government considers paragraph 1 of the joint statement signed by the Presidents of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan relating to " the delimitation of administrative and territorial borders along a line running through the middle of the Sea " as a step in violation of the existing legal regime and declares that it bears no legal value and shall not affect , directly or indirectly , the existing legal regime and any future agreement that may be concluded among the five coastal States .  
There is a need for concerted action by all countries and for improved cooperation to assist developing countries in implementing the relevant agreements and instruments in order that they may participate effectively in the sustainable use , conservation and management of their fishery resources , as provided for in the Convention and other international legal instruments , and achieve integrated coastal zone management .  
The coastal State is also given the exclusive right to construct and to authorize and regulate the construction , operation and use of artificial islands.a * The legal status of offshore installations , the legislation applicable to workers thereon , the type of jurisdiction exercised by States over such installations and the possible obligations arising from licensing of the installation for the purposes of exploration and exploitation continue to be of concern to ILO , and work begun on this subject has not yet been completed . 
Thus , the degree to which coastal States can enforce IMO regulations in respect of foreign ships in innocent passage in their territorial waters or navigating the exclusive economic zone is a subject matter to be established by national law drafted in accordance with the provisions of UNCLOS .  
The Republic of Korea reported that it had taken measures to ensure that no vessels entitled to fly its flag were engaged in fishing in areas under the jurisdiction of other States , unless duly authorized by the competent authorities of the coastal State concerned .  
Earth observation of coastal regions were still in a pre-operational stage , key constraints being the lack of continuously operational Ocean Colour Sensors , lack of appropriate algorithms with local and timely calibration , low frequency of measurements , difficult access to data , unfriendly integration scheme with other data sources and poor information dissemination .  
Its major commercial applications included coastal zone and environmental monitoring , marine navigation , offshore oil and gas operation , natural disaster mitigation and coastal and deep ocean fishing .  
Barbados is improving living conditions by revitalizing the main town centres , developing systems of physical planning and coastal management , and promoting partnerships between the public and private sector , disposing of waste and extending water resources .  
In this regard , it should be emphasized that the Jakarta Mandate covering the following areas : integrated marine and coastal area management ; marine and coastal protected areas ; sustainable use of marine and coastal living resources ; and mariculture and alien species called , inter alia , for the effective implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity concerning marine and coastal biodiversity questions .  
Article 76 of the Convention requires that information on the limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured shall be submitted by the coastal State to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf set up under annex II on the basis of equitable geographical representation .  
Across all small island developing States , however , a major area of concern will continue to be the impact of climate change and sea level rise on coastal areas , and the consequent need for costly remedial and protective measures .  
But the individual and collective efforts of small island developing States have so far made little or no real impact on the magnitude of the problems facing them , including the more frequent occurrence of hurricanes , storm surges and coastal inundation , and the resulting loss of valuable economic resources and marine biodiversity stocks .  
Evidence is strong that most of the increase is attributable to human activity , in particular , to fossil fuel combustion . 8 Continuation of these emission trends poses serious , though uncertain , risks of global and regional climate change , leading to unpredictable rises in sea level , inundation of low-lying coastal areas , migration of ecosystems and disruption of agriculture .  
Calls upon States to take the responsibility , consistent with their obligations under international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea2 and resolution 49 / 116 , to take measures to ensure that no fishing vessels entitled to fly their national flags fish in areas under the national jurisdiction of other States unless duly authorized by the competent authorities of the coastal State or States concerned ; such authorized fishing operations should be carried out in accordance with the conditions set out in the authorization ;  
The main issues that have emerged during SBSTTA sessions have been detailed technical issues , such as how to promote access to and transfer of technology , the development of monitoring systems and assessments , and issues dealing with agricultural , terrestrial , marine and coastal biodiversity and traditional knowledge .  
While legal and institutional instruments have definitely improved the basis for sustainable development of oceans and coastal areas , implementation lags behind owing , among other things , to ( a ) the difficulty in making political decisions regarding resources and wealth allocation ; ( b ) the difficulty of improving inadequate or inefficient institutions ; and ( c ) in many cases , difficulties in meeting the related financial commitments .  
Dependence on aquaculture ( mainly inland ) for an important part of future net increases in fish consumption will require improved management of freshwater resources , protection of aquaculture sites from industrial and urban pollution , as well as protection of coastal areas , wetlands and mangrove swamps from irresponsible coastal aquaculture practices .  
Noting that El Ni �� has a recurring character and has produced disastrous effects , resulting in large material , economic , human and environmental losses , with particular impact in the coastal countries of the Pacific Ocean , especially in developing countries ,  
Additional views expressed were that the rules should address the issue of whether a member of the Commission who was a national of a coastal State making a submission could not serve in the subcommission considering that State 's submission while another member of the Commission who was a national of an adjacent or opposite State served in the subcommission ; that the Commission , being an independent body , might wish to consider the potential usefulness of drawing upon outside expertise ; however , the latter view was not shared by others .  
There is a need for concerted action by all countries and for improved cooperation to assist developing countries in implementing the relevant agreements and instruments in order that they may participate effectively in the sustainable use , conservation and management of their fishery resources , as provided for in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and other international legal instruments , and achieve integrated coastal zone management . 
We also recognized that the problems of the environment , such as global warming , the destruction of coastal and marine ecosystems , the degradation of forests , desertification and the overuse of mineral resources are concerns not of any one nation or continent , but of the entire international community .  
The charts and relevant information , including geodetic data , describing the outer limits of the continental shelf , which are deposited by the coastal State with the Secretary-General and which are to be given due publicity by the Secretary-General in accordance with article 76 , paragraph 9 , of the Convention , shall cease to be classified as confidential , if they had been so classified earlier , upon their receipt by the Secretary-General .  
Promote and co-operate in providing the necessary financial and technological resources for the sustainable management , conservation and enhancement , as appropriate , of sinks and reservoirs of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol , including biomass , forests and oceans as well as other terrestrial , coastal and marine ecosystems .  
The effects of global warming are of grave concern to small islands like ours , whose coastal areas may become submerged , and whose protective coral reefs are at risk of total destruction .  
We equally recognize that sustainable development in coastal areas is dependent upon an adequate understanding of the interaction between natural assets and social and human capital .  
Noting that El Nino has a recurring character and has produced disastrous effects , resulting in large material , economic , human and environmental losses , with particular impact in the coastal countries of the Pacific Ocean , especially in developing countries ,  
Confidential material so classified by the coastal State shall remain confidential after consideration of the submission is concluded unless decided otherwise by the Commission with the written consent of the coastal State concerned .  
The Commission will also consider as admissible evidence , synthetic bathymetric data derived from cartographic and analog sources officially recognized by the coastal State .  
Article 76 , paragraph 7 , states that " the coastal State shall delineate the outer limits of its continental shelf . . . by straight lines not exceeding 60 nautical miles in length , connecting fixed points . . . " .  
In the Caribbean , in collaboration with selected regional institutions , OAS is currently providing technical assistance for the execution of three major projects : assessment of coastal and marine problems ; assessment of the current state of effluent disposal in the region ; and comprehensive review of integrated coastal zone management legislative systems .  
Since sectoral approaches to coastal development have not proven effective in arresting its deterioration , the concept of integrated coastal area management ( ICAM ) has gained recognition in recent years as a comprehensive , ecosystem-based approach to sustainable development and environmental conservation .  
The Coastal Module Panel of GOOS has begun the design of optimal monitoring and forecasting systems for coastal seas , focusing on preserving healthy coastal environments , promoting sustainable use of resources , mitigating coastal hazards , and enabling safe and efficient marine operations .  
Such a situation would create additional pressure on developing countries , including small island developing States , to meet their growing domestic demand for fish as food on the one hand a problem likely to be aggravated by declining productivity of coastal fisheries due to coral reef degradation , as previously discussed and to increase their share of international markets on the other .  
The Global Programme of Action states at the outset that its implementation will require new approaches by and new forms of collaboration among Governments , organizations and institutions with responsibilities and expertise relevant to marine and coastal areas , at all levels national , regional and global including the promotion of innovative financial mechanisms to generate needed resources .  
The disposal of untreated effluents into surrounding areas of land and sea often leads to the pollution of scarce inland freshwater resources , loss of valuable marine life , destruction of coral reefs and the silting and erosion of coastal beaches .  
There was considerable emphasis on the need for improved scientific understanding of the marine environment as a fundamental basis for sound decision-making , improved human well-being and prevention of environmental degradation including in coastal areas .  
In discussing integrated coastal zone management , participants agreed that there were real biophysical limits to capacity in any particular location as well as cultural limits that should be determined at the local level by the local community .  
Participants agreed that the Commission on Sustainable Development should facilitate funding from international agencies such as the World Bank and from national Governments for integrated environmental , social and economic research on best management practices in regard to design , development and management of tourism projects in coastal regions .  
To create the appropriate institutional , legal , economic , social and environmental framework by developing and applying a mix of instruments , as appropriate , such as integrated land-use planning and coastal zone management , economic instruments , social and environmental impact assessment for tourist facilities , including gender aspects , and voluntary initiatives and agreements ;  
Invites relevant agencies , particularly the International Maritime Organization , to evaluate whether existing regulations on marine pollution and compliance with them are sufficient to provide adequate protection to fragile coastal zones from adverse impacts as a result of tourist vessel activities ;  
The Commission invited all organizations concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider whether their programmes of work provided sufficient consideration of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review what needed to be done to ensure adequate prediction and understanding of the impacts on coastal and marine areas of phenomena such as El Nio .  
Promoting the formulation , adoption and implementation of appropriate technical , institutional , administrative and legal measures contributing to improved protection of marine and coastal environment , including the rational use and conservation of their resources .  
Invited all intergovernmental agencies concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider , within their respective mandates , whether their programmes of work make sufficient allowance for considerations of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review through the various coordination arrangements what more needs to be done to ensure adequate understanding of the prediction of coastal and marine impacts of such phenomena as El Nio .  
Technological and human-induced ecological hazards , such as accidental releases of chemicals in surface water catchments , dumping of toxic and radioactive materials in coastal zones or on the high seas , and hydrological and climatic problems created by excessive withdrawals from large water bodies etc . add to or complicate problems related to natural hazards , particularly in CIS countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia . 
Satellite data are used operationally to lessen the impact of natural disasters such as tropical cyclones , flash floods , heavy snowstorms , volcanic ash clouds , sea ice , toxic effects on coastal waters and harmful algal blooms .  
Strengthening of national capacity for the development of a methodology or guidelines for sound practices and techniques suitable for small island developing States , for achieving the integrated management and sustainable development of the coastal and marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , building on existing experience in that area ;  
Greater regional coordination in management and monitoring , control and surveillance , including vessel monitoring systems and enforcement , consistent with international agreements of coastal countries and fishing countries in the marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , including the management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks ;  
No doubt the shared use of facilities increases the legal and jurisdictional complexities of project financing , but increasing experience on how to tackle ownership issues has been gained through international water-sharing projects . 47 Also , the private financing of multi-country infrastructure projects creates complementary interests between landlocked and coastal countries as transit infrastructure directly generates foreign exchange . 
The continental shelf of a coastal State comprises the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin , or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend up to that distance .  
The coastal State shall delineate the outer limits of its continental shelf , where that shelf extends beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured , by straight lines not exceeding 60 nautical miles in length , connecting fixed points , defined by coordinates of latitude and longitude .  
Information on the limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured shall be submitted by the coastal State to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf set up under Annex II on the basis of equitable geographical representation .  
The limits of the shelf established by a coastal State on the basis of these recommendations shall be final and binding .  9 .  The coastal State shall deposit with the Secretary-General of the United Nations charts and relevant information , including geodetic data , permanently describing the outer limits of its continental shelf .  
GOOS aims to meet the need for : ( a ) forecasting climate variability and change ; ( b ) assessing the state of health of the marine environment and its resources ( including the coastal zone ) ; and ( c ) supporting an improved decision-making and management process which takes into account potential natural and man-made changes in the environment and their effects on human health and resources .  
The Caribbean region and sea possessed a number of unique features which justified according them priority attention : exceptional biological diversity , highly fragile ecosystems and heavy reliance by most of the countries of the region on the coastal land and marine environment in order to achieve sustainable development .  
This hurricane is unusual not only for its lateness and ferocious winds , but also because it spreads its force selectively and has caused sea level rise and huge , mountainous waves that have completely destroyed the coastal area in my country and others , where the population is concentrated . 
As you said , Sir , a very great tragedy has occurred in Venezuela as a result because of the persistent rains that have fallen throughout the year in the central part of the country , which , on 16 December , led to massive flooding and mudslides in the central mountain range , affecting densely populated regions , particularly the central coastal regions near the capital city and where the country ' s main airport and port are located .  
Strengthening of national capacity for the development of a methodology or guidelines for sound practices and techniques suitable for small island developing States , for achieving the integrated management and sustainable development of the coastal and marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , building on existing experience in that area ;  
Greater regional coordination in management and monitoring , control and surveillance , including vessel monitoring systems and enforcement , consistent with international agreements of coastal countries and fishing countries in the marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , including the management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks ;  
Indeed , the issues of climate change , soil erosion , global warming , sea level rise , coastal and marine resources , natural and environmental disasters , biodiversity resources , waste management and freshwater resources are among those that all developing countries face , in particular small island nations , in an increasingly competitive global economy .  
Invites all intergovernmental agencies concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider , within their respective mandates , whether their programmes of work make sufficient allowance for considerations of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review through the various coordination arrangements what more needs to be done to ensure adequate understanding of the prediction and coastal and marine impacts of such phenomena as the El Nio phenomenon .  
Governments at all levels , the private sector and other major groups as defined in Agenda 21 are urged to cooperate in developing waste collection systems and disposal facilities , and developing programmes for prevention , minimization and recycling of waste , to safeguard and improve the quality of life in human settlements and coastal regions in all countries , especially in developing countries .  
To create the appropriate institutional , legal , economic , social and environmental framework by developing and applying a mix of instruments , as appropriate , such as integrated land-use planning and coastal zone management , economic instruments , social and environmental impact assessment for tourist facilities , including gender aspects , and voluntary initiatives and agreements ;  
The Commission invites relevant agencies , particularly the International Maritime Organization , to evaluate whether existing regulations on marine pollution and compliance with them are sufficient to provide adequate protection to fragile coastal zones from adverse impacts as a result of tourist vessel activities .  
The disposal of untreated effluents into surrounding areas of land and sea often leads to the pollution of scarce inland freshwater resources , loss of valuable marine life , destruction of coral reefs and the silting and erosion of coastal beaches .  
In discussing integrated coastal zone management , participants agreed that there were real biophysical limits to capacity in any particular location as well as cultural limits that should be determined at the local level by the local community .  
Participants agreed that the Commission on Sustainable Development should facilitate funding from international agencies such as the World Bank and from national Governments for integrated environmental , social and economic research on best management practices in regard to design , development and management of tourism projects in coastal regions .  
There was considerable emphasis on the need for improved scientific understanding of the marine environment as a fundamental basis for sound decision-making , improved human well-being and prevention of environmental degradation including in coastal areas .  
In terms of programme areas covered by both bilateral and multilateral commitments , those that received larger shares were human resource development , transport and communication , freshwater resources , land resources , coastal and marine resources , and energy resources .  
In the light of the immense potential of space remote sensing in providing vital input for soil conservation , water resources , management , forest monitoring , land management , coastal and river basin protection , agriculture and drought management , and flood mapping and sustainable integrated development , action must be initiated to promote intensive cooperation among various countries within the region to enable them to benefit from each others expertise .  
The first instance of the illegal entry of dangerous waste reported by the Brazilian authorities is that of four containers holding 68 , 332 kg of toxic wastes ( copper , zinc and other heavy metals ) which arrived in the coastal port of Santos ( State of So Paulo ) in December 1993 .  
Where untreated effluents are disposed into surrounding areas of land and sea , the result often is the pollution of scarce inland freshwater resources , the loss of valuable marine life , the destruction of coral reefs and the silting and erosion of coastal beaches .  
The inundation of coastal areas can result in : ( a ) loss of agricultural land , a common concern because agriculture is still the primary source of income in many small island developing States , and most agricultural land lies along the coastline , increasing its vulnerability to sea level rise ; ( b ) loss of exclusive economic zone ( EEZ ) , a common concern because sea level rise will also reduce the exclusive economic zone , thereby reducing the resource base .  
Pollution of marine and coastal areas from land-based sources of pollution is a major issue for small island developing States ; the pollution is largely from domestic sewage , industrial effluents and agricultural run-off ; in a few larger islands ( for example , Jamaica and some Melanesian countries ) , pollution from mining effluent is also a cause for concern ;  
At the regional level , ongoing activities conducive to the sustainable management of coastal and marine resources include training of personnel , acquisition of equipment and facilities , production of stock assessment data and other resource inventories , upgrading of skills for management of marine parks , studies on pollution , information exchange and sharing of experience from within and outside the regions , and production of ICAM plans using regional guidelines .  
Small island developing States also have been the recipients of formal and informal training efforts to improve their capacity to implement sustainable coastal and marine resource management from regional and international institutions .  
Most efforts on integrated coastal area management , though technically innovative and successful in various cases , have evolved at the local level , leaving them isolated from the mainstream of national development planning ; furthermore , such efforts have not attracted substantial funding , making the initiatives less effective than they could be ;  
Building adequate manpower with the requisite level of skill for effective integrated island management ; small island developing States should assess their training needs and develop a training programme , involving the private sector , non-governmental organizations and Governments ; training should not be limited to technical experts ; it should include local communities , for example , fishermen , tourist hotel operators , managers of industries located in coastal regions and farmers ;  
Specialized institutions devoted to specific sectors should be established and provided with adequate staff and budgetary resources for their operations ; such institutions are required particularly to deal with major resource conservation issues , such as those involving fisheries , coastal zones and biodiversity ;  
The present section summarizes , by region and by sea , the main priorities and challenges , developments in decision-making , and activities at the national level to promote integrated coastal zone management , marine environment protection , and sustainable use and conservation of marine living resources .  
Among the main concerns in the region are unsustainable exploitation and environmental degradation of those natural resources on which rural communities depend ; optimized use of land ; living conditions of coastal people ; insufficiently treated urban wastes , oil pollution and coastal erosion .  
The major challenges of the region are to secure a healthy sea environment at a time when economic recovery is being pursued ; completion of effective regulatory and institutional frameworks , particularly for integrated coastal zone management and sustainable fisheries ; and enhancement of public awareness and cooperation between stakeholders .  
Losses in biodiversity and economic growth due to unplanned activities related to dredging , lack of clear property rights and control on natural resources , the low level of investments , and lack of participation in decision-making are conditions that have brought integrated coastal zone management onto the political agenda , and programmes are gradually being developed .  
In terms of coverage of programme areas at the global level by both bilateral and multilateral commitments , those that received large shares were human resources development , transport and communications , freshwater resources , land resources , coastal and marine resources and energy resources .  
For instance , problems of water supply in terms of both quantity and quality , environmentally sound management of solid and liquid wastes , adaptation to climate change and sea level rise , integrated management of coastal zones , prevention or minimization of natural and environmental disasters among others , all call for specific skills , without which small island developing States even with the highest level of political will can not hope to solve them .  
Without coordinated international efforts , illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing will severely undermine the economic base , food security and , above all , human security of coastal States , and in particular small island developing States .  
Those delegations expressed the view that such re-entry constituted a serious threat to human security and the economic activities of coastal States and threatened the marine environment and its natural resources .  
Noting the importance that the global meetings of regional seas conventions and action plans have taken as a consultative mechanism for the revitalization of Regional Seas Programme , including the strengthening of partnerships with international organizations dedicated to marine and coastal issues and the establishment of programmatic linkages with global environmental conventions and related agreements ,  
The basic consent provision is contained in article 246 , paragraphs 1 and 2 , whereby the coastal State in the exercise of its jurisdiction has the right to regulate , authorize and conduct marine scientific research in its exclusive economic zone and on its continental shelf in accordance with relevant provisions of the Convention .  
Recognizing that low-lying and other small island countries , countries with low-lying coastal , arid and semi-arid areas or areas liable to floods , drought and desertification , and developing countries with fragile mountainous ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change ,  
While some , particularly in the temperate latitudes , have reported positive impacts in agriculture , overall the impact of climate change is expected to be mixed , and to be largely negative in tropical , coastal and mountain areas . 
Climate change had , among other things , increased the scarcity and diminished the quality of fresh water and had contributed to the degradation of coastal zones and marine ecosystems in all CARICOM member countries , which therefore continued to seek the support of the United Nations for a special regime for the Caribbean Sea .  
The center of the typhoon is expected to continue moving northwest by north at the speed of about 20 kilometers per hour , possibly brushing the eastern coast of Zhejiang before heading north and entering the southern waters of the Yellow Sea during the daytime tomorrow .  Or it may hit the northern coastal areas of Zhejiang between tonight and early tomorrow morning .  
Influenced by the storm , from daytime to night today , it is still windy 6-8 degrees in the middle and northern part of the South Sea and and coastal area in Guangdong . It is downpour in the west of Guangdong , in the middle and and north of Guangxi , southern and western part of Hunan and most part of Guizhou . It is rainstorm in some places in western part of Guangdong , middle and western part of Guangxi , southern part of Hunan and eastern part of Guizhou .  
Up to now , 34 cities and counties in this province are listed as coastal open economy cities and counties , covering 44% of the whole province 's total area , among which , there are 7 national level development zones of various kinds and some provincial level economic development zones and provincial level agricultural development zones as well .  
From instituting the household contract responsibility system to the establishment of coastal special economic zones , from planned economy to socialist market economy , and from the initial stage of socialism to the idea of " benefiting three things " - - every one of this series of reforms drawing forward the overall situation is attributable to guidance by the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts .  
Third , it is necessary to speed up the pace of scientific and technological development by giving full play to the human resource and technology advantages in the eastern coastal areas , applying modern technologies to transform the traditional industries , developing high-tech and new technology industries , and establishing innovation mechanisms in the light of the laws that govern technological and economic development . 
In socialist construction , areas inhabited by minority nationalities in our country have scored achievements attracting worldwide attention .  Owing to the limitations of natural conditions and for historical reasons , however , there is still a certain gap between the minority-nationality regions and the more developed inland and eastern coastal areas in the levels of economic and cultural development .  
Xinjiang 's oil and cotton have initially become its advantages .  Fourth , the western region can absorb the valuable experience accumulated in the practice of foreign trade and economic cooperation in the coastal areas of the eastern region to constantly improve and develop its environment and conditions for foreign trade and economic cooperation and to speed up the formation of an opening-up economy , thus saving a lot of time and energy for opening up wider to the outside world and for developing its economy .  
Guizhou used to have a relatively weak industrial foundation ; thanks to the construction and readjustment of remote regions away from coastal areas over the past more than 30 years , a military industrial system has been established in Guizhou , with the three major bases of aviation , space flight , and electronics as its main body .  Today , these three major bases have become an important force in Guizhou 's economic development .  
It is true that in comparison with the coastal areas in the country 's eastern region , the western region has a relatively lower industrialization level and an irrational industrial structure on the whole , and its gap with the eastern region has been further widened ever since the beginning of reform and opening up ; however , the central cities in the western region , such as Xian , Chongqing , Chengdu , and Guiyang , as well as certain industries and trades still maintain each 's own relative advantages .  
at the same time , these development zones need to have more macroscopic guidance and assimilate the successful experience from the coastal development zones , so as to become the experimental plots and windows for the grand western development and opening up , and play the role of demonstration , radiation , and contribution in the business solicitation and foreign capital importation for the entire central and western regions .  
The publication and implementation of " the Provisions " indicate that China has advanced a big step in developing legal system governing public security and border patrol .  They have very important significance in demonstrating China 's efforts to strengthen the administration over vessels along the coasts , to prevent and crack down on marine crimes , and to safeguard social order along coastal regions and at sea .  
In particular , the eastern coastal areas should make efforts to establish the socialist market economy before other areas , realize the goal for the reform and development of the state-owned enterprises before other areas , complete the readjustment of the economic structure , and optimize and upgrade the industry before other areas , and realize basic agricultural modernization before other areas .  In short , they should work hard to realize modernization before other areas and make greater contribution to building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
In order to raise the strategizing competence of captains in the context of modern naval warfare , this detachment adjusted the content of training and took its vessel formation from yellow waters into blue waters , from training under general inshore conditions to rapid-reaction training under complex conditions in the coastal waters .  
Located in border and coastal areas , Dandong city has many chemical plants .  To step up preparations for military struggles and prevent sudden environmental pollution incidents , the Dandong city government and the army units stationed there gathered materials relevant to the urban unclear and chemical plants attacked during the Gulf War and Kosovo War and drew up a meticulous and thorough emergency plan .  
We must strengthen our efforts to cut off the supply of illegal drugs in Yunnan , Guangxi , and other border areas in China 's southwest , northwest , and northeast regions as well as in the southeast coastal region by increasing the use of scientific and technological equipment , intensifying investigation and arrests , firmly stopping the influx of illegal drugs , and strictly preventing the flow of precursor chemicals out of the restricted areas .  
Owing to various factors , such as historical and geographic conditions , most of our country 's key economic bases are distributed in economically developed coastal areas , areas with transport facilities , and large and medium-sized inland cities .  Thus , it will be easy for enemies to destroy in a concentrated manner our closely distributed economic bases .  
Judging from the craft 's own characteristics , they can be used for powerful surprise attacks in a short period from its good mobility , easy concealment nature , accurate firing power and strong antipersonnel force .  Therefore , Taiwan 's military considers those crafts as an important component part in fighting at coastal waters .  
Relevant military and civilian personnel generally think that frequent exercises not only have rigorously trained the front-support contingent participating in sea battles , but also have strengthened the military-government and military-people relationships in coastal regions and raised the national defense awareness of the masses in these regions .  
Ever since the time when peace and development were defined as the main theme of our time , a series of major strategic changes have been made in the principles that guide the work of the party , the state , and the army , for example , the formulation of a long-term objective of " three-step development " for the country 's modernization building ; the comprehensive establishment of coastal economic zones ; an all-positioned opening up in the country 's eastern , western , southern , , northern , and central regions ;  
However , as Sichuan is an interior province with a large population , a weak economic foundation , an unreasonable economic structure , and an uneven condition of regional development , it is still below the average level of the whole country 's economic growth , and still lags behind the coastal areas in the east .  
Therefore , the central and western regions can not simply copy the policies of the coastal regions if they are to achieve breakthroughs and greater development in attracting foreign investment .  They must take measures that are suited to the local conditions , give play to their own unique strengths , pioneer new ideas and new models , and adopt more active and effective measures to further open up to the outside .  
Mutual exchanges between Jinmen and Mazu on the one hand and Fujian 's coastal areas on another hand have been going on since a long time ago .  The so-called " mini three links " currently implemented by Taiwan authorities merely transformed such exchanges from " underground " to " the surface . "  Or just as what the Taiwan mass media pointed out , the measure would merely " decriminalize " the existing exchanges and does not have any realistic significance .  
It is necessary to speed up the development of central and western China and , at the same time , continue to let eastern coastal areas play a leading role in promoting structural renovation , scientific and technological innovation , the process of opening up to the outside world , and economic growth .  This is an important part of and a strategic step toward the readjustment of the economic structure .  
He said , international law applies to every country , and this US plane we are speaking of is not an ordinary plane but a military reconnaisance plane which entered China 's airspace without permission after colliding with and destroying a Chinese plane due to carrying out maneuvers contrary to regulations over China 's coastal waters , and landed at a Chinese military airfield .  
According to the principle of state responsibility stated in international law , the US Government must apologize to the Chinese Government and people , stop immediately all its reconnaissance activities along the coastal areas of China , actively cooperate with the Chinese Government to conduct a comprehensive and thorough investigation of this incident , and compensate in a rapid , complete , and effective manner for the personnel and property losses on the part of the Chinese side .  
In the China-US military aircraft collision accident that took place in the airspace over the coastal area of Hainan Island , the US military surveillance plane in China 's Hainan airspace bumped into and damaged a Chinese fighter and illegally landed on Chinese territory .  The United States did not feel slightly ashamed and uneasy for this but shifted the blame to China . It claimed that " China should be responsible for the accident " and that " China 's fighters should not monitor US surveillance planes that came to spy on China . "  
Sources told us that this large-scale exercise in the South China Sea was based on the background of an incident in the Taiwan strait , with the United States as the main imaginary enemy ; it was imagined that , given the intervention of the US Pacific Fleet , one of the focal points of the exercise to " resist the enemy outside coastal areas and territorial seas " was to counter US military information warfare and reconnaisance .  
According to an earlier report in Jiefangjun Bao , since the Taiwan strait crisis broke out , the United States has frequently sent reconnaisance planes to come and go close to China 's coastal airspace in order to step up its gathering of military intelligence on China , and they have even waited for opportunities to sneak into China 's airspace ; Chinese and US warplanes have frequently engaged in midair confrontation and chases , and this collision was by no means a case of accidentally " going too far . "  
During the meeting , relevant consular officials of the Chinese Foreign Ministry pointed out to the US Embassy and Consulate officials mentioned above that after the US military reconnaissance plane bumped against and destroyed a Chinese military plane in the airspace over the coastal waters of China , it , without the permission of the Chinese side , intruded into China 's territorial airspace and landed on an airport in China . This has violated relevant provisions of the international law and relevant Chinese laws .  China has the right to investigate the entire incident .  
A vast ocean separates China and the United States . China has never sent a single soldier to areas near the US continent , nor has China dispatched a reconnaissance plane to US coastal areas .  The United States , on the contrary , has never stopped conducting hostile surveillance , probing flights and harassing activities toward China since the founding of New China .  
Pursuant to the UN Convention on Maritime Law , a foreign aircraft 's " freedom of flight " over another country 's exclusive economic zone is preconditioned by observance of the relevant coastal country 's law and international law , forbidden from activities that may harm the coastal country 's sovereignty , safety , and national interests .  
The Chinese side has also pointed out that when the surveillance aircraft that caused the trouble flew into the airspace over China 's special economic zone , it should respect the provisions concerning the rights of this coastal country .  This act , which is very unfriendly to China , has seriously threatened China 's national security and severely damaged the consensus reached in May last year between China and the United States on avoiding dangerous military actions at sea .  
The reconnaissance behavior of the US military surveillance plane violated the provisions of the " UN Convention on the Law of the Seas " concerning the necessity of respecting the rights of respective coastal nations in overflight of exclusive economic zones , thus posing a serious threat to China 's national security .  
The Chinese Government and people have the right to know why the US sidefrequently dispatched military surveillance planes to China 's coastal waters tocarry out activities , why the US plane violated operational rules and suddenlyveered , bumped into , and destroyed the Chinese plane , and why the US planeintruded into China 's territorial airspace and landed at a Chinese airportwithout permission . 
Ignoring the international law , the US plane had intruded intothe special economic zone in China 's coastal area , and made a turn to bump anddestroy a Chinese military aircraft .  This is an ironclad fact and can not bedenied .  However , what has been hard for people to understand is that after theincident , the US side has refused to admit its fault .  
To exercise sovereign right and exclusive jurisdiction over its exclusive economic zone , the coastal state is entitled to draw up relevant laws and rules to restrict the overflight freedom enjoyed by another state 's aircraft in the airspace over the exclusive economic zone .  Doing so , the coastal state can safeguard the aerial traffic order and flight safety in the zone and protect its legal rights and interest .  
The United States has for many years kept conducting military reconnaissance activities along China 's southeast coastal areas , and US military planes have repeatedly appeared in the skies of China 's coastal areas and have even intruded into the line of China 's territorial waters for reconnaissance .  The US plane that bombed into and destroyed China 's fighter this time is a US military reconnaissance plane equipped with sophisticated electronic reconnaissance devices as well as military intelligence gathering professionals .  
The frequent military reconnaissance activities that the United States have conducted in China 's coastal areas despite the repeated solemn representations from the Chinese Government are never out of a good peaceful purpose , but have an obvious nature of hostility and have posed a serious threat to China 's security and interest .  Meanwhile , these reconnaissance activities have obviously surpassed the scope of " overflight freedom " and violated the principle of " overflight freedom , " as stipulated in the " UN Convention of the Law of the Sea .  
China 's military plane tailed after and conducted surveillance over the US military reconnaissance plane , which intruded into the airspace of our coastal exclusive economic zone to conduct military reconnaissance activities , according to the international law and China 's law .  Exercising sovereign right in the exclusive economic zone , and safeguarding the national defense security is just and legal behavior .  
From China 's northern borders where spring is much in the air to southern China where trees are turning green and from the coastal areas where the ground is full of fallen flowers to the headstreams of the Chang Jiang and Huang He where snow and ice begin to thaw , the public securities organizations have taken rapid actions to form a huge and comprehensive anti-crime network .  
The incident where the US surveillance plane repeatedly infringed on our coastal waters , and rammed and destroyed the Chinese military aircraft , made the Chinese people further understand that hegemonism truly exist in the world , and aroused their fighting will to make China strong and their determination to seize the opportunity to accelerate economic development .  
Wang has conducted surveys of some joint venture enterprises in the coastal region of southern China , an area which is seen by many domestic and foreign companies as an excellent processing base , and as long as the design and standards for electronic products are provided , there are various ready-made associated facilities there , from raw materials and parts / components to assembly , etc .  
These provisions indicate that " other rights " of a coastal country over its exclusive economic zone include its sovereignty and territorial integrity being free from violation as well as its right to protect its national security and peace and other rights granted by international law .  
As mentioned above , the US military reconnaissance plane abused free overflight in airspace over China 's coastal waters , violated flying rules , bumped against and destroyed a Chinese plane , and entered China 's territorial airspace and landed on China 's military airfield without authorization .  That already constituted an incident of serious violation of international law .  
This commentator 's article entitled " ' Routine Duty ' or Malicious Provocation ? " published by the organ of the Central Military Commission held that the surveillance activities of US planes along China 's coastal areas were more than just hostile activities that grossly encroached upon China 's sovereignty and threatened China 's security , but they also seriously affected the healthy and steady development of bilateral relations and would do untold damage to both the Chinese and US sides and to the international community .  
Wang Zhile surveyed some joint venture enterprises in southern China 's coastal area , which is regarded by many domestic and foreign corporations as the best processing base .  One only has to provide the designs and standards for electronic products , because all kinds of necessary factories , from raw materials , spare parts , to assembly , are already there .  
In Beijing , in last night 's " News Network Show , " the CCTV unusually devoted three and a half minutes to snapshots of " large-scale drills " of the PLA , showing Su-27 fighters engaged in all-weather operations over inland , highland , and coastal areas and indicating that the new-generation fighters have developed full fighting capacity .  
From northern frontiers bathing in a luxuriant spring to the south land dressing in green , from the coastal areas full of fallen flowers to the high plateaus of melting snow , the armed police units are all carrying out raids with triumphant results .  
After the national work conference on public security was held , public security border guards have taken measures to speedily launch the " strike-hard " rectification struggle , and severely crack down on cross-border criminal activities such as stowing away , smuggling , guns running , and drug trafficking , thus making positive contributions to safeguarding social and public stability in both border and coastal regions .  
Leaders at all levels have taken the lead in supervising the campaign at the frontline , and all units have studied and determined the key points for the " strike-hard " rectification by considering local conditions .  They have firmly adopted a system whereby units at a higher level will oversee the operations of those at the lower level .  A grand " strike-hard " struggle has vigorously and orderly been launched in the motherland 's border and coastal regions .  
In this grand " strike-hard " struggle , public security frontier guards throughout the country have stressed their tasks in striking out at illegal migration .  They have formed a tight preventive line along the coastal regions and in ports to strike at the activities on " sea , land , and air . "  
We have made brilliant achievements in aiding and developing poverty-stricken areas , however , we should be aware that the production means and living in the poor areas have not yet been basically improved .  These poor areas are hardly capable of resisting natural disasters , their levels of production and social growth are comparatively low , and the gap between them and coastal developed areas keeps expanding .  
To make the new project of aiding and supporting poor areas successful , we call for continued arduous efforts on the part of the party and the people throughout the country and further support from various social sectors and coastal developed areas .  
Japan regards its southwest oceangoing shipping line stretching from Southeast Asia to the Persian Gulf as its " economic lifeline " .  Relying on its special relationship with the United States , Japan has readjusted its strategy at sea in a step-by-step manner from " annihilating enemies in coastal waters " to " ocean defense " as well as " ocean offense and defense " , which is of considerable offensive tints .  
A year after a sharp change took place in the Taiwan Strait situation , Taiwan people built their own views and judgement on Taiwan authorities ' threats of " fighting a decisive war offshore " and " bombing the coastal cities on the west side of the strait " .  
The MND organized more than 100 officers to participate in the operation of the " Lecheng " plan , which includes many plans and special projects and requires a wide range of cooperation .  Frequent meetings every month enabled US officers on active service to visit all Taiwan 's sensitive and important military areas , such as the Air Force Operation Command , the Army 's missile bases , and the Navy submarine base , and to conduct field investigations of the coastal areas where the Chinese communists may conduct landing .  
In the first 10 years plus since the implementation of reform and opening up , the gap between the level of Tibet 's economic and cultural development with the inland and the inland as well as the coastal developed areas in the east showed a trend of further widening instead of shrinking because Tibet was restricted by natural conditions and because of historical reasons .  
Guam is about 1,500 nautical miles from the Philippines . The US deployment of massive forces at this important " strategic supporting point " reflects the strategic thinking of the new Bush administration and will be conducive to launching a long-distance precision attack against the mainland 's coastal regions by US military within 12 hours .  
These reporters visited almost all the companies and forward posts in the coastal and frontier areas of the country and sent out more than 400 news reports , zealously eulogizing frontier servicemen 's heroic achievements and mental outlook of fighting arduously and bravely making contributions .  Besides , these reports have vividly demonstrated the historically great changes in coastal and border defense and fully reflected the border areas ' new progress in army-government and army-people unity and material and spiritual civilizations .  
The province has fully exploited the material support provided for coastal defense and security management by rapid economic development .  Drawing on science and technology , Jiangsu has abandoned the past method of simply relying on patrols and inspections of beaches .  Instead , the province has included public order , production , transit , ships , ports , and military facilities in coastal areas into the land-sea-air comprehensive management system .  
The province has dealt with coastal defense in accordance with the law by enacting the " Interim Provisions on Coastal Defense Development and Management of Jiangsu Province . " It has established " capable , highly efficient , and authoritative " leading management institutions in various administration levels .  While implementing scientific management in establishment of units , doing rational planning , and separating regions for management , it has attached importance to coordinated administration to solve the difficulty in cross-command in coastal defense and security management .  
Lianyungang and other localities have brought into full play the role of high-tech facilities of military bases in the field of coastal defense surveillance and have built and improved a multilevel surveillance and intelligence network for the sea and coastal regions ( including islands ) .  This has enhanced the coastal defense monitoring capability in ocean and territorial airspace , not merely restricted to coastal beaches , thus solving the difficult problem in coastal defense management .  
When constructing new ports , roads , and railways and optic fiber and ground satellite projects , counties and cities in the coastal regions have fully considered the practical needs for coastal defense and incorporated them into unified planning and construction .  This is to ensure coordination in coastal defense management and economic development of coastal regions .  
The army is trying to raise its field air defense and mobile assault capability , the navy is forming a combat equipment system for sea-borne mobile and land-based defense of coastal waters , and the air force is forming a system that will be equipped for both attack and defense , a high - , medium - , and low-altitude , long - , medium - , and short-range integrated system of disposition combined with an antiaircraft intelligence network that can defend our national territory .  
As early as in the eighties , Deng Xiaoping , the chief architect of China 's reform and opening up program , already put forth the concept of coordinating the nation 's economic development .  According to the concept , central and western China should first give consideration to the national interests by supporting the opening up and development of coastal areas in the east .  Then , when the east has reached a certain stage of development , it should help central and western China speed up its development with even more resources in return .  
With its great efforts over the past 50 years , the Chinese Navy has initially built a modern marine operational force composed of the crack troops of five branches - - surface warships , submarines , naval air force , coastal guard , and the marines .  The Chinese Navy is capable of carrying out various kinds of operational tasks on coastal waters .  
The surface warship unit represents a backbone force of the Chinese Navy in carrying out defense strategic task on coastal waters .  It is also the earliest branch established by the Navy . The Chinese Navy has expanded its surface warship unit .  Now it has guided missile destroyers , guided missile escort ships , and guided missile boats as its major fighting capacity .  
More than a half of the state-owned units ' fixed assets investment have been placed in the eastern region , where five special economic zones , the Pudong Development District , 14 coastal open cities , and still more economic development zones have been established , and some preferential policies have been adopted to accelerate development , promote reform , and expand openness in this region , so that the economy in the eastern region has developed rapidly . 
Invited member Zhao Jiazhi , who rushed here from the old industrial base of Jilin Province , indicated that , in attending the session this time , he aimed most at gaining understanding of major arrangements made by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council that are oriented toward the new century , especially arrangements on how to develop the western region and coastal regions .  
The central authorities adopted the policy decision of accelerating the development of the vast western region last year .  This is a strategic shift in China 's economic construction .  For a large country like China , it is undoubtedly not enough to have only a developed and prosperous eastern coastal region .  
We Yi noted : The state has already extended a number of preferential policies to the western region to encourage the region to introduce foreign investment , and the western region should therefore acquire an adequate understanding and make a good use of these policies .  Meanwhile , it should also draw on the experiences of the country 's eastern coastal areas in introducing foreign investment .  
At the same time , he also proposed that departments concerned should re-appraise the reasonability and serviceability of the existing national defense engineering system in southeast coastal areas based on the Central Military Commission 's military strategic principle for the new period , should rebuild this system in line with the requirements of the future high-tech war , and should intensify the building of military facilities and future battlefields in order to meet the demands of the military struggles against Taiwan .  
Reportedly , after drawing from the experience of the military pressure exerted during Taiwan 's presidential elections in 1996 and also for the sake of avoiding unnecessary conjecture , the air force , navy , and missile troops along the southeast coastal areas have received orders to suspend all their military exercises one week before and after Taiwan 's current presidential elections .  The military action will be focused on stepped up monitoring and patrols .  
According to reports , the second-generation guided missile destroyers developed by China itself are equipped with short-range air defense missiles , fully-automated guns and auxiliary guns , and the antisubmarine defense system composed of the late-model sonar antisubmarine helicopters and torpedoes .  For the first time a single vessel has the combat capacity which covers the three dimensions of coastal , air , and antisubmarine defenses .  
The implementation of the large-scale western development is China 's major policy decision oriented to the new century , which , like the eastern coastal region that previously took the lead in development and contributed to the sustained and rapid economic development in the entire country , will certainly provide enormous market and development prospects for the eastern and central regions and energetically promote greater economic prosperity throughout the country .  
It has been disclosed that most of the A-Category group armies of Nanjing and Guangzhou theaters deployed along the southeast coastal frontline have been equipped with warships in their establishments .  In this connection , the crack troops which have been formed and carefully selected from the two theaters have been sent to the navy stage by stage and group by group to receive professional training with sea-crossing and landing operations as the content .  
The historical contribution of the Taiwan Strait area and the Western Pacific coastal area in the 21st century , and whether it will create wealth or engender more conflict , will be decided based on whether the leaders of Taiwan , poised at a crossroads , can accurately judge the trends of the times , distinguishing true historical opportunities from false , in order to successfully negotiate the difficult situation in which they find themselves .

The developed coastal areas and suburban districts of large and medium cities should proceed from their local superiority and give priority to the development of agriculture with fine quality and high efficiency as well as agriculture that earns foreign exchange .  
To consolidate its sector dealing with Taiwan affairs in light of the new situation , the CPC is about to institute a major reshuffle of the relevant mechanism , including increasing the military 's involvement in Taiwan affairs as well as the number of Taiwan affairs offices nationwide , especially the size of such offices in coastal areas . 
Fujian is located along the coastal areas in southeast China . It will make comprehensive preparations to provide logistical support for the probable war in the future [ wei lai ke neng chu xian de zhan zheng ] .  The preparations consist of increased investments on infrastructural construction projects , including airports , harbors , and highways .  
For example , the special national policies for the eastern coastal regions created fast economic development and quick increases in wages in those areas .  This is an obvious example .  
According to today 's " Jiefangjun Bao , " since the beginning of July , Nanjing Military Region has sent units of a whole division and regiment to the coastal forefront to conduct maritime military training , forming a military training picture of a grand scene at sea along the meandering coastal line .  More than 10,000 officers and men of a certain infantry division were organized into a formation and crossed the sea in arms in stormy conditions .  Neither the front nor the end of the formation could be seen ;  
To guarantee the quality of maritime training , the Nanjing Military Region organized leaders of all units to check the areas scheduled for maritime training and formulated careful training plans on the basis of comprehensively mastering the regular weather patterns , the morning and evening tides , the sea currents , and the characteristics of beaches and coastal sea beds .  
Later he headed troops to give strategic chase to Kuomintang troops , liberating eastern China and many coastal islands .  After the founding of the New China , Comrade Su Yu was successively appointed deputy chief and chief of general staff of the People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] .  Proceeding from the actual conditions of the army and state and the international environment , he made many major proposals to the CMC , making important contributions to building a modern defense and army .  
The quality of the environment of surface water of various municipalities , provincial capitals , cities of special economic zones , coastal cities and key tourist cities must meet the state standards .  
As revealed by informed sources , the mainland 's public security authorities have launched several nationwide campaigns to " strike at the underworld " since the beginning of the second half of this year .  Several coastal areas in the southeast , including Shenzhen , Zhuhai , Zhongshan , and Shantou in Guangdong , Fuzhou and Xiamen in Fujian , and Shanghai , are believed to be the localities where underworld activities are most rampant .  These localities have become major places for the public security authorities to " strike at the underworld . "  
Although the forms of expression and the numbers of people involved in criminal and evil forces vary between the coastal areas and the interior and between town and country , and some organizations are lax and some tight , their antisocial essence is completely identical and they do very great social harm .  
The police estimated that after the crackdowns in the fourth quarter of this year and in the first half of next year , they should be able to eliminate some of the larger local triads , fully curb the activities of foreign triads in the mainland , and bring about an obvious improvement in public order in the coastal areas .  
He also disclosed : The flight squadrons currently stationed in the southeast coastal region are all crack troops with the most advanced equipment and weaponry in the Chinese air force , the most superb military technology , and the pilots with the greatest wealth of experience that can take off and conduct operations in all weather .  
Vice Minister of Agriculture Liu Chengguo said : From now on , the coastal areas and outskirts of large and medium-sized cities in east China will mainly be engaged in the production of cash crops with a high value-added and specialty farm produce for export ; the central region will lay particular emphasis on giving play to its advantages in producing premium grain , special-purpose grain , and feed grain ; and the western region will return the grain plots to forestry and husbandry and vigorously develop ecological agriculture .  
Pressured by recent developments , he was forced to lift restrictions on the direct exchange of goods and people between the two islands of Jinmen [ Kinmen ] and Mazu [ Matsu ] and coastal Fujian . However , this is not direct " three links " in the real sense of the word and can not meet the strong desire and pressing demand of the people on both sides of the Strait . It also lags behind the objective situation of growing cross-Strait personnel and economic exchanges .  
Recently , compelled by the situation , they lifted the ban on direct cargo shipping and visitor traffic between Kinmen-Matsu and the coastal areas of Fujian . But this is not direct " three links " in a true sense and can not satisfy the strong wish and urgent demand of the public on both sides .  Furthermore , it lags behind the objective situation where the exchange of visits , economic interaction , and trade between the two sides have been steadily growing .  
The two delegations made the visit exactly after the Taiwan authorities announced the opening of goods and personnel exchanges between Kinmen and Matsu on one side and the coastal areas of Fujian on the other .  The event attracted close attention from mass media inside and outside Taiwan . Both ARATS and the two party delegations from Taiwan agreed that the so-call " mini three links " adopted by the Taiwan authorities by making a big fanfare was of no substantive significance .  
The article , entitled " Uphold the One China Principle , Promote Direct Cross-strait ' Three links , ' " says that the so-called " mini three links " refer to links between Jinmen and Mazu and the Fujian coastal region .  On 13 September 2000 , through an assessment report on the so-called " mini three links , " the Taiwan authorities planned to adopt a gradual and partial method in opening limited Jinmen-Xiamen and Mazu-Fuzhou freight and passenger links , and applied the principle of " first freight , then passengers ;  
Over the past year , ever since the beginning of the large-scale development of the western region , the people of the entire county have made use of this rare opportunity , laid a solid infrastructural foundation , and stepped up their cooperation with coastal areas in the country 's eastern region .  As a result , our advantage of having rich natural resources is being turned into a practical economic advantage .  
In view of our country , following the reform and opening up and economic construction for more than 20 years , the productive forces in our country have climbed onto a new stage , the system of socialist market economy has been initially established , the scale and level of opening up to the outside world have been greatly increased , the talented people of science and technology , management , and other specialized professions are growing rapidly , and a number of center cities with relatively stronger competitiveness have emerged in the coastal areas .  
County Chief Rou Zi Gu Li Ba Yi of Tashiku Erqiantajike Autonomous County said that within one year of the launching of the great strategy of developing the west , the county had strengthened cooperation with the eastern coastal region and turned ample resources into an economic advantage .  The strategy , he said , has already brought tangible benefits to the impoverished county located 4,000 meters above sea level on the Pamirs plateau that had been singled out to receive special government support .  
The new museum is located at the ruins of the Lei Yue Mun Fort , which was a defence work built by the British army in the 19th century .  The SAR Government has preserved and maintained the historical relics , and has rebuilt it into a museum for the benefit of the public , so that they may have a better understanding of Hong Kong 's coastal defence .  It is undoubtedly another cultural contribution to our community .  
The weather was fine and sunny on April 13 but it became cloudy with some light rain patches again that evening as an intense replenishment of the northeast monsoon reached the south China coastal areas .  Winds strengthened from the east and persisted the next day .  
A northeast monsoon reached the south China coastal areas on May 6 .  As winds freshened from the northeast , there was continual rain and temperatures fell to 17 degrees , the lowest in the month , in the late afternoon .  This was the fourth lowest daily minimum temperature recorded in May .  
A cold front crossed the south China coastal areas on the morning of November 1 .  It brought a few rain patches to the New Territories . Winds strengthened from the north and the weather was mainly cloudy .  
The content and the extent of the site , however , remained unclear till 1997 as the AMO conducted an intensive archaeological survey and discovered that it was in fact a typical ancient sandbar site of South China coastal area , which was well-preserved underneath a playground . 
Since the country went ahead with reform and open door policy in 1978 , Hong Kong businesses have been actively involved in investment and trade in the coastal provinces , developing external trade in tandem with local enterprises .  Plenty of valuable experience has thus been gained which can be used for reference in the development of western region . " he added .  
They visited more than six major and many minor ungazetted beaches along the coastal areas in Tuen Mun , Tsuen Wan , Sai Kung and the southern part of Hong Kong and removed rubbish washed ashore or left by inconsiderate beach-goers .  
A weak cold front arrived at the south China coastal areas on October 4 .  The weather in Hong Kong turned hazy at first and became cloudy with thundery showers in the afternoon .  Around 80 millimetres of rainfall were recorded over parts of the Lantau Island .  
" Recycling Cinema " is a continuation of Ellen Pau 's longstanding interest in exploring different ways to frame the spatial and temporal aspects of mobility and location in an urban context .  In her video series , she investigates the simple visual experience of viewing a coastal highway to contemplate the moods of the mind and the silent pathos of loneliness .  
Mr Leung also pointed out that a critical mass of middle class consumers had been formed in the PRD as well as in the Yangtze River Delta and other coastal cities following a breakneck development in China . The combined " middle-class " consumer population is estimated at over 200 million , with a market volume estimated at over US $ 560 billion , growing at a rate of about 10 per cent per annum .  
Falling within this area are coastal areas mainly below the 20-metre contour .  This zone is intended to conserve and retain the natural coastlines and the sensitive coastal natural environment including attractive geological features , physical landform or areas of high landscape , scenic or ecological value .  
With the completion of the North Link Railroad between Suao and Hualien , a major port city at the northern end of the narrow coastal plain due to be completed by the end of this year , further development in eastern Taiwan is possible .  
Covering an area of 163 kilometers on the western coastal plain , Taichung 's location has aided economic development of the city . Taichung 's harbor and verdant outlying fields provide fresh fish and produce for busy city markets , and both the city and surrounding area are served by an efficient network of roads and railways , linking Taichung to centers in the north and south of Taiwan .  
However , the east coast is shown as blank , and the central highlands are simply indicated by painted peaks , because the sheer mountains , and fierce tribes of those regions meant that Ching rule was ineffective beyond the coastal plain to the west .  
No clear plan was set out for upgrading Taichung to a metropolis , nor for opening Taichung Harbor to direct cross-strait shipping ; the high-speed railway was diverted to a coastal route via new towns far from Taichung city ; the third international airport was planned for southern Taiwan ; no increases in numbers of universities and colleges were envisaged under the plan ; and the mass transit system urgently needed to solve Taichung 's transportation problems would n't be ready until the year 2020 ! "  
Currently , in the coastal areas all around the island , smugglers are mostly bringing in agricultural products with a relatively high value , like peanuts , garlic , mushrooms , dried lilies , red beans , betel nuts , sticky rice , Chinese medicines and fish products . Beef , pork , lamb and intestines are also smuggled in , as well as rare animals like Tibetan Mastiffs .  
In Pingtan , boats from afar : Let 's return to the fishing industry . Taiwan is surrounded by the sea on all sides , and conditions for the development of the fishing industry were originally excellent , but because of the pollution caused by industrial development and improper fishing methods , the Taiwan coastal and inshore fishing industries have fallen on hard times .  
Chen Wu-hsiong , the head of the Council of Agriculture 's Planning Department , points out that peanuts and garlic are crops grown in coastal regions of the south . Dried lilies and mushrooms are traditional crops grown in mountainous regions of eastern and central Taiwan . These areas share the characteristic of being relatively poor and barren and not well suited for growing other crops . Furthermore , families have farmed the same land for generations .  
We would probably note that the trends starting in the 1980 ' s , i.e . the loosening of trade and investment restrictions , continued as mainland China gradually opened up . Development spread from the southern coastal provinces to the North and through the interior . China was transformed , the " Sleeping Dragon " awoke , jolted from its long slumber by the calls of two of the " Little Tigers , " Hong Kong from within and Taiwan from the outside . ( edited by Teng Sue-feng / photos by Vincent Chang )  
Then there was the outbreak of a disease that left people with blackened feet in the coastal area of southern Chiayi which has been proved by experts on contagious diseases to have been related to the protracted use of underground water containing too much arsenic for drinking . "  
The objective international situation has changed and the Western economies have long been stuck in a period of economic malaise . The Asia-Pacific area , however - - especially the Southeast Asian region , including Indochina , Taiwan , Hong Kong and coastal mainland China - - has produced a rich economic stimulus . People have money and their purchasing power has increased dramatically . "  
The Tourism Bureau has been developing a recreational area in the woodland coastal area in Tungshih rural township in Chiayi County . They built a huge service center and parking lot in the area . Perhaps by the time they 're ready to open , the woodland will have withered because of destruction of the living environment . "  
A swimming pool at the beach : Six years ago Taiwan had still not lifted martial law , and strict controls over beach areas hindered the chances for intimacy between the sea and this island people . Today most of the restrictions on approaching coastal areas have been removed , but now we are cut off from the sea by dikes we have built ourselves .  
Eastern Taiwan 's inconvenient transportation is well-known , especially the railroad . Because the east is obstructed by the double barrier of the central mountain range and the coastal mountain range , beginning work on the railroad was extremely difficult . The earliest constructed stretch was a simple narrow gauge line from Hwalien to Taitung .  
Twisting around rivers , green mountains and verdant valleys , the railway accompanies the ample and profound Pacific in an interlude when it runs parallel to the coast , occasionally crossing paths with the coastal highway . The railway winds a circuitous path around the mountain peaks , ducking in and out between pitch black shadow and shimmering light .  
Starting in the north at the mouth of the Hualien River , the designated area runs southward as far as Little Yehliu ; on the west it is bounded by the coastal mountain range running north-south parallel to the Central Mountain Range ; and in the east it runs into the Pacific Ocean .  
In the coastal regions of every Asian country along the western Pacific ocean live large numbers of marine turtles , but many of the islands where they are distributed lack reliable monitoring and protection . Sea turtles have even gotten innocently embroiled in local wars or been negatively affected by the capers of private individuals . For this reason international conservation groups intend to devote the year 1995 to the West Pacific Marine turtle , hoping to encourage research and protection of marine turtles in this region .  
As such , with its view of a wide expanse of water and green coastal ridges , the area is said to have especially auspicious geomantic properties . Thus the hillsides are covered with cemeteries advertised as " Fit for an Emperor or King , " " Home of the Dragon and Den of the Tiger , " or " Paradise . " For businessmen to build these cemeteries - - the most expensive and delightfully-sited on the island - - they had to first level the mountainsides and uproot the woods .  
Since 1993 , as part of a major government crackdown , the government has thus far closed down over 30 underground amphetamine laboratories . Nearly 14 tons of raw materials , finished products , and semi-finished products were uncovered . The industry 's history then repeated itself , only this time it was Taiwan drug manufacturers putting up the capital and providing the equipment and technology , as factories moved westward to coastal China ( especially Fujian ) . Goods produced there are either sold to Taiwanese businessmen or shipped out to Taiwan , Japan , and Korea .  
Archaeologist Chang Kuang-chih argues that Tapenkeng Culture may have been an old culture spread widely in southeast coastal China . It may have been one of the two agricultural cultures that developed in parallel in China at that time , the other being the familiar Yangshao Culture which is mainly distributed around the midstream portions of the Yellow River .  
Taiwan in those days was wilderness , but the wide-open land and bountiful resources continued to attract Han Chinese from the coastal areas of Fujian and Guangdong . According to historical sources , the population of coastal Fujian and Guangdong in that era was highly concentrated , with mountainous areas outweighing habitable ones , which further intensified the attraction of Taiwan for the Han .  
Taiwan 's " plum rains " were particularly heavy this year . The storms brought by the stationary front that creates the plum rains in June quickly raised water levels in the island 's reservoirs to dangerous levels . In the center and south of the island , from the mountains to the coastal plains , there were almost daily reports of flooding and landslides .  
The main areas affected by land subsidence run down the western coastal plain from Changhua through Chia-yi , Yunlin and Tainan to Pingtung . Fish farming is prevalent in these counties , and ponds dot the entire area . The excessive pumping of ground water by these fish farmers is so severe that the elevation of towns and village in the area is dropping . This creates problems with drainage leading to frequent flooding .  
Such projects included the building of the Shihmen and Tsengwen Reservoirs and the Central Cross-Island Highway . The provincial government implemented compulsory education through grade nine , encouraged development of coastal marshes and hilly districts , rezoned agricultural land , took steps to prevent excessive concentration of urban land ownership , built public housing , and developed industrial parks . All these measures were taken to create the conditions that would enable Taiwan to vault from the category of developing nation into the ranks of the newly industrialized economies .  
But over recent years , in the pursuit of economic growth , Taiwan has heavily exploited its natural resources . For example , coastal land reclamation and the development of new industrial zones have destroyed valuable wetlands , and when the wetlands are lost the birds ' paradise is lost with them .  
But most worrying are the fish farms spread all over Taiwan 's coastal regions . In some places , abalone pools have been dug into the marine erosion terraces , while in others illegal and excessive pumping of groundwater for aquaculture , along with extraction for domestic , industrial and agricultural use , has caused serious land subsidence in areas covering almost 1,000 square kilometers .  
As the coastal region continued to thrust upward , the shallowest sections of coral reef rose above sea level , resulting in a layer of limestone . This rock has been mined for many years by the cement industry , but has begun to be depleted in recent years .  
In 1928 , the Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Peking was terminated , and a new Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Amity and Commerce was signed . Although the Macau problem was left unresolved , the ROC reclaimed numerous governing rights from the Portuguese , including powers over customs , coastal trade , and riverine transport ; also , Portuguese consular jurisdiction was terminated . The exhibit shows how the ROC tried to eliminate the unequal treaties .  
And it is not only the ocean that is beautiful ; Palau 's land scenery is also absorbing . The " Rock Islands , " known as " a garden on the sea , " have extensive white sand beaches and a rich variety of coastal plant life , as well as amazing waterfalls .  
First , he says , it 's not too far from Taipei , so it makes for a convenient daytrip for foreigners passing through Taipei . Second , the northeastern coastal area is a popular recreation corridor , with excellent places to see in Chinshan , Tanshui , Yangmingshan National Park , Yehliu , Keelung , and Ilan . Even before the museum was established , there was a ready-made stream of visitors passing through the area looking for worthwhile places to go .  
Furthermore , the Kuroshio current and the mainland coastal current converge here , the upwelling current off Taiwan 's eastern rift valley brings up organic salts from the ocean depths , and a seabed valley forms a natural barrier . Under these conditions , many organisms have developed into unique species , and the sea off Ilan contains a cornucopia of marine life .  
However , explains Huang Wu-ta , director of the Taiwan Institute of Urban History , the conditions did not yet exist that would have allowed Jiaozaitu to serve as the capital . The overland transportation network during the late Qing dynasty was extremely poor , and people traveled north-south in Taiwan mainly via the sea . This factor marginalized Jiaozaitu , which had no port . Central Taiwan 's key population center was farther south in the coastal city of Lukang .  
Fish noodles are a special type of noodle particular to China 's southeast coastal region . They are made from four parts cornstarch and six parts eel , drum , and other high-grade fish . The mass is then rolled , pressed , cut , and dried in the sun .  
The head of the team , Wang Chao-yi , points out that the high quality pebbles found underground in the Kuanyin alluvial plain have been disastrous as idle farmland has drawn illegal gravel mining , and the gravel pits have then been used as landfills , leaving behind a ravaged landscape . Since 1994 , residents of Paochang Village in Kuanyin Rural Township have been trying to protect the environment by blocking off coastal roads to gravel and garbage trucks . Unfortunately , new problems keep cropping up .  
In the same way , the demand for seafood increased when Taiwan 's economy took off . Taking advantage of this favorable situation , aquaculture began sprouting up on the west coast . At one point , coastal counties were waterlogged with fully 58,000 hectares of fish farms , causing massive erosion problems . With the widespread smuggling of seafood from the PRC in recent years , aquacultural land in Taiwan has dropped to 40,000 hectares as fisheries have shifted operations to mainland China .  
Here at the other end of the Earth in Taiwan , the wise words written in the Bible 2000 years ago are borne out : on Linshan Point , a windswept promontory jutting out into the sea from Taiwan 's north coast , between the sandy beach and the rock face there grows a carpet of tough coastal plants , including a scattering of short-stemmed flowers .  
At a symposium on the control of environmental hormones held in April , Professor Liu Li-lian , director of the Institute of Marine Biology at National Sun Yat-sen University in Kaohsiung , described the results of a coastal survey in southern Taiwan . The natural ratio of males to females in oyster drills is about one to one , " so when I noticed that the Thais clavigera we were catching had all turned male , I knew something was wrong , " said Liu with alarm .  
On some tours , as well as birdwatching and learning about coastal plants , tourists also ride out to the tidal zones to see how oysters are raised and collected . At low tide , they enjoy the sight of crabs digging their holes , and visit ponds where hard clams are grown . Later , as the tide rises , they return to the shore to enjoy magnificent views of the sea over the now-submerged oyster beds .  
The first typhoon to strike Taiwan this year , Typhoon Mindulle , swept in from the southwest at the start of July , bringing with it torrential rains and powerful winds and causing massive landslides and coastal flooding . Once again , having been through the disasters of the 921 earthquake of 1999 and 2001 ' s Typhoons Toraji and Nari , the people of central Taiwan faced the hardship of losing livelihoods and loved ones .

A : The cross-strait industrial relationship has been complementary for the past 20 years , but now economic development in the mainland is gradually bringing us into competition with one another . This is true of our ports , as well . Once completed , the mainland 's southeast coastal ports will represent a real challenge to their counterparts in Taiwan .  
An approach to marine pollution prevention " , GESAMP Report and Studies , No . 30 , 1986 .  Heavy trawls may be considered " green " on deep muddy grounds but " red " in shallow estuaries and coastal zones or coral reefs .  
As part of the effort to expand the production base for trade , island developing countries need to strengthen regional capabilities for the effective surveillance and monitoring of marine and coastal resources and activities in the exclusive economic zones .  
Such cooperation was aimed at preserving the marine environment and living resources , disposing of toxic wastes , developing coastal infrastructure and taking joint action to promote sustainable development in border areas .  The meeting rose at 5.40 p.m .  
It would call upon States to take measures to ensure that no fishing vessels entitled to fly their flags fish in areas under the national jurisdiction of other States unless duly authorized by the competent authorities of the coastal State or States concerned , such authorized fishing operations being carried out in accordance with the conditions set out in the authorization .  
Furthermore , other recent endeavours , including the 1995 Agreement on straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks and the work of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , reflect the determination of the international community to develop and strengthen the global legal order for the sustainable development of the living and non-living resources of marine and coastal waters .  
That institution will be responsible for studying data and other forms of information presented by coastal States regarding the outer limits of the continental shelf when the shelf extends beyond nautical 200 miles and for giving scientific and technical advice to States in preparation of this data when such assistance is requested .  
New Zealand welcomes the strengthened commitment that coastal States and States fishing on the high seas have made reflected in the provisions of the Convention to improve the status of essential fisheries resources , both through agreed conservation measures for high-seas areas and through the exercise by coastal States of responsible management of the sovereign resources within their exclusive economic zones .  
Nuclear tests pose a potential risk to the health and security of the people of coastal States and to their natural resources and environment , contrary to the precautionary principle on international environmental law contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development , the Convention on Biological Diversity , the United Nations Framework Convention on Climatic Change , the Treaty of Maastricht and other international instruments .  
Many species , such as migratory species , species dependent on the timing of ice-melting , Arctic communities , marine , coastal and peripheral populations , genetically impoverished species , mountain and alpine communities , and species that inhabit dry lands , semi-arid and arid ecosystems , are all likely to be adversely affected by global warming ; the climatic changes predicted may bring about catastrophic losses in genetic resources and species and ecosystem diversity .  
The breadth of an adjacent area of the high seas , measured from the outer boundary of an economic zone , shall be determined , up to a maximum of 70 nautical miles , on the basis of the best available scientific data by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or by agreement between the coastal and other States concerned .  
Activities planned for 1996-1997 are expected to result in ( a ) a knowledge base upon which management strategies and plans can be formulated and implementation initiated to ensure the protection and sustainable development of marine and coastal areas ; and ( b ) establishment of mechanisms and policy options for the development of environmental protection and sustainable management and plans .  
Field projects . ( i ) Establishment of four port reception facilities in the Mediterranean ; ( ii ) two field projects on the assessment of threats to marine mammals ; ( iii ) one marine biodiversity assessment ; ( iv ) strengthening of four institutional arrangements for integrated coastal zone planning and management ; and ( v ) 10 projects to assist Mediterranean countries to set up their legislation concerning specially protected areas .  
Within the project on " Coastal Marine Pollution Monitoring and Training : Asia Pacific Mussel Watch " , UNU is seeking to analyse and monitor key hazardous chemicals and substances in the coastal marine areas of the Asia-Pacific region , including relative levels of important agricultural and industrial halogenated hydrocarbons in the eastern Pacific .  
While poverty results in certain kinds of environmental stress , the major cause of the continued deterioration of the global environment is the unsustainable pattern of consumption and production , particularly in industrialized countries , which is a matter of grave concern , aggravating poverty and imbalances .  Rising sealevels as a result of global warming cause a grave and immediate threat to people living in island countries and coastal areas .  
Building upon earlier activities and based on qualitative and quantitative assessments of the coastal and marine pollution loads from land-based sources in the eastern African subregion , including the Comoros and Seychelles , the planned development of a regional overview and strategy will lead to the implementation of various additional activities , such as monitoring programmes .

The Sustainable Dar es Salaam Project ( SDP ) supports the City Council in developing sustainable solutions to priority environmental issues such as solid waste , servicing urban land , air quality , surface water , coastal area resources , recreational and tourism resources and urban agricultural production .  
The General Assembly has proclaimed 1998 to be the International Year of the Ocean . 158 / This initiative is expected to generate important cooperative efforts in the United Nations system 159 / and stimulate greater global awareness of the oceans and greater cooperation for the effective protection and management of marine and coastal areas and resources . 
Australia was a founding member of the International Coral Reef Initiative whose aims included promoting education programmes , improved coastal management and coordinated research and monitoring at the global , regional and national levels to ensure that coral reef resources were managed in a sustainable fashion .  
Calls upon States to take the responsibility , consistent with their obligations under international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and resolution 49 / 116 , to take measures to ensure that no fishing vessels entitled to fly their national flags fish in areas under the national jurisdiction of other States unless duly authorized by the competent authorities of the coastal State or States concerned ; such authorized fishing operations should be carried out in accordance with the conditions set out in the authorization ;  
In many cases , the unrestricted use of technology , the growing demand for goods and services from the ocean , uncontrolled population growth and continuous migration to coastal areas have led to the depletion of living resources and the degradation of the coastal and marine environment as well as of the economic conditions of some of the major sectors exploiting the ocean .  
Chapter 17 of Agenda 21 called for governmental action , with the assistance of the specialized agencies of the United Nations system when required and with the active participation of the people and sectors involved and that of the non-governmental organizations , in order to : ( a ) improve the use and conservation of coastal resources through integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas , including exclusive economic zones ( programme area A ) ; ( b ) increase marine environmental protection from land-based and sea-based sources of pollution  
Oceans and coastal areas are a finite economic asset yet to be fully understood by Governments , as is also the consequent need for their prudent and rational exploitation , and given commensurable priority in national development plans ;  
It will provide the basis for national and international action to reduce pollution of the oceans from land-based activities , contributing , inter alia , to : ( i ) improvement of coastal habitats and productivity ; ( ii ) reduction of threats to food security and safety ; ( iii ) reduction of hazards to human health ; and ( iv ) increased control over coastal activities to stop and reverse the process of alteration of the coastal zone .  
Protection of the atmosphere , in regard to : ( i ) absorption of greenhouse gases ; ( ii ) climate change and its potentially drastic effects on marine living resources ; ( iii ) energy optimization programmes and reduction of dangerous substances in exhaust gas emissions ; and ( iv ) reduction in the use of chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) in at-sea and coastal ocean industries ; ( g ) Chapter 10 .  
Calling the attention of the international community to the role of oceans and coastal areas as a major governing force of the planetary ecosystem , as well as a determining factor of human life , recommend that greater priority be accorded at national , regional and international levels to the action set out in chapter 17 of Agenda 21 ;  
Recognizing further the progress made during the post-UNCED process in developing international and regional standards and action plans relevant to the protection and management of coastal and marine environments and to the sustainable use and conservation of its resources , recommend that Governments : ( i ) continue to use existing mechanisms and forums to foster further progress ; ( ii ) actively participate in regional action plans , programmes and other cooperative arrangements ; and ( iii ) take advantage of international collaboration , particularly in the area of financing ;  
National , subnational and local policies and development plans must be carefully re-examined to ensure optimal land use and geographically better balanced economic development , including the protection of indispensable agricultural land ; land that sustains biodiversity , water quality and groundwater recharge ; fragile areas , including coastal areas ; and other sensitive areas in need of protection . 83 bis .  
The Working Group also stressed the need for increased support for training and capacity-building in the field of integrated management of coastal areas , and stressed the need for taking action to protect all critical habitats of marine living resources in the coastal zone , including coral reefs , mangroves , mudflats and estuaries .  
It also asked Governments and agencies of the United Nations system to promote programmes for guiding management and corrective actions to control pollution in the larger coastal urban settlements , specifically in the treatment of sewage and waste disposal , both domestic and industrial , as well as to control pollution in river systems caused by mining industries .  
Urge concerned Governments , United Nations agencies and organizations , multilateral development banks , donor institutions , local communities , non-governmental organizations , the private sector and the scientific community to support the implementation of the ICRI Framework for Action , launching local or national coral reef initiatives as part of their plans for coastal integrated development and management ;  
In cases where the continental margin extends beyond 200 nautical miles , the coastal State , if it meets specific technical criteria , can establish the outer limits of the legal " continental shelf " up to 350 nautical miles from the baselines , or up to 100 nautical miles seaward of the 2,500-metre isobath , whichever is further seaward .  
The limits to be defined in the submission from a coastal State with a continental shelf that extends beyond 200 nautical miles are to be based on distances measured with respect to " the foot of the continental slope " near the edge of the submerged prolongation of its land mass .  
In the course of examination of the coastal State 's submission , the Commission will have to analyse a large volume of complex geodetic , bathymetric , seismic and possibly other geophysical data in order to verify that the geological and geomorphological conditions support the coastal State 's submission .  
The Commission must be mindful of existing or potential offshore boundary disputes between opposite or adjacent coastal States and the proviso in article 76 ( 10 ) of the Convention , which states that " [ t ] he provisions of this article are without prejudice to the question of delimitation of the continental shelf between States with opposite or adjacent coasts " .  
It would be preferable at this first submission stage for the coastal State to present in its package summary A4 maps 14 / indicating the approximate limits of its continental shelf , its territorial sea baselines , the general manner by which the limits were defined and any potential areas of disagreement with other States .  
Population density , availability of key natural resources , per capita income and urban and agricultural conditions differ between the crowded coastal plain and the less densely populated West Bank .  
Furthermore , international law permits the coastal State to conduct only marine scientific research in its exclusive economic zone , not " any kind of research " , as stated in article 14 , subparagraph ( b ) ( ii ) , of the aforementioned Iranian Act .  
The limited information obtained from national sources shows that a number of small island developing States have begun to implement parts of the Programme of Action that have especially high priority at the national level , including institution-building , particularly the strengthening of legislative frameworks ; waste management ; coastal area management ; and to a lesser extent , the preservation of biodiversity .  
A primary responsibility of the regional commissions is to provide advisory services and to strengthen regional networks by which Member States may exchange experience and information , and harmonize national economic , social , environmental and settlement policies and strategies - in particular those that have a critical cross-border impact on , inter alia , migration , shared coastal zones , river basins and ecosystems , watersheds , and pollution and waste management .  
As reported at the consultation of the whole , on 18 September 1996 , at approximately 0200 hours local time , a 350-ton , 106-foot military submarine was found about 100 feet offshore , grounded in shallow water near the coastal city of Kangnung , one of the major ports on the eastern coast of the Republic of Korea .  
Moreover , it was based on several recognized criteria , among them the drawing of a baseline in a way not to depart to any appreciable extent , from the direction of the coast , and also the coastal State 's right to consider the economic interests peculiar to the region concerned , the reality and importance of which are clearly evidenced by long usage . 
The coastal State may , pursuant to article 211 ( 6 ) , under the conditions stipulated therein , adopt special mandatory laws and regulations for the prevention , reduction and control of marine pollution in a clearly defined area in its exclusive economic zone where such special laws and regulations are required for recognized technical reasons in relation to its oceanography , ecology , resource use and maritime traffic conditions .  
According to Indonesia , the proposed axis lines are the result of years of careful study of various factors , such as : the need of international transportation and aviation in transiting Indonesian waters ; the hydrographic and natural marine conditions in and near the relevant axis lines ; the intensity of coastal and inter-island navigation and overflight ; the intensity of fishing activities , particularly of local artisanal fishermen ; the existence of oil and gas exploration and exploitation ;  
Furthermore , there was general agreement that the incentives regarding commercial value , contained in some national salvage law , should not be included in the future instrument ; that warships should be excluded from the scope of application of the instrument ; that an approach based on flag State jurisdiction , and port State jurisdiction , supplemented by existing coastal State jurisdiction , was the more acceptable solution for enforcement ;  
Among other actions , the Subcommittee agreed that the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities would be considered as the cooperative programme framework for programme areas A ( integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas , including exclusive economic zones ) and B ( i ) ( marine environmental protection : land-based sources ) .  
It endorsed the Secretary-General 's initiative to convene a Special Consultative Meeting of entities involved with the carriage of materials subject to the 1993 INF Code and the coastal States concerned for the purpose of sharing information , concerns and ideas and to gain a better understanding of the safety and environmental aspects involved .  
The group of experts on marine and coastal biodiversity , established pursuant to decision II / 10 of the Second Conference of Parties , has not been able to meet as planned ; however , the first step has been achieved in drawing up a roster of nominated experts from which the group will be composed .  
SBSTTA has recommended that this expert group should concentrate on determining the following areas where the Biodiversity Convention can have the greatest effect : integrated marine and coastal area management , marine and coastal protected areas , sustainable use of coastal and marine living resources , mariculture and alien species . 193 Other items of particular note discussed by SBSTTA included the economic valuation of biological diversity and its components , in particular in relation to access to genetic resources ( art . 15 of the Convention ) .  
Calls upon States to take the responsibility , consistent with their obligations under international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and resolution 49 / 116 , to take measures to ensure that no fishing vessels entitled to fly their national flags fish in areas under the national jurisdiction of other States unless duly authorized by the competent authorities of the coastal State or States concerned ; such authorized fishing operations should be carried out in accordance with the conditions set out in the authorization ;  
Viet Nam will continue its consistent policy of settling disputes through negotiation in the spirit of equality , mutual respect and understanding , with due respect to international law , particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , and to the sovereign rights and jurisdiction of coastal States over their respective continental shelves and exclusive economic zones .  
The 1982 Convention , although the most universal and extensive instrument on the law of the sea , nevertheless can not fully reflect the growing concern of coastal States at the state of living marine resources , which often fall victim to uncontrolled and scientifically unsound harvesting on the high seas .  
the three topics mentioned in paragraph 249 of the Commission 's report - diplomatic protection ; ownership of wrecks ; and unilateral acts of States - should be topics of study , although he did not agree with the views outlined in note 9 of addendum 2 of the annexes , since the jurisdiction of the coastal State beyond its territorial sea and contiguous zone was guaranteed by the residual competence granted to it under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea .  
Barbados is improving living conditions by revitalizing the main town centres , developing systems of physical planning and coastal management , and promoting public-private partnerships , disposing of waste and extending water resources .  
For many of today 's major environment and development concerns , the sciences ( including the social and human sciences ) are essential in detecting and analysing the problem , in identifying solutions and in ensuring scientifically sound action .  This has been particularly evident for the ozone depletion issue , and increasingly also for other issues such as climate change , erosion of biological diversity and water and coastal pollution .  
A number of important initiatives have been launched to develop high-level scientific capacities in developing countries ( with particular reference to the least developed countries ) so as to enable these countries to address local problems and to participate fully in regional and international activities related to important issues such as sustainable water and coastal zone management , global change and the conservation and sustainable utilization of biodiversity .  
For instance , there is need to identify ecologically endangered areas where overexploitation of natural resources and rapid population growth create serious problems : forested uplands , coastal fishing areas , small-holder agriculture in lowland areas , arid grazing lands and tropical forests .  
Priority research5 should focus on : coastal areas where populations are growing rapidly and critical resources are being depleted at an accelerated rate , such as on highly urbanized coasts ; soil erosion and desertification , linked with inappropriate land-use practices often brought on by migration patterns ; water scarcity , and misuse and pollution of water resources in both rural and urban areas ; and deforestation resulting from inappropriate shifting cultivation patterns , fuelwood demands , and conversion of forests in upland areas to other uses , linked with demographic pressures among the poorest groups in society .  
Furthermore , they have established programmes to develop the principles of the CBD and facilitate their implementation : on coastal and marine biodiversity ; forest biodiversity ; agricultural biodiversity ; the biodiversity of inland waters ; the rights of indigenous and local communities under the CBD ; and the equitable sharing of the benefits of biodiversity .  
In particular , Parties have through the CBD been actively pursuing a strategy of establishing the legal basis to ensure the integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas , including exclusive economic zones ( programme area A ) and sustainable use and conservation of marine living resources under national jurisdiction ( programme area D ) .  
Recognizing the respect for the environment accorded by the cultures of indigenous peoples of the Americas , and considering the special relationship between the indigenous peoples and the environment , lands , resources and territories on which they live and their natural resources .  Recognizing that in many indigenous cultures , traditional collective systems for control and use of land and territory and resources , including bodies of water and coastal areas , are a necessary condition for their survival , social organization , development and their individual and collective well-being . . .  
Urge all SAARC countries to preserve rare , fragile , ecologically sensitive coastal and marine ecosystems , such as mangroves , coral reefs , sea-grass beds , etc . , for conservation and sustainable use of the resources under national jurisdiction .  
Continuing the international dialogue on the issues of conservation and sustainable use of coastal and marine biodiversity and agricultural biological diversity was also very important , since both issues were essential to food security , which was the focus of the forthcoming World Food Summit ; the work being undertaken by the Intergovernmental Panel on forests was likewise crucial to that discussion .  
In view of the above-mentioned points , my Government considers paragraph 1 of the joint statement signed by the Presidents of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan relating to " the delimitation of administrative and territorial borders along a line running through the middle of the Sea " as a step in violation of the existing legal regime and declares that it bears no legal value and shall not affect , directly or indirectly , the existing legal regime and any future agreement that may be concluded among the five coastal States .  
There is a need for concerted action by all countries and for improved cooperation to assist developing countries in implementing the relevant agreements and instruments in order that they may participate effectively in the sustainable use , conservation and management of their fishery resources , as provided for in the Convention and other international legal instruments , and achieve integrated coastal zone management .  
The coastal State is also given the exclusive right to construct and to authorize and regulate the construction , operation and use of artificial islands.a * The legal status of offshore installations , the legislation applicable to workers thereon , the type of jurisdiction exercised by States over such installations and the possible obligations arising from licensing of the installation for the purposes of exploration and exploitation continue to be of concern to ILO , and work begun on this subject has not yet been completed . 
Thus , the degree to which coastal States can enforce IMO regulations in respect of foreign ships in innocent passage in their territorial waters or navigating the exclusive economic zone is a subject matter to be established by national law drafted in accordance with the provisions of UNCLOS .  
The Republic of Korea reported that it had taken measures to ensure that no vessels entitled to fly its flag were engaged in fishing in areas under the jurisdiction of other States , unless duly authorized by the competent authorities of the coastal State concerned .  
Earth observation of coastal regions were still in a pre-operational stage , key constraints being the lack of continuously operational Ocean Colour Sensors , lack of appropriate algorithms with local and timely calibration , low frequency of measurements , difficult access to data , unfriendly integration scheme with other data sources and poor information dissemination .  
Its major commercial applications included coastal zone and environmental monitoring , marine navigation , offshore oil and gas operation , natural disaster mitigation and coastal and deep ocean fishing .  
Barbados is improving living conditions by revitalizing the main town centres , developing systems of physical planning and coastal management , and promoting partnerships between the public and private sector , disposing of waste and extending water resources .  
In this regard , it should be emphasized that the Jakarta Mandate covering the following areas : integrated marine and coastal area management ; marine and coastal protected areas ; sustainable use of marine and coastal living resources ; and mariculture and alien species called , inter alia , for the effective implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity concerning marine and coastal biodiversity questions .  
Article 76 of the Convention requires that information on the limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured shall be submitted by the coastal State to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf set up under annex II on the basis of equitable geographical representation .  
Across all small island developing States , however , a major area of concern will continue to be the impact of climate change and sea level rise on coastal areas , and the consequent need for costly remedial and protective measures .  
But the individual and collective efforts of small island developing States have so far made little or no real impact on the magnitude of the problems facing them , including the more frequent occurrence of hurricanes , storm surges and coastal inundation , and the resulting loss of valuable economic resources and marine biodiversity stocks .  
Evidence is strong that most of the increase is attributable to human activity , in particular , to fossil fuel combustion . 8 Continuation of these emission trends poses serious , though uncertain , risks of global and regional climate change , leading to unpredictable rises in sea level , inundation of low-lying coastal areas , migration of ecosystems and disruption of agriculture .  
Calls upon States to take the responsibility , consistent with their obligations under international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea2 and resolution 49 / 116 , to take measures to ensure that no fishing vessels entitled to fly their national flags fish in areas under the national jurisdiction of other States unless duly authorized by the competent authorities of the coastal State or States concerned ; such authorized fishing operations should be carried out in accordance with the conditions set out in the authorization ;  
The main issues that have emerged during SBSTTA sessions have been detailed technical issues , such as how to promote access to and transfer of technology , the development of monitoring systems and assessments , and issues dealing with agricultural , terrestrial , marine and coastal biodiversity and traditional knowledge .  
While legal and institutional instruments have definitely improved the basis for sustainable development of oceans and coastal areas , implementation lags behind owing , among other things , to ( a ) the difficulty in making political decisions regarding resources and wealth allocation ; ( b ) the difficulty of improving inadequate or inefficient institutions ; and ( c ) in many cases , difficulties in meeting the related financial commitments .  
Dependence on aquaculture ( mainly inland ) for an important part of future net increases in fish consumption will require improved management of freshwater resources , protection of aquaculture sites from industrial and urban pollution , as well as protection of coastal areas , wetlands and mangrove swamps from irresponsible coastal aquaculture practices .  
Noting that El Ni �� has a recurring character and has produced disastrous effects , resulting in large material , economic , human and environmental losses , with particular impact in the coastal countries of the Pacific Ocean , especially in developing countries ,  
Additional views expressed were that the rules should address the issue of whether a member of the Commission who was a national of a coastal State making a submission could not serve in the subcommission considering that State 's submission while another member of the Commission who was a national of an adjacent or opposite State served in the subcommission ; that the Commission , being an independent body , might wish to consider the potential usefulness of drawing upon outside expertise ; however , the latter view was not shared by others .  
There is a need for concerted action by all countries and for improved cooperation to assist developing countries in implementing the relevant agreements and instruments in order that they may participate effectively in the sustainable use , conservation and management of their fishery resources , as provided for in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and other international legal instruments , and achieve integrated coastal zone management . 
We also recognized that the problems of the environment , such as global warming , the destruction of coastal and marine ecosystems , the degradation of forests , desertification and the overuse of mineral resources are concerns not of any one nation or continent , but of the entire international community .  
The charts and relevant information , including geodetic data , describing the outer limits of the continental shelf , which are deposited by the coastal State with the Secretary-General and which are to be given due publicity by the Secretary-General in accordance with article 76 , paragraph 9 , of the Convention , shall cease to be classified as confidential , if they had been so classified earlier , upon their receipt by the Secretary-General .  
Promote and co-operate in providing the necessary financial and technological resources for the sustainable management , conservation and enhancement , as appropriate , of sinks and reservoirs of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol , including biomass , forests and oceans as well as other terrestrial , coastal and marine ecosystems .  
The effects of global warming are of grave concern to small islands like ours , whose coastal areas may become submerged , and whose protective coral reefs are at risk of total destruction .  
We equally recognize that sustainable development in coastal areas is dependent upon an adequate understanding of the interaction between natural assets and social and human capital .  
Noting that El Nino has a recurring character and has produced disastrous effects , resulting in large material , economic , human and environmental losses , with particular impact in the coastal countries of the Pacific Ocean , especially in developing countries ,  
Confidential material so classified by the coastal State shall remain confidential after consideration of the submission is concluded unless decided otherwise by the Commission with the written consent of the coastal State concerned .  
The Commission will also consider as admissible evidence , synthetic bathymetric data derived from cartographic and analog sources officially recognized by the coastal State .  
Article 76 , paragraph 7 , states that " the coastal State shall delineate the outer limits of its continental shelf . . . by straight lines not exceeding 60 nautical miles in length , connecting fixed points . . . " .  
In the Caribbean , in collaboration with selected regional institutions , OAS is currently providing technical assistance for the execution of three major projects : assessment of coastal and marine problems ; assessment of the current state of effluent disposal in the region ; and comprehensive review of integrated coastal zone management legislative systems .  
Since sectoral approaches to coastal development have not proven effective in arresting its deterioration , the concept of integrated coastal area management ( ICAM ) has gained recognition in recent years as a comprehensive , ecosystem-based approach to sustainable development and environmental conservation .  
The Coastal Module Panel of GOOS has begun the design of optimal monitoring and forecasting systems for coastal seas , focusing on preserving healthy coastal environments , promoting sustainable use of resources , mitigating coastal hazards , and enabling safe and efficient marine operations .  
Such a situation would create additional pressure on developing countries , including small island developing States , to meet their growing domestic demand for fish as food on the one hand a problem likely to be aggravated by declining productivity of coastal fisheries due to coral reef degradation , as previously discussed and to increase their share of international markets on the other .  
The Global Programme of Action states at the outset that its implementation will require new approaches by and new forms of collaboration among Governments , organizations and institutions with responsibilities and expertise relevant to marine and coastal areas , at all levels national , regional and global including the promotion of innovative financial mechanisms to generate needed resources .  
The disposal of untreated effluents into surrounding areas of land and sea often leads to the pollution of scarce inland freshwater resources , loss of valuable marine life , destruction of coral reefs and the silting and erosion of coastal beaches .  
There was considerable emphasis on the need for improved scientific understanding of the marine environment as a fundamental basis for sound decision-making , improved human well-being and prevention of environmental degradation including in coastal areas .  
In discussing integrated coastal zone management , participants agreed that there were real biophysical limits to capacity in any particular location as well as cultural limits that should be determined at the local level by the local community .  
Participants agreed that the Commission on Sustainable Development should facilitate funding from international agencies such as the World Bank and from national Governments for integrated environmental , social and economic research on best management practices in regard to design , development and management of tourism projects in coastal regions .  
To create the appropriate institutional , legal , economic , social and environmental framework by developing and applying a mix of instruments , as appropriate , such as integrated land-use planning and coastal zone management , economic instruments , social and environmental impact assessment for tourist facilities , including gender aspects , and voluntary initiatives and agreements ;  
Invites relevant agencies , particularly the International Maritime Organization , to evaluate whether existing regulations on marine pollution and compliance with them are sufficient to provide adequate protection to fragile coastal zones from adverse impacts as a result of tourist vessel activities ;  
The Commission invited all organizations concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider whether their programmes of work provided sufficient consideration of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review what needed to be done to ensure adequate prediction and understanding of the impacts on coastal and marine areas of phenomena such as El Nio .  
Promoting the formulation , adoption and implementation of appropriate technical , institutional , administrative and legal measures contributing to improved protection of marine and coastal environment , including the rational use and conservation of their resources .  
Invited all intergovernmental agencies concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider , within their respective mandates , whether their programmes of work make sufficient allowance for considerations of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review through the various coordination arrangements what more needs to be done to ensure adequate understanding of the prediction of coastal and marine impacts of such phenomena as El Nio .  
Technological and human-induced ecological hazards , such as accidental releases of chemicals in surface water catchments , dumping of toxic and radioactive materials in coastal zones or on the high seas , and hydrological and climatic problems created by excessive withdrawals from large water bodies etc . add to or complicate problems related to natural hazards , particularly in CIS countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia . 
Satellite data are used operationally to lessen the impact of natural disasters such as tropical cyclones , flash floods , heavy snowstorms , volcanic ash clouds , sea ice , toxic effects on coastal waters and harmful algal blooms .  
Strengthening of national capacity for the development of a methodology or guidelines for sound practices and techniques suitable for small island developing States , for achieving the integrated management and sustainable development of the coastal and marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , building on existing experience in that area ;  
Greater regional coordination in management and monitoring , control and surveillance , including vessel monitoring systems and enforcement , consistent with international agreements of coastal countries and fishing countries in the marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , including the management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks ;  
No doubt the shared use of facilities increases the legal and jurisdictional complexities of project financing , but increasing experience on how to tackle ownership issues has been gained through international water-sharing projects . 47 Also , the private financing of multi-country infrastructure projects creates complementary interests between landlocked and coastal countries as transit infrastructure directly generates foreign exchange . 
The continental shelf of a coastal State comprises the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin , or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend up to that distance .  
The coastal State shall delineate the outer limits of its continental shelf , where that shelf extends beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured , by straight lines not exceeding 60 nautical miles in length , connecting fixed points , defined by coordinates of latitude and longitude .  
Information on the limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured shall be submitted by the coastal State to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf set up under Annex II on the basis of equitable geographical representation .  
The limits of the shelf established by a coastal State on the basis of these recommendations shall be final and binding .  9 .  The coastal State shall deposit with the Secretary-General of the United Nations charts and relevant information , including geodetic data , permanently describing the outer limits of its continental shelf .  
GOOS aims to meet the need for : ( a ) forecasting climate variability and change ; ( b ) assessing the state of health of the marine environment and its resources ( including the coastal zone ) ; and ( c ) supporting an improved decision-making and management process which takes into account potential natural and man-made changes in the environment and their effects on human health and resources .  
The Caribbean region and sea possessed a number of unique features which justified according them priority attention : exceptional biological diversity , highly fragile ecosystems and heavy reliance by most of the countries of the region on the coastal land and marine environment in order to achieve sustainable development .  
This hurricane is unusual not only for its lateness and ferocious winds , but also because it spreads its force selectively and has caused sea level rise and huge , mountainous waves that have completely destroyed the coastal area in my country and others , where the population is concentrated . 
As you said , Sir , a very great tragedy has occurred in Venezuela as a result because of the persistent rains that have fallen throughout the year in the central part of the country , which , on 16 December , led to massive flooding and mudslides in the central mountain range , affecting densely populated regions , particularly the central coastal regions near the capital city and where the country ' s main airport and port are located .  
Strengthening of national capacity for the development of a methodology or guidelines for sound practices and techniques suitable for small island developing States , for achieving the integrated management and sustainable development of the coastal and marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , building on existing experience in that area ;  
Greater regional coordination in management and monitoring , control and surveillance , including vessel monitoring systems and enforcement , consistent with international agreements of coastal countries and fishing countries in the marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , including the management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks ;  
Indeed , the issues of climate change , soil erosion , global warming , sea level rise , coastal and marine resources , natural and environmental disasters , biodiversity resources , waste management and freshwater resources are among those that all developing countries face , in particular small island nations , in an increasingly competitive global economy .  
Invites all intergovernmental agencies concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider , within their respective mandates , whether their programmes of work make sufficient allowance for considerations of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review through the various coordination arrangements what more needs to be done to ensure adequate understanding of the prediction and coastal and marine impacts of such phenomena as the El Nio phenomenon .  
Governments at all levels , the private sector and other major groups as defined in Agenda 21 are urged to cooperate in developing waste collection systems and disposal facilities , and developing programmes for prevention , minimization and recycling of waste , to safeguard and improve the quality of life in human settlements and coastal regions in all countries , especially in developing countries .  
To create the appropriate institutional , legal , economic , social and environmental framework by developing and applying a mix of instruments , as appropriate , such as integrated land-use planning and coastal zone management , economic instruments , social and environmental impact assessment for tourist facilities , including gender aspects , and voluntary initiatives and agreements ;  
The Commission invites relevant agencies , particularly the International Maritime Organization , to evaluate whether existing regulations on marine pollution and compliance with them are sufficient to provide adequate protection to fragile coastal zones from adverse impacts as a result of tourist vessel activities .  
The disposal of untreated effluents into surrounding areas of land and sea often leads to the pollution of scarce inland freshwater resources , loss of valuable marine life , destruction of coral reefs and the silting and erosion of coastal beaches .  
In discussing integrated coastal zone management , participants agreed that there were real biophysical limits to capacity in any particular location as well as cultural limits that should be determined at the local level by the local community .  
Participants agreed that the Commission on Sustainable Development should facilitate funding from international agencies such as the World Bank and from national Governments for integrated environmental , social and economic research on best management practices in regard to design , development and management of tourism projects in coastal regions .  
There was considerable emphasis on the need for improved scientific understanding of the marine environment as a fundamental basis for sound decision-making , improved human well-being and prevention of environmental degradation including in coastal areas .  
In terms of programme areas covered by both bilateral and multilateral commitments , those that received larger shares were human resource development , transport and communication , freshwater resources , land resources , coastal and marine resources , and energy resources .  
In the light of the immense potential of space remote sensing in providing vital input for soil conservation , water resources , management , forest monitoring , land management , coastal and river basin protection , agriculture and drought management , and flood mapping and sustainable integrated development , action must be initiated to promote intensive cooperation among various countries within the region to enable them to benefit from each others expertise .  
The first instance of the illegal entry of dangerous waste reported by the Brazilian authorities is that of four containers holding 68 , 332 kg of toxic wastes ( copper , zinc and other heavy metals ) which arrived in the coastal port of Santos ( State of So Paulo ) in December 1993 .  
Where untreated effluents are disposed into surrounding areas of land and sea , the result often is the pollution of scarce inland freshwater resources , the loss of valuable marine life , the destruction of coral reefs and the silting and erosion of coastal beaches .  
The inundation of coastal areas can result in : ( a ) loss of agricultural land , a common concern because agriculture is still the primary source of income in many small island developing States , and most agricultural land lies along the coastline , increasing its vulnerability to sea level rise ; ( b ) loss of exclusive economic zone ( EEZ ) , a common concern because sea level rise will also reduce the exclusive economic zone , thereby reducing the resource base .  
Pollution of marine and coastal areas from land-based sources of pollution is a major issue for small island developing States ; the pollution is largely from domestic sewage , industrial effluents and agricultural run-off ; in a few larger islands ( for example , Jamaica and some Melanesian countries ) , pollution from mining effluent is also a cause for concern ;  
At the regional level , ongoing activities conducive to the sustainable management of coastal and marine resources include training of personnel , acquisition of equipment and facilities , production of stock assessment data and other resource inventories , upgrading of skills for management of marine parks , studies on pollution , information exchange and sharing of experience from within and outside the regions , and production of ICAM plans using regional guidelines .  
Small island developing States also have been the recipients of formal and informal training efforts to improve their capacity to implement sustainable coastal and marine resource management from regional and international institutions .  
Most efforts on integrated coastal area management , though technically innovative and successful in various cases , have evolved at the local level , leaving them isolated from the mainstream of national development planning ; furthermore , such efforts have not attracted substantial funding , making the initiatives less effective than they could be ;  
Building adequate manpower with the requisite level of skill for effective integrated island management ; small island developing States should assess their training needs and develop a training programme , involving the private sector , non-governmental organizations and Governments ; training should not be limited to technical experts ; it should include local communities , for example , fishermen , tourist hotel operators , managers of industries located in coastal regions and farmers ;  
Specialized institutions devoted to specific sectors should be established and provided with adequate staff and budgetary resources for their operations ; such institutions are required particularly to deal with major resource conservation issues , such as those involving fisheries , coastal zones and biodiversity ;  
The present section summarizes , by region and by sea , the main priorities and challenges , developments in decision-making , and activities at the national level to promote integrated coastal zone management , marine environment protection , and sustainable use and conservation of marine living resources .  
Among the main concerns in the region are unsustainable exploitation and environmental degradation of those natural resources on which rural communities depend ; optimized use of land ; living conditions of coastal people ; insufficiently treated urban wastes , oil pollution and coastal erosion .  
The major challenges of the region are to secure a healthy sea environment at a time when economic recovery is being pursued ; completion of effective regulatory and institutional frameworks , particularly for integrated coastal zone management and sustainable fisheries ; and enhancement of public awareness and cooperation between stakeholders .  
Losses in biodiversity and economic growth due to unplanned activities related to dredging , lack of clear property rights and control on natural resources , the low level of investments , and lack of participation in decision-making are conditions that have brought integrated coastal zone management onto the political agenda , and programmes are gradually being developed .  
In terms of coverage of programme areas at the global level by both bilateral and multilateral commitments , those that received large shares were human resources development , transport and communications , freshwater resources , land resources , coastal and marine resources and energy resources .  
For instance , problems of water supply in terms of both quantity and quality , environmentally sound management of solid and liquid wastes , adaptation to climate change and sea level rise , integrated management of coastal zones , prevention or minimization of natural and environmental disasters among others , all call for specific skills , without which small island developing States even with the highest level of political will can not hope to solve them .  
Without coordinated international efforts , illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing will severely undermine the economic base , food security and , above all , human security of coastal States , and in particular small island developing States .  
Those delegations expressed the view that such re-entry constituted a serious threat to human security and the economic activities of coastal States and threatened the marine environment and its natural resources .  
Noting the importance that the global meetings of regional seas conventions and action plans have taken as a consultative mechanism for the revitalization of Regional Seas Programme , including the strengthening of partnerships with international organizations dedicated to marine and coastal issues and the establishment of programmatic linkages with global environmental conventions and related agreements ,  
The basic consent provision is contained in article 246 , paragraphs 1 and 2 , whereby the coastal State in the exercise of its jurisdiction has the right to regulate , authorize and conduct marine scientific research in its exclusive economic zone and on its continental shelf in accordance with relevant provisions of the Convention .  
Recognizing that low-lying and other small island countries , countries with low-lying coastal , arid and semi-arid areas or areas liable to floods , drought and desertification , and developing countries with fragile mountainous ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change ,  
While some , particularly in the temperate latitudes , have reported positive impacts in agriculture , overall the impact of climate change is expected to be mixed , and to be largely negative in tropical , coastal and mountain areas . 
Climate change had , among other things , increased the scarcity and diminished the quality of fresh water and had contributed to the degradation of coastal zones and marine ecosystems in all CARICOM member countries , which therefore continued to seek the support of the United Nations for a special regime for the Caribbean Sea .
