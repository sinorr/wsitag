However , China is still much engaged in her own domestic development , and has limited national strength .  For this reason we are selecting those key areas or key links that have favorable prospects , where the degree of industrial linkage will be significant , and which can drive the entire mechanism for critical breakthroughs , and through these we will vigorously strive to realize a leap in high-tech development .  
At the special symposium on China held on the 29th , Vice Premier Wu Bangguo delivered a speech entitled " China 's Economy Gears To the 21st Century " and introduced to the participants the strategic key points of China 's future economic development , which include the strategic readjustments of the economic structure and the implementation of the strategy to open up the western region and other grand plans .

Xiang stated : In 1999 , the Ministry of Finance also organized forces to launch a specialized examination on how specialized funds had been managed or spent , such as funds earmarked for national bonds , funds earmarked as subsidies for key flood control projects , funds earmarked for water conservancy works , and central financial funds earmarked for helping the poor ; adopted punitive measures to deal with exposed problems in a timely fashion ; and made public through the news media a number of typical cases .  
To successfully reinforce the ideological and political work , the key is to practice what one preaches .  Communist party members must set an example for the entire society to follow , while leading cadres are required to play an exemplary role for the whole party .  
Nationalities affairs commissions at all levels must seize the opportunity , always focus on economic construction as the center , proceed from the state 's major political guideline and from the actual circumstances of ethnic areas in the western part of the country , research into the policy and measures for expediting the development of ethnic areas , study specific issues such as reform and opening up , social progress , and key tasks that aim to help impoverished areas , and properly handle the relationship between development and unity .  
We face arduous tasks in strengthening and improving our ideological and political work in the new period .  There are many problems that need studying .  The key issue is to strengthen the ideals and beliefs of the broad masses of Party members , cadres , and the people through strong and effective ideological and political work .  
Currently , we are in an important historical period at the turn of two centuries .  Our country 's reform is in the period of storming the fortifications .  Faced with the changeable situation in the world and various complicated social phenomena , some people are at a loss and puzzled .  This is not strange .  The key is that our ideological and political work must adapt to the new situations in China and abroad .  The work must adapt to new changes in our society , politics , economy and cultural lives .  
and the major measures should conform to such requirements as strengthening macro-economic control and regulation , readjusting the structure of the economy , making sound arrangements for the state 's key constructions , taking earnest steps to improve the living standards of the people , enhancing the level of employment , providing sound social securities , and bringing about a sustainable growth . "  
We need to focus on the key strategic plans for national economic development , mobilizing the advantage of overseas Chinese resources to the service of the strategies of revitalizing China through science and education and sharply developing western China .  
main measures to be taken should meet the requirements of strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control , optimizing the economic structure , properly scheduling key state projects , truly improving the people 's livelihood , actively increasing employment , ensuring social insurance work , and ensuring sustainable development .

Now , our most important urgent task is that we must fundamentally change the situation that some grassroots Party organizations are weak and lax .  They key in changing this situation is that we must establish and perfect systems which ensure the healthy development of grass-roots Party organizations .  
Facing the contradiction that has appeared , between periodic and structural surplus versus a domestic market potential that is a long way from being realized , and facing the contradiction that while market demand for a large quantity of commodities is insufficient , we still rely on imports for some special products , especially key technical equipment , we must be determined to solve some outstanding problems such as irrational economic structure .  
China 's household electrical appliance industry digested and absorbed foreign technology brought in through a variety of ways - - such as engaging in cooperative production with foreign name-brand enterprises and importing key installations as well as packages of technology and production lines - - and made innovations to greatly narrow the gap between Chinese and advanced international levels , thereby quickening the pace of development .  
He Guoqiang , secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee , answered : Chongqing is the only municipality in western regions as well as the key industrial and commercial city in the southwest region .

One of major policies adopted at the meeting is to , in combination with the efforts of state-owned banks to handle their bad assets with concentrated efforts , introduce the practice of changing debt to equity by means of financial assets management companies and resolve the problem of an unduly high ratio of liabilities in a number of key state enterprises which have marketable products and enjoy sound development prospects , but have nevertheless landed in difficulty because of their unduly high ratio of liabilities .  
We must keep a sober mind on this issue .  The leading comrades of the State Council have stressed the need for many times to make a proper use of the practice of " changing debt into equity , " for it is an effective means for us to assist key state enterprises with well-marketable products , a sound management foundation , and a broad development prospect to lower their liabilities ratio and to turn their deficits into profits .

At the same time , starting with the first five-year plan , the central authorities concentrated finances to invest in a number of key construction projects ; within quite a short time we built up an independent and relatively complete industrial system and national economic system on the backward " poor and blank " foundation left over from old China .  
For this purpose , a " key construction project of military academies " will be activated , under which support will be given to the development of selected key areas with concentrated forces : Within 10 years ' time , about 10 military academies and a number of branches of learning are expected to reach or approach the advanced national level , among which some are expected to reach or approach the advanced international level ;  
The 10-year history of Pudong development also demonstrates the adherence to the strategy of Emphasizing both on economy and ideology and of the ideological education of stressing both spiritual civilization and material civilization as a key reason of the successful development of Pudong . The adherence also is the guarantee of a Party free of corruption , and of a fine social mood .  The Pudong development project stuck to the principle of To accelerate the first-class development project with first-class Party construction .  
The number one men of the party and government occupy the key position in the leadership groups and shoulder heavy responsibilities ; if supervision over them is lost , they will become privileged figures without control or constraint , which will result in suggestions being stifled , criticism being suppressed , and healthy trends suffering setbacks , and it will be impossible to curb the phenomena of corruption .

As the majority of our products are of intermediate or low standard , we have had to import core key products from abroad ( such as CPU , DSP for mobile telecommunications , and so on ) .  Moreover , our country 's integrated circuits industry has also lagged far behind the international standard in terms of its seal and package technology .  
The spatial data infrastructure is the key to building the digitized battlefield .  There is a great deal of intricate and complex battlespace data related to military operations , but the primary spatial data includes geodetic references , digital orthographic projection maps , digital elevation models , and digital topographic maps , etc .  
They should make joint efforts in running schools and in tackling key technical problems .  We should enable military schools gear toward the world by gradually expanding their exchanges and cooperation with their foreign counterparts .  We should make bold efforts in learning and borrowing advanced ideas and useful experiences from foreign military academies by exchanging students and conducting scientific research cooperation with them .  
After the new technologies and new methods of operation produced through the academy and troops ' joint effort in tackling key problems were popularized and applied in the various relevant units , the scientific and technological content of army training have greatly increased .  As a result , troop training through science and technology , in which the troops under training strike extreme low-altitude , high-speed targets with air defense missiles , has gotten over its " bottleneck " and is developing in the direction of high quality and greater depth .  
The party and Government of the DPRK have attached extremely great importance to the scientific and technological investment in agricultural production and have organized the National Academy of Sciences , the Academy of Agricultural Sciences , the " shock team " composed of outstanding scientific and technological personnel selected from universities of agriculture , and some other scientific research institutes to cultivate improved varieties of crops and tackle the key problems in agricultural production .

He stressed the need to reinforce the building of party branches according to the " three represents " requirements , and the fundamental key lies in properly performing the function of exercising political leadership , thus guaranteeing the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces and guaranteeing the fulfillment of all tasks with medical service as the central link .  
Although it is still difficult to set a standard for quantification of economic globalization , viewed from the angle of nature , at least the following three characteristics are important .  The global distribution of key economic elements has become very convenient and rapid ;  
Faced with the new situation where science and technology are developing rapidly and high technology is being applied extensively in the military field , our army should train a large number of new-type military personnel who are militarily and politically competent and who have acquired good command of modern scientific and cultural knowledge .  This is the key for our army to gain the initiative in future military struggles and shoulder the historical missions entrusted by the party and the people .  
Strengthen examination and inspection over coordinated educational activities following introduction of information technology .  Make timely organization of such activities as selection of proper topics , collective classes , key rehearsals , and on-the-spot visits .  It is necessary to ensure the concentration of topics and the correct subject contents .  
Owing to various factors , such as historical and geographic conditions , most of our country 's key economic bases are distributed in economically developed coastal areas , areas with transport facilities , and large and medium-sized inland cities .  Thus , it will be easy for enemies to destroy in a concentrated manner our closely distributed economic bases .  
Accordingly , to adapt to the changing circumstances and promote the long-term dynamic stability in our international balance of payments , as well as safeguarding national economic security and the interests of foreign investors , we must concentrate hard on the key issue of improving the quality of utilization of foreign capital .  
and the rate of urban alarm coverage has touched 98 percent in key PAD cities .

Equipped with such a portable tent , a patrol or inspection team is capable of taking a rest or staying in an area at any time , should it fail to reach a destination in time or encounter bad weather , and this has also enhanced the regiment 's control over some key areas or sandy areas , to which access is difficult .  
In the Ninth Five-Year Plan , the PLA training institutions at the postgraduate level built a number of key academies or schools ; developed a batch of key academic disciplines ; and set up a number of key laboratories as well , and this was a major decision made by the Central Military Commission .  
In accordance with unified arrangements laid down by the Central Military Commission , the general departments selected and built in a centralized way a batch of key academic disciplines , key laboratories , or key academies or schools on the basis of a scientific forecast and sufficient demonstration .  Over the past five years , various major units , academies , or schools charged with the task of building key projects have persistently followed a correct direction ;  
- - Building a contingent of highly qualified instructors and training a batch of qualified personnel specializing in various disciplines for higher levels .  Various units charged with the task of building key projects have all along taken training a rationally structured contingent of highly qualified instructors as the focus of their principal endeavors ; have mapped out or implemented a series of policy measures for absorbing or training qualified personnel for higher levels ;  
During the Clinton years , as the US economy was steadily strong , and salary increases for the non-military sector rose faster than did the military 's , making the military less attractive .  This made many talented people reluctant to serve in the armed forces , and various armed forces personnel in key positions to decide against making it a career .  This affected the overall quality of the US armed forces .  
It is understood that , during the 15 years of the " 863 " Plan , it has achieved a large number of world class research results .  It has made breakthroughs on and mastered a number of key technologies , closing our gap with the advanced world level , to develop a number of high-tech industrial growth-points .  It has sharply promoted China 's development of high technology and high-tech industry , providing high-tech support for upgrading traditional industry .  
Third , thanks to the close cooperation between the key techniques developed during the implementation of the " 863 " Project and the industrial circle , China has created products with its own intellectual property rights in such hot point fields of international high-tech competition as biological engineering medicine , communications equipment , high-performance computers , Chinese information processing platform , artificial crystal , photoelectron material and apparatuses .  
China fully put into play the extensive knowledge of its vast satellite engineering contingent .  Under fairly poor conditions , we constantly attacked key technologies , scoring a series of major achievements in satellite engineering , and at the same time constantly perfecting and strengthening all kinds of fundamental work in satellite engineering .  
Focusing on the objective conditions of limited national investment , and a fairly small number of satellites to design and manufacture , we must correctly select development paths where the technological leaps are the greatest , strengthening the advance research of key technologies , and constantly realizing fairly large technological advances , raising by the greatest margin the level of satellite engineering .  
Thereby , the key to consolidating and developing the current gratifying situation , realizing objectives in the Outline of the 10th Five-Year Plan , and fulfilling the three major historical tasks in the new century hinges on further implementing the important thinking of the " three represents " as put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin . Besides , the party should achieve its ideological and organizational construction , improve its work styles , and ceaselessly improve its leadership , its ruling level , and its capability of resisting corruption and preventing peaceful evolution .  
To realize the goal , it is necessary to make development our key theme , restructuring our key path , reform , opening up , scientific and technological progress our driving force , and raising the people 's standards of living our fundamental objective .  
In connection with Powell 's recent stream of indiscretions on various sensitive policies , which have even sparked off some diplomatic disputes , some media have pointed out that Powell 's frequent " indiscretions " on certain key issues , as the man in charge of foreign policy in the world 's sole " superpower , " may be deliberate , and that his aim in using " indiscretions " to explore reactions from various sides is very evident .  
Ever since it was activated , a networked information system built by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has played a key role in intensifying a series of specialized struggles waged by the public security organs across the country , including " pursuing fugitives " , " cracking down on abductors " , " striking at triad activities and weeding out local tyrants " , and so on .  
Dai Xianglong said : Deepening the reform of wholly state-owned commercial banks is key to the reform of China 's financial system .

While we pay attention to what we have achieved in construction of rural markets , we must also pay attention to the fact that the level of our rural markets is still low and they face such issues as unsound market systems and mechanisms , backward market infrastructures , slow development in the key elements of the market , low degrees of exports , depressed market prices , and low percentages of marketable commodities .  
After liberalized reforms , the systemic reform of the rural economy was a step ahead of that for city economies , but , due to a lack of changes in the agricultural management system by the government , the agricultural product markets and the agricultural key element markets have been split up among various departments such as farming , forestry , economic trade , foreign trade and labor .  In some areas , such administrative departments as animal husbandry , fisheries , and water resources also participate in the market divisions .  
After our WTO entry , our agricultural product markets and agricultural key element markets will be tied to the international market , and this will help us learn from others , introduce competitive mechanisms and regulations of the international market , and accelerate a sound and complete market system and operational mechanism for agricultural products and agricultural key elements .  
The overall quality of the main bodies of our rural markets does not measure up to that in developed western countries .  Many peasants and farm enterprises not only do not understand international agricultural trade , but also have little knowledge about the domestic market situations involving agricultural products and agricultural key elements .  It will be hard for them to participate in a timely and effective way in vigorous international market competition after our entry in the WTO .  
This requires us to first establish the focal points for the construction of large scale agricultural wholesale markets and specialized wholesale markets in cities and towns , supporting it by constructing market centers to connect the numerous peasants , and completing the whole chain by constructing such key elements of the market as capital , information , technology and labor forces , to form a unified market system in cities and towns that will ensure smooth circulation of goods between cities and towns .  
At this time , we must do an outstanding job on the following key links : first , we must entirely eliminate market barriers to realize self-motivated commodity trading and free commodity circulation and to ensure timely and rapid transportation of domestic agricultural products to the international market .  
However , there is one point which the MAC has neglected .  Not all the key industrial cities today are located in northern China , but are located in the southeastern coast of the mainland such as Jiangsu , Guangdong and Fujian . In terms of geographic distance , they can be formed into an industrial group with Taiwan . However , the political factors have made most people feel today that the distance between both sides of the strait is too far to be reached .  
The meeting pointed out : Rectifying and regulating the market economic order is an important measure to strengthen the work of social order , a pressing need to consolidate and develop the fine momentum of the national economy , an inevitable choice for improving the quality and competitiveness of the national economy , an essential condition for opening up yet wider to the outside world , a key move to establish and perfect the socialist market economic system , and an intrinsic demand for making full progress in social civilization .  
The meeting stressed : To rectify and regulate the market economic order , the key is that we must reach a common understanding .  All localities and departments must attach great importance to and conscientiously bring into effect all the demands made by the State Council . First , we must have stronger leadership , division of labor in a responsible way , close cooperation , and concerted efforts .

Recently , while the US stock market was falling again and again , Taiwan 's stock market did not follow suit and even slightly rose .  The key for this lay in the existence of the mainland conceptual stocks formed by the Taiwan businessmen 's investment in the mainland , the opening of B shares on the mainland stock market , and the booming real estate market on the mainland side .

To successfully reinforce the ideological and political work , the key is to practice what one preaches .  Communist party members must set an example for the entire society to follow , while leading cadres are required to play an exemplary role for the whole party .  
Nationalities affairs commissions at all levels must seize the opportunity , always focus on economic construction as the center , proceed from the state 's major political guideline and from the actual circumstances of ethnic areas in the western part of the country , research into the policy and measures for expediting the development of ethnic areas , study specific issues such as reform and opening up , social progress , and key tasks that aim to help impoverished areas , and properly handle the relationship between development and unity .  
We face arduous tasks in strengthening and improving our ideological and political work in the new period .  There are many problems that need studying .  The key issue is to strengthen the ideals and beliefs of the broad masses of Party members , cadres , and the people through strong and effective ideological and political work .  
Currently , we are in an important historical period at the turn of two centuries .  Our country 's reform is in the period of storming the fortifications .  Faced with the changeable situation in the world and various complicated social phenomena , some people are at a loss and puzzled .  This is not strange .  The key is that our ideological and political work must adapt to the new situations in China and abroad .  The work must adapt to new changes in our society , politics , economy and cultural lives .

At the same time , starting with the first five-year plan , the central authorities concentrated finances to invest in a number of key construction projects ; within quite a short time we built up an independent and relatively complete industrial system and national economic system on the backward " poor and blank " foundation left over from old China .  
For this purpose , a " key construction project of military academies " will be activated , under which support will be given to the development of selected key areas with concentrated forces : Within 10 years ' time , about 10 military academies and a number of branches of learning are expected to reach or approach the advanced national level , among which some are expected to reach or approach the advanced international level ;  
The 10-year history of Pudong development also demonstrates the adherence to the strategy of Emphasizing both on economy and ideology and of the ideological education of stressing both spiritual civilization and material civilization as a key reason of the successful development of Pudong .

Although it is still difficult to set a standard for quantification of economic globalization , viewed from the angle of nature , at least the following three characteristics are important .  The global distribution of key economic elements has become very convenient and rapid ;  
Faced with the new situation where science and technology are developing rapidly and high technology is being applied extensively in the military field , our army should train a large number of new-type military personnel who are militarily and politically competent and who have acquired good command of modern scientific and cultural knowledge .  This is the key for our army to gain the initiative in future military struggles and shoulder the historical missions entrusted by the party and the people .  
Strengthen examination and inspection over coordinated educational activities following introduction of information technology .  Make timely organization of such activities as selection of proper topics , collective classes , key rehearsals , and on-the-spot visits .  It is necessary to ensure the concentration of topics and the correct subject contents .  
Owing to various factors , such as historical and geographic conditions , most of our country 's key economic bases are distributed in economically developed coastal areas , areas with transport facilities , and large and medium-sized inland cities .  Thus , it will be easy for enemies to destroy in a concentrated manner our closely distributed economic bases .  
Accordingly , to adapt to the changing circumstances and promote the long-term dynamic stability in our international balance of payments , as well as safeguarding national economic security and the interests of foreign investors , we must concentrate hard on the key issue of improving the quality of utilization of foreign capital .

The army units stationed along the line have connected themselves to the line , thus entering a photoelectric era with one stride .  
In particular , we acted in line with urban defense operations , with all priority cities acting in line with their respective strategic status , to build a number of key projects such as mass concealed defense works and key strong points .  
As to making our civil air defense project construction more efficient , the government and military sectors need to make the building of underground bomb shelters a key part of urban construction , insisting on " mostly construction " .  We need to set growth rates in line with local realities to build a number of underground bomb shelters and integrated peacetime-wartime projects suited to new tactical and technical needs .  
The key cities of people 's air-defense across the country have generally established an air-raid siren test system , formulated and improved urban air-defense plan , and strengthened the people 's air-defense command system .  Various localities have organized and trained a total of several hundred-thousand air-defense workers specialized in dealing with the aftermath of air-raid , and thus created a backbone force capable of performing air-defense task in wartime and the task of disaster control in peacetime .

The resolution of key and difficult problems certainly does not lie in shouting slogans more loudly .  It lies in starting out with a recognition of reality , revolving around real problems of widespread concern to the broad masses of officers and soldiers , thinking of practical moves , taking real action , and working steadily and surely to solve the problems .  
Speeding up the establishment of a social security system is now the key issue in deepening enterprise reform and speeding up structural adjustment ; it has a bearing on efforts by enterprises to separate out their social functions and cut personnel to improve efficiency , on whether the reassignment of laid-off personnel to other jobs can move forward or not , and on whether the task of upgrading the industrial structure and improving enterprise efficiency can be accomplished smoothly .  It has become a critical task .

The Russian President , foreign minister , defense minister , and many other political and military leaders have recently pointed out in speeches or articles that the key factor determining international security in the new century is to maintain strategic stability , and the basis of this strategic stability is the ABM Treaty signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1972 .  
Equipped with such a portable tent , a patrol or inspection team is capable of taking a rest or staying in an area at any time , should it fail to reach a destination in time or encounter bad weather , and this has also enhanced the regiment 's control over some key areas or sandy areas , to which access is difficult .  
In the Ninth Five-Year Plan , the PLA training institutions at the postgraduate level built a number of key academies or schools ; developed a batch of key academic disciplines ; and set up a number of key laboratories as well , and this was a major decision made by the Central Military Commission .  
In accordance with unified arrangements laid down by the Central Military Commission , the general departments selected and built in a centralized way a batch of key academic disciplines , key laboratories , or key academies or schools on the basis of a scientific forecast and sufficient demonstration .  Over the past five years , various major units , academies , or schools charged with the task of building key projects have persistently followed a correct direction ;  
- - Building a contingent of highly qualified instructors and training a batch of qualified personnel specializing in various disciplines for higher levels .  Various units charged with the task of building key projects have all along taken training a rationally structured contingent of highly qualified instructors as the focus of their principal endeavors ; have mapped out or implemented a series of policy measures for absorbing or training qualified personnel for higher levels ;  
During the Clinton years , as the US economy was steadily strong , and salary increases for the non-military sector rose faster than did the military 's , making the military less attractive .

This affected the overall quality of the US armed forces .  
It is understood that , during the 15 years of the " 863 " Plan , it has achieved a large number of world class research results .  It has made breakthroughs on and mastered a number of key technologies , closing our gap with the advanced world level , to develop a number of high-tech industrial growth-points .  It has sharply promoted China 's development of high technology and high-tech industry , providing high-tech support for upgrading traditional industry .  
Third , thanks to the close cooperation between the key techniques developed during the implementation of the " 863 " Project and the industrial circle , China has created products with its own intellectual property rights in such hot point fields of international high-tech competition as biological engineering medicine , communications equipment , high-performance computers , Chinese information processing platform , artificial crystal , photoelectron material and apparatuses .  
China fully put into play the extensive knowledge of its vast satellite engineering contingent .  Under fairly poor conditions , we constantly attacked key technologies , scoring a series of major achievements in satellite engineering , and at the same time constantly perfecting and strengthening all kinds of fundamental work in satellite engineering .  
Focusing on the objective conditions of limited national investment , and a fairly small number of satellites to design and manufacture , we must correctly select development paths where the technological leaps are the greatest , strengthening the advance research of key technologies , and constantly realizing fairly large technological advances , raising by the greatest margin the level of satellite engineering .  
Thereby , the key to consolidating and developing the current gratifying situation , realizing objectives in the Outline of the 10th Five-Year Plan , and fulfilling the three major historical tasks in the new century hinges on further implementing the important thinking of the " three represents " as put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin . Besides , the party should achieve its ideological and organizational construction , improve its work styles , and ceaselessly improve its leadership , its ruling level , and its capability of resisting corruption and preventing peaceful evolution .  
To realize the goal , it is necessary to make development our key theme , restructuring our key path , reform , opening up , scientific and technological progress our driving force , and raising the people 's standards of living our fundamental objective .  
In connection with Powell 's recent stream of indiscretions on various sensitive policies , which have even sparked off some diplomatic disputes , some media have pointed out that Powell 's frequent " indiscretions " on certain key issues , as the man in charge of foreign policy in the world 's sole " superpower , " may be deliberate , and that his aim in using " indiscretions " to explore reactions from various sides is very evident .

While we pay attention to what we have achieved in construction of rural markets , we must also pay attention to the fact that the level of our rural markets is still low and they face such issues as unsound market systems and mechanisms , backward market infrastructures , slow development in the key elements of the market , low degrees of exports , depressed market prices , and low percentages of marketable commodities .  
After liberalized reforms , the systemic reform of the rural economy was a step ahead of that for city economies , but , due to a lack of changes in the agricultural management system by the government , the agricultural product markets and the agricultural key element markets have been split up among various departments such as farming , forestry , economic trade , foreign trade and labor .  In some areas , such administrative departments as animal husbandry , fisheries , and water resources also participate in the market divisions .  
After our WTO entry , our agricultural product markets and agricultural key element markets will be tied to the international market , and this will help us learn from others , introduce competitive mechanisms and regulations of the international market , and accelerate a sound and complete market system and operational mechanism for agricultural products and agricultural key elements .  
The overall quality of the main bodies of our rural markets does not measure up to that in developed western countries .  Many peasants and farm enterprises not only do not understand international agricultural trade , but also have little knowledge about the domestic market situations involving agricultural products and agricultural key elements .  It will be hard for them to participate in a timely and effective way in vigorous international market competition after our entry in the WTO .  
This requires us to first establish the focal points for the construction of large scale agricultural wholesale markets and specialized wholesale markets in cities and towns , supporting it by constructing market centers to connect the numerous peasants , and completing the whole chain by constructing such key elements of the market as capital , information , technology and labor forces , to form a unified market system in cities and towns that will ensure smooth circulation of goods between cities and towns .  
At this time , we must do an outstanding job on the following key links : first , we must entirely eliminate market barriers to realize self-motivated commodity trading and free commodity circulation and to ensure timely and rapid transportation of domestic agricultural products to the international market .  
However , there is one point which the MAC has neglected .  Not all the key industrial cities today are located in northern China , but are located in the southeastern coast of the mainland such as Jiangsu , Guangdong and Fujian .

Bridging the data gap will require a strategy of more widespread participation in data collection and assessment , bringing together Governments , scientists , non-governmental organizations , the private sector ( including industry ) , local authorities , and even the general public in coherent efforts to document key issues and trends as a basis for management decisions at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
Moreover , mention should be made of two key issues which have a decisive influence on the human rights situation in Guatemala : the values , attitudes and social behaviours that go to create the overall context in human rights violations take place and are encouraged and tolerant ; and the main characteristics of the functioning of the State institutions responsible for protecting human rights .
