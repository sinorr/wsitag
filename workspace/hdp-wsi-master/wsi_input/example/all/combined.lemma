This was the combined result of the strong rebound in Hong Kong 's exports of goods upon the improved regional and global economic environment and the slack in retained imports reflecting the modest domestic demand for most of the year .  
Thus , even with a larger deficit on the visible trade account , there was still a combined surplus ( including an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) of $ 34 billion in the first three quarters of 2000 , equivalent to 2.5% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that period .  
This was the combined result of a marked increase in visible trade deficit from $ 24.5 billion to $ 64.0 billion , a decrease in net external factor income inflow from $ 34.8 billion to $ 21.5 billion , and an increase in net outflow of current transfers from $ 11.9 billion to $ 12.7 billion , which were offset in part by a marked rise in invisible trade surplus from $ 90.7 billion to $ 123.8 billion .  
Overall , the combined visible and invisible trade account ( including an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) remained in surplus , at $ 2 billion in the first quarter of 2001 , equivalent to 0.5% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that quarter .  Yet these were smaller than the corresponding figures of $ 5 billion and 1.3% in the same quarter in 2000 .  
Taken together , there was still a combined visible and invisible trade surplus ( having incorporated an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) amounting to $ 11.3 billion in the first half of 2001 , equivalent to 1.3% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that period .

Overall , a combined visible and invisible trade surplus of $ 34.1 billion was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 , larger than that of $ 20.7 billion in the same quarter in 2000 .  
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that the surplus in the current account rose markedly further in the fourth quarter of 2001 , underpinned by a surge in the combined visible and invisible trade surplus , as well as continued net external factor income inflow .  
Taken together , the combined surplus ( including an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) rose to $ 20.5 billion in the first quarter of 2002 , equivalent to 5.3% of the total value of imports of goods and services .  This was considerably up from the respective surplus figures of $ 3.2 billion and 0.8% in the same quarter in 2001 .  
Peter Lau , who studied in England in his early years , was very fond of ancient European buildings , and this sentiment can be traced in many of his earlier works .  In his award winning work created in 1993 , Lau successfully combined the language of architecture and surrealism to form a richly imaginative pictorial space and a distinctive personal style .  
Mr Leung also pointed out that a critical mass of middle class consumers had been formed in the PRD as well as in the Yangtze River Delta and other coastal cities following a breakneck development in China . The combined " middle-class " consumer population is estimated at over 200 million , with a market volume estimated at over US $ 560 billion , growing at a rate of about 10 per cent per annum .  
The combined visible and invisible trade surplus still expanded , to $ 24.1 billion in the first quarter of 2003 , equivalent to 5.4% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that quarter , from the corresponding surplus figures of $ 18.7 billion and 4.9% in the same quarter in 2002 .  
As a result , I discovered , as we rehearsed , that they had made a lot of progress .

This added to the fact that Soochow is blessed with an abundance of water , fertile soil and a favorable climate , helped to produce some of the most breathtaking scenery in China . The intellectual pool that was present in Soochow combined with the natural conditions to mold the limited space into a realm of boundless beauty .  
And the Hong Kong government has adopted a laissez-faire , internationalist economic policy , leaving companies pretty much alone as long as they pay their annual tax . These factors , combined with an advantageous geographical location that has enabled the colony to become the world 's second largest transshipment port , have created a society where business is boss . "  
More seriously , both psychological and physiological symptoms may occur at the same time . For instance , hypertension , restlessness , irascibility , and irrational fear combined with rapid heartbeat , high blood pressure , headache , and indigestion may indicate neurasthenia , or a " nervous breakdown . " Stress is well-nigh ubiquitous in its effect on health and bodily systems , and the illnesses most closely related to it are termed psychosomatic .  
The time-honored idea that while counterfeits may be illegal , imitations are harmless , combined with today 's advanced technology , has resulted in a confusing jumble of the spurious and the authentic . Distinguishing the genuine from the fake is a problem of prime importance for collectors and investors in Chinese art . "  
In one powerful effort he set a new national record with a combined snatch and clean-and-jerk of 267.5 kilos . That kind of achievement would have won him a gold medal at Los Angeles in 1984 , and even though now it was only good enough to rank him fourth in the world , it fired him up with the ambition to win another medal this year at Seoul .  
Two centuries of adaptation and hard work combined with changing political and economic factors have made " the smooth integration of the Chinese into the multicultural society of Hawaii one of the rare success stories in the history of world immigration , " as Professor Clarence E . Glick of the University of Hawaii , noted for his research on the subject , has put it .  
Innate rebelliousness combined with his father 's authoritarianism formed a character that is hard to fathom - - plain and taciturn on the surface , but complex and changeable inside , with more than a dash of the unexpected .  
Data indicates that if the mainland authorities launch an attack on Taiwan regardless of internal democratic opposition and the cost in casualties - - one third to one quarter of their combined forces manpower - - then they have three possible options for military action : The first is attacking the islands one by one , starting with Kinmen , Matsu and the Pescadores , at the same time using their air and sea dominance , and missiles , to strike military , political and economic targets on Taiwan itself .  
Excellent personnel quality has always been the strongest point of our national defense . During annual recruiting for the combined forces academy , the proportion of enrollees for the navy is usually the highest , which underlines the quality standards required by the navy . In recent years however the numbers seeking admission to military school have fallen steadily , with the navy feeling the bite more than the other forces because of its reputation for the hard life .  
The office , about 20 p'ing ( about 720 square feet ) large , is divided up with brick for the lower half and glass for the upper , giving the whole office a clean , modern appearance combined with a solid , practical feel .  
I 'm sure the reason many overseas students go bad or give up on themselves is that they 're afraid of being unable to live up to their parents ' expectations , combined with the stress of living overseas and the pressure of getting ahead academically .  
The outdoor stages of an earlier day have given way to vulgar , flashy song-and-dance shows and decorated electronic sound trucks , which are growing in exponential proportions .

The memoir 's depiction of the events of the Cultural Revolution , however , does convince a reader that the deliberate selfishness of leaders , combined with the wrong political system , allowed the evil and selfish in people to run wild . Only people of excellent character could lend a helping hand or show a little gentleness .  
It 's been nearly 100 years since the rediscovery of oracle bone writing , and there has always been one mystery . The characters on the oracle bones , which are of the six orthodox varieties of " ideographic , pictographic , compound ideographic , attered phonetic , combined meaning / phonetic , and phonetic loan " characters , must have already been at an early stage of standardization , and could not have been the earliest Chinese writing .  
In this situation the government decided to set up a special project , enlisting the ITRI 's Mechanical Industry Research Laboratories to bring in American technology for combined research and development . When the development was finished , hands were joined again with the private sector to establish a compressor factory , with joint production and distribution free of Japanese control .  
In 1989 the Wildlife Conservation Law was passed . Besides being concerned about Taiwan 's image , the Council of Agriculture , which is responsible for ecological preservation work , is even more worried that the mountains are being scarred by ever-larger development projects , which are destroying the habitat of wild animals . It is feared that this destruction of habitat , combined with the Chinese belief that monkey brain is especially fortifying in the winter , will make the Formosan Rock Monkey an endangered species .  
According to Chinese American scholar Him Mark Lai , overseas Chinese , being influenced by American architecture , came back to build a series of structures that combined Western and Chinese influences . Typically , the front half was a blue-gray brick western style building with a flat roof one or two storeys high , while the back half retained the traditional design of an " A " shaped roof composed of fir wood and bricks .  
In life Among the Society of Beggars he stated that problems making ends meet combined with unfilial sons and grandchildren or unharmonious family relations forced many of the old and weak to beg . Shih described other beggars who pretended they were old and blind to support the opium habit of their wives .  
Seeing through " Huang Fei-hong the idol , " Peng Han-ping believes that the reason Bruce Lee was acknowledged as a hero was because he combined Chinese Wing Chun kungfu with Western fighting techniques to create his own " Stop Fist " kungfu , and his films display real martial arts skill ; to this day , they remain very valuable material for martial arts students to study . But Jet Li 's kungfu is just " display kungfu , " flashy and beautiful , but only good for brief entertainment .  
These volcanos went extinct about 350,000 years ago , but because that is quite recent in geological terms , a lot of heat remains . When this kind of heat is combined with ample deposits of sandstone , which are excellent holds for water , opportunities abound for water underground to warm up quickly . All said and done , it 's a " hot bed " for hot water .  
This in turn drew on the neoclassical style that appeared in Europe in the mid-18th century . That style emphasized " reason " and rationality , which designers of the period found embodied in the nearly pure geometric shapes of classical architecture . This trend , combined with the cultural exchange that came from colonial expansionism and the rise of archaeology as a field of study , produced new structures in Europe that incorporated a number of classical themes into a single building .  
A radio in every handIn the future shortwave broadcasting may be no competition for satellite TV , with its combined impact of both sound and image . But every time a major international incident occurs , the number of shortwave listeners increases .  
But even though high-level medical technology ca n't be provided on location in these remote districts , where populations number in the hundreds , combined medical assistance should be sufficient , through telemedicine , mobile medical care , and public-sponsored rural physician visitation services , all of which have been carried out for many years , as well as the backup system of offshore military medical services .

This mysterious and graceful Eastern wonderland combined well with the extravagant rococo style that was sweeping Europe in the time of Louis XV , to create Chinoiserie , that strange and remarkable blend of East and West that has its own place in art history .  
But after some discussion it was concluded that the reason Mother Yu had this " false impression " was perhaps because the model was so small and was not colored , combined with the visual effect of looking down on it from above When Huang Sheng-yuan remade the model at one-fiftieth scale , and , in accordance with Mother Yu 's wishes , pasted up spring couplets in the right places and painted the walls red where they were to be built of bricks , Mother Yu was finally more able to accept the house 's appearance .  
Professor Yang Kuo-chu of NTU 's psychology department sums up the situation by saying that in the West , demographic change and equal rights for women have developed over a relatively long period , whereas in Taiwan demographic change has been compressed into a short timeframe , and it is difficult for traditions of male preeminence and of continuation of the male family line to disappear so quickly . These factors , combined with the timely appearance of techniques for determining fetal gender , probably provide the best explanation for the imbalance between male and female births .  
Liu explains , " China 's court music was the music and dance extolled by Confucianists . Confucius combined rites , music , dance , poetry , and song into a coherent whole , creating a single integrated set of rules for proper ritual and decorum .

The fundamental principle was to create a harmonious society through cultivation of character and delineation of status .  
In making a new opera , characterization is very important , and the set character types of traditional opera are often insufficient . There 's nothing new about transcending these limitations by merging and melding traditional character types .

These may include sliced mushroom , miniature corn , carrots , gingko and gingko nuts , lily bulbs , or facai seaweed . These are fried up separately , then combined and cooked again evenly , and seasoned .  
Besides , from ancient times , Chinese people have shown total respect to the written word . You can even say that they are overly reverent toward it . This caused music , which is most inimical to written language , to turn into written records in the hands of the scholars ; and at the same time , to be combined with political ritual and become the system of " ceremonial music . " In the past , the focus of what scholars came in contact with in music was this type of political , ritual music .  
The combined effects of ROC foreign policy and cross-strait relations make this stage of ROC foreign relations extremely unusual . How does Chang , an old foreign-affairs hand , who studied international politics and entered the diplomatic corps nearly 30 years ago , and who bears the high expectations of the people , plan to steer the ROC diplomatic ship through these troubled times ?  
Ordinary families in which the husband 's and wife 's combined monthly income is only NT $ 80-90,000 not only need to meet their mortgage payments , cover their childcare fees and pay for three meals a day ; like Kuafu chasing the sun they should also be assiduously pursuing one financial goal after another , each higher than the last .

And Lien offered a new rendition of his song " When the Earth Calls Her Children Home " to console the wounded spirits of the September earthquake :  
The problem was eventually fixed through the combined efforts of a number of American computer scientists . Realizing that the increasing size and complexity of computer networks made it impossible for any individual to discover all the holes within them , these scientists established the Computer Emergency Response Team ( CERT ) at Carnegie-Mellon University . They hoped that by working together , network security issues could be predicted and resolved .  
But a flip side to economic growth , something the new administration needs to address , is the worsening problem of unemployment . In the first quarter of this year the number of unemployed climbed to 270,000 people , and narrowly-defined unemployment rose to a new high of 2.8% . Under the combined pressures of industrial upgrading , internationalization and liberalization , Taiwan 's economy is still facing a number of difficult challenges .  
The 47% share previously allotted to Taipei and Kaohsiung was decided upon last year after the government canceled a plan to abolish all local sales taxes and replace them with a single national sales tax . Now that this share has been lowered to 43% , the other cities and counties have seen their combined share go up to 39% , with each local government 's individual share calculated on the basis of population , land area , and other factors .  
It includes areas of metamorphic rock created and uplifted by intense orogenic movements , where continuous upward movement of the earth 's crust combined with the downward cutting action of the rivers has produced a terrain of many sheer gorges .  
For instance , the course content offered by his college 's Graduate Institute of Technology and Innovation Management is only suitable for postgraduate work . " But due to the regulations imposed by the Ministry of Education , if you set up only a graduate school the educational resources available from the government do not compare with those for a combined undergraduate department and graduate school . " Wu says that this results in institutions having to make a choice between " actual need " and " winning more resources . "  
Over the years , the body-snatching exploits and outrageous price-gouging of some of the worst operators , combined with the decrepit state of the funeral parlors-dismal dumps where every move seems to require a " red envelope " - have heaped misery upon mourning for countless bereaved families .  
The combined population of countries running socialist economies either now or in the past comes to over 3 billion , or 44% of the world 's total population . The major socialist economies include mainland China ( 1.2 billion ) , India ( 1 billion ) , and the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe ( 0.3 billion ) . Since the collapse of socialism , the massive labor pool of these nations has gradually been incorporated into the global capitalist economy .  
" Huashan lies at the juncture of the Philippine tectonic plate and the Eurasian plate . After serious earthquakes , the crust is loosened and altered , and the topography shows very obvious changes , " says Chiu Tsun-lung , director of the " Lake Bottom Culture Association , " and now a member of the 921 community reconstruction committee .

Meanwhile , the hot igneous rock combined with the heated underground water combined to form hydrothermal fluids , which , as result of the prevailing high temperature and high pressure , included large amounts of dissolved metals . After these fluids percolated upward through faults , as temperature and pressure declined , the metal ions percolated into cracks and into fissures in the surrounding rock . In the places where accumulations reached a certain volume , gold veins took shape . Bringing prosperity back  
Both spiders and insects are arthropods , but they have very different body patterns . Insects have six legs and a distinct head , thorax and abdomen , but spiders ' bodies are divided into only a " cephalothorax " ( combined head and thorax ) and abdomen , along with eight hairy legs that may be many times longer than the size of their bodies . They are very unique in form , and have some remarkable physical attributes . Spiders have fully developed digestive , circulatory , respiratory and nervous systems .  
A shortage of workers will push up wages and thus be bad for exports , or else it will be necessary to import large numbers of foreign workers , which will bring about social change and may give rise to many social problems . The combined effect of falling birthrates and increasing average lifespans is to accentuate the problem of population aging .  
As a matter of fact , after assuming the KMT chairmanship in March 2000 , Lien Chan stated that after a comprehensive examination of party assets and commercial investments , it had been discovered that during Lee Teng-hui 's presidency , when Liu Tai-ying was director-general of the KMT 's Investment and Business Management Committee , there were eight highly controversial investment cases with combined total losses of NT $ 9.8 billion .

He has experienced " snow blindness " from carving too long under the rays of a magnifying lamp . He would feel pain in both eyes and see nothing but white everywhere . Only after going to the doctor did he recognize that the extremely close-up work of carving combined with the reflection of the white fluorescent lamp light from the white eggshell was , after long-term exposure , injuring his eyes . At his physician 's suggestion , he changed the fluorescent lamp for an incandescent bulb and his condition improved somewhat .  
When combined with the growing leisure farming industry , this restoration takes on even more importance . All along the 9.6-kilometer Niutou-Sanhsing section of the Taipingshan railroad , a variety of beautiful natural vistas greet the eye-soaring mountains , creeks and valleys , fields , villages , and small towns . All this has great tourism potential , and aside from spurring the growth of peripheral industries such as accommodation and food service , it also has a great historical importance .  
As motor-scooter riders themselves , they started from their own experience of often being dazzled by the high beams of car headlights that prevent one from seeing the road ahead clearly . The team had the idea of installing a warning device to remind drivers behind to dip their lights . They combined it with a reversing alert to give a warning if the vehicle ahead backs up , and a turn signal canceling device to automatically switch off the indicator after the scooter has completed a turn and is going straight ahead again .  
Last year , after staff from the Formosa Plastics Group on an overseas inspection tour learned of this mechanism , the company decided to assist Vietnam in developing clean technologies such as cogeneration ( combined heat and power ) and tree planting , and then sell the resulting greenhouse gas reduction credits ( valued at US $ 10 per tonne ) to countries that need them , thus developing a new line of business .

The remaining Pakistani forces were withdrawn from the Mogadishu seaport to an intermediate staging base on 2 March 1995 , with the combined task force rearguard departing in an amphibious operation immediately thereafter under the protection of the naval task force standing off Somalia .  
Without the active support of the Somali people , it is unlikely that future humanitarian programmes will meet with much success , and more than likely that the gains , made through the combined efforts of international agencies and committed Somali partners , will be undone .  
Particularly in Kuwait , Qatar and the United Arab Emirates , relatively large national incomes generated by oil revenues , combined with rapid urbanization , high standards of living , improved health care and gradually declining fertility rates resulting in part from improved education of women , will produce drastic changes in the demographic structure , including the marked ageing trends which have been projected .  
Clearly , desirable levels of effective coordination do not result from the mere creation of joint departments : rather , they should arise from the regular , institutionalized work of combined units set up to monitor public socio-economic policies .  
Those who not only advocate but brutally carry out the policy of ethnic cleansing , national and religious superiority and the physical elimination of a people combined with the destruction of the traces of their centuries-old existence and the expropriation of their land and all other belongings , must not be treated in the same way as those who fight for religious equality , tolerance , coexistence , human rights and freedom .

The crime prevention and criminal justice programme , including its network of institutes , could usefully be included in the new combined promotional and operational TCDC activities , and priority undertakings such as the replication of successful innovative projects , development of subject-specific TCDC products , promotion of joint strategies to deal with the problems faced by groups of countries , and mobilization of support , including triangular cooperative arrangements .  
While historic factors such as the low level of African incomes and inadequate domestic technical expertise and capacity explain a part of this situation , it is also the general perception that inappropriate macroeconomic policies , combined with an antiquated and ineffective legal , regulatory and prudential framework , have been the main impediments .  
The study will draw on a wide range of practices and experiences at all levels , which will be combined in a comprehensive appraisal of the needs of children , leading in turn to specific recommendations for action directed to the national , regional and international communities to enable them to respond more effectively to those needs .  
The frequent lack of adequate presence in areas where there are internally displaced populations , combined with insufficient understanding of what internal displacement means , has often made it difficult to know the numbers of internally displaced populations and their specific assistance , protection and development needs .

The Commission had concluded from a reappraisal of the principle and its application that the Noblemaire principle continued to be applicable and that the " best-paid national civil service " formula , combined with a reference check with international organizations , appeared to be sound , provided that the process was handled in a timely manner and the margin range realistically reflected comparator expatriation benefits and resulted in a competitive remuneration package .  
Responsibility for social development is based on two pivotal factors : national responsibility and collective commitment , as reflected in the combined efforts of the international community .  
These figures , combined with a liberal investment law and a low gross domestic product of $ 287 per capita , are providing strong incentives for foreign direct investment , in particular now that Cambodia enjoys most-favoured-nation status with the United States , the European Union and other important countries in the world .  
Looking back over the recent past , we are very much aware that the cumulative impact of natural disasters and economic crises has combined to produce an untenable situation clearly deserving concerted international support and assistance .  
In addition , the problems of persistent poverty , increasing unemployment , debilitating debt , declining levels of official development assistance , environmental degradation , drug abuse and drug trafficking , crime , terrorism and social disintegration have combined to present a formidable array of challenges , which , if left unaddressed , threaten to overwhelm us and further marginalize the vulnerable and disadvantaged among us . 
Yet experience from countries which have made advances in reducing poverty indicates that strong and sustained political commitment to policies which promote distribution and investment in human resources through the provision of basic social services , combined with effective service delivery mechanisms and mobilization of all the actors involved are fundamental to eradicating poverty .  
In view of those difficulties , the Government was developing a policy that combined campaigns to eradicate stereotypes in several areas , ranging from the sharing of domestic responsibilities to the role of the media , with the establishment of affirmative action programmes in the public and private sectors .  
In operational terms , sustainable forest management includes the formulation and implementation of forest management plans , which help to control and regulate harvesting of specified goods , combined with silvicultural and protective measures applied in varying intensity to sustain or to enhance the social , ecological and economic value of subsequent generations of the managed forests .  
Harvesting of priority products , especially in developed countries , was frequently combined with the provision of selected environmental services ( notably maintenance of the biological resource base , including the wildlife and the conservation of soil and water ) and , with efforts to enhance recreation and aesthetic values of forests and woodlands for an increasingly urbanized human population .  
Hence the focus on driving forces , sectoral strategies , and resource management must be combined with the monitoring of the impact on levels of living ( as measured by the incidence of poverty ) , quality of life , health and education status , environmental risks at the local , national and global level , and similar variables .  
In section VI of that report , the Secretary-General proposed that since the total strength of the combined forces , including the rapid reaction capacity , was within the total strength ( 44,870 ) authorized by the Security Council prior to authorizing the rapid reaction capacity , and since the revised cost estimates , after deducting voluntary contributions in-kind , for the rapid reaction capacity were within the funding already approved by the General Assembly , all expenses for the rapid reaction capacity should be included in the assessed budget .

Global interests and responsibilities are the theoretical textbook carefully cooked up by the United States in order to pursue global hegemony , build a geopolitical framework with the Eurasian continent as the main body , and achieve its unipolar strategic goal .  Guided by this strategic goal , the new vision emphasizes joint or combined operations when taking military action , in order to maintain military superiority and create a favorable environment for the United States ;  
The gaining of all-round superiority in Joint Vision is drawn up in light of three changes .  First .  In the wake of the development of transport , telecommunications , and information technology , the trend of economic globalization has markedly speeded up , with the result that US interests and the international environment are closely linked , and this demands that the US military take military action in other regions of the world in joint ( combined ) form ;

The first crisis is that , because of the " normless " rich-poor polarization in society resulting from political corruption and benefit distribution and substantial unemployment and hidden unemployment resulting from system transformations , large numbers of lower-strata people who are discontented with the status quo because of their threatened survival status will get combined with radical political forces which use " populism " as their rallying cry , thereby forming a sustained force of pressure with direct disruptive effects on the existing order .  
As radical nationalism in itself is just an operational platform for speech , it must be combined with other ism values in order to assume the state of actual political operation .  In terms of contemporary China , the ideology or ism the most capable of functioning well on the platform of nationalism is exactly leftist radicalism ; such a leftist current of thought , revitalized through being combined with radical nationalism , will acquire momentum in terms of " being able to command the local lords in the name of the emperor . "  
The second contradiction is that in the process of international interactions in the post-Cold War era , international contradictions and conflicts may lead to the formation of the current of thought of radical nationalism which will get combined with leftist speech because of the existence of a large amount of leftist speech in China 's traditional ideological resources , resulting in the undermining of balanced development of pluralist intellectual differentiation and , eventually , affecting the democratic process .

This was the combined result of the strong rebound in Hong Kong 's exports of goods upon the improved regional and global economic environment and the slack in retained imports reflecting the modest domestic demand for most of the year .  
Thus , even with a larger deficit on the visible trade account , there was still a combined surplus ( including an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) of $ 34 billion in the first three quarters of 2000 , equivalent to 2.5% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that period .  
This was the combined result of a marked increase in visible trade deficit from $ 24.5 billion to $ 64.0 billion , a decrease in net external factor income inflow from $ 34.8 billion to $ 21.5 billion , and an increase in net outflow of current transfers from $ 11.9 billion to $ 12.7 billion , which were offset in part by a marked rise in invisible trade surplus from $ 90.7 billion to $ 123.8 billion .  
Overall , the combined visible and invisible trade account ( including an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) remained in surplus , at $ 2 billion in the first quarter of 2001 , equivalent to 0.5% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that quarter .  Yet these were smaller than the corresponding figures of $ 5 billion and 1.3% in the same quarter in 2000 .

It 's been nearly 100 years since the rediscovery of oracle bone writing , and there has always been one mystery . The characters on the oracle bones , which are of the six orthodox varieties of " ideographic , pictographic , compound ideographic , attered phonetic , combined meaning / phonetic , and phonetic loan " characters , must have already been at an early stage of standardization , and could not have been the earliest Chinese writing .  
In this situation the government decided to set up a special project , enlisting the ITRI 's Mechanical Industry Research Laboratories to bring in American technology for combined research and development . When the development was finished , hands were joined again with the private sector to establish a compressor factory , with joint production and distribution free of Japanese control .  
In 1989 the Wildlife Conservation Law was passed . Besides being concerned about Taiwan 's image , the Council of Agriculture , which is responsible for ecological preservation work , is even more worried that the mountains are being scarred by ever-larger development projects , which are destroying the habitat of wild animals . It is feared that this destruction of habitat , combined with the Chinese belief that monkey brain is especially fortifying in the winter , will make the Formosan Rock Monkey an endangered species .  
According to Chinese American scholar Him Mark Lai , overseas Chinese , being influenced by American architecture , came back to build a series of structures that combined Western and Chinese influences .

Seeing through " Huang Fei-hong the idol , " Peng Han-ping believes that the reason Bruce Lee was acknowledged as a hero was because he combined Chinese Wing Chun kungfu with Western fighting techniques to create his own " Stop Fist " kungfu , and his films display real martial arts skill ; to this day , they remain very valuable material for martial arts students to study . But Jet Li 's kungfu is just " display kungfu , " flashy and beautiful , but only good for brief entertainment .  
These volcanos went extinct about 350,000 years ago , but because that is quite recent in geological terms , a lot of heat remains . When this kind of heat is combined with ample deposits of sandstone , which are excellent holds for water , opportunities abound for water underground to warm up quickly . All said and done , it 's a " hot bed " for hot water .  
This in turn drew on the neoclassical style that appeared in Europe in the mid-18th century . That style emphasized " reason " and rationality , which designers of the period found embodied in the nearly pure geometric shapes of classical architecture . This trend , combined with the cultural exchange that came from colonial expansionism and the rise of archaeology as a field of study , produced new structures in Europe that incorporated a number of classical themes into a single building .  
A radio in every handIn the future shortwave broadcasting may be no competition for satellite TV , with its combined impact of both sound and image . But every time a major international incident occurs , the number of shortwave listeners increases .

This mysterious and graceful Eastern wonderland combined well with the extravagant rococo style that was sweeping Europe in the time of Louis XV , to create Chinoiserie , that strange and remarkable blend of East and West that has its own place in art history .  
But after some discussion it was concluded that the reason Mother Yu had this " false impression " was perhaps because the model was so small and was not colored , combined with the visual effect of looking down on it from above When Huang Sheng-yuan remade the model at one-fiftieth scale , and , in accordance with Mother Yu 's wishes , pasted up spring couplets in the right places and painted the walls red where they were to be built of bricks , Mother Yu was finally more able to accept the house 's appearance .  
Professor Yang Kuo-chu of NTU 's psychology department sums up the situation by saying that in the West , demographic change and equal rights for women have developed over a relatively long period , whereas in Taiwan demographic change has been compressed into a short timeframe , and it is difficult for traditions of male preeminence and of continuation of the male family line to disappear so quickly . These factors , combined with the timely appearance of techniques for determining fetal gender , probably provide the best explanation for the imbalance between male and female births .  
Liu explains , " China 's court music was the music and dance extolled by Confucianists .

Besides , from ancient times , Chinese people have shown total respect to the written word . You can even say that they are overly reverent toward it . This caused music , which is most inimical to written language , to turn into written records in the hands of the scholars ; and at the same time , to be combined with political ritual and become the system of " ceremonial music . " In the past , the focus of what scholars came in contact with in music was this type of political , ritual music .

In the places where accumulations reached a certain volume , gold veins took shape . Bringing prosperity back  
Both spiders and insects are arthropods , but they have very different body patterns . Insects have six legs and a distinct head , thorax and abdomen , but spiders ' bodies are divided into only a " cephalothorax " ( combined head and thorax ) and abdomen , along with eight hairy legs that may be many times longer than the size of their bodies . They are very unique in form , and have some remarkable physical attributes . Spiders have fully developed digestive , circulatory , respiratory and nervous systems .  
A shortage of workers will push up wages and thus be bad for exports , or else it will be necessary to import large numbers of foreign workers , which will bring about social change and may give rise to many social problems .
