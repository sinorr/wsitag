The standard work week when President Chen took office was 48 hours . After the new government proposed to shorten this to 44 hours , the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan one-upped the administration by passing legislation that further reduced standard working time to 84 hours over two weeks .

The finance panel witnessed struggles between government officials and the corporate sector . The corporate sector made a number of proposals including cutting the tax for land value-added in half for two years , freezing collection of the stock transaction tax for one year , and giving government an upper debt limit . However , these proposals would have reduced government revenues by NT $ 95 billion per year . These were also resisted by scholars who argued that they would create a " bubble economy , " as well as by industrial elder statesman Wang Yung-ching .  
" Industrial firms in Taiwan have expanded capacity furiously over the past decade and produced in huge quantities . The result has been destructive price competition that has left producers badly weakened . " Central banks throughout the world have responded by lowering interest rates in an attempt to revive their economies . The US Federal Reserve Board has lowered the prime lending rate ten times this year , and Japan 's interest rates have been at zero for a long time , but rapidly declining investments have greatly reduced the effectiveness of such monetary measures .  
As Taiwan 's industrial structure undergoes transformation , we see the traditional manufacturing firms migrating offshore in search of cheap labor , materials , and land .

Of particular importance are these few sentences that capture the essence of Dan 's thinking : " It 's naturally difficult to search for nothing , yet when the substance is clearly defined you see the emptiness . It 's impossible to paint the spirit , yet when reality is reduced to its essence the spirit will be revealed . A painting that is chaotic and busy is largely superfluous . Only when emptiness and reality are arranged properly will the idea of the picture extend beyond the painting . "  
Of course , it is asking a lot of any hospital to be a designated SARS hospital , and it is a rather terrifying prospect for the staff there . For this reason all hospitals should contribute to the staffing of the special facility in rotation-time spent caring for patients , a ' vacation ' in quarantine , and then a return to their original hospitals . Staff must also be provided with the best possible protective gear and financial bonuses , so that the sense of anxiety felt by caregivers can be reduced to a minimum .  
Against this backdrop , how to augment the quality of the second track is currently being hotly debated in the field of vocational education .

With such developments the sector has increasingly given the impression of being on the verge of collapse .  
However , kitchen waste is the main source of the foul odors and disease vector proliferation in garbage . When kitchen wastes are mixed with other garbage for processing , landfills are inundated with noxious gases , polluting the air . If taken instead to incinerators , due to their high water content , much energy will be wasted in the burning process , and the lifespan of the incinerator will also be reduced . At the same time , concentrations of the toxin dioxin will be increased .  
HUF chairwoman Mary Chen points out that Taiwan 's traditional business groups have put economics first , neglecting an environment-friendly business culture , which does cause worry .

The Chinese Communist Party believes that the guiding role of the state-owned economy is mainly embodied in its ability to control .  The state-owned economy should have a dominant role in key areas and major industries which are the lifeline of the national economy .  Other areas can have adjustments such as " advance and retreat " and " let some things go undone , " with the proportion which is the state-owned economy reduced somewhat with no effect on the socialist nature of China .  
An expert concerned pointed out that the reduced output of summer grain held a very small proportion in the total amount of grain output in China , which will not make a fundamental change in the setup of supply exceeding demand in the domestic markets .  
As reflected in various localities , in the past , some enterprises with a fairly great number of retired workers had to assign a person to take charge of issuing pensions every month , and this wasted a lot of human and material resources .  After the implementation of socialized distribution of pensions , the management of retirees will be separated from enterprises ; the burdens of enterprises will be greatly reduced and their operational vitality will be noticeably strengthened .  
Amid the series of eye-catching reforms of the cadre and personnel system , appointment to posts by competition has become a glittering point , which has opened up people 's vision regarding selection and employment , effectively prevented unhealthy trends in employing people , and reduced to the minimum the phenomenon of " selecting the wrong person " in cadre selection ; it has played a positive role in building a high-quality civil service force and allowing the emergence of more outstanding talent .

Wen Jiabao pointed out : Since last year , a number of counties and cities in Anhui Province and other provinces and autonomous regions have carried out the trial reform of taxes and charges in rural areas in accordance with the arrangements made by the party Central Committee and the State Council , and have achieved initial good results .  First , the peasants ' burdens have been reduced by a great extent and the " arbitrary collection of fees , unreasonable penalties and unjustified financial levies " has been effectively curtailed .  
According to Anhui province 's statistics , since the fee-to-tax reform was implemented , the agricultural two taxes and their attachments collected by the province were reduced 23.6 percent from what was collected in agricultural tax , agricultural unique product tax , township joint planning and village withdrawals before the reform was implemented .  Implementing this reform , combined with abolition of the butchery tax and rural educational fundraising raising , meant the total tax and fee burden for farmers dropped by 31 percent .

The Chief Justice said , " Before the Administration makes any decision on the Judiciary 's proposal ( which includes statutory prohibition of reduction in judicial remuneration in line with numerous jurisdictions ) , it would be inappropriate for the Administration to evade the issue by further cutting the Judiciary 's budget by an amount equivalent to the amount involved if judicial remuneration were reduced back to the levels as at 1 July 1997 .  
Members also observed that the technical measures introduced to improve the Currency Board system in 1998 ( including the introduction of the discount window and a substantial increase in the size of the Monetary Base ) had , through reducing the sensitivity of interest rates to speculative attacks , probably reduced the amount by which GDP and prices would decline following a speculative attack .  They noted , however , that there was , for the time being , insufficient empirical data for this to be clearly shown .  
Miniature landscape , by its very name , is the art of re-creating beautiful natural scenery in reduced scale .  With ingenious use of vertical and horizontal placement of branches skillfully pruned , shaped and trained into the desired shape , the artists have their sensibilities echoed in these small worlds of wonder that delight the eyes .  
This was largely due to a markedly reduced current account surplus , as the spread of SARS in the second quarter resulted in a distinct setback in inbound tourism and related service exports , and hence a shrinkage in invisible trade surplus , and as net external factor income inflow also contracted considerably .  
Manufacturers of electric wire and cables in Taiwan have built automatic plants to produce high quality continuous copper rod . Such a plant needs capitalization of US $ 5,000,000 . This continuous rod has a number of major characteristics : It is cost-saving . Each roll weighs 5 tons . Transportation costs and the tedious work of connection can be saved or reduced .  
The former approach , used by athletes , falls under the psychological heading of image therapy . Requiring no physical activity to reach its goal , the method might be considered a type of positive thinking exercise . Pleasant experiences are reinforced , and negative stimuli are reduced to a bare minimum .  
Within these three goals , these are our efforts in each individual area : In the area of national defense : Following the policy of military modernization , we have built up formidable armed forces , successfully developed sophisticated weaponry according to a predetermined plan , and implemented the policy of using only highly qualified soldiers ; over the past five years , military personnel have been reduced by over 35,000 persons .  
It is planned that by the 1993 academic year , the number of teachers per class will have risen to 1.5 , and this standard would be maintained until the turn of the century . As to class size , it is hoped that it can be reduced from the present average of 43 students per class to an average of 40 students per class by the year 1993 , with further reductions thereafter until the number will have been reduced to 35 students per class by the year 2000 .  
The Taiwan Straits may seem calm , but there is an unseen and turbulent undercurrent . The naval vessels that cruise these rough waters are in the front line in more than one sense . Externally , they face mainland forces that are ten times numerically superior to our own , and the threat from nearly one hundred submarines , as well as the worsening problems of smuggling and illegal entry . On the domestic front the navy is going through a transition period , with aging vessels being decommissioned and manpower reduced .  
Something worth mentioning is that with new military equipment largely automated and technological , future manpower needs will be reduced , which eases the problem that has been caused for the navy by the shortened term of naval conscription .  
Its advantage is to reduce land speculation , and also the protests faced at the time the government claims the land will be reduced . The disadvantage is that a considerable portion of the value added to the property by new government construction will be skimmed off by the landowners , so that the ideal of " returning the value added to the public " can not be fully realized .  
After painful lessons , the palmtop computer alliance mapped out by the Computer and Communications Research Laboratories last year made a major shift in its structure . First the number of companies was greatly reduced . At present there are only nine . Moreover , all the technical work , from materials purchasing to the design and quality control of the main board to the certification of the keyboards , is to be divided up among the participating firms .  
The attacking force goes straight down to the foot of the dike . Add to this that there is a pulling effect when the waves retreat , so-called " backwash " , says Lin Yung-teh . Given the iron law that the force of the waves can not be reduced , although the dikes will not be smashed in a single blow , they can not stand up against the continual digging away of the soft sand under their feet over a long period of time .  
" Moon Children " was originally selected as material for a show to be aired over public television .

" We ca n't know if this was right or not , " admits Wu Tsung-neng . No one knows if the slowing of the epidemic was due to human effort or was a natural trend . However , from the fact that over the same time period other communicable diseases also were reduced , it can be assumed that the preventive measures taken against the enterovirus were effective .  
Hsichih is a typical example of rapid city development where urban planning failed to give sufficient attention to water resources , where cultivated hillside land was seriously reduced by construction of homes , and where sections of river in Nankang and Hsichih were reclaimed by being filled in and built upon . This latter process cut out bends of the lower sections of the Keelung River in Taipei City , straightening it without consideration to the drainage problems that would be created in upstream at Hsichih and Keelung .  
As women have rewritten their gender characteristics , some reassessment has been made of the male box . It has been discovered that this rigid box has not only crushed women and children under it , it has also deformed men-those allegedly advantaged by it . It has stifled their emotions , destroyed their health , reduced the happiness they get out of daily life , and made them lonely and violent .

The standard work week when President Chen took office was 48 hours . After the new government proposed to shorten this to 44 hours , the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan one-upped the administration by passing legislation that further reduced standard working time to 84 hours over two weeks . This measure saddled businesses with an extra burden , and manufacturing operations began migrating offshore at an accelerated rate , thus contributing to increased unemployment .  
The finance panel witnessed struggles between government officials and the corporate sector . The corporate sector made a number of proposals including cutting the tax for land value-added in half for two years , freezing collection of the stock transaction tax for one year , and giving government an upper debt limit . However , these proposals would have reduced government revenues by NT $ 95 billion per year . These were also resisted by scholars who argued that they would create a " bubble economy , " as well as by industrial elder statesman Wang Yung-ching .  
" Industrial firms in Taiwan have expanded capacity furiously over the past decade and produced in huge quantities . The result has been destructive price competition that has left producers badly weakened . " Central banks throughout the world have responded by lowering interest rates in an attempt to revive their economies . The US Federal Reserve Board has lowered the prime lending rate ten times this year , and Japan 's interest rates have been at zero for a long time , but rapidly declining investments have greatly reduced the effectiveness of such monetary measures .  
As Taiwan 's industrial structure undergoes transformation , we see the traditional manufacturing firms migrating offshore in search of cheap labor , materials , and land . Although this has reduced the ROC 's tax revenues , the industries that have stayed behind , forced to reinvent themselves , have adapted with flying colors to the new structure .  
His son , who is in senior high school , once reached 90 kilos in weight , and was depressed and constantly lethargic .

Of particular importance are these few sentences that capture the essence of Dan 's thinking : " It 's naturally difficult to search for nothing , yet when the substance is clearly defined you see the emptiness . It 's impossible to paint the spirit , yet when reality is reduced to its essence the spirit will be revealed . A painting that is chaotic and busy is largely superfluous . Only when emptiness and reality are arranged properly will the idea of the picture extend beyond the painting . "  
Of course , it is asking a lot of any hospital to be a designated SARS hospital , and it is a rather terrifying prospect for the staff there . For this reason all hospitals should contribute to the staffing of the special facility in rotation-time spent caring for patients , a ' vacation ' in quarantine , and then a return to their original hospitals . Staff must also be provided with the best possible protective gear and financial bonuses , so that the sense of anxiety felt by caregivers can be reduced to a minimum .  
Against this backdrop , how to augment the quality of the second track is currently being hotly debated in the field of vocational education . The technical and vocational education infrastructure has undergone major changes over the last few years . Vocational high schools have been reduced in scale and become increasingly unclear about their role , while senior technical colleges have begun to resemble standard universities , with many actually choosing to upgrade to university status . With such developments the sector has increasingly given the impression of being on the verge of collapse .  
However , kitchen waste is the main source of the foul odors and disease vector proliferation in garbage . When kitchen wastes are mixed with other garbage for processing , landfills are inundated with noxious gases , polluting the air . If taken instead to incinerators , due to their high water content , much energy will be wasted in the burning process , and the lifespan of the incinerator will also be reduced . At the same time , concentrations of the toxin dioxin will be increased .  
HUF chairwoman Mary Chen points out that Taiwan 's traditional business groups have put economics first , neglecting an environment-friendly business culture , which does cause worry . However , through monitoring and testing mechanisms , compost content and quality problems can be reduced to a minimum . This is a direction that many environmental groups will be pursuing in the future .  
The mountain Karen still make a living through such traditional methods as swidden farming , fishing , hunting and gathering , working hard to eke out an existence each and every day . However , as their numbers have increased , the limited availability of agricultural land and the impact of modernization and natural disasters have meant that they now lack adequate resources to meet their daily subsistence needs , and have been reduced to penury and perpetual shortage .  
To break the " teaching by subject " mold that had characterized teaching at the primary and middle school levels for more than ten years , the " integrated curriculum " for grades 1 to 9 was introduced four years ago . Although it reduced ten subjects to seven major disciplines , the core subjects of mathematics , Chinese and English remained clearly delineated in the classroom .  
Ho says that as soon as people with a foot disability try on their custom-made shoes , they can feel the difference . A man with one leg 12 centimeters shorter than the other had to wear a shoe with a built-up sole that weighed 1.5 kilos . The FRTRI used foam materials that reduced the weight of the shoe by half . The satisfied and grateful customer was delighted at how light and comfortable his new shoes were .  
They indicated : " Natural disasters have resulted in poor harvests for 2 consecutive years .  In addition , economic crisis and disruption of farming activities in some areas have reduced production and supply of foods to the region - creating one of the worst agricultural catastrophes in southern Africa in 10 years . "  
They noted : " Two successive years of poor harvests brought about by natural calamities , coupled with economic crises and the disrupted farming in some areas , have reduced the food production and supply in this region , resulting in one of the gravest agricultural disasters in a decade in southern Africa .

The worsening of socio-economic conditions in many LDCs in the 1990s has increasingly been translated into a marked deterioration in human welfare as reflected in reduced caloric intakes , increased mortality and morbidity , the re-emergence and spread of diseases , lower school enrolment , further marginalization of the weakest members of society , and other signals of acute social distress , as further reviewed below in chapter V .  
The implementation of this crash programme , if successful , would have reduced the time required to attain sufficient nuclear material for a single nuclear weapon by up to two years compared to the probable production time-scale of Iraq 's EMIS and centrifuge enrichment programmes .

These included the rethinking of existing organizational structures and the introduction of role delineation ; the revision of existing legislation and the introduction of new legislation to reflect subsidiarity ; the introduction of an information technology infrastructure ; sustained development initiatives in management of change and business re-engineering ; the setting up of local Government to enhance citizen empowerment ; the revamping of human resources practices and procedures ; the new salary structure , which reduced 96 pay scales to 20 ; and the introduction of a code of ethics for all public officers .  
In fact , my country has noted with deep regret that while some developed countries have been making efforts to meet the official development assistance level , such assistance from some rich countries has been declining noticeably , and the decline has been taking place in the post-cold-war era , when it was to be expected that such countries were in a better position to increase the flow of official development assistance as a result of greater stability in the world and reduced tensions between former antagonists .  
The commitment that we undertook at the 1990 World Summit therefore represented a challenge that we had to accept in extremely difficult circumstances , since we entered the decade in the midst of a deep economic crisis with reduced resources , an oppressive external debt and great demands and needs for social services .  
The full economic and social utilization of those resources for the benefit of the peoples , to uplift them and create and maintain a better way of life , has been retarded by the severe impact of external debt and , concomitantly , debt-servicing costs , declining levels of official development assistance , reduced financial flows for investment and for industrial , business and commercial development , increasing barriers to trade and impaired access to the markets of the developed countries of the world .  
The Helms-Burton Act also calls for an annual report that would describe all bilateral assistance provided to Cuba by other countries , including humanitarian assistance ; Cuban debt to third countries , as well as the amount exchanged , forgiven or reduced ; identification of Cuban trading partners ; and a description of the joint ventures completed or under consideration by foreign nationals and business firms .  
In strengthening and modernizing the United Nations , the emphasis has to be on enhancing legitimacy , addressing inequities in decision-making processes and promoting efficiency and effectiveness better to meet the changing , complex needs of Members .

Drought or inadequate supplies of water in southern and northern parts of the continent reduced agricultural output and increased the diversion of foreign exchange earnings for food imports in several countries in 1995 .  
Unique or rare forest ecosystems that are not comprised of significant numbers of endemic species are more likely to be found in areas that previously had more continuous forest cover but in which forest cover has been fragmented and reduced relatively recently ( in evolutionary terms ) by climatic change , human influence or a combination of the two .  
The Office has documented numerous case-studies worldwide of management and technical changes that have led to reduced environmental impacts and improved economic performance .  
The worsening of socio-economic conditions in many LDCs in the 1990s has increasingly been translated into a marked deterioration in human welfare as reflected in reduced caloric intakes , increased mortality and morbidity , the re-emergence and spread of diseases , lower school enrolment , further marginalization of the weakest members of society , and other signals of acute social distress , as further reviewed below in section V .  
However , in order to sustain the momentum of the ongoing process of democratization and economic and social stabilization in Haiti until the Haitians can assume direct and sole responsibility for their future , we support the continued presence of UNMIH for a period of four months with a reduced troop level of 1,200 , as provided for in the draft resolution .  
The Secretary-General 's military advisers and potential troop contributors to a renewed but significantly reduced UNMIH assessed that a contingent of 1,900 would be the minimum viable force required to accomplish UNMIH 's mandate with an acceptable degree of risk to the United Nations personnel involved .  
In view of the pattern of meetings and conference-servicing requirements in 1994-1995 , it is expected that any requirements of the Conference of the Parties and its subsidiary bodies that can not be absorbed from within permanent capacity would require an additional appropriation and could not be met from within the reduced budgeted resources for temporary assistance in the approved programme budget for 1996-1997 .  
For such drugs , reduced consumption is usually aimed at tertiary prevention approaches that highlight the possible negative health consequences related to acute and chronic toxicity that may stem from binging , frequent and continued illicit consumption .  
Most ESCWA member countries have developed , or are developing , strategies or plans to combat environmental degradation and achieve sustainable development .  However , financial constraints and reduced public expenditure are apparently hindering the implementation of such strategies and plans .  
In keeping with the options I outlined in my report to the Council of 19 January 1996 , and pursuant to resolution 1042 ( 1996 ) , I sent a technical team last month to examine the current functions of the MINURSO military component and to determine whether its size could be reduced , while still permitting it to play an effective role in monitoring the cease-fire and verifying allegations of violations . 
The volume and quality of the work the Institute has been able to perform is noteworthy , taking into consideration the reduced number of professional staff available , the numerous vacancies at the management level , and the limited financial resources at its disposal .  
Whether its mandate is still required gives rise to the question posed in paragraph 25 of my report of 30 January 1996 ( S / 1996 / 65 ) : how does one measure the success of a preventive operation and judge that if it is reduced or withdrawn peace and stability will continue to hold , threats and tensions that have so far been contained will disappear and channels or institutions for defusing them will continue to be built or consolidated ? 
The military element , with an initial strength of 1,200 personnel , would be located in Port-au-Prince only and be composed of one reduced infantry battalion and one reduced reconnaissance battalion , a helicopter unit , a military police unit , an engineer unit , transport and logistic elements , as well as adequate medical support .  
At the same time , existing modalities will be reformed and streamlined in seven ways : reduced meetings ; fewer and improved reports and revitalized publications ; new networking arrangements ; increased interactions with member States ; more effective technical support , including use of country representatives ; enhanced South-South cooperation ; and strategic alliances with partners .  
However new problems have been appearing in rural areas with respect to restitution of private land ownership , transformation of agricultural cooperatives and reduced opportunities to find a city job by women coming from the province in the form of requirements for requalification and / or new professions available to provincial women , e.g . , new forms of gainful employment executable at home .  
In any event , this objective will have to be pursued while preserving the current capacity of the text-processing units to ensure the timely issuance of documentation in all languages simultaneously , working with generally very short deadlines and operating within the present framework of reduced staff resources and drastic limitations in the use of overtime .  
The revised cost estimates submitted in document A / 50 / 696 / Add . 1 of 30 October 1995 amounted to $ 890,230,900 gross ( $ 881,791,500 net ) , compared to the original estimates of $ 1,013,629,900 gross ( $ 1,002,021,100 net ) and took into consideration reduced requirements for military and civilian personnel , rental of premises , transport operations , air operations and the purchase of equipment .  
Faced with an increasingly heavy reliance on temporary assistance for Conference Services , resulting from growing workloads and decreasing established resources , and more recently with substantially reduced appropriations for this budget item , the Secretariat has endeavoured to maximize the use of local freelance staff and avoid payment of costly travel expenses and daily subsistence allowances , in addition to salaries . 
It is anticipated that the revised programme of work as decided by the ninth session of the Conference can be implemented within the reduced level of resources , utilizing , inter alia , the gains from the efficiency review , which is currently ongoing .  
" Deeply concerned about the significant decline in resources allocated to the operational activities for development of the United Nations system , the incomplete tenth replenishment of the International Development Association and prospects for the eleventh replenishment at significantly reduced real levels , which has a negative impact on the effectiveness of the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions in pursuing collaboration and their role in the field of development ,  
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) has been reduced in the past years from 10 to 7 , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
While it is true that the number of resolutions regarding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East ( UNRWA ) has been reduced in the past years from 10 to 7 , the content of these resolutions remains occupied with political issues irrelevant to the work for which UNRWA is responsible , and thus remains detached from the new reality .  
The above savings were realized mainly as a result of more favourable rates for the hire of aircraft used for rotation of military personnel ; receipt of additional vehicles , equipment and supplies from other missions ; cancellation and deferment of maintenance projects as part of the special measures taken in relation to the bad financial situation in the United Nations ; and the reduced prices offered by the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic for petrol , oil and other lubricants .  
The revised cost estimates for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 amounted to $ 31,902,000 gross and reflected a 39 per cent decrease in gross terms in comparison with the original cost estimates , taking into account that it provided for the reduced strength of 230 military observers and 9 civilian police observers , supported by a civilian establishment of 167 personnel ( 102 international and 65 local ) and 2 observers from the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) .  
The revised cost estimates for the maintenance of the Observer Mission for the 12-month period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 represented a 47 per cent reduction in the previous estimate , due to the reduced staffing level , comprising 34 military observers , 43 international staff and 47 local staff , and the non-implementation of disarmament and demobilization programme .  
It is anticipated that the revised programme of work as decided by the ninth session of the Conference can be implemented within the reduced level of resources , utilizing , inter alia , the gains from the efficiency review , which is currently ongoing . "

Those programmes were beginning to bear fruit : the level of absolute poverty had been reduced while per capita income had increased ; economic growth had been sustained ; the debt service ratio had decreased in relation to exports ; and the Philippines had re-entered the private capital market in order to seek sources of external financing .  27 .  In order to promote sustainable human development to achieve real prosperity , economic growth in developing countries must reach between 5 and 9 per cent .  
Taking into account the observations made by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions ( A / 50 / 7 / Add . 13 ) and the Board of Auditors as well as the experience gained since January 1996 , the Commodity Procurement Section has been divided into two separate sections , each headed by a Chief of Section at the P-5 level , effective 1 October 1996 .  Further , the number of clusters has been consolidated and reduced from 11 to 8 , with each chief of section responsible for four clusters .  
The widespread incorporation of information technology in production and communications has considerably reduced the physical size of factories ( by increasing the versatility of machines , thereby lowering the number of machines required for different sequences of operations ) , expanded the variety of jobs that can be performed , and improved the precision in production and quality control that can be achieved by a worker , and ( through instant information connectivity ) greatly enhanced intra - and inter-firm spatial networking to maximize location-specific advantages .  
Urges the developed countries to give the heavily indebted poor countries initiative the support it both needs and deserves and to further refine the initiative so that the required six-year performance period is reduced to one lasting a maximum of three years and the terms of eligibility to be used in qualifying countries do not introduce new conditionalities ;

Nonetheless , the ] [ The Panel was convinced of the necessity of having a set of criteria and indicators wide enough to be used at the global level , rather than a reduced core set that might prevent the mutual recognition of regional and national initiatives , the exchange of information and the further elaboration of the issues of best forest practices and voluntary codes .  
He stated that the relegation of women to a domestic role , attributable to cultural factors , their lack of political involvement , the reduced pay they received when on maternity leave , the violence within the family that affected two out of every three women , the discrimination practised by families in respect of education and the sexual attacks by soldiers and policemen already reported in 1994 , continued unabated in 1995 .

Although dependence on imported oil and coal for total energy requirements is not expected to be reduced , natural gas is anticipated to have an increasing role in electricity production and in the residential heating market .  
Fourthly , FDI inflows should continue to be promoted by the per capita incomes in developing countries of the region , which are rising at higher rates than in the rest of the developing world , and increasing competition in the industrial as well as the developing countries and the resultant pressures on their transnational firms to locate abroad in search of reduced production cost and the strong likelihood of further liberalization of trade and investment policies in developing countries of the region . 
The alert level varied between amber , orange and red during the intervening months , being mostly orange until very recently , when it was reduced to amber in March 1997 .  
The Conference of Ministers of ECA was convinced that trade and investment were essential components in any credible strategies to accelerate development in the countries of Africa and sustain high rates of economic growth , and that poverty , which constituted the most serious problem facing African society , could be reduced and eventually eradicated by sustained high rates of economic growth that was broad-based and geared to creating employment and generating rising incomes .  
The representative of UNEP informed the Committee that the projected expenditures for 1998-1999 under these objects were based on anticipated contributions of $ 75-million , as approved by the Governing Council at its nineteenth session , while the amounts indicated under the same objects for 1996-1997 were based on reduced actual contributions amounting to $ 62.5-million .  
While the overall economic performance in the least developed countries has improved , poverty remains pervasive and the majority of the population in the least developed countries suffers from reduced caloric intakes , increased mortality and morbidity , the re-emergence and spread of disease and lower school enrolment .  
Given that the five Central Asian Republics are landlocked , in search of world markets and in need of developing new transport corridors to improve trade performance , UNDP is providing support to the Government of Tajikistan to pave the way for a modern system of transit procedures and ensure adherence to international customs conventions that simplify border crossings among the five Central Asian Countries , resulting in reduced transport costs , increased competitiveness , expanded trade potential and augmented economic growth .

As was indicated at that time , budget implementation during the current biennium would be notably more challenging than in previous bienniums owing to the dynamic efforts required to manage the sharply reduced level of resources within a short budget cycle and within a budgetary structure with limited flexibility or requiring longer lead times to address the necessary savings other than through significant reductions in staff costs .  
As concerns general operating expenses , the significant reduction is attributable in large part to several energy-saving measures undertaken , such as shutting down the internal air-conditioning fan supply after certain hours ; reduced communications requirements from favourable rates negotiated with and paid to commercial carriers ; and lower requirements for rental and maintenance of premises as a result of release of space , for new cleaning and other contracts and for rental and maintenance of furniture and equipment arising from such action as the move of the mainframe to the International Computing Centre in Geneva .  
A substantial proportion of maternal deaths , approximately 13 per cent , result from complications associated with unsafe abortion . 4 The Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development has recognized unsafe abortion to be a major public-health issue and recommended that the recourse to abortion be reduced through expanded and improved family planning services . 
The tripartite forms of governance of employment policy established in many countries have increased cohesion and reduced conflict so long as they were genuinely inclusive of all kinds of workers , and need to be developed in ways that take account of the transnational nature of much economic activity .  
In most cases , however , the growth processes remain fragile and the outlook is surrounded by considerable uncertainty . 4 While high inflation rates have been largely reduced to more manageable levels , prices still do not guide economic activity to the degree common in most market economies , as enterprise governance and institutional frameworks for business decision-making are still in transition . 
The White Paper also sets out the role of the central Government in providing the right conditions for public and private investment through management of the overall economy , and local authorities will be encouraged to take a strategic enabling approach in respect of all housing tenures and a reduced role as landlords .

As a least developed country itself , the Republic of Yemen expresses its concern regarding some indications in the report that the United Nations role in the field of development may be reduced and its responsibilities limited in the field of social justice and the task of narrowing the huge gap that separates the developing and developed industrialized countries all on the pretext that some of these responsibilities have been shifted elsewhere . 
In the United States , we have raised the minimum wage , expanded tax credits for working families and reduced the federal deficit , all of which provide the basis for investment , growth and job creation .

The Committee points out that the deferral of approved projects in alterations / improvements and major maintenance , although resulting in reduced spending during the current biennium , does not necessarily generate " real " savings for the Organization ; on the contrary , the more time that is lost for the completion of such projects , the more expensive they may become .  
At the end of the biennium , it is envisaged that in the key States parties to the memorandum of understanding , and in which national and subregional drug-control efforts are pursued , effective drug-control coordination and legislation will have taken hold , illicit opium poppy cultivation in Lao Peoples Democratic Republic , Myanmar and Viet Nam will be noticeably reduced , effective control measures against trafficking will be in place and prevention and reduction of drug abuse will have received more vigorous efforts by the national authorities and civil societies alike .  
Under the original proposal for the forthcoming biennium , the total number of posts would be reduced from 10,012 , the number approved for the current biennium , to 8,839 , and that number might be as low as 8,695 if Member States accepted the proposed reforms .

First , obstacles or barriers ( including political , legal , bureaucratic , physical , financial , social and informational ) should be reduced .  
Debtor countries derived two benefits from those operations : released collateral can be used to meet other obligations , and since the swap is effected at a discount based on secondary market prices debt outstanding is commensurately reduced .

Despite the efforts of the affected countries and the intervention of the multilateral financial institutions , the crisis had not abated and the potential consequences for those countries included a reduced rate of liberalization ; the possibility that they might seriously consider defaulting on their debt ; the contraction of expenditure , which inevitably meant reduced spending on social services ; and the possibility of widespread social and political upheaval .  
The concentration of shifting cultivators on a smaller or poorer resource base typically sets in motion a downward spiral of reduced agricultural productivity , increased forest depletion and worsened rural poverty , as cropland fallow periods are shortened and soil fertility declines .  
Mass poverty resulted from factors such as a shortage of productive resources , limited access to basic services and poor output and lack of diversification in the agricultural sector .  Those factors eroded the economic and social fabric of populations and drastically reduced the options of poor sectors .  
At the national level , the causes of poverty in many developing countries included inadequate national economic policies , the insufficiency or lack of a natural resource base and external economic shocks such as external debt , unfavourable terms of trade and reduced official development assistance .  
The negative aspects of the current economic situation must be reduced to a minimum and the enormous potential of the global market must be harnessed .  
The unencumbered balance of $ 2,199,100 gross ( $ 2,153,300 net ) resulted primarily from accelerated repatriation of military personnel and reduced requirements for air operations , as well as the fact that staffing and non-staff resources earmarked for the support of the run-off presidential elections were not utilized .  
Moreover , this pre-emptive stance of monetary policy , at insignificant rates of inflation , appears to make no acknowledgement of the fact that inflationary expectations have changed significantly since the 1970s and 1980s , and that the structural and technical changes that have occurred in the developed economies since then have reduced the likelihood of present wage and price setting behaviour being quickly reversed .
