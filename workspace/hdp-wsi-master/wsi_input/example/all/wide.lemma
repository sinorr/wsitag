Refining entails a great deal of pollution , but the supply of petrochemical materials is vital for developing the economy and improving the life of the citizenry , so production and growth were constantly increased . Today the site encompasses more than sixty refineries producing a wide range of fuels along with two upstream naphtha plants and some mid - and downstream facilities .

The flood plain used to be wide and marshy , but today its banks have been narrowed by levees , its course straightened , and the bed of the river raised , so that the water has soaked away leaving dry river bed inhospitable to waterfowl .  
Submarines lose some of their superiority in the relatively shallow Taiwan Straits , where sea trenches are not wide enough for use , and military experts believe there can be at the most only thirteen mainland submarines deployed around Taiwan , to the north , east , south and southwest where the waters are deeper .  
Teeming with life , the river also had a remarkably active course - - which has changed from being bounded by steep U-shaped canyons to having a wide and shallow river bed . Ordinarily this process occurs over the course of thousands of years and can not be observed in a human lifetime .  
This is especially the case in the main area of human settlement east of the Central Mountain Range , the Hua-Tung ( Hualien-Taitung ) Valley , which is a mere three to seven kilometers wide .

And because Taiwan abounds in tea leaves and has inherited the tea-drinking traditions of Southern Fukien , interest in tea here runs wide and deep .

As the growing use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides has caused the local stuff to fall from favor , Pu'er tea , by satisfying a yearning for the new , has suddenly become all the rage .  
With its rich text and pictures , Sinorama touches on a wide range of topics .

In the history of Chinese cities , fire-fighting measures were most thorough during the Song dynasty . Song cities resembled those of today 's Taiwan , with residences and places of business mixed together , streets less than fifty paces wide with alleys branching off them , buildings that rubbed up against each other , and great diversity within the population . With the city so tightly packed , fires spread quickly . This made fire fighters essential public servants .

As such , with its view of a wide expanse of water and green coastal ridges , the area is said to have especially auspicious geomantic properties . Thus the hillsides are covered with cemeteries advertised as " Fit for an Emperor or King , " " Home of the Dragon and Den of the Tiger , " or " Paradise . " For businessmen to build these cemeteries - - the most expensive and delightfully-sited on the island - - they had to first level the mountainsides and uproot the woods .  
But beautification and weight-loss is anextremely complicated and personalized process . Another variable is the uneven quality of the many new operators who have sprung up to meet the demand that has come along with economic prosperity , and there are traps everywhere .

But academics tended to the view that the activity was a shallow publicity stunt , and had no real significance in terms of sexual equality or educational reform . As for the general public , according to a newspaper opinion poll 55% assessed the camp positively , while 25% came out strongly against it . Perhaps the effectiveness of the training itself is secondary-just by attracting such wide attention and prompting such serious thought , it has already been well worthwhile ! ( Marlene Chen and Anna Wang / tr . by Robert Taylor )  
Aside from these technical preventatives , the most fundamental point is that suicide is a warning sign and can not be ignored . The wide disparities that exist between the suicide rates of different age brackets and different ethnic groups form a silent protest-a protest that must be heard as we consider the future distribution of resources in society .  
Were all government funds to reach this level , that would mean nearly another NT $ 100 billion entering the market , which would undoubtedly provide a huge boost .

In the world of budaixi , where each " school " carefully distinguishes itself from its competitors , this was truly unprecedented .  
But the long-term problems caused by recreational facilities are not going to go away . These private facilities , in fact , existed long before the park was established .

They break the law in various ways , including using national land , building illegal structures , and operating without proper permits .  
The medical community gives two main reasons why there is such wide acceptance of alternative treatments : superstition , and inadequate understanding of cancer treatment . But patients point mostly to the fact that they are tired of suffering .  
Just as the archeologists were beginning to calm down after the discovery of pit # 1 , the adrenaline started pumping again . As before , the soil was rammed hard , and once again , one stunning item after another was unearthed-over 60 elephant tusks , numerous delicate and complex bronze zun and lei ( an urn-shaped wine vessel ) , bronze heads bedecked in a wide assortment of finery , and a huge bronze mask measuring over 130 cm from side to side .  
Over 50 bronze heads were discovered at Sanxingdui , and they feature a wide variety of headgear , including gold masks , fancy hairstyles , braided head bands , and curly hair that seems to surge forward like breakers at the beach .  
Hung out in front of many of the farmhouses were brightly colored carp streamers , with the carp 's golden scales glittering against backgrounds of black , red , blue , purple , green , orange . . . .

Misery and suffering left in the wake of the 21 September Chichi earthquake are still apparent over a wide area , but rebuilding continues non-stop , and appraisal of damage to buildings in the disaster areas has been completed . The government has been busy distributing financial help and contributions sent by sympathetic onlookers , and temporary housing for 4,500 families will be completed by the middle of November . These are just the first steps in post-disaster relief efforts however ; full-scale recovery still has a long way to go .  
She said that she never expected that her party membership would be revoked . The astonishing cross-partisan pairings of the Soong-Chang and Hsu-Chu tickets-both presidential candidates stepping outside party ranks to launch independent campaigns and choosing running mates completely different from themselves-on the one hand shows that they are above not only party politics , but also provincial background and the issue of unification vs . independence . On the other hand , it also shows that they hoped to maximize the complementarity of their tickets to attract votes from as wide a political spectrum as possible .  
Chu notes in her research that after they captured the city of Haikou on Hainan Island in 1939 , the Japanese military ( operating through the Government-General of Taiwan ) ordered Taiwan Development to carry out economic development on the island .

Stroking the silver-gray ringlets which are twice as fine as human hair , Chang says that these soft , flexible fibers of high-grade steel can not only make fashion fabrics glisten with a mysterious modern sheen suitable for a millennium party , but-thanks to metals ' outstanding capacity to shield and conduct electromagnetic waves , and their ability to withstand high temperatures and acid or caustic environments-they also have a wide range of applications in many industries .  
An article published in 1932 by the Association for Promoting Taiwan 's Scenic Beauty describes the rigors of the road building task . In places the rock was very hard and highly fragmented , making it unsuitable for blasting with gunpowder .

Fourth , they established organized systems of religious practice . Examples are clerics such as Hui Neng , sixth patriarch of Chan Buddhism , Master Xian Shou , who founded the Huayan Sect in the Tang dynasty , and Master Zhi Zhe , who enabled the Tiantai Sect to spread far and wide . A final characteristic of the most distinctive figures in Buddhism is that their stories were avidly related by later generations .  
With their powerful wings , insects of the order Odonata can spread far and wide . Hence , compared with other insects , which have differentiated in response to specific environments , the proportion of endemic species among Taiwan 's dragonflies is not high . The island has only a third as many dragonfly species as butterfly species , and most were recorded by the middle of the 20th century . Lively dragonflies are easy to spot , but observing their lives in detail is more difficult .  
The freshly picked tips of Oolong tea , with their green buds and twin leaves , become a bright and luminous gold when steeped in hot water .

The words " If You Catch Me , Report Me " in large characters , along with the distinctive shape of the whale shark with its broad , flattened head , square snout , and large , wide mouth , make for an eye-catching sight amid the blue and gray hues of a busy port .  
But the reason why the Chin-kuashih-Chiufen area can be considered a world heritage asset , argues Monica C . Kuo , president of the Chinese Institute of Landscape Architects in Taiwan , is that its historic impact extended far and wide . From a historical perspective , the gold produced in Chinkuashih and Chiufen profoundly influenced the economic and colonial history of Asia in the first half of the last century .

" By prior arrangement , the HCM Orthodontic Hospital had spread the news of their impending arrival far and wide , and there were already 50 or 60 children with oral clefts waiting for treatment , having been brought by their anxious but hopeful parents .  
But it must be said that even the architectural uniqueness of the Shihsanhang Museum does not spare it from clashing severely with the holding tanks of the nearby Pali wastewater treatment plant . Fortunately , the architects have mitigated this by the happy connection between the wide staircase and the roof which draws one upward to a point from which sky and sea are seen as one and a feeling of vast visual space is created .  
Early one morning when she was seven years old , and in her first year of elementary school , just as she was all set for school , she suddenly heard a wretched cry , and saw one of the family 's dogs come flying over the fence .

And because Taiwan abounds in tea leaves and has inherited the tea-drinking traditions of Southern Fukien , interest in tea here runs wide and deep .

As the growing use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides has caused the local stuff to fall from favor , Pu'er tea , by satisfying a yearning for the new , has suddenly become all the rage .  
With its rich text and pictures , Sinorama touches on a wide range of topics .

In the history of Chinese cities , fire-fighting measures were most thorough during the Song dynasty . Song cities resembled those of today 's Taiwan , with residences and places of business mixed together , streets less than fifty paces wide with alleys branching off them , buildings that rubbed up against each other , and great diversity within the population . With the city so tightly packed , fires spread quickly . This made fire fighters essential public servants .

As such , with its view of a wide expanse of water and green coastal ridges , the area is said to have especially auspicious geomantic properties . Thus the hillsides are covered with cemeteries advertised as " Fit for an Emperor or King , " " Home of the Dragon and Den of the Tiger , " or " Paradise . " For businessmen to build these cemeteries - - the most expensive and delightfully-sited on the island - - they had to first level the mountainsides and uproot the woods .  
But beautification and weight-loss is anextremely complicated and personalized process . Another variable is the uneven quality of the many new operators who have sprung up to meet the demand that has come along with economic prosperity , and there are traps everywhere .

In those days , because of geographical factors , northern and southern Taiwan developed distinct varieties of settlement . On the wide , flat plains of southern Taiwan , villages basically massed together . In the mountainous north , settlement was spread out among many little villages .  
But academics tended to the view that the activity was a shallow publicity stunt , and had no real significance in terms of sexual equality or educational reform . As for the general public , according to a newspaper opinion poll 55% assessed the camp positively , while 25% came out strongly against it . Perhaps the effectiveness of the training itself is secondary-just by attracting such wide attention and prompting such serious thought , it has already been well worthwhile ! ( Marlene Chen and Anna Wang / tr . by Robert Taylor )  
Aside from these technical preventatives , the most fundamental point is that suicide is a warning sign and can not be ignored . The wide disparities that exist between the suicide rates of different age brackets and different ethnic groups form a silent protest-a protest that must be heard as we consider the future distribution of resources in society .  
Were all government funds to reach this level , that would mean nearly another NT $ 100 billion entering the market , which would undoubtedly provide a huge boost .

In the world of budaixi , where each " school " carefully distinguishes itself from its competitors , this was truly unprecedented .  
But the long-term problems caused by recreational facilities are not going to go away . These private facilities , in fact , existed long before the park was established .

They break the law in various ways , including using national land , building illegal structures , and operating without proper permits .  
The medical community gives two main reasons why there is such wide acceptance of alternative treatments : superstition , and inadequate understanding of cancer treatment . But patients point mostly to the fact that they are tired of suffering .  
Just as the archeologists were beginning to calm down after the discovery of pit # 1 , the adrenaline started pumping again . As before , the soil was rammed hard , and once again , one stunning item after another was unearthed-over 60 elephant tusks , numerous delicate and complex bronze zun and lei ( an urn-shaped wine vessel ) , bronze heads bedecked in a wide assortment of finery , and a huge bronze mask measuring over 130 cm from side to side .  
Over 50 bronze heads were discovered at Sanxingdui , and they feature a wide variety of headgear , including gold masks , fancy hairstyles , braided head bands , and curly hair that seems to surge forward like breakers at the beach .  
Hung out in front of many of the farmhouses were brightly colored carp streamers , with the carp 's golden scales glittering against backgrounds of black , red , blue , purple , green , orange . . . .

The botanist Chen Yu-feng has written : " The process of mountain formation in Taiwan has already passed its most active phase , and the arrangement of its tall mountains has basically been established . These provide a wide range of climates and habitats for many different forms of plant and animal life . " The island has an astounding array of ecological diversity .  
Misery and suffering left in the wake of the 21 September Chichi earthquake are still apparent over a wide area , but rebuilding continues non-stop , and appraisal of damage to buildings in the disaster areas has been completed . The government has been busy distributing financial help and contributions sent by sympathetic onlookers , and temporary housing for 4,500 families will be completed by the middle of November . These are just the first steps in post-disaster relief efforts however ; full-scale recovery still has a long way to go .  
She said that she never expected that her party membership would be revoked . The astonishing cross-partisan pairings of the Soong-Chang and Hsu-Chu tickets-both presidential candidates stepping outside party ranks to launch independent campaigns and choosing running mates completely different from themselves-on the one hand shows that they are above not only party politics , but also provincial background and the issue of unification vs . independence . On the other hand , it also shows that they hoped to maximize the complementarity of their tickets to attract votes from as wide a political spectrum as possible .  
Chu notes in her research that after they captured the city of Haikou on Hainan Island in 1939 , the Japanese military ( operating through the Government-General of Taiwan ) ordered Taiwan Development to carry out economic development on the island . The company was given a wide range of tasks , and construction of buildings urgently needed by the occupying forces received top priority . Facilities built included administrative quarters , a mess hall , barracks , and a naval comfort station .  
Stroking the silver-gray ringlets which are twice as fine as human hair , Chang says that these soft , flexible fibers of high-grade steel can not only make fashion fabrics glisten with a mysterious modern sheen suitable for a millennium party , but-thanks to metals ' outstanding capacity to shield and conduct electromagnetic waves , and their ability to withstand high temperatures and acid or caustic environments-they also have a wide range of applications in many industries .  
An article published in 1932 by the Association for Promoting Taiwan 's Scenic Beauty describes the rigors of the road building task . In places the rock was very hard and highly fragmented , making it unsuitable for blasting with gunpowder . " Police squad leader Shibata tied a thick rope around his body and had himself lowered down the mountainside like a bottle on a string . First he cut a foothold wide enough to stand on with one foot , and then gradually enlarged it . "  
Fourth , they established organized systems of religious practice . Examples are clerics such as Hui Neng , sixth patriarch of Chan Buddhism , Master Xian Shou , who founded the Huayan Sect in the Tang dynasty , and Master Zhi Zhe , who enabled the Tiantai Sect to spread far and wide . A final characteristic of the most distinctive figures in Buddhism is that their stories were avidly related by later generations .  
With their powerful wings , insects of the order Odonata can spread far and wide . Hence , compared with other insects , which have differentiated in response to specific environments , the proportion of endemic species among Taiwan 's dragonflies is not high . The island has only a third as many dragonfly species as butterfly species , and most were recorded by the middle of the 20th century . Lively dragonflies are easy to spot , but observing their lives in detail is more difficult .  
The freshly picked tips of Oolong tea , with their green buds and twin leaves , become a bright and luminous gold when steeped in hot water .
