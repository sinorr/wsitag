But because Yushan National Park was " a single man able to hold a narrow mountain pass against an army , " the plan was shrunk so that the road became the park 's " scenic highway . "  
As long as 120 years ago , just after it was founded , it treated applicants of all backgrounds just the same - - whether black or white , rich or poor , male or female . It is a citadel of academia that lives up to the ideal of " education without discrimination , " in the words of Confucius .  
For example , the Tun Hwa Radio fleet , the first to make use of radio communication , was established three years ago as a pilot project of the Institute of Transportation of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications . It upholds a policy of hiring only drivers of outstanding moral character and of employing not a single driver with a bad record so that passengers can feel at ease about riding a cab at any hour .  
D . in soil and agricultural sciences from the University of Hawaii , he returned to Taiwan four years ago . In Taiwan he specialized in recultivation of seeds from rare and precious local varieties of trees . Because he made a major breakthrough in asexual propagation , he had just begun to earn a reputation . Yet it was just at this point that he chose to pull up roots . "  
These products of cultural fushion from 200 or 300 years ago are scattered all across Europe . Just open the map - - from Sicily in the south to Fagervik in the north , from St . Petersburg in the east to Lisbon in the west - - well-preserved specimens of chinoiserie can be found everywhere . This month 's photo essay presents some of the pictures of chinoiserie Sinorama has garnered from across the continent of Europe .  
Three years ago , when first appointed principal of the island 's only junior high , Fuan Junior High School , Lin Yao-wen became deeply enamored of the local scenery , which has been especially favored by nature . The entire family of volcanoes ringing Taipei , including Mt . Tatun , Mt . Chihsing , Mt . Shamao and Mt . Kuanyin , are all visible from the school 's athletic grounds , and the magnificent Keelung River and Tamsui River slowly wind by .  
According to a survey done three years ago by Shao Li-fang , a lecturer at Shih Chien College , less than a third of unmarried people considered themselves " elite singles , " as a popular Chinese expression goes . Although most of them said they were content with their lot , half admitted they were lonely and missed having someone to take care of them .  
" In fact the appreciation of the Taiwan dollar and high foreign exchange reserves are not directly or necessarily linked with speculative fever or inflation . What is important is looking at how policy in the financial markets is carried out and supporting their stability , " says Lu Fang-ching , deputyexecutive secretary of the Commodity Price Supervisory Board at the Ministry of Economic Affairs examining the problem from another angle . " The point is that the central bank , compared to five years ago , is more experienced and very cautious . "  
It 's worth pointing out that two years ago , when Yuan Liu participated in the world 's largest children 's book exhibition - - the Bologna Italy book fair - - they won the competition for the prize for " Best Children 's Illustrated Books " with two Chinese folk tales for children , Gumiya and The Giant and the 12 Suns . You can see from this that as far as Taiwan 's children 's books are concerned , there is not far to go in terms of raising quality .  
Ten years ago , to help children that have been unable to receive proper parental care because their families have suffered special problems or misfortunes , the R . O . C . Children 's Welfare Foundation studied examples overseas and introduced to Taiwan the foster care system , in which families volunteer to take in foster children on a temporary basis .  
Three hundred years ago , colonial powers including England and Holland , looking to develop the rubber plantations and tin mines of southeast Asia , sought workers among the densely packed , poverty-stricken Chinese populations of Fukien and Kwangtung along the southeast coast of China . This created a huge wave of economic migration .  
Insufficient financial and human resources are the reason why handicapped athletics has never been popularized in this country , " says Ho Mao-sung . The CPAA was established seven years ago , but it only has made annual expenditures of NT $ 100,000 ( NT $ 200,000 this year ) , and the amount its volunteer director , secretary-general , and assistant secretary-general are able to accomplish is limited .  
When instant noodles first appeared on the market in Taiwan more than 20 years ago - - convenient , tasty and suited to the rapid pace of industrial society as they are - - they were an instant success . But their uniformity of flavor and inability to " fill you up " made it impossible for modern-day people who are pressed for time but still picky about their food to make them a staple of their diet .  
Just ten years ago research into computer " artificial intelligence " was being abandoned as computer researchers around the world were stymied in getting computers to understand models of human thought . Now Chu , who holds boundless enthusiasm for Chinese-language computers , has declared that he has designed " an intelligent Chinese computer " that " can think , learn skills and communicate directly with people using language . " The first stages of its development have already been completed successfully , and it is expected to be formally unveiled within two years . "  
Long ago , the busy striving for thoroughness in business and the hectic pace of life led Chen to turn to Confucian principles as an extremely human and practical set of cultural beliefs . He feels sorry that he can not get other modern people to accept them as well .  
The " Mei Stream Arts Society , " organized by twelve local Puli painters including Liang Kun-ming and I-yong Hung , has continually held individual and group exhibitions since being established fifteen years ago , and has earned quite a fine reputation in the arts community .  
It 's a new field , developed only five or six years ago , where we are n't that far behind other countries and where there are wide prospects for future applications . Although some scholars are worried they wo n't fit in with other industries , " high-temperature superconductors do n't require a huge investment , and as long as we keep at it , there 's a good chance we can hold our own with any other country , " Hsu Shiang-kueen says .  
It is like the dependency theory that was fashionable some years ago . This held that the late developing countries needed to depend on the advanced countries , with the result that such countries had no way to advance because the developed countries would not let them do so . Wanting to exploit their resources and labor , the developed countries would only allow the late-developers to do the most basic work .  
The best is yet to come ! Successful research on a stereo piano that has received the affirmation of a foreign piano manufacturer sounds exciting . But for Yang Tai-ho , who designed the stereo piano ten years ago and acquired a patent for it five years ago , it 's just one of 200 patents .  
The midterm and final report cards they handed over were Komalan Opera , a Taiwanese opera that tells the story of how the Han Chinese and the Pingpu aborigines a century ago changed from opposition to mutual acceptance , and Walking Theater , a stage play that centers around the life of a veteran Pei Kuan opera performer and thus contains a large amount of traditional singing , reciting and acting .  
The museum enables employees to gain a concrete idea of just how we built up our corporate reputation and an understanding of what each department does , " explains the museum 's director , Wu Mu-hsiang . Learning about the past gives them common memories and produces a sense of cohesion , he says , citing an example . When they discovered a refrigerator made 30 years ago still being used in one family 's kitchen , their hearts lit up with pride .  
Head librarian Wu Wen-chin says : " The work of the library is comprehensive . When we arranged all our common Chinese and Japanese books , we edited a catalog of 72 volumes , which was a huge process that was only finished eight years ago . After that we began an automatic system , which requires a very big budget . "  
Mr . Bigs should clean up their heavy metal : Faced with the red , blue , green , and other variously colored liquid pollutants generated by the electroplating industry , the industrial community ten years ago thought to follow the example of Japan and establish a special electroplating industrial zone to concentrate the scattered factories in one place and treat the waste water collectively .  
Wu is the executive director of the foundation and its painful opening announcement was like a short summary of his work : " The Chinese Communists established the reform-through-labor brigades some 40 years ago . Their inmates still include so-called counter-revolutionaries , class enemies , those deemed to be against the party and socialism , religious figures , " historical " counter-revolutionaries and members of the Tienanmen democracy movement .  
Not so long ago , R . O . C . business-men were involved in the killing of seals in South Africa , which was followed by the rhino horn incident and the reckless killing of the black-faced spoonbill . These incidents have challenged the humane philosophy Chinese have traditionally held dear .  
Two months ago a Canadian artist , J . Fenwick Lansdowne , held an exhibition in Taiwan on the theme of Chinese rare birds . His lively and fine depictions of Chinese birds and their habitats has led many people , including some ecologists , to exclaim : " The Chinese have not been good at giving realistic renderings of birds and their habitats , which is something they should strive hard to do in the future . "  
Environmental environment needs upgrading : Environmentally friendly products are the wave of the future . For example , Acer , which already has a sound foundation in Germany and Holland , in order to meet European environmental regulations , began a year and a half ago to offer a personal computer which " does n't use a single screw , " but is fit together out of molded parts .  
A reader in Thailand . 1993.4.10Dear Editor : A few days ago , as I occasionally read your esteemed periodical , I happened to come across the report by Teng Sue-feng about her visit with Harry Wu , entitled " Let the World Know . " I learned that Mr . Wu is searching for survivors of the Chinese labor camp system to collect further information about the labor reform camps .  
There are fewer and fewer kids coming along each year now : Two years ago the school still counted 37 heads , with 24 remaining last year , and only an even dozen this year . It 's hard to run a school without students : Leaving aside for a moment the question of economic efficiency , in terms of the quality of instruction , what impact does the small number of students have on learning ?  
Formerly a planner for an advertising agency , Huang noticed many years ago that colorful and attractive magazine advertisements and calendar photos would serve as good basic material for creating original illustrations . TaKing great pains to gather these photos and art work that others saw as waste paper , he has cut them up and pasted them together into 150 collages that accompany the text .  
A swimming pool at the beach : Six years ago Taiwan had still not lifted martial law , and strict controls over beach areas hindered the chances for intimacy between the sea and this island people . Today most of the restrictions on approaching coastal areas have been removed , but now we are cut off from the sea by dikes we have built ourselves .  
Three years ago , when Mr . You invited me to act as convener of Ilan 's " Editorial Committee for Locally Oriented Language Teaching Materials , " I made my acceptance conditional on his placing local vernacular education work in the cultural and educational sphere , and resisting any attempt to put it on the political level where it could become a tool in the Democratic Progressive Party 's political battles with the Nationalist Party ( KMT ) .  
In an old house : It was actually just by chance that this valuable piece ever came to light : One day two years ago , 24-year-old Wu Chung-wei was driving to Hsinchuang when he got confused and lost his way . At Yenping North Road he came across a long disused and damaged railroad workers ' dormitory .  
Not long ago , Taipei County executive You Ching wanted to hire Lin Yu-yi , a professor from National Normal University ( the elite teaching university ) , as director of the county Bureau of Education . The provincial government rejected him on the grounds that his qualifications were not suitable , and assigned someone else . This led to a conflict over which appointee should take office , and for a time relations between the two sides were strained .  
When the government came to Taiwan over 40 years ago , power was in the hands of those labelled as being from " outside the province . " The main industrial and commercial businesses , and economic power , were also primarily " mainlander . " This meant that chairmen , directors and other important leadership posts were largely held by mainlanders , so as to establish good ties between business and the central government .  
Thirty years ago , Wu Sung-he 's father had injured his spine through heavy labor , and over the years his condition gradually grew worse , to the point where even the tissues around his spine were swollen with pus . Seeing that his condition was critical , the impoverished Wu family were at their wit 's end until at a friend 's suggestion they used a wooden handcart to bring the patient to Dr . Chen 's clinic in Luotung .  
It 's just too bad that 12 years ago when the entire village moved down to the plains , their old village was left abandoned , its streets and gardens weed choked and its stone walls toppled .  
The Han dynasty ( 206 BC - 220 AD ) had an official charged with rearing the emperor 's hunting dogs , and in the Tang dynasty ( 618-9O7 ) there was even a special imperial kennels which raised hunting dogs for the emperor . Long ago , primitive men had dances imitating animals . The " dance of the hundred beasts " was not a performance using real animals as in a circus , but a religious ritual dance similar to the annual nuowu dances to drive out evil .  
A magic time machineThe tale begins two hundred years ago with a great flood that visited the old Penkang River ( now known as the Peikang River ) . An ancient village situated along the river was completely inundated , and the inhabitants were forced to flee , some moving north , others moving south .  
True , in The End of the Century she still shows an intellectual 's contemplative acuity , but is that gentle and kind glowing mother of Children the same woman who wrote Wild Fire , a collection of critical political and social writings , ten years ago ?  
Once I was tempted to throw this whole book in the garbage , and I declined to publish it . But on pure chance eight years later - - just a few months ago - - I saw a report in the paper about a woman working for a credit cooperative who was fired because she had married and gotten pregnant . I was shocked . How could Taiwan still be like this ?  
Two or three hundred years ago Hakka began coming to Taiwan and settled in relatively interior , mountainous areas in what is now the Pingtung-Kaohsiung region in southern Taiwan and the Taoyuan-Miaoli region in central Taiwan . Here they extended their experience in pioneering harsh and demanding terrain , and their characteristic traits were passed down from generation to generation .  
Beginning two years ago , foreign conservation groups started attacking Taiwan as a " rhino terminator , " and then in April of this year Taiwan became the first country against which the United States implemented trade sanctions for ecological reasons . The Chinese medical community has become a favorite public punching bag . As a doctor of Chinese medicine , Huang Ming-teh has had to face this problem .  
UP into very recently , some dozen neighboring households had all been drinking the water from the pond , but when construction began on the Sun City course four years ago , run-off from the golf course polluted their water . Turned yellow and murky , the pond surface no longer reflects the sky and clouds , and the fish that the Los had raised here for generations have gone belly up .  
Shenghsing Railway Station : The highest point on western Taiwan 's mountain railway line . The structure contains no metal nails . The Eight Trigrams design fixed to the beams is intended to ward off evil . Between Shenghsing and Tai-an , the railway passes over bridges and through tunnels , past green farmland and countryside , with scenic spots such as the Yutengping river valley and the " broken bridge " at Lungteng , which was split in two by a great earthquake over 50 years ago .  
He practiced medicine in his " Pochilum Clinic . " In an age of turmoil when China was weak and prey to Western invaders , with one hand he struck at the foreign sowers of intrigue and disorder , and with the other he fought against the corrupt and treacherous elements within China which sprang up to bedevil the country in its hour of difficulty . In the Chinese cinema of the l990s , the heroic figure of Huang Fei-hong bears strong parallels with Bruce Lee , who was the sensation of the film world 20 years ago .  
Just a moment ago your bare arms and legs were a little numb from the cold air . Now they 're numb because the heat is making your blood vessels throb , and your whole body is limp . When you ca n't stand that hot current running through your body any longer , just splash yourself with some cold water .  
These volcanos went extinct about 350,000 years ago , but because that is quite recent in geological terms , a lot of heat remains . When this kind of heat is combined with ample deposits of sandstone , which are excellent holds for water , opportunities abound for water underground to warm up quickly . All said and done , it 's a " hot bed " for hot water .  
In August this year , satellite transmitters were attached to marine turtles on Penghu ; three years ago , a Formosan black bear was released into Yushan National Park wearing a radio collar ; and the squirrels scampering through the grass and up and down the tall tropical trees of Taipei Botanical Garden have been kitted out with modern high-tech products for several years now .  
In the future , those indigenous people who may become journalists will probably come from an intellectual elite who have received a higher education in Han society . Their Sinicization will be quite thorough , and most will have long ago moved away from their ancestral homes . They wo n't necessarily understand the current problems in the aboriginal villages .  
The reception room has long been the part of the Presidential Palace that has received the greatest public exposure . Two years ago , the simple old carpet and armchairs from the frugal days of national reconstruction were replaced . Now the walls and furniture are all coordinated in a gentle cream color , and the carpet is decorated with Chinese motifs .  
It is worth mentioning that the tower 's flagpole , which has been jokingly called " The Greatest Pole Under Heaven , " is made up of five large , medium and small cannon barrels joined together . A few years ago when the flagpole had to be replaced because of rust , the president 's office specially commissioned a fengshui master to calculate an auspicious day for raising the new pole .  
The broad idea for this was floated two years ago . The hope is that Taiwan can take advantage of its geographic location , orthodox Chinese culture , business connections with overseas Chinese , and solid industrial base to become the regional center for foreign firms coming to the Asian region ( and especially for those firms investing in the PRC ) .  
Fourteen years ago , at the age of 17 , Chen Yi-tsung had just graduated from an architecture course at a technical senior high school . As luck would have it , he found a job at Han-kwang architects ' office - - the first architectural practice within the ROC to carry out restoration of ancient monuments and to incorporate the spirit of traditional architecture in modern buildings .  
Five years ago she and her boyfriend , taking preparatory measures for their marital pics , started saving a year in advance , in regular monthly installments of more than NT $ 1000 . They had saved up the money just in time to take the pictures and arrange the wedding .  
But a heavy , dense oil painting is not suited to be rolled up in a scroll . To address this problem , Wang Yue-chih thinned his paint , abandoning the layered brush strokes of normal oil painting in favor of a flat application of color . This painting , completed sixty years ago , is ahead of its time in its pronounced Chinese character .  
Four years ago the villagers of Ssumakussu found a grove of sacred red cypress trees , the largest of which required a chain of 20 people to encircle it . The tree resembles a giant whose powerful arms are raised and open , and its discoverer , neighborhood chief Tseng Chen-chuan , has named it " Ta Lao Ye , " which means " big old gentleman . "  
The government should long ago have lifted the ban on private groups producing their own textbooks in order to get rid of the bad reputation for brainwashing students , " says Chou Chuan , who fought to have the ban on competition with the unified textbook system lifted . Few countries in the world except communist or backward nations use unified textbooks adopted at the national level . Even Communist China currently uses a system in which the central and local governments produce different textbooks .  
The anonymous sender wrote on it that it was composed 600 years ago by Liu Bowen , a wise and resourceful military counsellor to the first Ming emperor Zhu Yuan-zhang . The sender also added notes next to the crucial words and phrases to indicate that the poem had anotheinterpretation : " When the Taiwanese independence movement falls , where will Chen Shui-bian go ? Chrysanthemum flowers fall , plum flowers bloom , prospects unfold for the new united front and Jaw Shau-kong . " ( The characters for Jaw 's name appeared in the poem . )  
Twelve years ago the first book in the ROC to promote ecological conservation , We Only Have One Earth , was published . From that time until today , a rich selection of publications focusing on the natural environment has been produced in Taiwan , following the progressive development of environmental consciousness here . Recently a publishing house has even been established specializing in books about nature .  
Twenty years ago , our not-so-affluent society expressed its sympathy with actions , and enabled the two-year-old Siamese twins to live on through highly sophisticated surgery , growing up to be the two bright youths of today . Can the society that prides itself on economic accomplishments exert its collective power to help them over their many future hurdles ?  
Sixteen years ago , surgery to separate Siamese twins Chung-jen and Chung-yi captivated the nation . The 12-hour operation produced the world 's first successful separation of male Siamese-twin infants joined at the hip and born with only three legs . Some of the many people crowded around TV sets set off firecrackers in celebration , or thanked providence .  
Because the north and northeast coasts face directly into the seasonal northeasterly winds , the area is soaked in rain for the better part of the year , allowing vegetation to flourish . And of course 400 years ago this area was still completely undeveloped , so the primeval forest was intact .  
Ten years ago , a number of Southeast Asian women were brought to this traditional Hakka community to look for partners among the local widowers and single men , but less than ten of them married and settled in the area , and " foreign brides " remained a rarity . Later , the practice was stopped from catching on when the government began to restrict the entry of single women from Southeast Asia on tourist visas .  
Two years ago , the " seven wolves of NTNU " incident shed light on the long running , but heretofore unpublicized , problem of sexual harassment of female students by male professors . The incident has certainly served as a warning to many professors of questionable morals . But there has been some spillover affecting " innocent " instructors .  
Briton Dennis Casey , managing director of drugstore chain Watson 's The Chemist Taiwan , and a long-time resident in the Asia-Pacific region , observes that a few years ago prices in Taiwan were almost as high as in Japan . But with the fast opening of Taiwan 's markets and free competition , " the most efficient and modern international retailers are all setting up in Taiwan , bringing with them their international experience and vision , and seeking out low - price , high-quality products from all over the world to supply to local consumers . "  
The complete extinction 65 million years ago of the dinosaurs - - the subjects of unlimited imaginings of us latter-day creatures - - was a seemingly calamitous and tragic event which left no survivors . But in fact the average rate at which the dinosaurs died out was equivalent to one species every thousand years . Even if humans had been alive at the time , we could not easily have observed the course of their demise .  
Since the endemic Mikado pheasant was first recorded 80 years ago , no other new bird species has been discovered in Taiwan , and in recent years although mammals such as bats or shrews have been newly recorded here , the island 's forests have been logged up to elevations of 2500 meters , and today if mammals have remained undiscovered it is because of their hidden or inaccessible habitat or their nocturnal habit .  
Michael Chen of the Government Information Office was one of the key persons responsible for taking care of all the incoming foreign media . Based on prior experience ( 120 foreign reporters for the elections two years ago and 160 foreign reporters for the elections last year ) , Chen 's office estimated that about 250 personnel would arrive from abroad to cover the presidential race .  
The opium that undermined China more than a century ago arrived through transnational trade , and the same thing is true of modern narcotics . In advanced countries drug production is strictly controlled , and it is virtually impossible to cultivate poppies ( for opium or heroin ) , coca ( for cocaine ) , or cannabis on a huge scale . Given the high demand for narcotics in these societies , the result is that supplies are inadequate , naturally forcing prices up .  
Thirty years ago , an American director and cinematographer named Morton Heilig , inspired by 3-D films , had the " wild idea " of developing a " total illusion of reality " which would encompass sight , smell , motion , and sound . He declared that audiences would enjoy complete and realistic sensory stimulation .  
Whenever there was a construction site , a few bizarre pieces of stone , some large , some small , would appear on the surface of the ground . Some of them were still recognizable in shape ; it was obvious that they were knives , axes , arrowheads or other crafted objects that people had used at one time . Huge stone slabs made local residents suspect that they were the lids of coffins for some people of long ago .  
Based on his previous research work and on the finds at the ongoing test dig , Liu Yi-chang can offer a general description of the first Puli-ites - - " Tamalin Man " - - living 2400-1700 years ago . They were a late neolithic people who used flaked stone tools . From the large number of hitching stones and animal jawbones it can be inferred that they knew fishing and agriculture .  
Not far from the coast can be found a spirit temple , built at the site of some old graves . Unaware of the true origins of the dead , some Han Chinese sought to placate the ghosts they feared were left unattended and lonely . A few years ago , when the Liuhecai numbers game swept over all of Taiwan , the temple was particularly dense with the smoke of joss sticks .  
Two years ago , preparations were being made for Taiwan 's fourth nuclear power plant , to be built in Kungliao Rural Township . When they began digging , they uncovered objects suspected of being ancient relics of the Ketagalan . Pan Huo-yen blocked the excavating machines with his own body , and the photograph of this act became a symbol of the conflict between culture and economic development .  
After the plan for the offshore shipping center was brought before the public , the PRC government , which up until then had been constantly calling for direct cross-strait shipping to be established , based on the definition of a " domestic shipping line , " reversed its attitude 180 degrees . Since the regulation was passed over one year ago , not even one commercial ship has succeeded in crossing the strait .  
Although many people remain skeptical about duplicating the characters of the ancient masters , thirtysomething artist Tu Chung-kao expresses the opinion that throughout history the number of literate people was exceedingly large , and to be able to make a lasting impression for all time is no mean feat . The great masters that are held up for imitation today discovered long ago the best way to achieve the most beautiful composition and shape for each character . Copying them is essential .  
In making a new opera , characterization is very important , and the set character types of traditional opera are often insufficient . There 's nothing new about transcending these limitations by merging and melding traditional character types . Years ago Mei Lanfang combined traits of the qingyi ( leading female ) and huadan ( vivacious female ) roles to create a new type of role , the huashan , that combines features of both .  
For instance , I used to get into earnest discussions with everyone about artistic methods and schools and about what was unique to Chinese art . But after I read the Western masters I discovered that they had thought about many of these issues hundreds or even thousands of years ago , and I found that those things which I deemed so special about Chinese art also exist in Western culture . And so in looking back , those past discussions seem pretty laughable .  
Frictional unemployment usually is voluntary . Just a few years ago , when the economy was bubbling and industries like commercial services , finance and insurance , information technology , construction , and national infrastructure were growing rapidly , they could absorb all the " floating " manpower , and frictional unemployment was not a serious problem .  
But in the view of the institute 's director Chen San-ching , since Liu Shao-tang began the magazine thirty-odd years ago , although his work can not be said to follow the traditional methods of academic research , his contribution to Chinese contemporary history has been incomparable , for he has rescued countless quantities of first-hand material including manuscripts , photographs , documents and personal memoirs , and has inspired many people who then participated actively in research and writing .  
New Zealand is large and sparsely populated , and seems much like a paradise . I remember when I went to Auckland ten years ago , life was relaxed and orderly , prices were low , and there were lovely boutiques all over the city . Outside the cities was an endless expanse of meadows and trees . I felt only that God had made a beautiful place at the tip of the world , and that New Zealanders were very lucky .  
A few years ago there was an incident which shook society . A Buddhist medical worker who could not bear to witness the suffering of the severely ill in their last stages and the hardships imposed on families for the long-term care of " human vegetables , " " played God " and let some of them die . He was discovered and prosecuted .  
Given the resounding success of percussion today , it is hard to imagine that ten years ago this field of music was entirely neglected in Taiwan . At that time people generally though of percussion music as cacophonous , incapable of being melodic , and not the kind of thing to be put on in elegant halls .  
But if such views are optimistic , they do also seem to echo a voice that departed from the Chinese scene not all that long ago and which most people would not be happy to hear again . The idea that mainland China can achieve economic miracles if the population just gives up its lunch-time nap , the notion that if you multiply everything by 1.2 billion then you can beat the world , unavoidably harks back to earlier calls to " overtake Britain and catch up with America . "  
North-South cooperation But what of mainland China , the real homeland of the mihoutao ? Having woken up to the fact that what had been considered a very ordinary wild fruit actually has an export earnings potential far beyond what anyone could have imagined years ago , in recent years the mainland has started making strenuous efforts to make up lost ground by setting up research establishments and commencing commercial cultivation .  
As the silt rises higher behind the Shih-men Dam and its water storage capacity diminishes , it becomes ever more prone to drying up , flooding and turbidity . In the drought two years ago , an Earth God temple which had been drowned back when the reservoir was first filled with water came up for air , and the lake 's familiar expanse of water became a shortcut for gravel trucks which raced upstream across the hard , cracked mud of its dry bed .  
Several years ago it reached Fuhsing Rural Township to the north . Along the Northern Cross-Island Highway , the air turns cold early in the year , and this brings forward the harvest season of New Century pears , California plums , California honey plums , honey peaches and even kiwi-fruit . Thanks to the abundant sunshine , the quality of the fruit far surpasses that of other areas , and with Taiwan 's largest consumer market , Greater Taipei , close at hand , sales from the area have gradually taken off and overtaken Lishan .  
As for the railway museum , five years ago the TRA set up a museum planning team to find suitable locations , " but all of the NT $ 5 million which we had budgeted was cut by the provincial assembly . They thought it was more appropriate for museums to be planned by cultural and educational departments , " says Chen Te-pei , spreading his hands in a gesture of frustration .  
The ERSO , which single-handedly created the ROC 's semiconductor industry 16 years ago , has been the ROC 's biggest source of qualified staff in the field , and it successfully set up three of the industry 's companies : UMC , TSMC and Vanguard . But most private-sector companies do not have such a solid research team , and if they wish to join the fray , they have no choice but to directly form joint ventures with foreign companies , or buy technology from abroad .  
Because problems are not readily apparent at the time gifted and talented students are selected , the National Science Council 's Science Education Office unveiled another plan three years ago for an in-depth investigation of the qualities needed by today 's gifted and talented science students . The aim was to discuss and develop suitable methods of intelligence testing to meet modern needs .  
The White Paper on Youth released by the Executive Yuan 's National Youth Commission two years ago gave the results of a survey , showing that of parental attitudes toward their children , exploitation or abuse , too-severe discipline , contradictory parent-ing , differences in opinion between the two parents , breakdown of the family unit , worsening of the atmosphere in the family , low social status of parents , and incorrect values and attitudes toward society were the major factors leading to juvenile crime .  
Two years ago on Women 's Day , several hundred wives , mothers and grandmothers left their homes and their kitchens to take to the streets . They carried with them a revised copy of the Family Law provisions of the civil code which they delivered to the Legislative Yuan . They were rejecting having their praises sung yet again as " all-sacrificing model women , " and instead were representing the rights and interests of " three million injured Taiwanese women crying in the dark . "  
" For example , I discovered the Focolare Movement , founded fifty years ago by an Italian woman , Chiara Lubich . Besides spreading Catholic doctrine and beliefs , she also emphasized experimental lifestyles . She organized associations or cooperative societies in which people lived a simple life in close communion with nature . Today they still have communities and farms in West Africa and in Latin America . "  
Ho Chien-min , a thirty-year-old in direct sales who grew up in a Catholic family , says that he felt less and less able to identify with Catholicism as he grew older . He had n't been to church in more than 10 years , until a few years ago , when he heard the album of Catholic Gregorian chants , and was deeply moved . " It transcends the busy mundane world , raising the listener to a higher plane and drawing people to search for their spiritual source . "  
Five years ago , because he had to look after his children , he could not go too far from home , so he decided to embark on extended observation of a small , nameless earthen mountain next to the Wanfang residential development . He christened it " Little Green Mountain , " and produced a series of notes and articles describing the natural scenery and plant and animal life through the four seasons on the southern rim of the Taipei basin .  
Western classical music is the furthest removed from life ; such a huge orchestra can not possibly be heard in ordinary life . But nobody ever asks questions about " the modern life of Western classical music . " The equipment of Western wind and string instrumental music is a form belonging to more than a century ago , but nobody ever wonders why orchestras do n't modernize .  
Three years ago , Wu San-ho , an associate professor at National Taiwan University 's Department of Agriculture , heard of Chuang Yu-long 's ability to grow gorgeous , healthy crops on red clay without the use of chemical fertilizers . He led a group of students who spent several days at the farm doing on-site experiments .  
The combined effects of ROC foreign policy and cross-strait relations make this stage of ROC foreign relations extremely unusual . How does Chang , an old foreign-affairs hand , who studied international politics and entered the diplomatic corps nearly 30 years ago , and who bears the high expectations of the people , plan to steer the ROC diplomatic ship through these troubled times ?  
As one author puts it with complete confidence in a book published only a few years ago , when the gates of China were forced open in the nineteenth century , " the dreadful truth leaked out : the scale of the gardens of the mandarins compared to their equivalents in England rather as the bonsai does to the beech . " With such a world of difference between the Chinese and the English garden , the two should not be spoken of in the same breath . Mountain buildings , myriad torrents  
He notes that modern national dress must have five key characteristics : it must be comfortable , artistic , modern , suited to the locality , and universal . He calls his ideal national dress shuya , which means " comfortable and elegant . " Taking the lead himself , two years ago he put aside his Western suits and asked a tailor to make a shuya outfit that Yu himself had designed . He wears it to work and to give lectures .  
Chen Hung-wei , a journalism student at Chengchi University , began to play the Japanese version of " The Three Kingdoms , " a game incorporating Chinese history and military strategy , two years ago . Not knowing Japanese did n't stop him from enjoying the game ; he spent the entire summer vacation after his freshman year attacking cities , invading countries and opening up the borderlands , often playing all night long .  
Remembering the day five years ago when Wei-wei was diagnosed as a hyperactive child by a doctor at National Taiwan University Hospital , Ho says , " I sat in the car and the tears just would n't stop falling , regretting the past , worrying about the future . . . . I was pained by the number of times our boy had been hit even though he was innocent . It hurt me that I had made so many wrong choices and that our son had been wrongly accused so many times .  
Yang Wen-I notes that the Biennale has always been an open-application exhibition . For instance , four years ago the motion artist Li Ming-shen applied as an individual . But this time the curators filed the application , and after careful consideration of the Biennale selection committee , it was accepted . Multiplication / Fragmentation is formally listed as part of the Biennale de Venezia 97 and is included in the show 's official catalog .  
Twenty years ago , people watched Taiwan 's Little League teams fighting for glory abroad on late night TV . A few days ago , people stayed up all night watching a live marathon program , directed by and starring a major criminal . Then came the elections for county and city executives . After the excitement generated by political " stars , " the victory of the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) has rewritten the political map of Taiwan .  
" I hope in the future we can trek once per year , passing through traditional lands and places of historical importance , to understand how the West Rukai spread . We will also survey the natural resources . " Sasala says that elders told him many things he did not know-about things that happened long ago , and that place names were often derived from commonly used plants . Creating a foundation of shared knowledge among the generations marks the beginning of transmission of the tribal culture .  
By the close of business every day , the counter on which the organically grown fruits and vegetables are displayed is usually bare . Chen Chun-chun , CEO of Organic World , which he founded three years ago , says that Taiwan 's organic foods market is growing quickly ; annual growth is 20-30% .  
About 400 years ago people began coming over to Taiwan from Fujian and Guangdong in search of land to farm . Faced with the perilous sea voyage and the hazardous life of pioneers , they naturally had a strong need for some authoritative guidance in determining the best ( and worst ) times to act .  
Not long ago , pop star Chang Yu-sheng was involved in a serious car accident . When he reached the hospital , he was pronounced dead on arrival . Had there been a trained professional there when he had his accident , he might have been saved .  
Some years ago , Mai Jan-mei was director of guidance at another Taipei middle school , located in one of the city 's most infamous criminal areas . At that time some pupils formed a gang and began causing trouble . They padded their left shoulders up high and went around the school terrorizing the other children ; even teachers did n't dare mess with them .  
Southeast Asia and the mainland entice firms with their low production costs and their market potential . In addition , about 70% of the economic strength of the region is concentrated in the hands of Chinese business people who , in turn , are closely tied to Taiwanese business people . This drew many Taiwanese to the region more than 10 years ago , making them some of Southeast Asia 's earliest foreign investors .  
" Not only do we need to make the environment more suitable , we also need to change our habits and thinking about leisure , " says Lin Wan-yi . Lin says that with regard to Taiwan 's leisure-time habits , you have to remember that the whole society only went from being an agricultural one to an industrial one 20 or 30 years ago . " The traditional Chinese agrarian society did n't operate on a system of weeks . People 's holidays were folk festivals and their way of celebrating them was active and noisy . "  
Some four years ago , when the architects responsible for renovating the Li Family Compound had the Lotus Flower Pool changed from its original irregular oval shape into the usual traditional half-moon shape , 77-year-old Li Yen Hsiu-feng , chairperson of the Li Family Compound management committee , insisted it be torn up and redone .  
He met the subject of the piece , Li Jung-lin , nine years previously when Li handled the funeral of his mother . But it was only two years ago , when Lin 's mother 's grave was robbed , and Li , wearing a gas mask , personally went into the grave to repair the damage to the coffin , that Lin really came to understand this man . He discovered that Li has quite remarkable views on death , human dignity , and on the poor self-regulation of the funeral industry .  
Two years ago , the special education center at National Taiwan Normal University conducted a survey of Taiwanese firms which made the above bias all too clear . The results indicated that bosses were most willing to hire handicapped persons whose disability involved their arms or legs . The next most " popular " were the hearing impaired , followed by the mentally retarded . Visually-impaired persons did not make a single boss ' list .  
It emerged that the Rey Lee Resort Hotel , which suffered severe structural damage in the quake , is actually an illegal structure , and its business license was revoked long ago . However , the owner had continued operating the hotel , leading to many guests being injured by earth and rock falls set off by the quake .  
Forty or fifty years ago , acute bacterial and viral diseases were the major cause of death in Taiwan . Today , they have been replaced by cancer and cerebrovascular disease . However , the threat from infectious diseases has not disappeared .  
When she came to Taipei three years ago , she did not choose a foreign firm , in which internal communication is normally done in English . Rather , she entered a local urban planning firm , in which only Chinese was spoken , and learned her Chinese the hard way .  
Twenty years ago Shiatzy presented an improved chi pao . Influenced by the film The Last Emperor , ten years ago they created an awe-inspiring imperial effect using Qing style beadwork and embroidery , silks , satins and velvets , in brown , gold and purple colors . This year Shiatzy are using cotton and linen with hand-drawn designs to create a Zen-like poetic quality .  
A few years ago , male writer Ku Ling , speaking at a public forum , advised married Taiwanese men to beware of " public menaces . " He was referring to well-educated , independent , and ambitious women who were unwilling to settle down .  
Market numbers tell the story . The privately-operated CGMH , which is the largest health-care organization in Taiwan , opened its first TCM department , fully staffed by doctors with dual backgrounds in both TCM and Western medicine , at its Linkou medical center two years ago . The number of patients seen by its out-patient clinic has grown explosively to its current level of around 25,000 per month , an average of approximately 1,000 per day .  
Edwin Yen was a pioneer who was studying and promoting sex education for schoolchildren as long as 20 years ago ; he is now director of the Health Education Department at NTNU and executive director of the Mercy Memorial Foundation . He points out that in the past the education system was conservative . Sex was considered to be dirty and vulgar , not worthy of the halls of knowledge . Children were left to find out for themselves as best they could .  
Chunghsing Village was modeled after English communities . Over 40 years ago , it was unique in Taiwan for its waste water treatment and rain water drainage systems , its specially planted camphor trees , bodhi trees , and assorted grasses and plants , giving the entire village plentiful greenery and shade .  
" Clinical practice has demonstrated that appropriate levels of hormone supplements , antioxidants and immune-system-boosting vitamins keep the body functioning optimally and naturally provide a youthful glow . It 's like regaining one 's youth , " says Dr . Wang , a former director of the surgical ward of Chang Gung Children 's Hospital . He states that in Europe geriatric medicine focused on controlling aging long ago developed into a full-fledged specialization providing full medical services , and that this field is now being introduced into Taiwan .  
Paiwan pottery can be divided into male and female . Male pots have designs of the hundred-pace snake while female pots are decorated with nipples . Because the Paiwan tribe long ago lost techniques for making pots , contemporary artists such as Pavavalung must attempt to imitate ancient pots .  
Three years ago , Luotung High School principal Hsu Wen-shong received a letter from the Paper Windmill Theater Troupe , saying that the Council for Cultural Affairs had commissioned them to implement a " Youth Theatre Project . " They were accepting invitations from schools for professional theatrical personnel to guide school theater programs , and the troupe was planning to put on instructional performances in schools . The project would also include other events such as talks by famous actors like Hugh Lee and Liang Tzu-yun , and camps designed to help teachers practice writing and directing .  
How the department came into being is a story in itself . Several years ago , a reporter was sent to interview a recently arrested suspect . The suspect wept bitter tears which the reporter assumed stemmed from his impending incarceration . But the suspect surprised the reporter , stating that he was not crying for himself , but was worried about how his elderly parents , his wife and his children would survive with him in jail .  
Shih himself has applied the right-brain concept to the commercial sphere . In the ideas about " business culture " that Shih put forward a number of years ago , he suggested that people are changed by emotional stimuli , not rational argument . This is very much in keeping with the right-brain concept . And in his " right-brain leadership " concept , put forward two years ago , Shih takes his approach a step further , proposing EQ-based , creative management .  
A year ago , when SET established its news department with a focus on what is termed " community news " ( meaning crime , sex and other sensational topics ) , it originally expected to lose about NT $ 5 million a month . Now , a year later , they have discovered that they have actually been making money , and they have decided to turn into an all-news station , adding staff in anticipation of the media wars that are sure to erupt during the presidential election campaigns .  
Twenty-eight-year-old Li Ching-yu went to senior high school and university in Canada , and graduated in economics . After he took over his father 's business four years ago , he introduced modern management methods . He not only redecorated and enlarged the premises , set up a limited company and instituted a profit sharing and stock ownership scheme for employees , but recently also embarked on an expansion plan calling for opening new branches , like a home-grown McDonald 's .  
At the National Palace Museum , the door-way to the Sanxingdui exhibit is designed to look like a time tunnel . Pass through it , and you are transported to a world that vanished millennia ago . The first thing that greets your eyes is a bronze statue over two meters tall , towering regal and majestic over the milling commoners .  
The bizarre-looking relics in this room might just as well be aliens from outer space , so odd is their appearance . Where they come from , however , is Sanxingdui , where they lay buried for over 3,000 years ago in a land regarded by the people of the Yellow River region as a wilderness inhabited by uncivilized barbarians . This is another in a string of recent archeological discoveries which prove that the Yellow River culture was not the only source of Chinese civilization .  
Little did they know that just beneath their feet lay the buried remains of an ancient culture dating back to a period ranging from 2,800 to 4,800 years ago . After several decades of research , however , archeologists have brought to light spectacular proof of an ancient " Sanxingdui culture . " Relics have been unearthed at dozens of locations around the huge Sanxingdui site , which covers a total area of more than 15 square kilometers .  
There is no parallel in human history for the bronze-making culture that flourished in China over 3,000 years ago . Particularly noteworthy are the bronzes that have been unearthed at Anyang in the Yellow River basin . The style and manufacturing techniques of Shang bronzes spread far and wide-to modern-day Shan-dong in the east , Shanxi and Shaanxi in the west , Liaoning in the north , and Guangdong in the south .  
Now that the Sanxingdui exhibit has brought over a huge bronze statue of a man and many other exotic items , another blockbuster exhibit from the mainland has been scheduled for October . The autumn event will feature the superbly preserved silk paintings found at the Mawangdui site in Hunan Province as well as the stunning jade pieces discovered in Guangzhou at the royal tomb of the Nanyue kingdom . Going in the other direction , a private Taiwanese collection ( Ku Yue Ko ) was put on exhibit four years ago at the Palace Museum in Beijing .  
With prompt action , it appears that hoof-and-mouth disease is under control . However , the Water Quality Protection Bureau of the Environmental Protection Administration warns that 24 wells were contaminated by the hasty burial of hogs which were slaughtered en masse to try to halt the spread of hoof-and-mouth disease among hogs two years ago . The EPA has warned the agencies in charge to be careful in disposing of the infected cattle which have been recently destroyed .  
A half-century ago , our image of the Han period still rested entirely upon what we could learn from historical records , but all that changed beginning in 1972 thanks to a series of major archeological finds at a number of tombs dating back to the Han dynasty . A huge quantity of silks , wooden tomb figurines , bamboo slips used for writing , and other burial items cast an entirely new light upon the way Chinese people lived two millennia ago .  
An elderly gent named Chang , who left Taiwan 20 years ago and returned a couple of years ago , is amazed when he sees cartoons lampooning national leaders or when radio commentators say national figures ' " brains are on the fritz . " Is this is the same country that he left all those years ago because of its suffocating and oppressive atmosphere ?  
The narrowing of international space in turn sparked the rise of " nativist ideology " in Taiwan-nascent Taiwanese nationalism . Now that Taiwan is free , democratic , and prosperous , the old policy of refusing to coexist in the international community with mainland China has been abandoned , and the government hopes to create a " win-win " situation . But mainland China still has the mindset from the civil war half a century ago .  
The Lin family 's " New Tile House " was built almost two centuries ago , and is the oldest family compound in the Liuchia high-speed rail development area . The high-speed rail plan originally called for the ancestral shrine and some of the defensive walls to be preserved as a park , but local residents and the Lin family are not satisfied with this solution and have been protesting to the agency in charge of the high-speed rail in the hope of persuading it to preserve the entire compound .  
People are forgetful , and as the nightmare of 21 September fades from memory , getting citizens to remain prudent and vigilant will be easier said than done . A recent survey in Japan , which had been on " full alert " after the Kobe earthquake , revealed that 34% of the public had made no special preparations whatsoever for a major earthquake-a full ten percentage points more than in a survey two years ago .  
In recent times , due to the limited productive value of its mainly agricultural economy , the township had become rather run-down and had been losing population to other areas . Nonetheless , it still had many distinctive historic features such as Chichi Railway Station and Minghsin Academy , along with traditional rural scenes such as tobacco fields , banana groves , fruit orchards and tree-lined roads . These assets had long ago given Lin the idea of using them as tourist resources to breathe new life into Chichi .  
If you only knew about these two , you would think that the women of the Han court either spent their days relying on their beauty as weapons in internecine power struggles , or ended up getting married off to the ruler of a distant land to cement some strategic alliance . A code of proper female conduct was explicitly prescribed for the first time by two books that were written about 2,000 years ago .  
She takes for example feminist issues , about which she is particularly concerned . Twenty years ago , she wrote a TV serial that overturned the tradition that the female lead had to be chaste , unmarried , and dependent on men ; instead her female lead was a middle-aged divorcee with children and a relationship with a younger man . Society was shocked from top to bottom .  
Huang Ming-chuan , who studied law before he began making movies , has come to be seen as the standard-bearer for independent films in Taiwan . Flat Tire , which he completed two years ago , tells the story of a pair of documentary makers traveling around Taiwan to film the island 's religious and political statuary . ( photo by Pu Hua-chih )  
In ancient times Dongguan was covered with lichee plantations whose fruit was favored by the imperial consort Yang Guifei . Just a little more than a decade ago Dongguan was still a largely agricultural area , its landscape a patchwork of rice paddies and corn fields . It has since been completely made over into a " boundless industrial park " with an area of 2,520 square kilometers , a population of more than 5 million , and more than 3,000 Taiwan firms .  
In autobiographical notes which Liu wrote a few years ago for the benefit of his many local and overseas visitors , he outlined his career prior to founding Biographical Literature : " Liu Shao-tang ( original name Liu Tsung-hsiang ) ; ancestral home Lutai , Hebei Province ; born in Jin County , Liaoning Province , on the 14th day of the ninth lunar month , 1921 .  
In response to Lin 's accusations , Chiou I-jen , director of Chen 's national election campaign headquarters , said that Lin was engaged in slander pure and simple . In fact , explained Chiou , the entire matter was very easily explained . Chen Chin-tsai and Chen Tien-fu used Chen Shui-bian 's name without authorization to defraud Tan Kok Ping . This crime came to light long ago , and Chen Chin-tsai admitted under questioning that he had forged Chen Shui-bian 's signature .  
Whether you are making a film or making glass , the creative process can easily make you tense and worried , and this is likely to be reflected in the way you get along with others . So other people often used to find me irritable or restless . It was not until a few years ago , when I produced a series of modern Buddha figures in glass , that I gained an entirely new insight .  
Paintings on silk tend to degenerate fairly quickly , generally lasting a century or two , with the oldest surviving examples ( safely buried underground ) dating back no further than two thousand years to the Han dynasty . But ceramic works can keep their color for millennia , and today we can still appreciate works of colored pottery and black pottery from as far back as six and seven thousand years ago . " Painting enhances the value of ceramics , and ceramics enables painting to last through time . "  
1,000 years ago , under the rule of scholars who valued culture over military prowess , Song-dynasty China saw rapid economic development and brought forth remarkable cultural and artistic achievements .  
According to the first-century Roman historian Pliny the technique was discovered around five thousand years ago by Phoenician traders on the Mediterranean coast . A crew of traders camping on the beach rested their cooking pots on bricks of natron , a sodium-carbonate-based mineral that they were transporting , and noticed that vitreous strips were formed when the heated mineral fused together with sand .  
3,500 years ago people in Egypt and Mesopotamia had already mastered the core-forming method of glassmaking , in which molten glass was extracted from the crucible on the end of an iron bar that had first been wrapped in a mixture of clay and horse manure . Threads of colored glass were then wound around the surface and decorative wave patterns were added . Once the glass cooled the core was scooped out , leaving a flask for storing perfume or collecting teardrops .  
It all began eight years ago at a friend 's home , where Chen and his wife saw a statue of the Buddha dating back to the Northern Qi dynasty ( mid-6th century ) . Although neither of the two are Buddhists , they were captivated by the simple serenity of the statue . Concerned by the fact that war and chaos in China have left many of the country 's ancient Buddhist statues scattered across the globe , Chen decided to do his part to recover what he could from abroad .  
Huang Min-nan , who formerly headed pop music planning at Rock Records , says : " Buddhist music now changes several times a year . " Not so long ago Chinese-style symphonic music , or chanting accompanied by a single instrument was popular , but at the moment it 's all about " spiritual " music and dance tunes .  
A : Our company is a transnational group , so as long as a year and a half ago we started thinking about what kind of new corporate culture we should develop to be able to maintain our leading position in the 21st century . Eventually we established four key elements for our future success .  
Over 2,000 years ago the Han Dynasty envoy Zhang Qian ( d . 114 BC ) traveled into the western regions , writing a great page in the history of global cultural interchange . Many important agricultural crops such as grapes , alfalfa and walnuts are reputed to have entered China at that time . 21 centuries later , in our age of highly developed international transport and commerce , the farming , forestry and fisheries industries play the role of modern Zhang Qians , importing countless weird and wonderful fruits , vegetables , birds and beasts .  
A turning point was reached two years ago , however , as the global Internet infrastructure began to mature . Increasingly available broadband connections offered dramatic improvements in speed , and online games began proliferating . Ever since the wave broke over Taiwan , the number Internet cafes has been growing rapidly .  
Years ago , the Japanese built the Mienyueh branch of the Alishan Mountain Railway to gain access to the cypress forests for logging . As the engineers cut their way along mountainsides and hacked out tunnels , they exposed large areas of steep rock face shaded by dense jungle above , and thus unwittingly produced excellent conditions for pleiones to grow .  
A few days ago my old friend Hsieh Chun-teh let me have a look at his most recent book , an experimental collection of 50 digital images that he has spent the last five years working on . Comparing it with the works he has published using conventional photographic techniques , I feel that , in terms of both form and content , he has gone beyond his old self , and he has also showed how photographers of the future can make use of digital imaging technology .  
Wu admits that university students are not as knowledgeable as they used to be , but feels that the wider availability of a university education is not the only reason . He notes that five years ago , graduate school admissions committees would never have asked an applicant if he or she had been abroad . Now , however , many university students and even high-school students have traveled overseas . " This generation of students has had a more diverse array of experiences than the previous .  
For instance , 40 years ago , after Chinese-American scientists Yang Chen-ning and Lee Tsung-dao received a Nobel physics prize , there was a boom in the popularity of physics courses . For the last five or six years law departments have consistently topped the rankings in Category 1 , but although the demand for legally qualified personnel has grown thanks to Taiwan 's progress towards the rule of law , the number of universities with law departments has increased too , making competition between law graduates more intense than before .  
As admirable as the accomplishments of modern-day astronomers , are those of their ancient Chinese counterparts . Long ago , our ancestors understood how to read the astronomical clock , and elaborated on real and perceived connections between celestial and human events . In those days , virtually everyone had some understanding of the heavens . Astronomers observed , recorded , and pondered the significance of celestial phenomena , and knowledge of astronomy affected the actions of rulers .  
Twenty years ago theorists proposed that the magnetic field extended down below the sun 's surface to a depth of 0.7 solar radii from the center of the sun surface , but signals from the magnetic field are very weak , and could not be detected by the methods and instruments then available . But today acoustic imaging has enabled Chou Dean-yi to find much stronger evidence in support of the 20-year-old theory , and this is highly significant for solar astronomy .  
With that experience under his belt , he decided three years ago at the age of 57 that in addition to his full-time job at a trading company , he would get involved in the matchmaking business by helping his wife , the outgoing Chu Li-li , set up " Super Matchmaker-Mama Jan " next door to the Asia Pacific Hotel on Taipei 's east side . The Jan clan uses a traditional one-on-one style of matchmaker-moderated meetings to help eligible young singles find dating partners , hopefully leading to marriage .  
Ten years ago , Japanese rice and dairy farmers strapped on headbands and took to the streets , like Taiwanese farmers on May 20th 1989 , but imported rice and pork could not compete with the high quality and safety guarantees of organically produced agricultural products , no matter how cheap they were . Japanese consumers remained very loyal to local rice . Two years ago , Japan abandoned its hard won caps on rice imports , because they no longer feared competition .  
From the very start , Yung'an has served as an experimental school for the nine-year integrated curriculum . Taiwan 's textbook publishers are now hard at work compiling textbooks for the integrated curriculum , but they have only finished with the first grade so far . The teachers at Yung'an , however , started working long ago to create an integrated curriculum of their own . Using existing textbooks as reference , they have already developed several integrated textbooks for the second and third grades .  
When students used to come from southern Taiwan to Taipei to study 20 years ago , they were warned about Taipei 's gray and wet winters . Friends and relatives reminded them to carry a newspaper with them at all times to keep off the fine rain of the northeastern monsoon . Over the years , however , Taipei 's winters have changed , becoming drier and less overcast .  
This sinologist from afar believes that his destiny has always been connected to China . Indeed , Joppert , who has always shown an outstanding intellect ever since early youth and has a sharp sixth sense , believes that 900 years ago he was a senior minister in the court of Huizong . The latter two characters of his Chinese name , Li Jiade , are identical with the name of the Song emperor Huizong 's main palace : Jiade Palace . Is that a coincidence , or fate ?  
Over the last few years , Li Hsien-wen 's life has changed quite a lot . He not only eats vegetarian , but he has also moved to the countryside and abandoned burdensome clothing such as suit and tie . At the same time , he has influenced his wife , who began practicing calligraphy three years ago . When she is free she copies a bit of traditional poetry , and able to settle in at her house , she no longer feels lonely .  
Here at the other end of the Earth in Taiwan , the wise words written in the Bible 2000 years ago are borne out : on Linshan Point , a windswept promontory jutting out into the sea from Taiwan 's north coast , between the sandy beach and the rock face there grows a carpet of tough coastal plants , including a scattering of short-stemmed flowers .  
Because of Yu 's clear status as a " friendly critic " of the government , the ruling party always treated Yu with great respect . Yu long held a seat on the KMT 's Central Standing Committee . Many years ago while visiting family in mainland China , Yu was received as a VIP by Jiang Zemin . During their meeting , Yu forcefully expressed his position on the inappropriateness of the " one country , two systems " model , recommending instead a " China confederation " model .  
Because there are so many wonderful uses for sensors , the National Science Council listed them as a scientific and technological focal point more than 10 years ago , and the ITRI started to research and develop them . Unfortunately , at that time most investors were focused on the stock and real estate markets , and the hot electronics sector swept away all investment capital . This left no money whatsoever for unfashionable fields such as sensors .  
The Tatun volcanic episode ended 350,000 years ago , but in geologic terms the landscape is still young , and the geothermal activity persists . The area 's abundant rainfall trickles down into the underlying strata of quartz sandstone , an ideal aquifer which fills with hot groundwater .  
The blinding light reflecting off the textured surface is both mysterious and moving . Lava story Between eight and 17 million years ago , in the southern part of the Taiwan Strait , magma forced its way through fractures in the earth 's crust . The lava poured through to the surface , accumulating and covering the earth in large and small piles , creating the impressively beautiful Penghu archipelago .  
Eight million years ago , the east coast of Taiwan was at the very edge of where the Philippine Sea Plate was crashing into the Asian mainland . As compression along the edge of the Eurasian Plate increased , fracturing of the crust in the Taiwan Strait came to an end . Channels for magma to reach the surface were sealed , and volcanic activity was locked out . All that remains is the basalt that the sea has been continuing to erode for tens of millions of years .  
The Chinkuashih area has a unique , long , and complex history of geological activity . Tahan College associate professor Yu Ping-sheng , who has extensively studied the local geology , tells us that the sedimentary rock which forms the area accumulated on the ocean floor 25 million years ago .  
During the Ming dynasty an Inspection Office was set up here , and Kinmen became an important maritime defense settlement . After the commanding general , Zhou Dexing , said of the place , " It is as impregnable as a metal [ kin ] wall and a moat of boiling water , and it commands control of the ocean gate [ men ] , " it came to be called Kinmen . Thus Kinmen 's role as a key military strong point began several hundred years ago .  
In late January , Legislative Yuan member Apollo Chen held a press conference to plead the case for giving permanent residency rights to Doris Brougham and other foreigners who long ago put down roots in Taiwan . Both ruling and opposition parties agreed that the issue was worthy of prompt attention , and later President Chen Shui-bian and interior minister Yu Cheng-hsien also publicly expressed their support .  
In fact , in a survey carried out two years ago by the Environmental Quality Protection Foundation and National Tsing Hua University , almost 40% of fish sampled from food markets contained excessive levels of " persistent organic pollutants , " which are likely to act as environmental hormones . However , following angry protests from fishermen after the report was published , no action was taken .  
Although they had not " done " anything , she broke out in a cold sweat . Her concern reminded me of the time a few years ago when I discovered a 15-year-old student whom I was tutoring engaged in a raucous game of mahjongg with three classmates , each of them accompanied by a girlfriend !  
However , 30 to 40 years ago , watercourses and paddy fields in the plains of western Taiwan , and in the Lanyang Plain to the east were full of native paradise fish . The fish were close companions of agricultural life , and because of the striking black-green spots on their gill covers they were known by many names , such as three-spot , cover-spot fighting fish , Taiwan fighting fish and Taiwan goldfish , as well as paradise fish .  
With these two types of sustenance , one material and one spiritual , naturally one can live a long time , " says Lu . In fact , as long ago as the Song dynasty , Su Dongpo had identified three major advantages of eating zhou : " It brings peace of mind , which contributes to well-being , it is easy on the stomach , which contributes to physical energy , and it saves money , which contributes to becoming wealthy . "  
Some months ago you ran a feature on digital content , and recently you also reported the development of nanotechnology in Taiwan . From these articles we can see how sensitive the government is to the development of new technologies , and how-whether by their own initiative or with government guidance-many large , medium and small enterprises are getting involved in R &amp; D or production related to these emerging technologies .  
Amidst the concurrence of rising rice wine prices , initial licensing of private distilling operations , and bootleg poisonings , sales of standard rice wine-the former " red label , " now Daoxiang 40 proof ( i.e . 20% alcohol content ) - fell from 25 million dozen bottles two years ago to 400,000 last year .  
But a year ago when RollCoCo launched another set of cartoon characters called CoCoPlay , featuring four cheeky children wearing animal-head masks , they immediately drew adverse comments such as " Not funny ! " or " Kill them off , do n't make any more ! " so they naturally stopped developing the characters .  
Recently a friend studying in Germany returned to Taiwan , and said with obvious feeling that despite the flourishing of the Aboriginal movement in Taiwan over the past ten years , when he returned to the village where he had done field work seven or eight years ago , he discovered the same old thing : lonely old people , kids who quit school halfway through , and emptiness in the tribal community . " Have n't you noticed this gap ? " he asked .  
It occupies about six hectares , divided into three parts : an upper compound , a lower compound , and a garden . Because the buildings had authentic antique carving , painting , and craftsmanship , they were considered a classic example of early architectural arts in Taiwan , and long ago the Estate was designated as a Grade 2 national historic site by the Ministry of the Interior .  
Many years ago , Nanfang Shuo became interested in the origins of language . Taking vocabulary often seen in the reporting of news events as his starting point , he set about tracing the historical origins of certain words and phrases whilst also discussing the process by which their meaning in society has evolved . For example , researching the Chinese expression for " mafia " ( heidao , literally " black way " ) Nanfang Shuo conducted a textual search of references to black and the metaphorical implications of the color to Chinese people .  
Will Chen Shui-bian be able to repeat his performance of three years ago , when his chance of victory was thought to be slim , but he went into the campaign full of confidence and energy and ultimately won the presidency ? Given his past record of coming out on top against all odds , it will be worth waiting to see if Chen will once again defeat his political opponents and the wheel of Taiwanese democracy will make another successful turn .  
The Chinese first made lacquer ware some seven millennia ago . Archeologists have discovered that the Hemudu Culture produced red lacquer on a wood base , and numerous archeological digs over the past few decades at burial sites dating back two to three millennia have turned up perfectly preserved lacquer ware surrounded by badly rotted artifacts made of wood and other materials . Records of Artisanry mentions the kings Shun and Yu ( both of whom ruled roughly 3,200 years ago ) making lacquer ware items .  
Originally established 45 years ago as a tourism-development taskforce , these days the TAT operates 17 overseas offices and has an annual budget of THB3 to 3.5 billion . Thailand 's numbers of both domestic and foreign tourists have been growing steadily for years , and we expect the number of visitors to top the 10-million mark next year .  
It was a serious blow to anti-nuclear activists when the Legislative Yuan approved funding for construction of the 4NPP seven years ago . These activists and the DPP responded by becoming determined to totally revolutionize energy policy and public opinion . In the 2000 presidential election , the DPP won the office of the presidency , and to fulfill its campaign promises , conducted a reevaluation of the 4NPP and subsequently announced the suspension of its construction . This move , however , provoked a major constitutional crisis , pitting the president against the opposition-controlled legislature .  
The outbreak of an epidemic of the pre-viously unknown disease SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) revealed a Taiwan public health system shot through with flaws . But twenty years ago , Taiwan had suppressed malaria , Japanese encephalitis , infantile paralysis , and other infectious diseases and had successfully set up a powerful frontline , grassroots defense network against epidemics .  
During Qing times , train station warehouses were strategic military entrepots ; during the Japanese occupation they were used as storage facilities by the sugar , salt , and forestry industries ; and after the war they were used to accommodate rail passengers on their way south or north . Although they were located in urban centers with good communication links , these warehouses stopped being used for freight storage many years ago .  
Vincent Hsieh , the chief operations officer ( COO ) at PC Home Online , which crossed over into online marketing three years ago , says that SARS definitely boosted Internet sales of things like surgical masks , thermometers , disinfectant , and air purifiers . But he also suggests that the Internet succeeds mainly because of its special characteristics-speed and suitability for new and unusual products . Therefore he thinks that online selling is attractive enough in itself that it will not experience any sharp falloff now that the epidemic is over .  
Thirty years ago , when martial was still in effect , the heavy hand of political authority held Taida in a tight grip . But the NTU spirit of never compromising was not extinguished .  
" Setting down roots and deepening our impact is the real hard job , " says Yu Mei-nu . To help close the gap between town and country , two years ago they began organizing women 's groups in northern , central , southern , and eastern Taiwan to create the NUTWA , to create a platform for information and resource sharing . They are now moving to use the Internet to link women 's groups across the island .  
For Wang Steak , which has annual revenues in Taiwan in excess of NT $ 1 billion and long ago extended its operations to the US , entry into the PRC was obviously rather late . Park Cheng explains : " We did a survey of white-collar workers several years ago and discovered that although Shanghai once did have areas controlled by Britain and France , nobody in Shanghai chose ' Western food ' as their preferred option for dinner out . "  
Aside from the massive popularity of the Nostalgia Lunches , domestic convenience store chains are also paying attention to this virgin market . Starting a couple of years ago , one after another they started offering different kinds of local packed lunches , starting a " biandang war , " - one would offer theirs for NT $ 40 , so a competitor would drop theirs to NT39 , all promoting their lower prices .  
Originally employed as a machinist , Grandfather Chen lost his job a few years ago as a result of the general industrial upgrading , which led to the closure of his factory .

Grandmother Chen , meanwhile , has been operated on for breast cancer and is in poor health .  
Kray Kee is a small settlement of the Karen minority , located in the northwestern Thai county of Tha Song Yang , nine kilometers from the nearest main road . It used to take three hours to reach on foot , until only a year ago villagers working together finally built a simple road through the mountains , allowing access to four-wheel-drive vehicles . However , during the monsoon season , this unstable mud road becomes much more dangerous to travel along and the only reliable way to reach the village is on foot .  
Professor Lin Wan-I of the Department of Social Work , National Taiwan University , recalls that four years ago , when he was vice-mayor of Taipei City , he was astonished to discover that junior high schools had rules that stipulated that female students who got pregnant would be considered to have committed the equivalent of three major violations of the school code and would therefore be expelled .  
To break the " teaching by subject " mold that had characterized teaching at the primary and middle school levels for more than ten years , the " integrated curriculum " for grades 1 to 9 was introduced four years ago . Although it reduced ten subjects to seven major disciplines , the core subjects of mathematics , Chinese and English remained clearly delineated in the classroom .  
The search for alternative sources of energy has become an important issue worldwide . In Taiwan , the debate four years ago over whether to continue building a fourth nuclear power plant produced a popular consensus that the island should be made a nuclear-free zone . Thus we urgently need to find clean , safe , sustainable energy sources .  
Over a decade ago , Hsu Jen-hsiu founded an environmentalist group and funneled his passion for exploration into disseminating environmental concepts . Lin A-min said farewell to the mountains in order to work . He says that life in Taipei seems even more like an exploration , packed with all kinds of curious spectacles and personalities . And last year Max Liu , whom nearly all of Taiwan 's explorers hold in the highest regard , departed this life and continued his exploration of the unknown in the mysterious world beyond .  
It was only then that he learned from Wang 's son that that tree was planted by Wang and his wife when they married . After the death of his wife years ago , Wang was very lonely , and that commemorative tree was his only solace . No wonder the old man was so worried and depressed about the tree .  
Somewhat over a decade ago , Brother Hotel owner Hung Teng-sheng , amidst widespread skepticism , played midwife to the birth of pro ball , and laid a foundation for its success .

Later she joined up with a study group run by the Mandarin Daily News , and finally , ten years ago , she moved on to the volunteer service at NTUH .  
Visiting the Wenshan Public Hall , which sits next to Mucha Elementary School , you 'll find the elegant former Japanese residence brings to mind times gone by . The turfed courtyard and plastic ground cover at the rear set each other off nicely , giving the place a refined , tranquil feel .

FRTRI director Liu Pao-pao , who has designed rock-climbing shoes and medical footwear for the elderly , says , " If we had presented medical footwear for specific professions or elderly people to the public ten years ago , we would not have been able to sell them .

There used to be a craftswoman in Chiayi who specialized in making these fans . When she died about 20 years ago the craft was lost , but demand for the fans has grown along with the numbers of the troupes performing . Hence , Chen studied how to make them , and after 20 years of intense research has become the undisputed leading maker of these fans .  
Hsu tells an anecdote : more than ten years ago , local inventor Huang Ying-chun devised an air-cushioned shoe .

" Besides the climatic and geographic advantages , this area has a unique background in terms of human history , " states Chen Chung . If hundreds of years ago Chinese had not flooded into Taiwan and occupied all the lowlying land , the Aboriginal peoples would never have been forced to move to high altitudes . When the Nationalist government retreated to Taiwan in 1949 , overnight the island was flooded with two million refugees and soldiers , creating an immediate shortage of arable land , and spawning an urgent need for development in the mountains .  
Over a decade ago , a program was developed here that balances conservation and agricultural use through a " shelterbelt / base / facilities " approach .

P �� ez-Otermin ( Uruguay ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : In this changed world that came out of the Second World War more global and interdependent Uruguay wishes to reaffirm its confidence in the vital role played by the United Nations in the preservation of peace and in solving the main problems affecting the world , and it wishes to confirm the validity of the enlightened principles of the Charter , as sound today as they were 50 years ago .  
Most States represented in this Hall were not present at the historic signing of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco 50 years ago , but on gaining independence they applied for membership in this Organization as an essential part of their quest for a secure and stable international environment and improved standards of living .  
Just a few years ago , at the Rio Conference , we , the Member countries of the United Nations , established as a primary concern the need to ensure a rational balance between realizing legitimate national goals and safeguarding the well-being of future generations through the protection of the world 's natural resources .  
The creation of the United Nations 50 years ago awakened tremendous hopes for mankind , which had , in the space of a single generation , suffered from two particularly savage wars with consequences that sorely affected the entire world and for which all peoples paid a heavy toll . 
If we , the United Nations united not , as 50 years ago , against someone , but driven by the desire for peaceful cooperation show sufficient determination to give effect to our own proposals at this Meeting and at major conferences such as those held under United Nations auspices in recent years , the world stands a chance of ensuring a better and safer life in the twenty-first century .  
Indeed , the widespread desire to bring uniformity to international society in political and institutional terms , on the one hand , and economic and social terms , on the other , has led to an imbalance every bit as dramatic as the imbalance not so long ago when the world was bipolar .  
This fiftieth anniversary might also have been a time to rejoice that the countries that 50 years ago were poor and dominated , especially those on the African continent , now find themselves today among the prosperous nations of our planet , a natural position , given their boundless natural resources .  
Fifty years ago , in the aftermath of the Second World War , the international community , determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war , resolved at San Francisco to create an Organization that would establish the political , economic and social conditions for a new and lasting peace .  
In the light of the universal concern of a few years ago over the extensive degradation of the environment and the enthusiasm aroused by the Rio Conference , our countries must take the necessary measures to attain the objectives set forth in those various international legal instruments .  
The country that has arrogated to itself supreme leadership in this area as a manifest destiny has , as it did two centuries ago , been conspiring to abort any regional or international association of peoples that does not fit in with its narrow national interests .  
One can not forget that the historic changes of a few years ago those changes which finally , once and for all , sealed the fate of totalitarianism actually took place along a line of confrontation which kept Europe and the entire world divided into two opposing ideological and military camps for several decades . 
Is it not also an injustice that the veto power should continue to be valid even when it is used to consecrate acts of aggression , as happened 10 years ago , when it was used by a country that enjoys the privilege in trying to avoid condemnation for a treacherous military , air and naval attack against my country in the course of which hundreds of innocent people were killed and injured ? 
In my initial reaction to the letter , I expressed my profound regret at the decision by the Croatian Government , as I strongly believe that the United Nations played a decisive role in bringing to a halt the brutal war on Croatian soil three years ago , and that UNPROFOR has since helped prevent a resumption of renewed fighting .  
What is worse , the international community will continue to send a negative signal vis - - vis the United Nations , that of a lack of genuine commitment to the ideals and principles that inspired its creation half a century ago .  
The above letters contain tendentious and untrue charges concerning the alleged involvement of the Army of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in incidents in the territory of eastern Slavonia contrary to the reports of the Secretary-General of the United Nations that confirmed a long time ago that the former Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) has left the United Nations Protected Areas ( UNPAs ) of the Republic of Serbian Krajina .  
If the United States had accepted the fair and aboveboard proposals of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea , the resolution would have been implemented long ago , the danger of war removed from the Korean peninsula and a lasting peace settled in the region .  
In drafting the resolution that the Council adopted a few moments ago , it proved particularly difficult to find words adequately to express the real indignation over the lamentable fact that troops of the peace-keeping forces with which the international community is trying generously to help the parties to resolve their conflicts a generosity not adequately reciprocated lost their lives as a result of deliberate action by members of one of these parties .  
The international community should give further thought to the background and habitual course of the conflicts in Africa and support African efforts to secure rapid , effective agreements guaranteeing the right to self-determination , fundamental freedoms , democracy and development for all these peoples who , despite the attainment of independence some years ago , are unable to find peace with justice and development , mainly because of violence , foreign interests and armed conflicts .  
Now , when we commemorate the historic injustice of 55 years ago , let our thoughts not be overwhelmed by the memory of the nefarious characters , Hitler , Mussolini and Stalin , who together assumed grave responsibilities for some of the most horrifying acts of territorial rape in the modern history of Europe , but rather remember the great politicians , Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer , the makers of the historic Franco-German reconciliation !  
According to the calculations made by advocates of this policy , it would cause such a serious deterioration in the standards of living of the population that spontaneous public demonstrations of popular discontent would occur , bringing to an end the social revolutionary process begun 36 years ago , and thereby fulfilling the main objective of the foreign policy towards Cuba of the last nine United States administrations .  
The war in southern Sudan , which began four decades ago and which , with the exception of the relative calm between 1972 and 1983 , has continued unabated , has claimed the lives of well over 1-million persons and has hindered , if not completely thwarted , efforts to move the country along a path of meaningful and lasting progress .  
The subject was put before the leadership for a second time two years ago by the President of the Republic , but the country 's difficult circumstances , particularly the anomalous situation in northern Iraq , which was subjected to quasi-occupation by the Coalition forces , caused the leadership to delay the matter until the sanctions were lifted and the situation in the north was restored to normal .

The international community , determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war , endeavoured at the San Francisco Conference , 50 years ago , to create an international Organization that would be able to prevent such calamities in the future by establishing the political , economic and social conditions for a new , more peaceful and safer world .  
Initially , i.e . , before the establishment of ICSC 20 years ago , these relationship agreements tying the specialized agencies to the United Nations through adherence to " a single unified international civil service " ( later termed " United Nations common system " ) were intended to be between equals .

To those who long ago declared invalid any legal measure of a foreign country against their businessmen and nationals , we here send a message of hope : Cuba , the island of the bold , is not going to turn away from the road it has taken ; it will not violate the hopes and trust of its friends or partners , in spite of threats and multilateral or bilateral measures that someone might try to impose upon it . 
However , if and when the financial target of the 20 / 20 initiative is attained , and even if more donors reach or surpass the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance , as the Netherlands did long ago , it will only have the hoped-for effect if there is a sufficiently competent and honest government machinery to administer these important funds .  
But if this argument is not considered sufficient to prove that the world remains as unjust , unequal and dangerous as it was some years ago , it suffices to look at the conflicts which , with their profound causes that no one can resolve and their tragic consequences that can not be prevented or avoided , fill the newspapers every day .  
Turkey and the pseudo-state , taking advantage of a peaceful demonstration by Greek Cypriots , proceeded a few weeks ago , with the active involvement of the extremist terrorist Turkish group the Grey Wolves , to implement a meticulously prepared plan which was crowned by the murder in cold blood of two young Cypriots and the injuries sustained by many others , United Nations peacekeepers included .  
Despite the magnitude of the obstacles that have to be overcome in order to ensure that human beings are educated for peace , Mexico maintains a profound faith in the United Nations , whose structures must be strengthened if we truly wish to give it the necessary capacity to discharge the complex and lofty tasks entrusted to it half a century ago , as well as those additional tasks it is charged with almost daily . 
All these falsities , many of them recorded in United Nations documents , hide the bankruptcy of development prospects for most of the poor countries , which is already threatening world stability and aggravating the ecological deterioration we all recognized several years ago at the historic Rio Conference .  
If we were to agree that the chain connecting home , primary school , secondary school , university , and life broke down some time ago , and that it is missing its first link , without which all else is pointless and without foundation , we would invest at the very roots of human life the economic and scientific resources needed to form human beings from the start , enabling them to grow , endowed with the values that would make them citizens .  
Guaranteeing peace and collective security ; developing friendly relations among nations based on shared values ; promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ; and developing varied forms of cooperation in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields these were the dreams of those who , 50 years ago , created the United Nations . 
The United Nations was established 51 years ago with a focus on the maintenance of peace and security , and while that remains the objective , the linkage between peace and economic and social development , enshrined in the Charter , must be recognized and strengthened if the world is to escape the inexorable consequences of the continuously widening gap between rich and poor nations .  
We are living in a world in which events are occurring that would have been unimaginable just a short while ago , major political changes in international relations that prompt us to rethink international law .  
I should like for a moment to pay a tribute here to a generation of young people which the media has of late characterized as being lost the young people of Bosnia and other parts of the former Yugoslavia who , not so many years ago , were confident children of Europe and who have now spent their youth amidst fratricidal struggles and ethnic cleansing , with all the revulsion inherent in that expression , a youth spent between death and barbarism .  
In accordance with article 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which Andorra signed and ratified less than a year ago , thus contributing to the universal process of ratification so desired by the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) , it is vital that Governments ensure that tolerance and human rights are taught freely and comprehensively at school in order to rear new generations that are much more sensitive to the universality and relevance of these rights . 
Only a few weeks ago , the mid-term review of the implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s ( UN-NADAF ) allowed us to measure the remarkable progress achieved by African countries at the political , economic and social levels to create and strengthen the conditions necessary for sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the continent .  
Almost five years ago , on 1 December 1991 , in a national referendum , the people of Ukraine confirmed its sovereign will and determination to build its own independent State with a predictable domestic and foreign policy to integrate our nation into the European family of free democracies .  
South Africa 's recent experience since its first truly democratic elections just over two years ago has indicated that the benefits of a vibrant democracy at both the national and the local levels with the full participation of all political parties , movements and civil society has again proven the value of the necessity for all Member States to strive for and promote a political culture of full participation and consultation in the affairs of state .  
In its earnest desire to advance peace , and in its deep conviction that international support to facilitate the process of negotiations by the parties directly involved would be essential to expediting the peace process , Japan has participated actively in the multilateral talks on the Middle East since they were set in motion in Madrid five years ago .  
It should have been removed from the agenda long ago on account of its negative political motive and in view of the fact that its substance is devoid of any subject not included in other resolutions .  
In reporting the results of action taken pursuant to General Assembly resolution 50 / 223 , the Secretary-General is concerned principally to convey the fact that , as compared with the situation two years ago , it is now evident that the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peace-keeping troops has been met with a positive response by a number of insurers in the global market .  
It has since been determined that the list contained several apparent errors : it included an individual who had already been granted amnesty , a number of non-combatants , several elderly persons and at least one person who died some years ago .  
The tragic civil war in the Sudan , which began four decades ago and , with the exception of the period of relative calm between 1972 and 1983 , has continued unabated , remains a crisis of immense proportions , which has affected the lives of millions of Sudanese .  
Coupled with the ongoing process of difficult transition from a centrally planned to a market-oriented economy , the special economic problems resulting from the implementation of the sanctions regime more than four years ago now continue to exert their negative impact on the national economy and on the overall social and economic situation in the country .  
Just a few years ago , Nicaragua maintained a large army and devoted a large part of its national budget to meet high military expenditures , to the detriment of its economic and social development .  Just a few years ago , many of you , and even we ourselves , were looking with sceptism at the possibility of peace reigning in Nicaragua or of the country enjoying full liberty .  
The ideals that inspired the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are as relevant today as they were nearly half a century ago when the community of nations pledged to promote universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
On the question of an increase in permanent membership , many States have retained an open mind , asking legitimate questions regarding the criteria on which to base such a decision , now and in the future , for any course of action adopted will , in fact , establish a precedent .  Can the historical realities which influenced the Council 's composition 50 years ago be paralleled or matched in any way by present contingencies ?  
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 7 of the report that , as compared with the situation two years ago , the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peacekeeping troops has been met with a positive response by a number of insurers in the global market .

IMIS is progressively replacing the numerous independent systems , many of which , built many years ago and mostly for regular budget activities , are no longer able to provide the support needed by management at a time of rapidly changing needs and increasing demands made on the administrative sector to support extensive peacekeeping activities and those financed from extrabudgetary resources .

Indonesia 's experience illustrated the region 's rapid transition from an economy where , just over a quarter of a century ago , 60 per cent of its population had been classified as poor to one where an annual average growth of 7 per cent had been sustained over two decades , and where the incidence of absolute poverty now affected less than 14 per cent of the total population .  
Since Israel 's occupation of East Jerusalem , more than 28 years ago , the Israeli Government has tried to judaize the city by distorting its identity , changing its demographic character , deporting Palestinian inhabitants and reducing their numbers through the application of military , administrative and legal measures , moving settlers into the city and expanding Jerusalem 's borders to prejudice the final status of the city .  
However , the easy availability of weapons , the high incidence of armed criminal activity and the fact that the first police officers graduated only 18 months ago are clear indications that the HNP faces formidable challenges in its efforts to maintain a secure and stable environment .  
When we met during the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held only four months ago , we all expressed our deep concern that , compared to 1992 , the overall trend regarding sustainable development in developing countries is worse today .

As such tales of discovery go , the development of the wind surfer did not occur in some grandiose manner , but instead , in the ordinary confines of a suburban California garage , some 18 years ago . Two young friends , one an avid surfer , the other a disciple of sailing , were engaged in a friendly debate over the relative merits of their favorite pastimes .  
Six years ago , on a windy winter afternoon , three friends , Ch'en Ch'ing-hui , a diver , Yue Li-jen , a surfer , and Chan Chi-hung , an avid sailor , were strolling on a deserted beach decrying the unpleasant weather conditions which were too windy for surfing , and too wavy for sailing .

Shop banners like those snapping in the wind in the painting Ch'ing-ming shang-ho t'u ( Flocking to the River at the Ch'ing-ming Festival ) vanished long ago . The neatly lettered signboards with a simple name like " The Integrity General Store " that used to flank narrow village streets have become rustic antiques . Traditional wooden plaques are rarities , andeven the metal and plywood plaques that were once popular have withdrawn , weather-beaten , from the scene .  
The image of the lion is widely seen in art both East and West , but in East Asia , where the animal is not indigenous , the conclusion is obvious that its image must have come from West , possibly as long ago as the time of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia .

As few as we were , under the shadow of the political climate of the time , we fell into two clearly defined camps , the line crossed only by a handful .  
Chang Ta-chien was long ago renowned for assessing paintings and imitating them . Collectors used to rely on his expert eye to determine whether a painting they had bought was genuine or not , but they were afraid he might copy it or take a liking to it and want to buy it himself , so they had an unwritten agreement : they would only unroll a scroll halfway , let him take a quick look , and then roll it back up again !  
Five years ago , a major battle was fought in the media between the natural ecology and communications construction . The result was that the " egg " ( the environment ) defeated the " stone .

Ten years ago , to help children that have been unable to receive proper parental care because their families have suffered special problems or misfortunes , the R . O . C . Children 's Welfare Foundation studied examples overseas and introduced to Taiwan the foster care system , in which families volunteer to take in foster children on a temporary basis .

It is like the dependency theory that was fashionable some years ago . This held that the late developing countries needed to depend on the advanced countries , with the result that such countries had no way to advance because the developed countries would not let them do so . Wanting to exploit their resources and labor , the developed countries would only allow the late-developers to do the most basic work .

There are fewer and fewer kids coming along each year now : Two years ago the school still counted 37 heads , with 24 remaining last year , and only an even dozen this year . It 's hard to run a school without students : Leaving aside for a moment the question of economic efficiency , in terms of the quality of instruction , what impact does the small number of students have on learning ?  
Formerly a planner for an advertising agency , Huang noticed many years ago that colorful and attractive magazine advertisements and calendar photos would serve as good basic material for creating original illustrations .

Not long ago , Taipei County executive You Ching wanted to hire Lin Yu-yi , a professor from National Normal University ( the elite teaching university ) , as director of the county Bureau of Education . The provincial government rejected him on the grounds that his qualifications were not suitable , and assigned someone else . This led to a conflict over which appointee should take office , and for a time relations between the two sides were strained .  
When the government came to Taiwan over 40 years ago , power was in the hands of those labelled as being from " outside the province . " The main industrial and commercial businesses , and economic power , were also primarily " mainlander . " This meant that chairmen , directors and other important leadership posts were largely held by mainlanders , so as to establish good ties between business and the central government .  
Thirty years ago , Wu Sung-he 's father had injured his spine through heavy labor , and over the years his condition gradually grew worse , to the point where even the tissues around his spine were swollen with pus .

But with the fast opening of Taiwan 's markets and free competition , " the most efficient and modern international retailers are all setting up in Taiwan , bringing with them their international experience and vision , and seeking out low - price , high-quality products from all over the world to supply to local consumers . "  
The complete extinction 65 million years ago of the dinosaurs - - the subjects of unlimited imaginings of us latter-day creatures - - was a seemingly calamitous and tragic event which left no survivors . But in fact the average rate at which the dinosaurs died out was equivalent to one species every thousand years . Even if humans had been alive at the time , we could not easily have observed the course of their demise .  
Since the endemic Mikado pheasant was first recorded 80 years ago , no other new bird species has been discovered in Taiwan , and in recent years although mammals such as bats or shrews have been newly recorded here , the island 's forests have been logged up to elevations of 2500 meters , and today if mammals have remained undiscovered it is because of their hidden or inaccessible habitat or their nocturnal habit .  
Michael Chen of the Government Information Office was one of the key persons responsible for taking care of all the incoming foreign media . Based on prior experience ( 120 foreign reporters for the elections two years ago and 160 foreign reporters for the elections last year ) , Chen 's office estimated that about 250 personnel would arrive from abroad to cover the presidential race .  
The opium that undermined China more than a century ago arrived through transnational trade , and the same thing is true of modern narcotics . In advanced countries drug production is strictly controlled , and it is virtually impossible to cultivate poppies ( for opium or heroin ) , coca ( for cocaine ) , or cannabis on a huge scale . Given the high demand for narcotics in these societies , the result is that supplies are inadequate , naturally forcing prices up .  
Thirty years ago , an American director and cinematographer named Morton Heilig , inspired by 3-D films , had the " wild idea " of developing a " total illusion of reality " which would encompass sight , smell , motion , and sound . He declared that audiences would enjoy complete and realistic sensory stimulation .  
Whenever there was a construction site , a few bizarre pieces of stone , some large , some small , would appear on the surface of the ground . Some of them were still recognizable in shape ; it was obvious that they were knives , axes , arrowheads or other crafted objects that people had used at one time . Huge stone slabs made local residents suspect that they were the lids of coffins for some people of long ago .  
Based on his previous research work and on the finds at the ongoing test dig , Liu Yi-chang can offer a general description of the first Puli-ites - - " Tamalin Man " - - living 2400-1700 years ago . They were a late neolithic people who used flaked stone tools . From the large number of hitching stones and animal jawbones it can be inferred that they knew fishing and agriculture .  
Not far from the coast can be found a spirit temple , built at the site of some old graves . Unaware of the true origins of the dead , some Han Chinese sought to placate the ghosts they feared were left unattended and lonely . A few years ago , when the Liuhecai numbers game swept over all of Taiwan , the temple was particularly dense with the smoke of joss sticks .  
Two years ago , preparations were being made for Taiwan 's fourth nuclear power plant , to be built in Kungliao Rural Township . When they began digging , they uncovered objects suspected of being ancient relics of the Ketagalan . Pan Huo-yen blocked the excavating machines with his own body , and the photograph of this act became a symbol of the conflict between culture and economic development .  
After the plan for the offshore shipping center was brought before the public , the PRC government , which up until then had been constantly calling for direct cross-strait shipping to be established , based on the definition of a " domestic shipping line , " reversed its attitude 180 degrees . Since the regulation was passed over one year ago , not even one commercial ship has succeeded in crossing the strait .  
Although many people remain skeptical about duplicating the characters of the ancient masters , thirtysomething artist Tu Chung-kao expresses the opinion that throughout history the number of literate people was exceedingly large , and to be able to make a lasting impression for all time is no mean feat . The great masters that are held up for imitation today discovered long ago the best way to achieve the most beautiful composition and shape for each character . Copying them is essential .  
In making a new opera , characterization is very important , and the set character types of traditional opera are often insufficient . There 's nothing new about transcending these limitations by merging and melding traditional character types . Years ago Mei Lanfang combined traits of the qingyi ( leading female ) and huadan ( vivacious female ) roles to create a new type of role , the huashan , that combines features of both .  
For instance , I used to get into earnest discussions with everyone about artistic methods and schools and about what was unique to Chinese art . But after I read the Western masters I discovered that they had thought about many of these issues hundreds or even thousands of years ago , and I found that those things which I deemed so special about Chinese art also exist in Western culture . And so in looking back , those past discussions seem pretty laughable .  
Frictional unemployment usually is voluntary . Just a few years ago , when the economy was bubbling and industries like commercial services , finance and insurance , information technology , construction , and national infrastructure were growing rapidly , they could absorb all the " floating " manpower , and frictional unemployment was not a serious problem .  
But in the view of the institute 's director Chen San-ching , since Liu Shao-tang began the magazine thirty-odd years ago , although his work can not be said to follow the traditional methods of academic research , his contribution to Chinese contemporary history has been incomparable , for he has rescued countless quantities of first-hand material including manuscripts , photographs , documents and personal memoirs , and has inspired many people who then participated actively in research and writing .  
New Zealand is large and sparsely populated , and seems much like a paradise . I remember when I went to Auckland ten years ago , life was relaxed and orderly , prices were low , and there were lovely boutiques all over the city . Outside the cities was an endless expanse of meadows and trees . I felt only that God had made a beautiful place at the tip of the world , and that New Zealanders were very lucky .  
A few years ago there was an incident which shook society . A Buddhist medical worker who could not bear to witness the suffering of the severely ill in their last stages and the hardships imposed on families for the long-term care of " human vegetables , " " played God " and let some of them die . He was discovered and prosecuted .  
Given the resounding success of percussion today , it is hard to imagine that ten years ago this field of music was entirely neglected in Taiwan . At that time people generally though of percussion music as cacophonous , incapable of being melodic , and not the kind of thing to be put on in elegant halls .  
But if such views are optimistic , they do also seem to echo a voice that departed from the Chinese scene not all that long ago and which most people would not be happy to hear again . The idea that mainland China can achieve economic miracles if the population just gives up its lunch-time nap , the notion that if you multiply everything by 1.2 billion then you can beat the world , unavoidably harks back to earlier calls to " overtake Britain and catch up with America . "  
North-South cooperation But what of mainland China , the real homeland of the mihoutao ? Having woken up to the fact that what had been considered a very ordinary wild fruit actually has an export earnings potential far beyond what anyone could have imagined years ago , in recent years the mainland has started making strenuous efforts to make up lost ground by setting up research establishments and commencing commercial cultivation .  
As the silt rises higher behind the Shih-men Dam and its water storage capacity diminishes , it becomes ever more prone to drying up , flooding and turbidity . In the drought two years ago , an Earth God temple which had been drowned back when the reservoir was first filled with water came up for air , and the lake 's familiar expanse of water became a shortcut for gravel trucks which raced upstream across the hard , cracked mud of its dry bed .  
Several years ago it reached Fuhsing Rural Township to the north . Along the Northern Cross-Island Highway , the air turns cold early in the year , and this brings forward the harvest season of New Century pears , California plums , California honey plums , honey peaches and even kiwi-fruit . Thanks to the abundant sunshine , the quality of the fruit far surpasses that of other areas , and with Taiwan 's largest consumer market , Greater Taipei , close at hand , sales from the area have gradually taken off and overtaken Lishan .  
As for the railway museum , five years ago the TRA set up a museum planning team to find suitable locations , " but all of the NT $ 5 million which we had budgeted was cut by the provincial assembly . They thought it was more appropriate for museums to be planned by cultural and educational departments , " says Chen Te-pei , spreading his hands in a gesture of frustration .  
The ERSO , which single-handedly created the ROC 's semiconductor industry 16 years ago , has been the ROC 's biggest source of qualified staff in the field , and it successfully set up three of the industry 's companies : UMC , TSMC and Vanguard . But most private-sector companies do not have such a solid research team , and if they wish to join the fray , they have no choice but to directly form joint ventures with foreign companies , or buy technology from abroad .  
Because problems are not readily apparent at the time gifted and talented students are selected , the National Science Council 's Science Education Office unveiled another plan three years ago for an in-depth investigation of the qualities needed by today 's gifted and talented science students . The aim was to discuss and develop suitable methods of intelligence testing to meet modern needs .  
The White Paper on Youth released by the Executive Yuan 's National Youth Commission two years ago gave the results of a survey , showing that of parental attitudes toward their children , exploitation or abuse , too-severe discipline , contradictory parent-ing , differences in opinion between the two parents , breakdown of the family unit , worsening of the atmosphere in the family , low social status of parents , and incorrect values and attitudes toward society were the major factors leading to juvenile crime .  
Two years ago on Women 's Day , several hundred wives , mothers and grandmothers left their homes and their kitchens to take to the streets . They carried with them a revised copy of the Family Law provisions of the civil code which they delivered to the Legislative Yuan . They were rejecting having their praises sung yet again as " all-sacrificing model women , " and instead were representing the rights and interests of " three million injured Taiwanese women crying in the dark . "  
" For example , I discovered the Focolare Movement , founded fifty years ago by an Italian woman , Chiara Lubich . Besides spreading Catholic doctrine and beliefs , she also emphasized experimental lifestyles . She organized associations or cooperative societies in which people lived a simple life in close communion with nature . Today they still have communities and farms in West Africa and in Latin America . "  
Ho Chien-min , a thirty-year-old in direct sales who grew up in a Catholic family , says that he felt less and less able to identify with Catholicism as he grew older . He had n't been to church in more than 10 years , until a few years ago , when he heard the album of Catholic Gregorian chants , and was deeply moved . " It transcends the busy mundane world , raising the listener to a higher plane and drawing people to search for their spiritual source . "  
Five years ago , because he had to look after his children , he could not go too far from home , so he decided to embark on extended observation of a small , nameless earthen mountain next to the Wanfang residential development . He christened it " Little Green Mountain , " and produced a series of notes and articles describing the natural scenery and plant and animal life through the four seasons on the southern rim of the Taipei basin .  
Western classical music is the furthest removed from life ; such a huge orchestra can not possibly be heard in ordinary life . But nobody ever asks questions about " the modern life of Western classical music . " The equipment of Western wind and string instrumental music is a form belonging to more than a century ago , but nobody ever wonders why orchestras do n't modernize .  
Three years ago , Wu San-ho , an associate professor at National Taiwan University 's Department of Agriculture , heard of Chuang Yu-long 's ability to grow gorgeous , healthy crops on red clay without the use of chemical fertilizers . He led a group of students who spent several days at the farm doing on-site experiments .  
The combined effects of ROC foreign policy and cross-strait relations make this stage of ROC foreign relations extremely unusual . How does Chang , an old foreign-affairs hand , who studied international politics and entered the diplomatic corps nearly 30 years ago , and who bears the high expectations of the people , plan to steer the ROC diplomatic ship through these troubled times ?  
As one author puts it with complete confidence in a book published only a few years ago , when the gates of China were forced open in the nineteenth century , " the dreadful truth leaked out : the scale of the gardens of the mandarins compared to their equivalents in England rather as the bonsai does to the beech . " With such a world of difference between the Chinese and the English garden , the two should not be spoken of in the same breath . Mountain buildings , myriad torrents  
He notes that modern national dress must have five key characteristics : it must be comfortable , artistic , modern , suited to the locality , and universal . He calls his ideal national dress shuya , which means " comfortable and elegant . " Taking the lead himself , two years ago he put aside his Western suits and asked a tailor to make a shuya outfit that Yu himself had designed . He wears it to work and to give lectures .  
Chen Hung-wei , a journalism student at Chengchi University , began to play the Japanese version of " The Three Kingdoms , " a game incorporating Chinese history and military strategy , two years ago . Not knowing Japanese did n't stop him from enjoying the game ; he spent the entire summer vacation after his freshman year attacking cities , invading countries and opening up the borderlands , often playing all night long .  
Remembering the day five years ago when Wei-wei was diagnosed as a hyperactive child by a doctor at National Taiwan University Hospital , Ho says , " I sat in the car and the tears just would n't stop falling , regretting the past , worrying about the future . . . . I was pained by the number of times our boy had been hit even though he was innocent . It hurt me that I had made so many wrong choices and that our son had been wrongly accused so many times .  
Yang Wen-I notes that the Biennale has always been an open-application exhibition . For instance , four years ago the motion artist Li Ming-shen applied as an individual . But this time the curators filed the application , and after careful consideration of the Biennale selection committee , it was accepted . Multiplication / Fragmentation is formally listed as part of the Biennale de Venezia 97 and is included in the show 's official catalog .  
Twenty years ago , people watched Taiwan 's Little League teams fighting for glory abroad on late night TV . A few days ago , people stayed up all night watching a live marathon program , directed by and starring a major criminal . Then came the elections for county and city executives . After the excitement generated by political " stars , " the victory of the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) has rewritten the political map of Taiwan .  
" I hope in the future we can trek once per year , passing through traditional lands and places of historical importance , to understand how the West Rukai spread . We will also survey the natural resources . " Sasala says that elders told him many things he did not know-about things that happened long ago , and that place names were often derived from commonly used plants . Creating a foundation of shared knowledge among the generations marks the beginning of transmission of the tribal culture .  
By the close of business every day , the counter on which the organically grown fruits and vegetables are displayed is usually bare . Chen Chun-chun , CEO of Organic World , which he founded three years ago , says that Taiwan 's organic foods market is growing quickly ; annual growth is 20-30% .  
About 400 years ago people began coming over to Taiwan from Fujian and Guangdong in search of land to farm . Faced with the perilous sea voyage and the hazardous life of pioneers , they naturally had a strong need for some authoritative guidance in determining the best ( and worst ) times to act .  
Not long ago , pop star Chang Yu-sheng was involved in a serious car accident . When he reached the hospital , he was pronounced dead on arrival . Had there been a trained professional there when he had his accident , he might have been saved .  
Some years ago , Mai Jan-mei was director of guidance at another Taipei middle school , located in one of the city 's most infamous criminal areas . At that time some pupils formed a gang and began causing trouble . They padded their left shoulders up high and went around the school terrorizing the other children ; even teachers did n't dare mess with them .  
Southeast Asia and the mainland entice firms with their low production costs and their market potential . In addition , about 70% of the economic strength of the region is concentrated in the hands of Chinese business people who , in turn , are closely tied to Taiwanese business people . This drew many Taiwanese to the region more than 10 years ago , making them some of Southeast Asia 's earliest foreign investors .  
" Not only do we need to make the environment more suitable , we also need to change our habits and thinking about leisure , " says Lin Wan-yi . Lin says that with regard to Taiwan 's leisure-time habits , you have to remember that the whole society only went from being an agricultural one to an industrial one 20 or 30 years ago . " The traditional Chinese agrarian society did n't operate on a system of weeks . People 's holidays were folk festivals and their way of celebrating them was active and noisy . "  
Some four years ago , when the architects responsible for renovating the Li Family Compound had the Lotus Flower Pool changed from its original irregular oval shape into the usual traditional half-moon shape , 77-year-old Li Yen Hsiu-feng , chairperson of the Li Family Compound management committee , insisted it be torn up and redone .  
He met the subject of the piece , Li Jung-lin , nine years previously when Li handled the funeral of his mother . But it was only two years ago , when Lin 's mother 's grave was robbed , and Li , wearing a gas mask , personally went into the grave to repair the damage to the coffin , that Lin really came to understand this man . He discovered that Li has quite remarkable views on death , human dignity , and on the poor self-regulation of the funeral industry .  
Two years ago , the special education center at National Taiwan Normal University conducted a survey of Taiwanese firms which made the above bias all too clear . The results indicated that bosses were most willing to hire handicapped persons whose disability involved their arms or legs . The next most " popular " were the hearing impaired , followed by the mentally retarded . Visually-impaired persons did not make a single boss ' list .  
It emerged that the Rey Lee Resort Hotel , which suffered severe structural damage in the quake , is actually an illegal structure , and its business license was revoked long ago . However , the owner had continued operating the hotel , leading to many guests being injured by earth and rock falls set off by the quake .  
Forty or fifty years ago , acute bacterial and viral diseases were the major cause of death in Taiwan . Today , they have been replaced by cancer and cerebrovascular disease . However , the threat from infectious diseases has not disappeared .  
When she came to Taipei three years ago , she did not choose a foreign firm , in which internal communication is normally done in English . Rather , she entered a local urban planning firm , in which only Chinese was spoken , and learned her Chinese the hard way .  
Twenty years ago Shiatzy presented an improved chi pao . Influenced by the film The Last Emperor , ten years ago they created an awe-inspiring imperial effect using Qing style beadwork and embroidery , silks , satins and velvets , in brown , gold and purple colors . This year Shiatzy are using cotton and linen with hand-drawn designs to create a Zen-like poetic quality .  
A few years ago , male writer Ku Ling , speaking at a public forum , advised married Taiwanese men to beware of " public menaces . " He was referring to well-educated , independent , and ambitious women who were unwilling to settle down .  
Market numbers tell the story . The privately-operated CGMH , which is the largest health-care organization in Taiwan , opened its first TCM department , fully staffed by doctors with dual backgrounds in both TCM and Western medicine , at its Linkou medical center two years ago . The number of patients seen by its out-patient clinic has grown explosively to its current level of around 25,000 per month , an average of approximately 1,000 per day .  
Edwin Yen was a pioneer who was studying and promoting sex education for schoolchildren as long as 20 years ago ; he is now director of the Health Education Department at NTNU and executive director of the Mercy Memorial Foundation . He points out that in the past the education system was conservative . Sex was considered to be dirty and vulgar , not worthy of the halls of knowledge . Children were left to find out for themselves as best they could .  
Chunghsing Village was modeled after English communities . Over 40 years ago , it was unique in Taiwan for its waste water treatment and rain water drainage systems , its specially planted camphor trees , bodhi trees , and assorted grasses and plants , giving the entire village plentiful greenery and shade .  
" Clinical practice has demonstrated that appropriate levels of hormone supplements , antioxidants and immune-system-boosting vitamins keep the body functioning optimally and naturally provide a youthful glow . It 's like regaining one 's youth , " says Dr . Wang , a former director of the surgical ward of Chang Gung Children 's Hospital . He states that in Europe geriatric medicine focused on controlling aging long ago developed into a full-fledged specialization providing full medical services , and that this field is now being introduced into Taiwan .  
Paiwan pottery can be divided into male and female . Male pots have designs of the hundred-pace snake while female pots are decorated with nipples . Because the Paiwan tribe long ago lost techniques for making pots , contemporary artists such as Pavavalung must attempt to imitate ancient pots .  
Three years ago , Luotung High School principal Hsu Wen-shong received a letter from the Paper Windmill Theater Troupe , saying that the Council for Cultural Affairs had commissioned them to implement a " Youth Theatre Project . " They were accepting invitations from schools for professional theatrical personnel to guide school theater programs , and the troupe was planning to put on instructional performances in schools . The project would also include other events such as talks by famous actors like Hugh Lee and Liang Tzu-yun , and camps designed to help teachers practice writing and directing .  
How the department came into being is a story in itself . Several years ago , a reporter was sent to interview a recently arrested suspect . The suspect wept bitter tears which the reporter assumed stemmed from his impending incarceration . But the suspect surprised the reporter , stating that he was not crying for himself , but was worried about how his elderly parents , his wife and his children would survive with him in jail .  
Shih himself has applied the right-brain concept to the commercial sphere . In the ideas about " business culture " that Shih put forward a number of years ago , he suggested that people are changed by emotional stimuli , not rational argument . This is very much in keeping with the right-brain concept . And in his " right-brain leadership " concept , put forward two years ago , Shih takes his approach a step further , proposing EQ-based , creative management .  
A year ago , when SET established its news department with a focus on what is termed " community news " ( meaning crime , sex and other sensational topics ) , it originally expected to lose about NT $ 5 million a month . Now , a year later , they have discovered that they have actually been making money , and they have decided to turn into an all-news station , adding staff in anticipation of the media wars that are sure to erupt during the presidential election campaigns .  
Twenty-eight-year-old Li Ching-yu went to senior high school and university in Canada , and graduated in economics . After he took over his father 's business four years ago , he introduced modern management methods . He not only redecorated and enlarged the premises , set up a limited company and instituted a profit sharing and stock ownership scheme for employees , but recently also embarked on an expansion plan calling for opening new branches , like a home-grown McDonald 's .  
At the National Palace Museum , the door-way to the Sanxingdui exhibit is designed to look like a time tunnel . Pass through it , and you are transported to a world that vanished millennia ago . The first thing that greets your eyes is a bronze statue over two meters tall , towering regal and majestic over the milling commoners .  
The bizarre-looking relics in this room might just as well be aliens from outer space , so odd is their appearance . Where they come from , however , is Sanxingdui , where they lay buried for over 3,000 years ago in a land regarded by the people of the Yellow River region as a wilderness inhabited by uncivilized barbarians . This is another in a string of recent archeological discoveries which prove that the Yellow River culture was not the only source of Chinese civilization .  
Little did they know that just beneath their feet lay the buried remains of an ancient culture dating back to a period ranging from 2,800 to 4,800 years ago . After several decades of research , however , archeologists have brought to light spectacular proof of an ancient " Sanxingdui culture . " Relics have been unearthed at dozens of locations around the huge Sanxingdui site , which covers a total area of more than 15 square kilometers .  
There is no parallel in human history for the bronze-making culture that flourished in China over 3,000 years ago . Particularly noteworthy are the bronzes that have been unearthed at Anyang in the Yellow River basin . The style and manufacturing techniques of Shang bronzes spread far and wide-to modern-day Shan-dong in the east , Shanxi and Shaanxi in the west , Liaoning in the north , and Guangdong in the south .  
Now that the Sanxingdui exhibit has brought over a huge bronze statue of a man and many other exotic items , another blockbuster exhibit from the mainland has been scheduled for October . The autumn event will feature the superbly preserved silk paintings found at the Mawangdui site in Hunan Province as well as the stunning jade pieces discovered in Guangzhou at the royal tomb of the Nanyue kingdom . Going in the other direction , a private Taiwanese collection ( Ku Yue Ko ) was put on exhibit four years ago at the Palace Museum in Beijing .  
With prompt action , it appears that hoof-and-mouth disease is under control . However , the Water Quality Protection Bureau of the Environmental Protection Administration warns that 24 wells were contaminated by the hasty burial of hogs which were slaughtered en masse to try to halt the spread of hoof-and-mouth disease among hogs two years ago . The EPA has warned the agencies in charge to be careful in disposing of the infected cattle which have been recently destroyed .  
A half-century ago , our image of the Han period still rested entirely upon what we could learn from historical records , but all that changed beginning in 1972 thanks to a series of major archeological finds at a number of tombs dating back to the Han dynasty . A huge quantity of silks , wooden tomb figurines , bamboo slips used for writing , and other burial items cast an entirely new light upon the way Chinese people lived two millennia ago .  
An elderly gent named Chang , who left Taiwan 20 years ago and returned a couple of years ago , is amazed when he sees cartoons lampooning national leaders or when radio commentators say national figures ' " brains are on the fritz . " Is this is the same country that he left all those years ago because of its suffocating and oppressive atmosphere ?  
The narrowing of international space in turn sparked the rise of " nativist ideology " in Taiwan-nascent Taiwanese nationalism . Now that Taiwan is free , democratic , and prosperous , the old policy of refusing to coexist in the international community with mainland China has been abandoned , and the government hopes to create a " win-win " situation . But mainland China still has the mindset from the civil war half a century ago .  
The Lin family 's " New Tile House " was built almost two centuries ago , and is the oldest family compound in the Liuchia high-speed rail development area . The high-speed rail plan originally called for the ancestral shrine and some of the defensive walls to be preserved as a park , but local residents and the Lin family are not satisfied with this solution and have been protesting to the agency in charge of the high-speed rail in the hope of persuading it to preserve the entire compound .  
People are forgetful , and as the nightmare of 21 September fades from memory , getting citizens to remain prudent and vigilant will be easier said than done . A recent survey in Japan , which had been on " full alert " after the Kobe earthquake , revealed that 34% of the public had made no special preparations whatsoever for a major earthquake-a full ten percentage points more than in a survey two years ago .  
In recent times , due to the limited productive value of its mainly agricultural economy , the township had become rather run-down and had been losing population to other areas . Nonetheless , it still had many distinctive historic features such as Chichi Railway Station and Minghsin Academy , along with traditional rural scenes such as tobacco fields , banana groves , fruit orchards and tree-lined roads . These assets had long ago given Lin the idea of using them as tourist resources to breathe new life into Chichi .  
If you only knew about these two , you would think that the women of the Han court either spent their days relying on their beauty as weapons in internecine power struggles , or ended up getting married off to the ruler of a distant land to cement some strategic alliance . A code of proper female conduct was explicitly prescribed for the first time by two books that were written about 2,000 years ago .  
She takes for example feminist issues , about which she is particularly concerned . Twenty years ago , she wrote a TV serial that overturned the tradition that the female lead had to be chaste , unmarried , and dependent on men ; instead her female lead was a middle-aged divorcee with children and a relationship with a younger man . Society was shocked from top to bottom .  
Huang Ming-chuan , who studied law before he began making movies , has come to be seen as the standard-bearer for independent films in Taiwan . Flat Tire , which he completed two years ago , tells the story of a pair of documentary makers traveling around Taiwan to film the island 's religious and political statuary . ( photo by Pu Hua-chih )  
In ancient times Dongguan was covered with lichee plantations whose fruit was favored by the imperial consort Yang Guifei . Just a little more than a decade ago Dongguan was still a largely agricultural area , its landscape a patchwork of rice paddies and corn fields . It has since been completely made over into a " boundless industrial park " with an area of 2,520 square kilometers , a population of more than 5 million , and more than 3,000 Taiwan firms .  
In autobiographical notes which Liu wrote a few years ago for the benefit of his many local and overseas visitors , he outlined his career prior to founding Biographical Literature : " Liu Shao-tang ( original name Liu Tsung-hsiang ) ; ancestral home Lutai , Hebei Province ; born in Jin County , Liaoning Province , on the 14th day of the ninth lunar month , 1921 .  
In response to Lin 's accusations , Chiou I-jen , director of Chen 's national election campaign headquarters , said that Lin was engaged in slander pure and simple . In fact , explained Chiou , the entire matter was very easily explained . Chen Chin-tsai and Chen Tien-fu used Chen Shui-bian 's name without authorization to defraud Tan Kok Ping . This crime came to light long ago , and Chen Chin-tsai admitted under questioning that he had forged Chen Shui-bian 's signature .  
Whether you are making a film or making glass , the creative process can easily make you tense and worried , and this is likely to be reflected in the way you get along with others . So other people often used to find me irritable or restless . It was not until a few years ago , when I produced a series of modern Buddha figures in glass , that I gained an entirely new insight .  
Paintings on silk tend to degenerate fairly quickly , generally lasting a century or two , with the oldest surviving examples ( safely buried underground ) dating back no further than two thousand years to the Han dynasty . But ceramic works can keep their color for millennia , and today we can still appreciate works of colored pottery and black pottery from as far back as six and seven thousand years ago . " Painting enhances the value of ceramics , and ceramics enables painting to last through time . "  
1,000 years ago , under the rule of scholars who valued culture over military prowess , Song-dynasty China saw rapid economic development and brought forth remarkable cultural and artistic achievements .  
According to the first-century Roman historian Pliny the technique was discovered around five thousand years ago by Phoenician traders on the Mediterranean coast . A crew of traders camping on the beach rested their cooking pots on bricks of natron , a sodium-carbonate-based mineral that they were transporting , and noticed that vitreous strips were formed when the heated mineral fused together with sand .  
3,500 years ago people in Egypt and Mesopotamia had already mastered the core-forming method of glassmaking , in which molten glass was extracted from the crucible on the end of an iron bar that had first been wrapped in a mixture of clay and horse manure . Threads of colored glass were then wound around the surface and decorative wave patterns were added . Once the glass cooled the core was scooped out , leaving a flask for storing perfume or collecting teardrops .  
It all began eight years ago at a friend 's home , where Chen and his wife saw a statue of the Buddha dating back to the Northern Qi dynasty ( mid-6th century ) . Although neither of the two are Buddhists , they were captivated by the simple serenity of the statue . Concerned by the fact that war and chaos in China have left many of the country 's ancient Buddhist statues scattered across the globe , Chen decided to do his part to recover what he could from abroad .  
Huang Min-nan , who formerly headed pop music planning at Rock Records , says : " Buddhist music now changes several times a year . " Not so long ago Chinese-style symphonic music , or chanting accompanied by a single instrument was popular , but at the moment it 's all about " spiritual " music and dance tunes .  
A : Our company is a transnational group , so as long as a year and a half ago we started thinking about what kind of new corporate culture we should develop to be able to maintain our leading position in the 21st century . Eventually we established four key elements for our future success .  
Over 2,000 years ago the Han Dynasty envoy Zhang Qian ( d . 114 BC ) traveled into the western regions , writing a great page in the history of global cultural interchange . Many important agricultural crops such as grapes , alfalfa and walnuts are reputed to have entered China at that time . 21 centuries later , in our age of highly developed international transport and commerce , the farming , forestry and fisheries industries play the role of modern Zhang Qians , importing countless weird and wonderful fruits , vegetables , birds and beasts .  
A turning point was reached two years ago , however , as the global Internet infrastructure began to mature . Increasingly available broadband connections offered dramatic improvements in speed , and online games began proliferating . Ever since the wave broke over Taiwan , the number Internet cafes has been growing rapidly .  
Years ago , the Japanese built the Mienyueh branch of the Alishan Mountain Railway to gain access to the cypress forests for logging . As the engineers cut their way along mountainsides and hacked out tunnels , they exposed large areas of steep rock face shaded by dense jungle above , and thus unwittingly produced excellent conditions for pleiones to grow .  
A few days ago my old friend Hsieh Chun-teh let me have a look at his most recent book , an experimental collection of 50 digital images that he has spent the last five years working on . Comparing it with the works he has published using conventional photographic techniques , I feel that , in terms of both form and content , he has gone beyond his old self , and he has also showed how photographers of the future can make use of digital imaging technology .  
Wu admits that university students are not as knowledgeable as they used to be , but feels that the wider availability of a university education is not the only reason . He notes that five years ago , graduate school admissions committees would never have asked an applicant if he or she had been abroad . Now , however , many university students and even high-school students have traveled overseas . " This generation of students has had a more diverse array of experiences than the previous .  
For instance , 40 years ago , after Chinese-American scientists Yang Chen-ning and Lee Tsung-dao received a Nobel physics prize , there was a boom in the popularity of physics courses . For the last five or six years law departments have consistently topped the rankings in Category 1 , but although the demand for legally qualified personnel has grown thanks to Taiwan 's progress towards the rule of law , the number of universities with law departments has increased too , making competition between law graduates more intense than before .  
As admirable as the accomplishments of modern-day astronomers , are those of their ancient Chinese counterparts . Long ago , our ancestors understood how to read the astronomical clock , and elaborated on real and perceived connections between celestial and human events . In those days , virtually everyone had some understanding of the heavens . Astronomers observed , recorded , and pondered the significance of celestial phenomena , and knowledge of astronomy affected the actions of rulers .  
Twenty years ago theorists proposed that the magnetic field extended down below the sun 's surface to a depth of 0.7 solar radii from the center of the sun surface , but signals from the magnetic field are very weak , and could not be detected by the methods and instruments then available . But today acoustic imaging has enabled Chou Dean-yi to find much stronger evidence in support of the 20-year-old theory , and this is highly significant for solar astronomy .  
With that experience under his belt , he decided three years ago at the age of 57 that in addition to his full-time job at a trading company , he would get involved in the matchmaking business by helping his wife , the outgoing Chu Li-li , set up " Super Matchmaker-Mama Jan " next door to the Asia Pacific Hotel on Taipei 's east side . The Jan clan uses a traditional one-on-one style of matchmaker-moderated meetings to help eligible young singles find dating partners , hopefully leading to marriage .  
Ten years ago , Japanese rice and dairy farmers strapped on headbands and took to the streets , like Taiwanese farmers on May 20th 1989 , but imported rice and pork could not compete with the high quality and safety guarantees of organically produced agricultural products , no matter how cheap they were . Japanese consumers remained very loyal to local rice . Two years ago , Japan abandoned its hard won caps on rice imports , because they no longer feared competition .  
From the very start , Yung'an has served as an experimental school for the nine-year integrated curriculum . Taiwan 's textbook publishers are now hard at work compiling textbooks for the integrated curriculum , but they have only finished with the first grade so far . The teachers at Yung'an , however , started working long ago to create an integrated curriculum of their own . Using existing textbooks as reference , they have already developed several integrated textbooks for the second and third grades .  
When students used to come from southern Taiwan to Taipei to study 20 years ago , they were warned about Taipei 's gray and wet winters . Friends and relatives reminded them to carry a newspaper with them at all times to keep off the fine rain of the northeastern monsoon . Over the years , however , Taipei 's winters have changed , becoming drier and less overcast .  
This sinologist from afar believes that his destiny has always been connected to China . Indeed , Joppert , who has always shown an outstanding intellect ever since early youth and has a sharp sixth sense , believes that 900 years ago he was a senior minister in the court of Huizong . The latter two characters of his Chinese name , Li Jiade , are identical with the name of the Song emperor Huizong 's main palace : Jiade Palace . Is that a coincidence , or fate ?  
Over the last few years , Li Hsien-wen 's life has changed quite a lot . He not only eats vegetarian , but he has also moved to the countryside and abandoned burdensome clothing such as suit and tie . At the same time , he has influenced his wife , who began practicing calligraphy three years ago . When she is free she copies a bit of traditional poetry , and able to settle in at her house , she no longer feels lonely .  
Here at the other end of the Earth in Taiwan , the wise words written in the Bible 2000 years ago are borne out : on Linshan Point , a windswept promontory jutting out into the sea from Taiwan 's north coast , between the sandy beach and the rock face there grows a carpet of tough coastal plants , including a scattering of short-stemmed flowers .  
Because of Yu 's clear status as a " friendly critic " of the government , the ruling party always treated Yu with great respect . Yu long held a seat on the KMT 's Central Standing Committee . Many years ago while visiting family in mainland China , Yu was received as a VIP by Jiang Zemin . During their meeting , Yu forcefully expressed his position on the inappropriateness of the " one country , two systems " model , recommending instead a " China confederation " model .  
Because there are so many wonderful uses for sensors , the National Science Council listed them as a scientific and technological focal point more than 10 years ago , and the ITRI started to research and develop them . Unfortunately , at that time most investors were focused on the stock and real estate markets , and the hot electronics sector swept away all investment capital . This left no money whatsoever for unfashionable fields such as sensors .  
The Tatun volcanic episode ended 350,000 years ago , but in geologic terms the landscape is still young , and the geothermal activity persists . The area 's abundant rainfall trickles down into the underlying strata of quartz sandstone , an ideal aquifer which fills with hot groundwater .  
The blinding light reflecting off the textured surface is both mysterious and moving . Lava story Between eight and 17 million years ago , in the southern part of the Taiwan Strait , magma forced its way through fractures in the earth 's crust . The lava poured through to the surface , accumulating and covering the earth in large and small piles , creating the impressively beautiful Penghu archipelago .  
Eight million years ago , the east coast of Taiwan was at the very edge of where the Philippine Sea Plate was crashing into the Asian mainland . As compression along the edge of the Eurasian Plate increased , fracturing of the crust in the Taiwan Strait came to an end . Channels for magma to reach the surface were sealed , and volcanic activity was locked out . All that remains is the basalt that the sea has been continuing to erode for tens of millions of years .  
The Chinkuashih area has a unique , long , and complex history of geological activity . Tahan College associate professor Yu Ping-sheng , who has extensively studied the local geology , tells us that the sedimentary rock which forms the area accumulated on the ocean floor 25 million years ago .  
During the Ming dynasty an Inspection Office was set up here , and Kinmen became an important maritime defense settlement . After the commanding general , Zhou Dexing , said of the place , " It is as impregnable as a metal [ kin ] wall and a moat of boiling water , and it commands control of the ocean gate [ men ] , " it came to be called Kinmen . Thus Kinmen 's role as a key military strong point began several hundred years ago .  
In late January , Legislative Yuan member Apollo Chen held a press conference to plead the case for giving permanent residency rights to Doris Brougham and other foreigners who long ago put down roots in Taiwan . Both ruling and opposition parties agreed that the issue was worthy of prompt attention , and later President Chen Shui-bian and interior minister Yu Cheng-hsien also publicly expressed their support .  
In fact , in a survey carried out two years ago by the Environmental Quality Protection Foundation and National Tsing Hua University , almost 40% of fish sampled from food markets contained excessive levels of " persistent organic pollutants , " which are likely to act as environmental hormones . However , following angry protests from fishermen after the report was published , no action was taken .  
Although they had not " done " anything , she broke out in a cold sweat . Her concern reminded me of the time a few years ago when I discovered a 15-year-old student whom I was tutoring engaged in a raucous game of mahjongg with three classmates , each of them accompanied by a girlfriend !  
However , 30 to 40 years ago , watercourses and paddy fields in the plains of western Taiwan , and in the Lanyang Plain to the east were full of native paradise fish . The fish were close companions of agricultural life , and because of the striking black-green spots on their gill covers they were known by many names , such as three-spot , cover-spot fighting fish , Taiwan fighting fish and Taiwan goldfish , as well as paradise fish .  
With these two types of sustenance , one material and one spiritual , naturally one can live a long time , " says Lu . In fact , as long ago as the Song dynasty , Su Dongpo had identified three major advantages of eating zhou : " It brings peace of mind , which contributes to well-being , it is easy on the stomach , which contributes to physical energy , and it saves money , which contributes to becoming wealthy . "  
Some months ago you ran a feature on digital content , and recently you also reported the development of nanotechnology in Taiwan . From these articles we can see how sensitive the government is to the development of new technologies , and how-whether by their own initiative or with government guidance-many large , medium and small enterprises are getting involved in R &amp; D or production related to these emerging technologies .  
Amidst the concurrence of rising rice wine prices , initial licensing of private distilling operations , and bootleg poisonings , sales of standard rice wine-the former " red label , " now Daoxiang 40 proof ( i.e . 20% alcohol content ) - fell from 25 million dozen bottles two years ago to 400,000 last year .  
But a year ago when RollCoCo launched another set of cartoon characters called CoCoPlay , featuring four cheeky children wearing animal-head masks , they immediately drew adverse comments such as " Not funny ! " or " Kill them off , do n't make any more ! " so they naturally stopped developing the characters .  
Recently a friend studying in Germany returned to Taiwan , and said with obvious feeling that despite the flourishing of the Aboriginal movement in Taiwan over the past ten years , when he returned to the village where he had done field work seven or eight years ago , he discovered the same old thing : lonely old people , kids who quit school halfway through , and emptiness in the tribal community . " Have n't you noticed this gap ? " he asked .  
It occupies about six hectares , divided into three parts : an upper compound , a lower compound , and a garden . Because the buildings had authentic antique carving , painting , and craftsmanship , they were considered a classic example of early architectural arts in Taiwan , and long ago the Estate was designated as a Grade 2 national historic site by the Ministry of the Interior .  
Many years ago , Nanfang Shuo became interested in the origins of language . Taking vocabulary often seen in the reporting of news events as his starting point , he set about tracing the historical origins of certain words and phrases whilst also discussing the process by which their meaning in society has evolved . For example , researching the Chinese expression for " mafia " ( heidao , literally " black way " ) Nanfang Shuo conducted a textual search of references to black and the metaphorical implications of the color to Chinese people .  
Will Chen Shui-bian be able to repeat his performance of three years ago , when his chance of victory was thought to be slim , but he went into the campaign full of confidence and energy and ultimately won the presidency ? Given his past record of coming out on top against all odds , it will be worth waiting to see if Chen will once again defeat his political opponents and the wheel of Taiwanese democracy will make another successful turn .  
The Chinese first made lacquer ware some seven millennia ago . Archeologists have discovered that the Hemudu Culture produced red lacquer on a wood base , and numerous archeological digs over the past few decades at burial sites dating back two to three millennia have turned up perfectly preserved lacquer ware surrounded by badly rotted artifacts made of wood and other materials . Records of Artisanry mentions the kings Shun and Yu ( both of whom ruled roughly 3,200 years ago ) making lacquer ware items .  
Originally established 45 years ago as a tourism-development taskforce , these days the TAT operates 17 overseas offices and has an annual budget of THB3 to 3.5 billion . Thailand 's numbers of both domestic and foreign tourists have been growing steadily for years , and we expect the number of visitors to top the 10-million mark next year .  
It was a serious blow to anti-nuclear activists when the Legislative Yuan approved funding for construction of the 4NPP seven years ago . These activists and the DPP responded by becoming determined to totally revolutionize energy policy and public opinion . In the 2000 presidential election , the DPP won the office of the presidency , and to fulfill its campaign promises , conducted a reevaluation of the 4NPP and subsequently announced the suspension of its construction . This move , however , provoked a major constitutional crisis , pitting the president against the opposition-controlled legislature .  
The outbreak of an epidemic of the pre-viously unknown disease SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) revealed a Taiwan public health system shot through with flaws . But twenty years ago , Taiwan had suppressed malaria , Japanese encephalitis , infantile paralysis , and other infectious diseases and had successfully set up a powerful frontline , grassroots defense network against epidemics .  
During Qing times , train station warehouses were strategic military entrepots ; during the Japanese occupation they were used as storage facilities by the sugar , salt , and forestry industries ; and after the war they were used to accommodate rail passengers on their way south or north . Although they were located in urban centers with good communication links , these warehouses stopped being used for freight storage many years ago .  
Vincent Hsieh , the chief operations officer ( COO ) at PC Home Online , which crossed over into online marketing three years ago , says that SARS definitely boosted Internet sales of things like surgical masks , thermometers , disinfectant , and air purifiers . But he also suggests that the Internet succeeds mainly because of its special characteristics-speed and suitability for new and unusual products . Therefore he thinks that online selling is attractive enough in itself that it will not experience any sharp falloff now that the epidemic is over .  
Thirty years ago , when martial was still in effect , the heavy hand of political authority held Taida in a tight grip . But the NTU spirit of never compromising was not extinguished .  
" Setting down roots and deepening our impact is the real hard job , " says Yu Mei-nu . To help close the gap between town and country , two years ago they began organizing women 's groups in northern , central , southern , and eastern Taiwan to create the NUTWA , to create a platform for information and resource sharing . They are now moving to use the Internet to link women 's groups across the island .  
For Wang Steak , which has annual revenues in Taiwan in excess of NT $ 1 billion and long ago extended its operations to the US , entry into the PRC was obviously rather late . Park Cheng explains : " We did a survey of white-collar workers several years ago and discovered that although Shanghai once did have areas controlled by Britain and France , nobody in Shanghai chose ' Western food ' as their preferred option for dinner out . "  
Aside from the massive popularity of the Nostalgia Lunches , domestic convenience store chains are also paying attention to this virgin market . Starting a couple of years ago , one after another they started offering different kinds of local packed lunches , starting a " biandang war , " - one would offer theirs for NT $ 40 , so a competitor would drop theirs to NT39 , all promoting their lower prices .

Grandmother Chen , meanwhile , has been operated on for breast cancer and is in poor health .  
Kray Kee is a small settlement of the Karen minority , located in the northwestern Thai county of Tha Song Yang , nine kilometers from the nearest main road . It used to take three hours to reach on foot , until only a year ago villagers working together finally built a simple road through the mountains , allowing access to four-wheel-drive vehicles . However , during the monsoon season , this unstable mud road becomes much more dangerous to travel along and the only reliable way to reach the village is on foot .  
Professor Lin Wan-I of the Department of Social Work , National Taiwan University , recalls that four years ago , when he was vice-mayor of Taipei City , he was astonished to discover that junior high schools had rules that stipulated that female students who got pregnant would be considered to have committed the equivalent of three major violations of the school code and would therefore be expelled .  
To break the " teaching by subject " mold that had characterized teaching at the primary and middle school levels for more than ten years , the " integrated curriculum " for grades 1 to 9 was introduced four years ago .

The search for alternative sources of energy has become an important issue worldwide . In Taiwan , the debate four years ago over whether to continue building a fourth nuclear power plant produced a popular consensus that the island should be made a nuclear-free zone . Thus we urgently need to find clean , safe , sustainable energy sources .  
Over a decade ago , Hsu Jen-hsiu founded an environmentalist group and funneled his passion for exploration into disseminating environmental concepts . Lin A-min said farewell to the mountains in order to work . He says that life in Taipei seems even more like an exploration , packed with all kinds of curious spectacles and personalities . And last year Max Liu , whom nearly all of Taiwan 's explorers hold in the highest regard , departed this life and continued his exploration of the unknown in the mysterious world beyond .  
It was only then that he learned from Wang 's son that that tree was planted by Wang and his wife when they married .

FRTRI director Liu Pao-pao , who has designed rock-climbing shoes and medical footwear for the elderly , says , " If we had presented medical footwear for specific professions or elderly people to the public ten years ago , we would not have been able to sell them .

There used to be a craftswoman in Chiayi who specialized in making these fans . When she died about 20 years ago the craft was lost , but demand for the fans has grown along with the numbers of the troupes performing . Hence , Chen studied how to make them , and after 20 years of intense research has become the undisputed leading maker of these fans .  
Hsu tells an anecdote : more than ten years ago , local inventor Huang Ying-chun devised an air-cushioned shoe . Unfortunately , due to the fact that at the time accessing relevant information was problematic , he did not scrutinize foreign patents and applied only for a domestic patent , with the result that this patent was later challenged and overturned by Nike .  
" Besides the climatic and geographic advantages , this area has a unique background in terms of human history , " states Chen Chung . If hundreds of years ago Chinese had not flooded into Taiwan and occupied all the lowlying land , the Aboriginal peoples would never have been forced to move to high altitudes . When the Nationalist government retreated to Taiwan in 1949 , overnight the island was flooded with two million refugees and soldiers , creating an immediate shortage of arable land , and spawning an urgent need for development in the mountains .

The creation of the United Nations 50 years ago awakened tremendous hopes for mankind , which had , in the space of a single generation , suffered from two particularly savage wars with consequences that sorely affected the entire world and for which all peoples paid a heavy toll . 
If we , the United Nations united not , as 50 years ago , against someone , but driven by the desire for peaceful cooperation show sufficient determination to give effect to our own proposals at this Meeting and at major conferences such as those held under United Nations auspices in recent years , the world stands a chance of ensuring a better and safer life in the twenty-first century .  
Indeed , the widespread desire to bring uniformity to international society in political and institutional terms , on the one hand , and economic and social terms , on the other , has led to an imbalance every bit as dramatic as the imbalance not so long ago when the world was bipolar .  
This fiftieth anniversary might also have been a time to rejoice that the countries that 50 years ago were poor and dominated , especially those on the African continent , now find themselves today among the prosperous nations of our planet , a natural position , given their boundless natural resources .  
Fifty years ago , in the aftermath of the Second World War , the international community , determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war , resolved at San Francisco to create an Organization that would establish the political , economic and social conditions for a new and lasting peace .

In my initial reaction to the letter , I expressed my profound regret at the decision by the Croatian Government , as I strongly believe that the United Nations played a decisive role in bringing to a halt the brutal war on Croatian soil three years ago , and that UNPROFOR has since helped prevent a resumption of renewed fighting .  
What is worse , the international community will continue to send a negative signal vis - - vis the United Nations , that of a lack of genuine commitment to the ideals and principles that inspired its creation half a century ago .  
The above letters contain tendentious and untrue charges concerning the alleged involvement of the Army of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in incidents in the territory of eastern Slavonia contrary to the reports of the Secretary-General of the United Nations that confirmed a long time ago that the former Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) has left the United Nations Protected Areas ( UNPAs ) of the Republic of Serbian Krajina .

In drafting the resolution that the Council adopted a few moments ago , it proved particularly difficult to find words adequately to express the real indignation over the lamentable fact that troops of the peace-keeping forces with which the international community is trying generously to help the parties to resolve their conflicts a generosity not adequately reciprocated lost their lives as a result of deliberate action by members of one of these parties .  
The international community should give further thought to the background and habitual course of the conflicts in Africa and support African efforts to secure rapid , effective agreements guaranteeing the right to self-determination , fundamental freedoms , democracy and development for all these peoples who , despite the attainment of independence some years ago , are unable to find peace with justice and development , mainly because of violence , foreign interests and armed conflicts .

However , if and when the financial target of the 20 / 20 initiative is attained , and even if more donors reach or surpass the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance , as the Netherlands did long ago , it will only have the hoped-for effect if there is a sufficiently competent and honest government machinery to administer these important funds .  
But if this argument is not considered sufficient to prove that the world remains as unjust , unequal and dangerous as it was some years ago , it suffices to look at the conflicts which , with their profound causes that no one can resolve and their tragic consequences that can not be prevented or avoided , fill the newspapers every day .  
Turkey and the pseudo-state , taking advantage of a peaceful demonstration by Greek Cypriots , proceeded a few weeks ago , with the active involvement of the extremist terrorist Turkish group the Grey Wolves , to implement a meticulously prepared plan which was crowned by the murder in cold blood of two young Cypriots and the injuries sustained by many others , United Nations peacekeepers included .
