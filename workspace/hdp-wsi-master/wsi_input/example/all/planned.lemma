Only in this way can our country better protect its security and interests and develop in accordance with the planned objective .

China is now in a period of economic structural transformation , during which the rules governing the planned economy are being smashed while the rules governing the socialist market economy remain imperfect .

As regards operating expenditure , if the additional or improved services as planned , the natural increases in such expenditure as on pension , and the fact that the civil service pay can not be adjusted by the original assumed percentage , are taken into account , the total of operating expenditure to be incurred in 2003-04 will exceed the amount estimated in the Medium Range Forecast . 
In order to ensure that the Government 's overall operating expenditure does not go beyond the total amount estimated in the Medium Range Forecast , Directors of Bureaux are required to achieve a saving of 1.8% in the operating expenditure on the existing and new or improved services as planned in 2003-04 , and an additional saving of 1% each year from 2004-05 to 2006-07 .

It will play a major role in boosting the economy and tourism on the under-developed east coast of Taiwan as well as strengthening national defense .  
But a strong base of agricultural success has already been firmly established . New produce such as the avocado , the new fish hatcheries and domesticated animal farms in Peishihli , and the recently planned re-cultivation of Hsiaopili have successfully taken over what began with pomelo cultivation .  
Since we are still a middle-income nation , we must continue to develop our economy , yet at the same time , the affect of our dense population and the concentrated development of industry makes environmental questions extremely worthy of attention . Thus , our present policy is for economic growth and environmental protection to be simultaneously planned and considered and to be developed in balance .  
Specialists commonly agree that the solution lies in combining small farms into large ones to achieve economies of scale and in promotion of planned production and sales , to economically utilize agricultural resources . Moreover , modernized construction should be strengthened in the rural areas to build villages with the potential to meet the needs of the time . This will solve problems of the farming population and the farming villages simultaneously . (  
If we look at it from a planning point of view , today 's social disorder shows the shortcomings of the government 's planned investments in social affairs . In the past economic growth was stressed , environmental protection deemphasized ; the environmental protection movement is the inevitable price to be paid . Everyone must acknowledge this , only then can the truth be understood .  
Beautification of the environment , and urban and rural planning will receive toppriority attention .

Five years ago , a major battle was fought in the media between the natural ecology and communications construction . The result was that the " egg " ( the environment ) defeated the " stone . " The New Central Cross-Island Highway had originally been planned to cut across the Central Mountain Range to Yuli in Hualien . But because Yushan National Park was " a single man able to hold a narrow mountain pass against an army , " the plan was shrunk so that the road became the park 's " scenic highway . "

In accordance with an assessment made by China Engineering Consultants , the Yushan National Park Administration decided that the land was unstable and liable to frequently collapse along the 50 odd kilometers of the planned cross-island route from Yuli to Tafen .

It is said that when some companies have formed alliances with foreign enterprises , even the plans produced by the partners have been so hard to get to grips with that the contract documents are just left to drafted by the opposite parties before they are signed .

They have thus been preserved down to today .

On the one hand he hoped that his eldest daughter , who once dyed her hair purple and even planned to get herself tattooed , would start acting less like a foreigner and more like a Chinese ; but more importantly , over the last decade the North American economy had been going steadily downhill , while Taiwan had been developing far better than he had ever expected , and with family and contacts here , he thought that if his children returned they would have better chances for the future .  
Of the three concerts in the event , two were completely sold out , and not even the extra standing tickets were enough to meet the demand .

In fact , the real cause of power rationing and blackouts can be seen from even a superficial glance : Because of rapid economic growth with a corresponding increase in national wealth , commercial and industrial demand for electricity has risen while consumer electric products have become common .

As more and more suitable applications are discovered , the demand for taxol is expected only to rise .

The orientation of systems science is for students to learn how to " integrate " knowledge of different fields such as materials science , thermal flux and nuclear engineering .

The mainland is a massive country , and the distance between urban areas is huge . Profits from distribution and retailing of books and magazines are small , even though the ' planned economy ' is gradually being dismantled , and soon it will be far too difficult to set up a wide-ranging logistics and shipping network .

It may have been because she was overwhelmed by the beautiful scenery , but Fu Chieh left her knapsack on a mountain top . She only noticed that she 'd lost it when we planned to go the free market .

China is now in a period of economic structural transformation , during which the rules governing the planned economy are being smashed while the rules governing the socialist market economy remain imperfect .
