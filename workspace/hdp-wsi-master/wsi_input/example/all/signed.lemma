Despite the decision pursuant to the peace accords signed by the Palestinian Liberation Organization ( PLO ) and Israel to postpone discussion of certain items , including the matter of settlements , pending negotiations on final status , the illegal confiscation of Arab lands by the Israeli Government in order to build settlements was incompatible with the achievement by all parties of the common goal of economic and social stability .

Bush said that the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty the United States signed with the Soviet Union in 1972 was " outdated , " and he discarded the defense policy based on mutual deterrence over the past 10 years , thus triggering off a new arms race by adding more and more offensive weapons to the defense system and expanding the weapon system to the outer space .

Now we are happy that the treaty has been signed smoothly .  The peaceful thinking that China and Russia will remain " friends from generation to generation and never be enemy " to each other has been laid down in a legal form , becoming the program guiding the development of bilateral relations .  
In the past 10 years , Sino-Russian relations have developed from " regarding each other as friendly countries " to " constructive partnership , " and then " strategic cooperative partnership of equality and mutual trust geared to the 21st century , " and the two heads of state have signed over 10 joint statements and declarations , which set a series of important principles for constantly strengthening , deepening and substantiating bilateral relations .
