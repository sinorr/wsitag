We must firmly redress the erroneous tendency to neglect ideological and political work and to " pay more attention to material progress than to cultural and ideological progress " in some places and departments ; develop a stronger sense of responsibility and urgency ; and conscientiously pay attention to and step up the effort to solve a series of major issues facing the effort to strengthen and improve ideological and political work , from the perspective of consolidating the party 's status as a ruling party and accomplishing the party 's historical mission .  
Practice proves that this round of the " three stresses " education is a creative exploration in strengthening and improving party building in the new period , especially in ideological and political building of leading bodies and cadres .  It carries forward and enriches in the period the Yanan rectification spirit and the party 's " three great styles , " and is an important measure in promoting and implementing the principle that " the party must manage itself " and the principle of " sternly governing the party . "  
The ideological and political quality , the mental state and the work of cadres at this level have a direct bearing on the implementation of the party 's line , principles and policies , influence local reform , development and stability , and influence party-people and cadre-people relations .  On the whole , the situation of the contingent of the leading bodies and leading cadres of over 2,000 counties ( cities ) across the country is good .  
The CPC Central Commission for Guiding the Spiritual Civilization Building held its seventh plenary session today to study the gist of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important directive on strengthening and improving the ideological and political work , and to make work arrangements for further reinforcing the building of socialist spiritual civilization and for earnestly grasping the party 's ideological and political work under the present new situation .

It is imperative to build up a contingent of ideological and political workers at the grassroots level who maintain a close tie with the masses , care for the well-being of the masses , and are good at doing the mass work .  
To successfully reinforce the ideological and political work , the key is to practice what one preaches .  Communist party members must set an example for the entire society to follow , while leading cadres are required to play an exemplary role for the whole party .  
We face arduous tasks in strengthening and improving our ideological and political work in the new period .  There are many problems that need studying .  The key issue is to strengthen the ideals and beliefs of the broad masses of Party members , cadres , and the people through strong and effective ideological and political work .  
Currently , we are in an important historical period at the turn of two centuries .  Our country 's reform is in the period of storming the fortifications .  Faced with the changeable situation in the world and various complicated social phenomena , some people are at a loss and puzzled .  This is not strange .  The key is that our ideological and political work must adapt to the new situations in China and abroad .  The work must adapt to new changes in our society , politics , economy and cultural lives .  
Their ideological and political quality , work style , words and deeds have a direct bearing on the implementation of the party 's line , principles and policies in rural areas , on the reform , development and stability in rural areas , and on the relations between the party and the masses and between the cadres and the masses .  Generally speaking , the great majority of township ( town ) leading cadres are good , diligent , honest in performing official duties and working hard regardless of criticism ;  
The conference pointed out : Launching activities of " stressing civilization and fostering new practices " in depth is an urgent need for promoting reform and development and maintaining social stability .  It is an urgent need for meeting the growing material and cultural needs of the people and forging closer ties between the party and the government on the one hand and the masses on the other .  It is also necessary for implementing tasks of ideological and political work at the grassroots levels .  
If the departments concerned can work in close cooperation , coordinate their actions and produce some tangible results in these activities , it will be conducive to promoting the solution of major and difficult issues that the masses feel very strongly about , thus making the effects of ideological and political work felt deep in the heart of the masses , improving the quality of the population as civilized people , and making the urban and rural areas more civilized .  
Cultural and sports activists among the masses should be given ideological education and vocational training , and the more outstanding ones should be selected to serve as instructors for community cultural and sports activities in order to gradually bring these activities onto the track of organized , standardized and healthy development .  
On 1 March , the Central Propaganda Department called a departmental affairs meeting to further study General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech , enhance understanding , seek unity of thinking , make thoroughgoing reflections in the light of the realities , work out concrete arrangements for strengthening and improving the ideological and political work in its implementation of the directives of the central authorities , and to discuss a number of major issues which need to be resolved in the propaganda and ideological work during the country 's present cross-century development .  
regard the ideological and political work as the essential among essentials ; grasp the work firmly , create a sound atmosphere , and carry out the work in a down-to-earth manner ; and provide a strong spiritual motive power and a powerful ideological guarantee for our efforts to promote the development of reform and maintain the stability of the society .  
and put the ideological and political education in the primary position of quality education .  It is imperative to promote the integration of the students ' moral , intellectual , physical , aesthetic , and labor technical education with social practice ;  
The ministry points out that with the focus on improving teachers ' moral characters and work styles , we should realistically strengthen the construction of the contingent of teachers and make ceaseless efforts to improve teachers ' ideological and political quality and professional ability .  
In line with the current situation and tasks as well as the ideological reality of officers and men , by encouraging officers and men to study , analyze , and discuss theories and to compare and examine themselves with positive examples , this unit has drawn up measures to conduct rectification and correction and concentrated on enhancing officers and men 's sense of responsibility and mission in preparing for military combat with high standards and high quality .  
We should take seriously studying and all-round carrying out Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech as a turning point to launch widespread and profound studies and discussions among the Party Committees and governments at all levels and all related departments especially education departments as well as all social related parties .  We should deepen our understandings , unify the thinking and lay a good ideological foundation in order to carry out quality education , strengthen and promote educational work , and create a new situation of paying attention to the healthy growth of youths among the whole society .  
The members of Jingyang County 's leading group said : In the past , we always thought economic work meant inflexible tasks and targets while the party building and the building of spiritual civilization were flexible tasks , dealing with ideological work , not " grain production . "  So , we did not have a profound understanding of the principle of " building both material and spiritual civilizations and attaching equal importance to both " and our understanding of it was lopsided .  
Fourth , all localities in Guangdong must constantly enhance the ideological and ethical qualities , as well as the scientific and cultural qualities , of the people ; strengthen the building of a socialist spiritual civilization ; and bring about a well-coordinated economic and social development .  
In view of the development of the objective situation and the change in the ranks of workers and staff members , we should do in-depth and meticulous ideological and political work among them and keep improving their ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities .  
While fully developing the material productive forces , our party should attach great importance to the " cultural productive forces , " which are high-level productive forces ; the value and influence produced by such high-level productive forces will have a direct bearing on every aspect of our work and on our party 's ideological and political work in the new period .  
We will further strengthen our four major pillar industries of the processing industry of agricultural and sideline products , the energy industry , the metallurgical industry , and the chemical industry ; speed up the development of our four dominant industries of rare earth , biological technology , information , and heavy-duty vehicles ; take the ideological emancipation as the guide , and uphold the principle that " development is the last word " ;  
The basic spirit of the speech is suited to the county ( or city ) level as well as to the leadership at various levels ; the speech is particularly aimed at improving the ideological and political qualities of leading cadres at various levels ; so it is of great practical and far-reaching historical significance .  
He then pointed out : In studying Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , we should base ourselves on the purpose of enabling leading cadres at various levels to clearly understand the importance and necessity of doing a good job in conducting the " three stresses " education at the county ( or city ) level , on the purpose of improving the ideological and political quality of cadres at all levels , and on the purpose of solving problems in a down-to-earth manner .  
Some delegates indicated : During the current building of a spiritual civilization , the trend of promoting material progress to the neglect of cultural and ideological progress has yet to be checked permanently , and a major factor leading to such a situation is that the related legislation work remains relatively weak ; in view of such a problem , we ought to vigorously strengthen the legislation concerning the building of a socialist spiritual civilization .  
We must solidly and deeply launch the mass campaign of the exploration and construction of spiritual civilization and comprehensively conduct promotion and education , among all of the people , on scientific perspective on the world and methodology .  We must form a healthy atmosphere , in the entire society , which opposes superstition and ignorance and resists various false reasoning and heretical ideas .  We must continuously improve the masses ' ideological and moral levels and establish good spiritual habits .  
Guided by Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , ideological and political work has always accompanied the party 's founding , development , maturing , and strengthening ; it has become the fine tradition and political strong point of the CPC members in uniting for struggle , conquering difficulties , and winning victory , and has become the party 's " magic weapon " in gathering together the spiritual force of the Chinese nation .  
From instituting the household contract responsibility system to the establishment of coastal special economic zones , from planned economy to socialist market economy , and from the initial stage of socialism to the idea of " benefiting three things " - - every one of this series of reforms drawing forward the overall situation is attributable to guidance by the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts .  
Faced with the new situations and problems that have emerged in market economy , in accordance with the demands of the central authorities , the central departments concerned and many localities have engaged in bold exploration and practice , and regarded mass activities to build spiritual civilization as an important carrier for ideological and political work ; they have attached importance to the social education function of culture , and paid attention to giving play to the demonstration role of advanced typical examples .  
Guangdong , which is in the forefront of reform and opening up , must all the more enhance understanding of the importance of " grasping things with two hands , with both hands firm , " tangibly strengthen ideological and political work , and launch an extensive and thorough education drive to " think of the source when getting rich , and advance in thinking when getting rich . "  
Many deputies and committee members said that in the course of reform , opening up , and establishing a socialist market economy system , pluralistic trends have emerged in economic components and interests , ways of social life , and social organizational forms ; high technology has developed rapidly , new changes have occurred in people 's ideological concepts and value orientation , there are more social hot spots and difficult points , all kinds of ideas and cultures stir each other , and certain new situations and problems have arisen in social life .  
Deputy Tian Chengzhong , secretary of Pingdingshan City CPC Committee in Henan , said that ideological and political work includes many aspects such as education content , ways and means , leadership system , operational mechanism , component force , and position carriers [ zhen di zai ti , 7109-0966-6528-7555 ] , and is closely lined with structural reform , the building of the legal system , and cultural construction .  
It is necessary to establish and perfect a system , under the unified leadership of the party committees , in which the party and government departments and the mass bodies share the work and coordinate with each other and the leading cadres at all levels take on dual responsibilities in their posts ; it is necessary to establish a work mechanism for integrating ideological and political work with work in all aspects , and to form a good " integration " of mutual stimulation between them .  
While creating a model street for the " no fake goods in malls and shops " activity , Hunan Road of Gulou District in Nanjing City incorporated ideological and political work as well as spiritual civilization construction into commercial enterprise management and business operation in a lively and tangible manner , producing a set of experiences in double civilizations construction and turning a shabby , cluttered , and unknown street into a golden business location , a shopping paradise , and a national model street of no fake goods in just a few years .  
The party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core has held high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , unswervingly upheld the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces , and persistently put ideological and political building in the most important place .  The people 's armed forces have maintained their brilliant image of being mighty and civilized armed forces .  The armed forces are constantly scoring new victories in making themselves more revolutionary , modern and regular .  
Deputy Wang Zhihao is deputy regimental commander of an air force aviation unit with glorious traditions .  This 34 year-old lieutenant colonel , who has been flying for 15 years , stressed : " As a result of training through science and technology in recent years , the overall quality of the air force has been greatly enhanced , while ideological and political education over a long period has rooted in our minds the idea that ' the interests of the motherland and the people are forever supreme . '  
The PLA and armed police units are treating the campaign of learning from Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun as an important content of their ideological and political education , organizing the officers and men to learn from the advanced deeds of Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun in light of the realities of army building in the new period , and help the officers and men further their understanding of Lei Feng 's and Li Xiangqun 's lofty spirit .  
The PLA and armed police units are treating efforts to strengthen the ideological properties of young officers and men as the most important part of the campaign of learning from Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun ; and are guiding young officers and men to display a " spirit of the nail " [ grasping every available minute and second ] , painstakingly study Deng Xiaoping Theory and materialist dialectics , constantly lay a solid ideological theory foundation , and acquire correct world outlook , outlook on life , and values .  
Therefore , with Marxism as the guide and the training of people who have lofty ideas , moral integrity , education , and a sense of discipline as the goal , we must develop a national , scientific , and popular culture , which is oriented to modernization , the world , and the future , and concentrate efforts on improving the ideological and ethical quality as well as scientific and cultural quality of the entire Chinese nation .  
However , while liberating and developing social productive forces , we must also handle numerous issues about production relations and superstructures , especially those issues in the ideological and cultural realms and must let the building of material civilization and the building of spiritual civilization coordinately develop .  
Meanwhile , under the new historical conditions we are required to comprehensively push forward the ideological , organizational , and stylistic building of the Party and truly maintain and display the advanced nature of the Party on the basis of correctly mastering and handling the relationship of dialectical unity between the advanced nature of ourselves and the extensiveness of our contacts with the masses .  
disseminated , in a vivid way , the materialist ideological concept of respecting science and opposing superstition among the vast number of the visitors ; helped people see more clearly the true nature and the harms of such religious cults as the " Falungong " ; and will thus prove a great help to enhancing the spiritual civilization and the scientific attainment of our people .  
He specially pointed out : General Secretary Jiang Zemin has always been concerned about the ideological and political education among , as well as the healthy growth of , our teenagers .  All relevant departments should run more useful activities , so as to guide the teenagers to establish a correct outlook on life , science , and civilization ; besides , they should also provide more place of activities for teenagers , including scientific parks and cultural centers .  
In some places and schools in our city of Beijing , there still exist the tendency to emphasize cultural knowledge study and to slight ideological and political education as well as the stubborn disease , of varying degrees of seriousness , of one-sidedly pursuing admissions rates and examination results and slackening ideological and political education as well as social practice activities .  
Teachers are engineers of human souls ; improving teachers ' ideological and political qualities and ethics cultivation will be of decisive significance to the comprehensive ethical , intellectual , physical , and aesthetic development of children and youths and to training qualified personnel for modernization construction .  
To conduct the in-depth ideal and belief education , it is necessary to greatly carry forward the Marxist fighting and critical spirit , firmly hold the initiative in the ideological struggle , watch out for symptoms of incorrect tendencies , check erroneous ideas at the outset , nip an evil in the bud , always guard against the corrosive influence of various decadent ideologies and values , resist the offensive from various anti-Marxist ideological trends , enable people to more clearly understand and more firmly adopt the correct ideal and belief through the ideological struggle .  
The people of the entire province , from top to bottom , must take this important four-point instruction as a powerful dynamic and ideological weapon to promote their work in various fields and to put into effect the party central committee 's policy decision on the grand western development with actual deeds .  
and accelerate the process of transforming scientific research results into realistic productive forces .  Wu Bangguo stressed : Under the present new situation , we should further strengthen the party building in state enterprises , reinforce and improve the ideological and political work , step up the building of a spiritual civilization , tighten ties between cadres and masses , show concern for the livelihood of workers and staff , and give full rein to the role of party organizations in enterprises as a strong fighting force .  
The " three representations " is the scientific summary of the Party 's character and aim , is the centralized requirements of maintaining the Party 's advancement , is the creative utilization and development of Theory of Marxism Party building , and is the fundamental guiding ideology of strengthening Party building under new circumstances , which has strong ideological content , theoretical content and distinctive character of the day .  
In his speech , Yu Yongbo , member of the Central Military Commission , and director of the General Political Department , demanded all levels of the military to strengthen ideological and political work , teach the military-turned-cadres to consolidate the concept of taking in the interests of the whole into account , fully understanding the difficulties of local governments and the units that take in the demobilized army officers , and supporting the economic construction and various reforms of the state by practical deeds .  
In his speech celebrating the centennial of Beijing University , he called on the vast number of young people to integrate the acquisition of scientific and cultural knowledge with the strengthening of ideological cultivation , book learning with social practice , the attainment of values with serving the motherland and the people , and the cultivation of lofty ideals with the conduct of hard struggles .  
On the one hand , hostile forces in the West are still bent on " Westernizing " and " dividing " us and they try their utmost to step up ideological and cultural infiltration through a multitude of channels .  They publicize capitalist values in the large volumes of imported publications , film and television products , electronic games , computer software , and other spiritual and cultural products in an effort to compete with us for the younger generation .  
In the face of new changes taking place in the domestic and international situation and new development in ideological education for young people , we feel deeply that Comrade Jiang Zemin 's speech has a clear objective , that it targets at the current problems , and that it is of great practical meaning , and it has made us realize even more the urgency and difficult nature of young people 's ideological education .  
Schools of different types and at all levels should strive to explore new paths for conducting young people 's and students ' ideological education in the new period , reform and enrich the content of the ideological education courses taught at primary and middle schools and at colleges , actively support and help students to engage in extracurricular activities that are healthy in content , rich and colorful , and loved by them .  
It is necessary to adhere to the principle of doing ideological and political work and doing economic and vocational work at the same time .  Ideological and educational work should permeate practical work , and the actual results in ideological and political work should be increased .  
On the basis of its comprehensive analysis of the current international and domestic situation , the party central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core requires that the party 's ideological and political work be done intensively and effectively , and takes this as an urgent strategic task related to the general situation of socialist reform and construction in our country for the whole party and the entire people of the whole nation .  
Only by correctly understanding and handling the relationship between the economy and politics can we make comprehensive development in the economic , political , ideological and cultural fields , and build ours into a wealthy , strong socialist modern country with democracy and a high degree of civilization .  
If the grass-roots party organizations fail to conduct effective ideological and political work , people may become listless , their minds may be confused , and the organizations may become loose and lax in management .  In such circumstances , profit-making enterprises and advanced units may inevitably collapse .  
In the subjective aspect , a small number of communists and party cadres became corrupt and degenerated because they did not study , did not stress politics , and then began to vacillate in their ideal and belief .  Therefore , to effectively stop corruption , in addition to improving the legal system and the supervision mechanisms , it is also necessary to enhance political , ideological , and moral education .  
The most commendable thing about Xu Zhigong , who is both a theoretical worker and a high-ranking cadre , is that he " has made thoroughgoing studies , developed a firm faith in , and put into practice " Marxism in real terms .  He has all along maintained a highly developed sense of political responsibility and a firm ideological resolve that are required of a theoretical worker ; closely integrated scientific theories with the practice of reform and construction ;  
to insure that all could , on a basis of their own initiative , learn revolutionary theories , guard and fight against the corrosion of corrupt ideology and culture , persistently struggle against schools of reactionary ideological trends , against idealistic and pseudoscientific ideologies ; that all should take in fact the Marxist world outlook , outlook on life , values , and take the initiative in socialist cultural civilization construction ;  
In doing practical work , first political commissars should resolve problems in a timely manner , study and arrange the major work of reserve forces , clearly understand the ideological pulse of leading cadres , and organize and convene meetings to study and resolve major problems so as to ensure that reserve forces are developing toward a correct orientation .  
Thus , they are more liable to the impact of erroneous ideas and bad phenomena .  In addition , reserve officers and men are scattered over many areas and are engaged in the work of various professions and trades .  Hence , the changes in their political attitude and ideological state are hard to be controlled .  
This is the marked difference between reserve forces and active military units .  To counter this , first political commissars of reserve forces must , when doing ideological and political work , embrace an advanced consciousness and must be fast in making judgement , in transmitting instructions , in giving feedback signals , and in tracking the results .  This is the only way to succeed .  
Zhu Rongji stressed : The leaders of state enterprises should all act in line with the requirements of the central authorities ; and strive to turn themselves into operators and managers who have a sound ideological and political quality , enjoy a strong ability in business operation and management , strictly observe the law and discipline , and remain honest and self-disciplined in performing their official duties .  To this end , they should be eager to study , diligent in their studies , and good at their studies .  
and we should take earnest steps to strengthen leadership over the ideological and political building in military academies , give priority to selecting highly capable cadres to form the leading bodies of military academies , and see to it that the school-running work can keep to its correct orientation and that the able personnel we bring up are all politically qualified .  
The 10-year history of Pudong development also demonstrates the adherence to the strategy of Emphasizing both on economy and ideology and of the ideological education of stressing both spiritual civilization and material civilization as a key reason of the successful development of Pudong . The adherence also is the guarantee of a Party free of corruption , and of a fine social mood .  The Pudong development project stuck to the principle of To accelerate the first-class development project with first-class Party construction .  
Such practice of using the human rights issue as a political tool to create ideological confrontation and promote hegemonism epitomizes politicization of the human rights issue , utterly violates the purpose and principles of the UN Charter and runs counter to the trend of the times , in which the international community calls for dialogue and cooperation .  It is only natural that the resolution was rejected by a majority of the members of the UN Human Rights Commission , and opposed by the just world opinion .  
In the wake of the deepening of reforms and the development of socialist market economy , economic components and interests , social organizational forms and social ways of life , and jobs and employment methods are becoming more varied by the day , and this inevitably affects people 's ideological concepts and human relations in various ways , and some of these influences are negative ;  
In recent years Comrade Jiang Zemin has repeatedly emphasized that leading cadres must stress study , politics , and healthy trends , work hard to enhance the ideological and political quality of the ranks of party members and cadres , do a good job in resolving problems of world view , view of life , and values , and firmly embrace correct ideals and beliefs .  
We must , through vigorous ideological-political work , enable Marxism to firmly control the ideological and cultural fields and make it difficult for all kinds of reactionary , decadent , and backward political viewpoint , ideology , and life style to gain a foothold and spread .  
In short , we must , under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels , carry out vigorous ideological-political work to explain and answer the masses ' questions , resolve contradictions , straighten out their feelings , coordinate interest relationship , bring about cohesion , and mobilize all positive factors .  Only by so doing can we provide our country 's reform , opening up , and modernization with powerful spiritual motive force and ideological safeguards ; can our economic construction advance in a healthy and smooth way .  
We should apply Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory to enhance the ideological and political levels of the young cadres ; apply modern scientific knowledge and the fruits of outstanding human culture to enhance their professional standards ; apply the practice of arduous and complex environment and a variety of posts to temper and enhance their leadership ability ;  
and apply regular ideological education and strict management and supervision to foster a good work style among them .  In connection with implementing the strategy of the major development of west China , we should guide young cadres to actively join the ranks of developing the west ; we should select young cadres from the central and state organs and from regions where the economically is relatively developed , and send them to the western regions in a planned manner .  
In view of such an understanding , we have specially stressed the point in our ideological and theoretical education that theory and practice are not of a relationship of simply fitting one into the other ; meanwhile , we have also taken special note to guide people to study and master a series of intermediate links in the process of transforming theory into reality , and guide people to consciously work hard for the materialization of such a transformation .  
Leading cadres at all levels must arm themselves fully with Mao Zedong Thought , Deng Xiaoping Theory , and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important exposition ; willingly enhance their sense of historical responsibility and urgency ; broaden their horizons ; work hard and keep forging ahead ; foster a scientific spirit ; master scientific methods ; learn knowledge about science ; and persist in working hard unremittingly on the basis of what has been achieved so far .  They must make efforts to further improve their ideological and cultural quality ;  
Wang Ke pointed out : The important speech , which Chairman Jiang made from a strategic height and after having reviewed the whole situation , is a scientific summation of our party 's historical experience , a deep revelation of the inherent laws governing the work of party building , and an enrichment and development of Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's thoughts on party building .  It has further pointed out the direction of party building in the new period and has a high theoretical and ideological level and a guiding function .  
Especially since its Third Plenary Meeting of the 11th National People 's Congress , our Party has re-established its ideological lines and has made significant decisions and taken strategic measures like reforms and opening-up policies to meet the development needs of the times.has greatly emancipated and developed the productive forces , accelerated the construction of the socialist material civilization and of the socialist spiritual civilization and has paved a way toward building up socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
The fundamental task of the ideological and political construction in military academies and universities in the new situation is , on the basis of winning wars and opposing corruption , to insure constructing high-quality military academies and universities in the correct direction and to insure realizing the purpose of cultivating high-quality talented military people .  
On the one hand , the ideological and political construction should push forward military academies and universities to further emancipate their thinking , change their perceptions , face modernization , face the world , face the future , catch up with the world trend of scientific and technological advances , of military revolution and of educational advances , create famous brands and struggle to be first class .  
In the process of ideological and political construction , we must take improving ideological and political qualities as the first task in cultivating high-quality talented military people ; meanwhile , we should insure students are competent in such aspects as science and culture , professional military skills , physical abilities and psychological qualities .  
At present , our military 's political and ideological work is facing many new problems like how to correctly understand and appropriately handle the relationship of honoring modern educational laws versus bringing to full play our military 's political advantages , teaching scientific and cultural knowledge versus cultivating military people 's ideological and political qualities and stimulating an academic and research atmosphere versus maintaining high ideological unity .  
To keep to the orientation of the progress of advanced culture , it is necessary to adapt ourselves to the requirements of reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization , to concentrate on improving the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the people across the country , and to unite and mobilize the people of all nationalities throughout the country to build our country into a prosperous , powerful , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist state .  
Since our army is an important force for building the socialist spiritual civilization and an advanced group composed of outstanding young people from all walks of life , it must conscientiously uphold the requirement for the advanced quality in ideological , moral , and cultural construction .  
Through reinforcing and improving ideological and political work , clearly explaining the common interest relations and our trans-century development objectives , plans , and policies among the masses though propaganda and inculcation , we shall make the 1.2-billion people share the same ideological base , hold the same ideal and belief , and strive for the same goal .  Thus , greater enthusiasm , initiative , and creativity will burst forth among our people in their joint struggle for building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Through ideological and political work , we will enhance people 's ideological consciousness , promote good public conduct in society , solve various problems in people 's minds , facilitate communication and mutual understanding among the people , and thus coordinate interpersonal relations , mitigate various social contradictions , and maintain a stable and orderly condition in society while keeping all the vigor and dynamism .  
However , under the current material conditions , ideological and political work can solve problems in people 's minds to different degrees , can better give play to the initiative role of people 's mentality , and make up for the temporary shortage of the material forces with people 's mental forces .  This will prompt the people to create more material wealth .  
He meticulously studied Deng Xiaoping Theory and learned a broad range of knowledge related with modern science and technology and ideological and political work .  He came up with a series of methods on how to lead soldiers in the new era , solved a series of problems that officials and soldiers face along their road of life , and promoted the progressive transformation of over a-hundred officials and soldiers .  
The important concept of " three represents " put forward by General Secretary Jiang is an in-depth summing-up of historical experiences in the building of our party , a scientific generalization of the party 's nature , aims , and tasks , and new requirements set for party building in the new period .  It embodies the distinct characteristics of the times and is of profound ideological and scientific guiding significance .  
During our major political struggle against " Falun Gong , " some veteran comrades who had been party members for many years were confused by its false reasoning and heresy .  This fact profoundly shows that in new historical conditions , the struggle between right and wrong , between the advanced and the backward , between science and superstition , and between civilization and ignorance in the ideological sphere appears to be ever more complicated .  
In the march toward the new century , in order to conscientiously implement Comrade Jiang Zemin 's requirement on the " three represents " and " comprehensively advance party building around the two major historical topics , that is , constantly raising our leading and governing ability and improving our ability to guard against corruption and degeneration and withstand risks , " it is necessary to thoroughly implement the principle of strictly administering the party and satisfactorily resolve the ideological , organizational , and work style problems that exist in our party .  
It is necessary to deeply understand and master the new requirements put forth by the " three represents " for the ideological and political building , so as to lay a firm theoretical foundation to unwaveringly uphold the revolutionary ideals and beliefs , consolidate the ideological defense line to unwaveringly uphold the essence and aim of the people 's army , and master the correct direction to unwaveringly uphold the absolute leadership of the party over the army .  
The Central Committee gives its full support to the Party 's basic line , continuing to uphold economic construction as the center , working hard to rectify the phenomenon of ' one hand rather hard , one hand rather soft ' , and strengthening ideological and political work and the building of the Party " .  
This is an important measure that the General Department of Politics took to carry out and implement Chairman Jiang 's important directive on improving the purposefulness , efficiency and creativeness of the military 's ideological and political work , and it is a lively and vivid textbook for the military to deeply promote the ideological and ethic education .  
It is one of our military 's excellent traditions in ideological and political work to help the broad number of officials and soldiers to strengthen their conviction , mold their sentiment and inspire their fighting spirit by singing revolutionary songs .  
In the new situation of reform and opening-up and developing a socialist market economy , when the historic topic of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " lies ahead , it is both the earnest expectation of the Party and the masses and the objective requirement for implementing our military 's sacred mission to strengthen the military 's ideological and morality construction and to cultivate revolutionary military professions with the " Four Haves " .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " firmly takes hold of this critical topic , retells in artistic form that officials and soldiers like to hear and see the brilliant history in which the people 's military united to struggle under the Party 's leadership , reflects the fundamental moral requirements for revolutionary military professionals in the new phase and displays the vigorous and progressive spiritual outlook of modern military professionals , having developed a new thinking on reforming the military 's ideological and political education .  
All troops should associate singing these songs with ideological and political education , enthusiastically respond to Chairman Jiang 's call that " the military 's civilization construction should proceed at the forefront of the whole society " , make effort to become exemplary figures who put into practice , and enthusiastically spread this advanced ideology and culture .  
We should sing aloud the " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " to enable these songs that are revolutionary , advanced , healthy and progressive to echo in military camps , to enrich our lives , to inspire our spirit , to serve our strengthening and accelerating our military 's fighting strength , to serve our strengthening and improving ideological and political work , and to serve our constructing a socialist spiritual civilization .  
The group of songs reflects the basic ethical demands on the revolutionary military personnel in the new period and is the vivid teaching material to enhance the troop units ' ideological and political building .  
Conscientious organization of the singing of these songs by military personnel is of major significance to nurture high ethical standards for officers and men , to carry forward the excellent tradition and style of the people 's army , to build an excellent image for a powerful and civilized army , and to promote reform of ideological and political education .  
The rich ideological content of those songs realizes the spirit of Chairman Jiang 's major instructions on enhancing the Army 's ideological and political education , warmly eulogizes the nature and purposes of the people 's army and the glorious chapters of unity and struggle under the Party leadership , and displays the spiritual outlook of the vigorous and high-fighting spirit contemporary military personnel .  Songs are varied in style .  
The PLA General Political Department held a training course for the party secretaries of its directly subordinate units from 10 May to 15 June to conscientiously study and implement Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents " .  The training course aimed to further improve the ideological level and the ability of leadership of the secretaries and deputy secretaries of party committees , and to enhance the coherent force and the fighting capacity of the leading bodies of party committees .  
Last year , after conducting research it proposed : The evil religion peddles spiritual opium in the guise of " making one into a Buddha or celestial being " , thus achieving the goal of opposing the government and society .  Therefore , thoroughly exposing and criticizing , and resolutely resisting all kinds of crooked reasons and heretical ideas are important tasks in strengthening ideological and political construction .  
Practice in the three major political struggles showed : The mission of ideological and political construction in the army under the new historical condition , as proposed by the All-Army Political Work Conference , is of extreme significance to providing a powerful spiritual motivation for " winning our fight " , and to providing a reliable political guarantee for " not deteriorating " .  
In line with their sacred missions and tasks , officers and men adhered to high standards and strove to set first-class standard .  They comprehensively improved their ideological and political quality ; quality of military professionalism ;  
scientific , technological , and cultural quality ; and physical and mental quality .  All these also reflected an important trend in the implementation of the conference spirit by all units : The units closely integrated theory with practice , and always focused on major issues such as direction and strategy , so as to earnestly strengthen ideological and political work , and actively promote military modernization .  
Strengthening the Party 's and the military 's aims should be taken as the basic requirement for such study programs as Party committees ' central groups , the Party 's life , theoretical learning programs for cadres and ideological education periodically held in the military .  We should devote unswerving , profound and permanent efforts , brand it and root it through periodic and repeated and effectively find answers from the bottom of their heart for the questions of " Why did we join the Party ?  What do we work for ?  
Even the leading cadres with workers ' or farmers ' backgrounds had raised their ideological and theoretical proficiency and knowledge and cultural qualities up to a considerable level through their diligent learning .  
In leading our army 's modernization , Comrade Jiang Zemin is applying Mao Zedong 's military thinking and Deng Xiaoping 's army-building thinking for the new period while adopting some new practices .  He has put forward the task of " ideological and political education " which is of great importance and epochal significance , emphasized the necessity to put ideological and political education above all else in the army , discussed in many ways how to strengthen ideological and political education , and advanced a series of important thinking .  
To strengthen ideological and political education is of extremely great significance to upholding the party 's absolute leadership over the army , stepping up our army 's revolutionization , modernization and regularization , providing a strong spiritual motive force for " winning in war " , and providing a political guarantee for " being immune to degeneration " .  
Upholding the party 's absolute leadership over the army is always a main subject of our army 's ideological and political education .  After they join the army , the most important education service members receive is " military spirit " .  In the final analysis , when troop units hold lectures , publish blackboard newspapers , show motion pictures , stress traditions , and organize visits to sacred places of revolution , all such activities are closely linked to " the gun obeying the party " .  
Everywhere , from South China Sea outposts to northern borders , from east coasts to snowy plateau , headquarters offices , grass-roots companies and other units have done a great deal of arduous and meticulous ideological education work , focusing on " forever unchanged military spirit " .  Some generals personally give political lectures .  
Many of them are teachers and students .  This may bring the impact of their administrative posts , academic status , and master-student relations into the party .  Thus , it is more necessary to intensify study , enhance the ideological and theoretical quality , strictly follow the requirement of the democratic centralist system , set aright the position of an individual , approach things from the across-the-board interests of section development .  
The Party 's grassroots organizations should profoundly solve the conspicuous problems arising in strengthening the leadership over ideological and political construction , in adhering to the principle of democratic centralism , in strengthening their sense of principles and their combat strength , in conforming to the system of regular activities at grassroots organizations , and in purifying the trend at the grassroots units .  
Under the conditions of promoting reform and opening up and being in the ruling position , our party must constantly resist all kinds of corrosive influence and culture .  Therefore , to the broad masses of party members and cadres , it is particularly important to strengthen the building of spiritual civilization and continuously raise their ideological , moral , scientific and cultural qualities .  
We must persist in " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to each " and firmly promote the building of spiritual civilization while grasping the building of material civilization .  We should use Marxism to firmly occupy the ideological and cultural front , vigorously strengthen education on developing a fine party style and building a clean and honest government , and construct an ideological and moral defensive line to repel the corrupting influence and guard against degeneration .  
Holding the major responsibility for ensuring the quality of the training , regular schools of higher learning should attach great importance to ideological and political education , persistently arm the students with scientific theory , and help the students firm up their faith in communist ideals and embrace correct outlook on the world , life , and value .  
It was pointed out in the " decision " of the all-army political work conference on the need to , with regard to the army 's political work reform , pay attention to " employing advanced scientific methods " , to " aggressively absorbing results of modern scientific and technological development and to giving play to the roles of modern information technology like computer networks and the mass media in the areas of information gathering , situation handling , knowledge dissemination , and ideological education " .  
With the introduction of modern information technology and with some units hit by an " online craze " , there arises the problem of " deviation " in the content of the ideological and political education , that is , neglect in employing advanced methods to conduct basic indoctrination of basic theories , and unsystematic , incomplete , and even fragmentary expounding of basic principles related to enhance convictions and to conduct oneself .  
Adopting advanced scientific means is meant to serve for ideological and political education .  First of all , content of political education must meet the needs of the times .  Political education content should be colorful and knowledge-based or it will not only not be conducive to solving ideological problems but also will produce negative impacts and cancel out the results of ideological and political education .  
In the network and information age , Western political ideology tends to infiltrate us via various channels .  In this connection , the army must persist in a correct direction in the ideological and political education work and must concentrate efforts on raising the ideological , ethical , scientific , and cultural quality of officers and men .  
We should combine that basis with the thinking of officers and men , carry out psychological adjustment education , provide guidance to officers and men to cultivate lofty ideals , for good mentality , for living well , and to help lay a solid ideological foundation for training " four haves " military personnel .  
When conducting ideological and political education , we should expand intention and extension of ideological and political education , and while helping raise the ethical quality of officers and men we must also incorporate the raising of their scientific and technological levels into the educational scope .  
In the second half of 1995 , units at the grassroots level of the South China Sea Fleet stationed in the opening area of the special economic zone reflected that the original experience and methods of ideological and political work seemed to be unworkable now .  
The Guangzhou Military Region , which is located on the forefront of reform and opening up , has always been carrying out ideological and political work with emphasis on studying and solving new situation and problems under the conditions of reform , opening up and the development of a socialist market economy , on studying and solving main , difficult , hot and doubtful problems faced by various units at present , and on summing up and promoting effective experiences in army building in the new period with good results .  
The second signal company of a garrison district of a navy unit stationed in Shantou has often carried out " letting everyone talk " activities in promoting ideological work and encouraged fighters to mount on the stage of self-education .  Everyone can offer his opinions on specific topics and on methods to solve problems and make contributions .  In this way , the unit has promoted the " appropriate , systematic and creative nature " of ideological and political work through mass work .  
Treating young officers and solders in the new period , we must understand them with a high period feel and by breaking away from old thinking .  We should see from them their epochal spirit and positive factors , see more of their fine points and less of their shortcomings and see more about the innate character and less from the outside appearance .  Only in this way , can we truly carry out ideological and political work with a definite objective in view .  
The purpose of the " three stresses " education by positive examples conducted at the grass-roots level is to bring into play the role of grass-roots party organizations as fighting bastions and the role of party members as exemplary vanguards , pool together the strength of the vast numbers of officers and men , and provide a strong organizational and ideological safeguards for all-round construction of our grass-roots units and for meeting the requirements of " winning the war " and " preventing degeneration " .  
It is beyond any doubt that we need to study and master professional knowledge and the knowledge of science and technology ; however , we should also see clearly that along with the deepening of modern scientific research and as a result of the increasingly detailed division of labor , we have a greater need for the guidance of advanced ideological theories and a correct world outlook .  
Focusing on and serving this center of economic construction , constantly strengthening and improving the ideological and political work and the building of spiritual civilization to fully display its role of clearing up doubts , remove apprehensions , and inspire spirit can vigorously safeguard and promote the building and development of the socialist material civilization .  
Nevertheless , it should also be noticed that some leading cadres still do not have sufficient understanding about the importance of ideological and political work and that they grasp economic work in a relatively solid way but grasp the ideological and political work and the building of spiritual civilization in a relatively vague way .  
They do not manage nor bother to know those issues affecting the personal interests and feelings of the masses and do not conduct patient and meticulous ideological and political work for giving timely guidance .  Some grass-roots party organizations are in a weak and slack state and do not display the roles they should in the ideological and political work .  
They do not have a comprehensive and scientific understanding about the relationship between economic construction and ideological and political works and do not have sufficient understanding about the importance , urgency , and protracted nature of the ideological and political work .  If this state of affairs is allowed to go on , the guiding position of Marxism will be shaken and the people will lose the correct ideological foundation for jointly forging ahead , ending with ideological confusion .  This is very dangerous .  
We should make full use of these favorable conditions , adhere to the mass line , fulfill the work amid the actual activities of the material and spiritual productions of the masses of the people , let ideological education run through the handling of solid affairs , and guide the masses to enhance their spiritual realm through resolving realistic problems .  
In his speech , Wang Ke pointed out that Chairman Jiang 's major expositions on logistical work , which closely evolve around the national and military conditions and address such basic questions as what logistics should be built and how to develop logistics , represent a new development of Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's military logistical ideology , a scientific summary of logistical work 's features and patterns under a new situation , and a powerful ideological weapon and an action guidebook for military logistical modernization in a new era .  
Specifically , it is necessary to achieve actual effects in correcting the guiding ideology for work and overcoming the formalism , in enhancing the unit 's level of training the military with science and technology , in strengthening the ideological and political building of the unit , and in resolving the hot and difficult issues which have confounded the grass-roots level over a long period of time .  
In his important speech at the central ideological and political work meeting , Comrade Jiang Zemin made a brilliant analysis and profound exposition of the important position , main tasks , guiding ideology , and basic requirements of the party 's ideological and political work in the new period , and major issues that need handling in doing the work , from the height of both international and domestic overall situations .  
The protracted nature of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that it will take a process of considerably long historical struggle to achieve the grand objective of socialist modernization and it is not plain sailing because many difficulties and problems will crop up in the course of our advance .  
The protracted nature of socialist modernization determines that ideological and political work is a measure of fundamental and lasting importance rather than an expedient measure and it is an indispensable task that should be carried out perseveringly and unremittingly .  
The complexity of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that we are improving and developing the self-reform of the socialist system and the world is undergoing a profound change .  Against this background , people 's thinking has become lively ;  
If we lack an adequate understanding of these new complicated situations and problems and a sober understanding of the ever changing situation , our ideological and political work will lose contact with reality and lack a clear aim in view and fighting will .  
The arduousness of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that international and domestic factors are complex and people 's thinking is lively , complex , varied , and constantly changeable from person to person , from matter to matter , and from time to time .  
To study Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , we must get an ever clearer understanding of the requirements of the new situation for ideological and political work , enhance our sense of suffering , not lose sight of the importance of ideological and political work , foster the sense of urgency in doing a good job of the work , see of the protracted nature , complexity , and arduousness of the work , and make adequate mental preparations to carry out the work in the long term .  
In the present information age , there are much more frequent ideological and information exchanges among the people .  This is particularly true in the current situation when the country is further opening up its doors to the outside world .  The influx and convergence of different spiritual and cultural products and different ideas and information through different channels have not only enlivened people 's minds and enriched the cultural market but have set higher demands on ideological and cultural development and on ideological and political work .  
Thus , fully making use of information technology , especially information network technology , to widen the space and channels of ideological and political work and create newer and more effective forms of ideological and political work that meet the characteristics of information exchange by the modern people should be a pressing issue that must be studied and tackled with concentrated efforts .  
We should pay special attention to the use of modern tools of the mass media , such as the press , the radio , the television and the Internet , bring into play their role as the main channel for ideological education , and make continuous efforts to create lively forms that can reach people 's ears , brain and heart .  
Meticulously studying and understanding Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important directive combined with closely adhering to the kernel of education on ideals and convictions form an important guidance in strengthening and improving ideological and political work and in instructing people to set up a common ideal of building up socialism with Chinese characteristics and to establish a scientific view on the world , life values and values .  
Since the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy , many developments have taken place in their spiritual and cultural life and the masses have proposed new demands for spiritual and cultural life .  This requires that we profoundly study the characteristics of the times , have a firm grip on the times , and continuously probe for new forms , methods , means , and mechanisms .  And this is the key to making ideological and political work more purposeful and more inspiring .  
In general , economic issues have been relatively outstanding subjects discussed at G-7 and G-8 summits .  Examples are macroeconomic management , international trade , and relations with developing countries .  Meanwhile , however , the summits have preserved a very clear political and ideological tradition .  
Along with the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy and the development of the socialist market economy , and along with the increase in economic and social contradictions and the increase in different ideological and conceptual problems , corruptive ideas and culture can take advantage and build up .  In addition , the remains of feudal ideas , including feudal superstition and ignorant ideas and concepts that have long been in our society , can arise - - as the popular Chinese saying goes , " dregs float to the surface " .  
All ideological and cultural battlefields , all departments of publicity , culture and education , and all spiritual and cultural products at levels ranging from high to low , should facilitate the spread of advanced culture , publicize scientific theories and mold beautiful souls .  
Meanwhile , military lawyers , as political workers , should consider the ultimate goal of their legal services as one of serving the armed forces ' political and ideological construction and increasing the relevancy and effectiveness of ideological and political work in the new period while performing their professional duties .  
It is necessary to integrate education with management and punishment .  In view of the special feature that the financial sector has more economic crimes than any other sectors and through the establishment of three defensive lines of ideology , system , and law , the financial sector should coordinate its regular ideological education with strict management and its efforts to strictly crack crimes , so as to form an education-management-crackdown structure .  
According to the requirements for improving quality , optimizing structures , and pulling the efforts of both full-time and part-time workers , we should set up a contingent of ideological and political workers who have political integrity , professional ability , a strict sense of discipline , and correct work styles .  
In addition to making great efforts to strengthen ideological and political construction , all military colleges and universities should face modernization , face the world and face the future .  All military colleges and universities should be motivated to update their concepts of education , further update curricular content and methodology , continuously add new aspects to existing theories , knowledge , technology and tactics , and form a curriculum oriented toward the 21st century .  
among the objective environment and major theories and problems of implementation which affect people 's ideological activities , one is the actual situation where the lightning increase in the total quantity of human knowledge and the rapid breakthroughs in modern technology of the " knowledge economy " which has the entire world as its scope have already shown themselves .  
It is a major political advantage of our Party and state.Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech is not only a powerful ideological weapon to strengthen ideological and political construction in the military , but also the fundamental strategy for devoting efforts to doing well the positive " Three Stresses " education in grassroots organizations and for correctly handling the relationship between the education and work .  
It will have a powerful theoretical weapon for developing advanced ideologies and eradicating backward ones , and it will have an ideological basis that is fundamental to the whole Party and people of the whole country in reinforcing unity and in consistently marching forward in the correct direction .  
We must stick to the study trend of associating theory with reality , consistently emancipate thinking and seek truth from facts , and consistently regard scientific theory as the guide .  Regarding currently obvious problems that urgently require theoretical guidance and explanation , we must provide scientific , convincing and realistic explanations and interpretation and make full use of the fundamental role of scientific theory in ideological and political work .  
The thinking of persisting in the " three represents " under the new historical conditions has clearly defined the political direction , political standard , and political requirement for the building of our military ; and is of an extremely important and far-reaching significance to strengthening the party 's ideological leadership , political leadership , and organizational leadership over the military , and to ensuring that our military can forever march forward under the banner of the party and can always retain the nature and the aim of a people 's military .  
and guide the vast numbers of our officers and men to establish a correct outlook on the world , life , and values so that they can always retain the true political color of revolutionary military men .  Third , we should keep to the correct direction , and never waver in upholding the principle that the party should command the gun .  To strengthen the ideological and political building in line with the requirement of " three represents " , the heart of the issue is to uphold the party 's absolute leadership over the military ;  
At the Central Committee Ideological and Political Work Conference , Comrade Jiang Zemin emphasized that , in the face of the new circumstances and new situation , ideological and political work must make efforts to carry out innovation and improvement on a foundation of carrying on and developing superior traditions and in such areas as content , form , method , means , and mechanisms .  In particular , he stressed , efforts must be made to heighten the sense of the times and strengthen direction , effectiveness , and initiative .  
In diligently studying and understanding this important exposition , we have the profound feeling that only by firmly grasping the key points of strengthening and improving ideological and political work and working hard to enhance " one feeling three qualities " can ideological and political work provide formidable impetus and guarantees for reform and opening up and modernization construction in an atmosphere of continuing innovation and expanding advances .  
Each region must pay thorough attention to developing spiritual and cultural products and healthy entertainment activities that have the ability to imperceptibly influence people 's ideological views and moral sentiments so as to allow the masses to achieve enlightenment and mold their sentiments in a relaxed and happy atmosphere .  
The fostering of noble ideology and morals and formation of excellent prevailing social customs must not only rely on patient and meticulous ideological education , it must also rely on scientifically stringent management .  
Many localities give prominence to special characteristics , conduct propaganda to suit local needs , and expand inputs , and have formed certain principal fronts for ideological and political work , including a public opinion front , a training front , and a cultural entertainment front .  
In recent years , the whole party carried out the activities of studying Deng Xiaoping Theory , conducted " three stress " education among cadres at and above the county level , recently studied and propagated Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thesis on " three represents " , and held a central ideological and political work conference not long ago .  All this has given full play to our party 's strong political advantages and effectively guaranteed the guiding position of Marxism in the ideological field .  
In his important speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin enunciated a series of fundamental theoretical and practical issues that have a bearing on the overall situation , gave a new summary to the status of ideological and political work in the overall tasks of the party and the state , and also set forth new requirements .  
He said : The party 's ideological and political work is the lifeblood of economic and all other work , is the central link for uniting the whole party and the entire people of all ethnical groups throughout the country to fulfill all tasks of the party and the state , and is the major political superiority of our party and socialist state .  
We must prevent trouble before it appears , must eliminate the wrong thing as soon as they begin to crop up , must not allow them to spread unchecked or swell viciously , must not allow them to confuse people 's minds and disrupt our overall situation .  Thus , we can lay a solid ideological foundation for achieving the party 's general objective and fulfilling the party 's general tasks in the initial stage of socialism .  
The " opinions " are based on profound research and scientific proof and on repeated discussions and revisions at the all-military conference on ideological and political work that was held not long ago at colleges and universities .  
The most fundamental requirement of these is the explicitly stated task for doing ideological and political construction well at military schools in the new situation .  That is : based on " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " , we should ensure the correct direction to build up high-quality military academies and ensure the objective of fostering high-quality military professionals is realized .  
To make it simple , that is to " ensure the correct direction and to produce skilled students " .  This task is based on basic requirements and the historical mission that Chairman Jiang imposed on military schools for ideological and political construction in the new stage .  
To implement the policy of managing the party strictly , the most fundamental measure is to draw up a set of practical and binding rules and mechanisms to strengthen ideological and institutional construction at the same time , to give full scope to the role of party committees being the leading cores , the role of party branches being the fighting fortresses , and the role of party members being vanguards and models .  
After he assumed the post of executive vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , under the leadership and support of Premier Zhou , he intensified the building of the ministry 's leading body , upheld collective leadership , developed democracy , regularly held meetings on the ministry 's affairs and discussions on ideological guidelines , and instituted a system of daily meeting and timely report of the situation .  
Some comrades have abandoned the Marxist viewpoint on classes and method of class analysis ; they can not see the background to " a world filled with love " or perceive that extremely sharp and complex struggles still exist in the ideological and political field ; and they can not see the conspiracy of hostile western forces to " westernize " and " disintegrate " China .  
With regard to their penetration channels and means , while vigorously intensifying ideological penetration through traditional means such as newspapers , television , and radio , hostile western forces are continually resorting to new methods , and these moreover are becoming more and more concealed and deceptive .  
While persisting in reform and opening up and speeding up exchanges with foreign countries , we must maintain high political vigilance and clear political heads , have a clear understanding of the true features of hostile western forces , lay a firm foundation in ideals and beliefs , build a strong ideological defense line , and win the initiative in the ideological battle .  
By grasping overall and key problems related to the comprehensive building of the grassroots party organizations , we can truly resolve problems in the grassroots party organizations that are of the nature of trends , ensure the effects and quality of " three stresses " education , and successfully achieve marked ideological improvement , marked political progress , marked transformation of work style , marked strengthening of discipline , marked progress in work , marked changes in quality , marked strengthening of the fortress role , and marked improvement in relations between officers and men .  
Seeing the situation clearly , mastering the overall situation , correctly distinguishing between the essentials and the nonessentials , and safeguarding and developing the excellent situation in the ideological and political realm is an important guarantee for continuously pushing forward the reform and opening up and the socialist modernization drive as well as a fundamental requirement for shaping and nurturing a national spirit in the new century .  
Through making efforts over the last 20 years or so , we have eventually opened up a most lively , active , and creative ideological and political situation in the history of our party and country and the ideological level and understanding capability of the masses of people have been greatly increased .  
The progress of the socialist materialist civilization and spiritual civilization has been constantly cleansing the outdated ideas and concepts and the advanced ideological and cultural mentalities like independent mentality , innovative mentality , competitive mentality , open-up mentality , and so on as well as those civilized and progressive social concepts like efficiency concept , effectiveness concepts , and so on which can promote the development of social productive forces have gradually gone deeply into the hearts of the people .  
Relying on the correct understandings which are formed in practice , we can make ideological and theoretical judgment through making objective and cool-headed comparisons under richer and as a matter of course more complicated cultural and theoretical background .  This is an indication of the psychological progress of a nation .  
Along with the development of the social , political , economic , and cultural life , the independent and optional space for people 's ideological activities will become more extensive .  
In contemporary China , the correct and progressive ideological concept under the guidance of Marxism is the main current of the whole social ideology and some wrong and backward concepts running against Marxism are only branch currents .  
In accordance with its peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , and based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence , China did not draw ideological lines but respected the political system which these countries had chosen , rapidly extended diplomatic recognition to those states which emerged as independent from the former Soviet Union , and established diplomatic relations with them .  
Since the beginning of the new stage , especially since the 14th National Party Congress , and facing the complex international situation and profound social change , our military can live through all tests with ideological and political education serving as an important guarantee .  
These changes will exert an extensive , profound and comprehensive influence on the military 's thinking , and challenge ideological and political education in fundamental and temporal ways .  
Through military training , students have enhanced concept of national defense and sense of organization and discipline , raised their ideological and political consciousness , received education on patriotism and collectivism , promoted their all-round development of morality , intelligence , and physique , and laid down a firm ideological and political foundation for becoming a generation of new people with lofty ideals , moral integrity , education and a sense of discipline .  Military training of students has cultivated high quality reserve people for national defense .  
And as to making our civil air defense organs " quasi-militarized " , we need to intensify civil air defense organ building .  Through constant building , we need to turn our civil air defense organs at all levels in the entire northeast China region into " quasi-militarized " administrative organs with political and ideological firmness , strong and effective unity , excellent professional skills , efficient organizational command , honest and clean administration , and a good administrative climate .  
According to the developing or changing situation , especially the complicated struggle going on in the ideological field , and in view of salient problems affecting the quality and effects of education , we should lay special stress on and adhere to such principles as educating people in Marxism , combining the advanced nature of the overall requirements with the level of specific work , being good at drawing on and acting in a spirit reflecting the progress of the times , and always focusing our attention on solving problems .  
At the central conference on ideological and political work , Chairman Jiang clearly pointed out : " On the basis of inheriting and carrying forward the fine traditions , we must strive to innovate in and improve the contents , forms , methods , means , mechanisms , and other aspects of our ideological and political work ; we must especially increase the purposefulness and practical results of this work and enhance our initiative in this regard .  
They felt : In the new century , changes will continue to take place in the international environment and the international political struggle , the practice of socialist reform will develop in depth in our country , and an unprecedentedly complicated situation will appear in the social ideological field .  The diversification of socioeconomic elements , organizational forms , material benefits , and ways of employment will influence officers and men deeply , on all sides , and in a long-term way .  
Whether or not we can uphold democratic centralism , regularly and consciously take up the weapon of criticism and self-criticism , and unfold active and healthy ideological struggle represent an important yardstick for measuring whether a leadership group is strong and effective and whether a leading cadre is truly upright .  
With the ideological and political quality of the party rank and file and party cadres being enhanced , they will have a strong sense of fighting against corruption and keeping themselves clean and honest in performing official duties .  This will not only eliminate the root cause that engenders corruption , but will also make it hard for corrupt elements to cover up their malpractices .  
As far as party building is concerned , while ensuring the party 's leading status , how are we going to further perfect the party 's leadership , truly enhance the ideological and political quality of our cadres at all levels , ensure that our party is always the " loyal representative in three aspects " , and effectively curb the corrosive influence of corrupt phenomena on our party 's ranks of cadres ?  
Therefore , it is necessary to further strengthen and improve the work of controlling the political and ideological conditions of the cadres .  In particular , it is necessary to set up concrete procedures and work out concrete standards and methods for assessing the political and ideological quality of a cadre .  The conclusion of the assessment should also be more specific and detailed .  
Since the implementation of the " Ninth Five-Year " Plan , we have scored glorious achievements in promoting spiritual civilization , while attaining tremendous successes in developing material civilization .  All this has provided a gigantic spiritual motive force and a strong ideological guarantee for the development of the reform and opening-up program and the socialist modernization drive .  
They have brought into full play the exemplary role of the advanced models well in all fields of social life and among various mass groups .  They have vigorously given full scope to healthy tendencies in society and created a fine general mood to respect the advanced and vie with each other to become the advanced .  They have also given a powerful ideological guarantee and intellectual support to creating a fine atmosphere in society for the development of the reform and opening-up program and the socialist modernization drive .  
The " opinion " also proposes explicit requirements on solutions to many realistic problems in ideological and political construction throughout military academies and universities .  These five documents were formulated in accordance with the " Opinion " on the basis of extensive investigation and study , sufficient solicitation of opinions from every field and repeated study and proof .  They are targeted and practical .  
All level of party organizations of the armed forces brought into play their roles as the core of leadership and fighting bastions while the broad masses of communist party members acted as exemplary vanguards .  Through forceful ideological and political work , these party organizations imbued all commanders and fighters with party policy decisions and instructions .  
At the Party Central Committee 's conference on ideological and political work , Comrade Jiang Zemin noted that , " to do the ideological and political work well in the new period , we must profoundly analyze both the objective environment and the characteristics of the thinking of the larger number of cadres and the masses in the new situation from international , domestic , historical and realistic perspectives .  We must correctly examine and solve significant problems in both theory and reality that are influential to the thinking of cadres and the masses .  
This important directive was made from a long-term and broad perspective , through both dialectical materialism and historical materialism , and with an eye on the requirements for the development of the times .  This directive has set the direction for strengthening and improving ideological and political work in the new period .  
Selecting officers from the grassroots with both working abilities , moral integrity and outstanding political achievements and placing them in correct posts is an important guide in stimulating the enthusiasm of grassroots cadres in making achievements and strengthening the ideological stability of grassroots units .  Stimulating their enthusiasm merely by promotion and position transfer is not only unrealistic , however , but also can not root out problems .  If the right cadre as the proper exemplary figure is promoted , this promotion will stimulate the enthusiasm of a large number of cadres .  
In the course of advancing their work in the key fields , trade unions at all levels actively assisted the party organizations and the local governments in doing effective ideological and political work among the working masses , carried out " economic and technical innovation projects " among the working masses , organized and guided workers to enhance their work skills , learn from the advanced , do a first-class job , and make greater contributions .  All this played a positive role in the course of fulfilling the across-the-board tasks of the party and the state .  
During this centralized education , Party members and cadres in grassroots units meticulously studied the important thinking of the " three represents , " touched on and solved some problems that are incongruous with the needs of the Party 's advanced nature , improved their ideological conscientiousness , and inspired their revolutionary will to fight .  
The second generation of the Party leadership with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at its core as well as the third generation of the Party leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core restored , upheld and advanced the ideological line of " emancipate one 's thinking , be practical and realistic " , and led the entire party and the entire Chinese people in concentrating efforts on reforms and opening to the outside world , such that China has been seeing miraculous economic and social growth .  
To this end , those engaged in ideological and political work must study and apply Marxism 's materialist dialectics .  They must use the " Three Represents " and other theoretical innovations of our Party . They must penetrate phenomena and see their basic nature , differentiate primary from secondary , and grasp the overall situation .  They must not make a tempest in a teapot because problems appear , nor must they allow matters to go unchecked .  They must analyze objectively , and actively seek countermeasures .  
The emergence of key and difficult problems makes some new demands on the organizational structure , the internal division of effort , the means and methods , and the scope of application of ideological and political work , and in the mutual relationships among these things .  How to draw new boundaries and achieve new standardization of these things , and make them form up an integrated whole which is full of vitality , is an important aspect of strengthening and improving ideological and political work in the new situation .  
The openness of society will inevitably bring about ideological and cultural diversification .  While people are receiving positive and progressive ideas and conceptions , they are also exposed to the influence of backward and decadent things .  The complex situation in the realm of ideology and culture in society , where the good and the bad exist side by side , brings about a multi-tiered and diversified feature in people 's mental pursuits and values .  
While failing to achieve their purpose , they began to change their strategies .  While maintaining their economic , political , and military pressure , they shifted the focus onto making ideological infiltration against the socialist countries and took this as an important means of pursuing their " peaceful evolution " strategy .  
Such infiltration is not limited to the ideological and cultural fields , but has also be extended to the economic , political , military , scientific , and technological fields .  In their exchanges with us , they also brought ideological things along with them .  
Theory , journalism , publications , literature , and arts are all important ideological and public opinion positions .  We should continuously create and produce good cultural products being favorable to social progress and being beneficial to people 's physical and mental health .  We should boost healthy public conduct in society and develop a progressive spirit of our times , advocate a healthy and civilized lifestyle , resist all reactionary , decadent , and backward ideological and cultural dregs .  
The military should reinforce Party-building in the military according to the requirements of the " three represents " and strengthen ideological and political construction in light of the assurance of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption . "  The military should be ready for military struggles with the military strategic principle in the new period as the guideline , profoundly study characteristics and rules regarding not only the military administration in the new situation but also high-tech regional wars , improve leadership skills and devote efforts to solid implementation .  
Centered on establishing the correct world view , view of life and values , we must combine inheriting the fine traditions with promoting the spirit of the age , integrate respect for the legitimate rights of the individual with shouldering social responsibilities , coordinate attention to efficiency with upholding social fairness , combine progressive demands with broad demands , and make efforts to form healthy , harmonious , and upwardly progressive ideological and ethical standards commensurate with economic and social development .  
The pro-Taiwan forces in the United States , who have called themselves " the blue unit , " have also advanced quite a few political propositions marked by strong ideological colors , and this has undermined the US-China relations ' healthy development and has frequently contravened the US strategic interests as well .  
The Mormon Church , for instance , boasts of 4.6-million followers .  Evil cults have their own characteristics : authoritative leader , anti-social mode of actions , absolute loyalty to chieftains and to the group one belongs , consciousness of being persecuted , mysterious and secret internal organization , arbitrary self-advertisement , exclusiveness , strict discipline , ideological control and manipulation of fellow believers , compelled service and preaching activities .  
The new situation and arduous tasks require that we must regard vigorously disseminating and promoting the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career as an important task of the current ideological and political construction , and devote efforts to carrying out this task in a persistent and effective manner .  
Not only has it been innovative in adopting new ideological concepts and modes of thinking in carrying out its domestic construction , it has also changed the isolationism of its past foreign policy , enthusiastically taking the initiative in developing relations with various countries .  
Western countries headed by the United States always draw an ideological line by only recognizing western value standards and human rights concepts , and they want every country to completely copy their ways , irrespective of their historical traditions and level of social and economic development .  This has already caused social turmoil and even war in certain African countries .  
The five kinds of spirit proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin are a new development and summation of various kinds of lofty spirit that have emerged in a long process of the party 's cause of uniting with and fighting together with the people .  They have carried forward and nurtured our national spirit .  They have a rich ideological content and distinct characteristics of the times .  
We must persist in the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences and being understanding and tolerant , we can not regard personal problems as organizational issues , we can not treat cognitive issues as political issues , and we should not create a tense atmosphere only because certain isolated cases of erroneous ideological and political views arise .  
Party committees , political institutions and leaders at all levels should profoundly and satisfactorily do this ideological and political work , guiding retired cadres to think from a strategic perspective of the reforming , dynamic and stable overall situation of the country and the military construction .  
Firm ideals and convictions are the ideological basis of assuring our revolutionary military professionals are politically qualified and maintaining their essential qualities and the spiritual backbone and resources for these professionals to live through tests , overcome difficulties and make achievements in their careers .  
In promoting the campaign to learn from Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun in the new century , young military professionals must keep our military 's fundamental duty firmly in mind , vigorously promote and develop the " five-point spirits " of struggling with persistent efforts , create endurable ideological styles and acquire competent qualities for " winning wars " through completing ordinary tasks in grassroots construction , through hard work and hardship and through tests of life or death .  
The good situation has been pioneered by the people of the whole country under the leadership of the party .  The ideological and political foundation , the material and technical foundation , and the mass foundation , that we have already possessed to realize the three major historical tasks in the new situation , have been laid by the people of the whole country under the leadership of the party .  
Thereby , the key to consolidating and developing the current gratifying situation , realizing objectives in the Outline of the 10th Five-Year Plan , and fulfilling the three major historical tasks in the new century hinges on further implementing the important thinking of the " three represents " as put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin . Besides , the party should achieve its ideological and organizational construction , improve its work styles , and ceaselessly improve its leadership , its ruling level , and its capability of resisting corruption and preventing peaceful evolution .  
Deputy Chi Haotian pointed out that great achievements were recorded in modernizing national defense and the armed forces during the Ninth FYP .  In the face of the complex situation at home and abroad , our army held aloft the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , and resolutely obeyed the commands of the CPC Central Committee and CMC with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core ; ideological and political building was further stepped up ;  
We should profoundly understand the great significance of studying , and practicing the important thinking on " three represents " from the level of " the foundation of building the party , the basis of ruling the country , and the source of strength , " vigorously step up ideological and political building , and ensure that the important thinking on " three represents " is truly implemented in building national defense and the armed forces .  
We must focus on maintaining the party 's advanced nature , cohesion , and combat strength , vigorously strengthen the ideological , work style , organizational , and disciplinary building of the party in the armed forces , promote healthy practices , oppose unhealthy practices , guard against lax organization and discipline and the growth and spread of corruption , resolutely overcome formalism and bureaucratism , and build the party organizations at all levels into combat collectives able to withstand severe tests .  
maintain sharp vigilance against the attempts of " westernization " and " disintegration " made by western hostile forces , and against the infiltration and erosion of such erroneous ideological trends as " the non-party affiliation of the army " ; resolutely resist the corrosive influence and the attacks of decadent ideologies and cultures ; and firmly defend the authority of the party 's leading collective of the third generation with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core .  
To implement the Tenth Five-Year Plan , we must work hard to improve the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the entire population in the forward direction of an advanced culture , adhere to the idea of " tackling with both hands , both hands hard , " combine the rule of law with the rule of morality , and vigorously push ahead with the building of a socialist spiritual civilization . 
It is necessary to firmly establish the idea of strengthening grass-roots units by science and technology and prospering grass-roots units by talented people .  While improving the ideological and political , military professional , and physical and psychological qualities , efforts should be made to improve their scientific and technological quality .  
The building of national defense is an important part of the great cause of the party and the country and various sectors have attached great importance to it .  Politically speaking , it is in a high and glorious position .  Besides , it is guaranteed with powerful ideological and political work and the conditions for political life is favorable .  
The second contradiction is that in the process of international interactions in the post-Cold War era , international contradictions and conflicts may lead to the formation of the current of thought of radical nationalism which will get combined with leftist speech because of the existence of a large amount of leftist speech in China 's traditional ideological resources , resulting in the undermining of balanced development of pluralist intellectual differentiation and , eventually , affecting the democratic process . 
We should penetratingly study the contents , forms , methods , means , and mechanisms for doing the ideological and political work well in the current situation , study how to enhance the period feel of our ideological and political work , set more definite aims for it in order to achieve more actual results , and better play the enormous role of ideological and political work in clarifying people 's hazy understanding , distinguishing right from wrong , fostering firm ideal and faith , strengthening confidence in forging ahead , and propelling reform and construction .  
We must uphold the guideline of grasping things with both hands , with both hands firm , combine ruling the country according to law with ruling the country with ethics , follow the orientation for progress of advanced culture , and make efforts to enhance the ideological and moral standard and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation .  
This is certainly not saying something frightening just to scare people .  In doing a good job in rural work , we must not only depend on correct theory , line , guidelines , and policies , but also on a rural grassroots cadre contingent of a quality capable of withstanding severe tests , with good ideological and work style , and genuinely bent on pursuing the masses ' interests .  
and further enhance the quality of rural grassroots cadres and strengthen the cohesion and combat strength of the rural grassroots party organizations , so as to provide strong and effective ideological and organizational guarantee for making a success of agriculture and rural work .  In carrying out this work it is essential to strictly act in accordance with the principles , methods , and measures laid down by the central authorities , and pay particular attention to getting a good grasp of the following issues .  
Over the past 100 years , the world underwent untold tribulations caused bywars , diseases , hunger , crises , and disasters ; but more importantly , the peopleof various countries carried out momentous social and natural struggles on amagnificent scale , and thus made unprecedented progress in the political , economic , ideological , cultural , scientific , technological , education , military , and medical aspects .  
At present , the mutual stirring of various cultural and ideological trends on a worldwide scale , the mingling of progressive and backward concepts , the increasing diversification of people 's orientations of value , moral concepts , and cultural choices and , in particular , the infiltration and offensives of the Western hostile forces against us , such as " Westernization " and " disintegration , " have made the contradiction and struggle in the ideological field more and more acute and complicated .  
It is necessary , in line with the requirements of maintaining the advanced nature , to vigorously step up ideological and political building , constantly enhance our steadfastness and consciousness in carrying out the party 's line , principles , and policies , energetically endorse and support reform , subordinate ourselves to and serve the overall interests of the state 's economic construction , conscientiously fulfill the fundamental functions of the armed forces , ensure unimpeded implementation of military orders , and provide a powerful security guarantee for the state 's reform , development , and stability .  
It is necessary , in line with the requirement of maintaining the advanced nature , to vigorously step up the building of our ranks , constantly improve the ideological and political quality , the scientific and cultural level , and the professional skills of party-member cadres , and train and bring up a contingent of high-quality party-member cadres .  
They should unite more closely around the party CentralCommittee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner ofDeng Xiaoping Theory , seriously implement the important thinking of " threerepresents , " strengthen the party building and improve the ideological andpolitical levels of the military , and provide a powerful spiritual motivationand reliable political guarantee for " winning in wars " and " neverdegenerating . "  
While instituting and developing a socialist legal system suited to the socialist market economy , we need to institute a moral system commensurate with it , and be good at merging the basic , important moral requirements into relevant laws and regulations and into various kinds of management in society , so as to ceaselessly promote the formation and perfection of the socialist ideological and ethical system .  
Second , greater efforts should be made to enhance the ideological and political quality of the new party members , education should be given to female activists who are striving to join the party .  According to the relevant stipulations for party member recruitment , concentrated training should be given to activists striving to join the party .  They should be organized to study the party constitution and the basic knowledge about the party so that they can adopt a correct ideal and belief and set aright the motivation of joining the party .  
Our military has made noticeable achievements in these efforts , but we should understand that , as sources of military professionals have been continuously changing and we are facing complex circumstances and vital struggles , unswervingly adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership of the military and using this military spirit to unite officers and soldiers , is still a significant and serious topic for our military 's ideological and political construction in the new situation .  
In light of the security work situation in the unit , the army unit party committee has conducted defense safety education with a specific problem in mind .  In the course of the education , both officers and men are guided to foster the idea of placing national defense interests above everything else , resist the temptation of money and material interests , think of danger in times of peace , take preventive measures , strive to be extremely careful in security work , and thus set up an ideological defense line .  
Second , new progress was made in the work of training and educating young cadres .  Through theoretical training , practical exercise , and routine education and management , the ideological and political quality of the young cadres was enhanced , and their ability to do organizational work and exercise leadership was also enhanced .  
Zeng Qinghong pointed out : In commanding various rural work with the important thinking of " three represents , " we must devote major efforts to advancing the building of socialist spiritual civilization , democracy , and the legal system and safeguarding social stability in the countryside to provide an ideological guarantee and good sociopolitical environment for rural economic and social development .  
They should also emulate Wang Wei 's lofty ideological character of making selfless dedication , loving and respecting his work , disregarding personal gains and loses , and being indifferent to fame and profit so that they will be able to take the initiative to subordinate themselves to and serve the cardinal needs of reform and construction , cultivate a fine moral character , establish a lofty goal of life , and maintain the unchangeable integrity of revolutionary military personnel .  
We must strengthen our building of leadership teams , keep our objectives firmly in mind , strengthen Party spirit , consider the situation as a whole , unite closely , fulfill promises , strive to implement the Party line , have an effective and strong ideological level , political awareness and professional capability , building a strong leadership collective capable of bearing its historical responsibility .  
It is reported that running in-depth education study classes are mainly aimed at meeting the needs of giving additional knowledge to former " Falungong " practitioners who have basically been reformed through persuasion , changing their mode of thinking , and exploring a law governing ideological and political work in the new age .  
The large body of young writers keep in step with the times , pay close attention to reality , engage themselves in the practices of the masses , devote themselves to literary creation , present numerous excellent works with both the flavor of the times and historical substance , as well as with definite ideological depth and artistic appeal .  
We must introduce more excellent ideological and artistic work , encourage better scenes that are positive and forward-looking as well as healthy and beneficial , and produce more good literary writings that are to the point and clear , as well as drive out evil and usher in good .  
In light of the many and heavy tasks faced by brigades and regiments , their Party committee secretaries should pay special attention to observing and analyzing the situation from the political perspective , adhere to the correct direction of military construction , give top priority to ideological administration and education .  They should rely on correct education and instruction to assure that the military is under the Party 's effective control and rely on the powerful spiritual backbone to unite military professionals and inspire their fighting spirit .  
Party committee secretaries should take the lead in studying and understanding the major contents of this opinion , straighten out the main theme of their work , and firmly stick to ideological and political education , the key to their work .  In this way , they can pool effort , coordinate relationships between different sectors and tasks and advance the overall situation of military construction .  
On the one hand , this reflects the serious harm created when " Falungong " followers practice spirit control .  On the other hand , it reflects the results of relaxed education , including correct ideological and scientific education , not interfering with feudal ignorance , and the spreading of backward and corrupt things .  
the spirit of pressing forward in the face of difficulties indomitably and relentlessly , the spirit of working hard and seeking solid results , and the spirit of being indifferent to fame and fortune and making selfless contributions ; continuously enhance their moral and ideological quality and their scientific , cultural , and technological quality ; and strive to become workers with a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good education , and a sense of discipline .  
You should make efforts to ensure that you have fine ideological and political qualities and also scientific and cultural ability that can withstand severe tests ; you should have both strong physique and sound minds .  
[ passage omitted ] In the 10 years beginning in 2001 , based on their yearning for an American century , extreme rightwing American politicians , tycoons , the military industrial complex , the media , and its ideological wildness will wallow together in the mire , and unscrupulously stir up the " theory of the China threat " ; in coordination with a psychological offensive , they will carry out a new " physical offensive . "  
The propaganda and ideological front must center closely on the theme of celebrations defined by the central authorities ; firmly grasp the correction orientation ; loudly chorus the main theme of the Communist Party , socialism , and the drive of reform and opening up being good ; vigorously create a rich and dense atmosphere of loving the party , loving the motherland , and loving socialism ;  
This professional contingent of helpers and educators are required to hold themselves responsible for the party and the people , enjoy a profound understanding of policy as well as a fairly high theoretical level , have an intimate knowledge of the harms of the evil cult , understand the mentality of " Falungong " practitioners , and are good at doing a patient and painstaking ideological and political work .  
18 percent felt that fierce political fighting led to weakening economic competitiveness ; 15 percent attributed it to the authorities ' ideological command and inability to take proper steps ; and 6 percent felt that people have not put in sufficient efforts .  
and how to implement General Secretary Jiang 's principle of dunning the country by virtue , satisfactorily unify efforts to run the army according to law with efforts to step up ideological and moral education among officers and men and , while enhancing the legal system concept and moral quality of officers and men , enhance the management level of army units , raise the consciousness of officers and men in loving the army , learning military skills , and strictly observing discipline , and so on .  
Therefore , correctly understanding and mastering the relationship between common characters and individual characters , fully understanding the protracted nature , complexity , and importance of the ethnic and religious issues , upholding the ideological line of seeking truth from facts , and proceeding from the actual conditions in Tibet in doing everything are important principles which must be mastered in doing work well .  
do a better job in the ideological and political work , the organizational work , the propaganda work , and the mass work under the present new situation ; resolutely eliminate such social malignant tumors as the " Falungong " ; and resolutely dump all the social garbage that runs counter to the development direction of advanced productive forces and advanced cultures , and that sets itself against the fundamental interests of the masses of the people .  
Particularly since the Third Central Forum on Work in Tibet , the region has taken the initiative in launching offensive and sought both a permanent cure and a temporary solution to the separatist problem .  The in-depth anti-separatist struggle in the political , ideological , educational , and cultural fields has dealt a crashing blow to all kinds of separatist activities , reversed the passive situation , and retaken the initiative .  As a result , basic stability of Tibet 's social and political situation has been maintained for a fairly long period .  
It is the ideological foundation and spiritual motive force inspiring people of different ethnic backgrounds in the whole region to fight bravely in unity .  It is a powerful ideological weapon enabling us to know and transform the world .  We must always uphold it without wavering .  
At present , every locality , on the basis of summing-up and applying successful experiences , is further implementing the demands of " three represents " for the construction of party grassroots organizations , making efforts to heighten the focus and fighting force of the rural grassroots organizations , comprehensively enhancing the overall quality of rural grassroots cadres , and providing solid and forceful ideological and organizational guarantees so that good work can be done on agricultural and rural tasks under the new conditions that confront us .  
During the initial days of reform , due to the heavy shackles of the " Left " thinking , reform met with strong obstruction .  In view of such a situation , the party 's leading collective of the second generation with Deng Xiaoping at the core successfully clarified confusions and brought things back to order in the political and ideological field , stood up to pressure , and removed all obstacles ; as a result , the ship of reform set sail smoothly .  
The basic theories , basic line , and basic program established by the party have provided an important ideological and theoretical weapon for our settlement of these problems ; the constantly enhanced bearing capacity of the vast numbers of masses in society has provided a more favorable social environment for our settlement of these problems ;  
All military forces profoundly carried out and implemented the important strategy of administering the military according to the law , through which they have further raised their level of making decisions , administering the military , managing military training and managing soldiers all according to the law and have effectively accelerated ideological and political construction and the comprehensive construction of the military .  
We have also emphasized that since the party 's leadership means ideological , political and organizational leadership , party committees must bring into play their role in assuming overall responsibility and coordinating the work of different quarters and make the decisionmaking process more scientific and democratic .  
We should closely associate with the domestic and international situation , military construction and the ideological reality of every individual person .  We should inspect ourselves in accordance with the requirements of the " three represents " , profoundly consider and effectively understand the essence and internal relations of the " three represents " .  We must thoroughly understand the historical background and the era-oriented significance of the " three represents " .  
We should not only be aware of the significant development and the significant contributions , but also profoundly understand the substantial significance for the practice and the guiding role .  In this way , we can comprehensively and accurately master the ideological and theoretical system and lay down a solid theoretical and ideological foundation for Party members to conscientiously put their advanced nature into practice .  
Marxism is our guiding ideology on building our party and state , the guide to actions in all our work , the ideological foundation and spiritual motive force pushing people of all nationalities of the entire country to fight for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation through concerted efforts , and also a powerful ideological weapon for our efforts to understand the world and to reform the objective world and subjective world .  
The dominant position of public ownership , the nature of state power of people 's democracy , and the CPC 's ruling position have determined that the ideological reflection of such economic and political relationships can only be the use of Marxism as the party 's and the state 's guiding ideology .  
From the very beginning , the party openly and explicitly regarded the most beautiful ideal of human beings - socialist society and communist society - as its objective for struggle , employed Marxism as an ideological weapon to sharply observe and analyze issues regarding China , united a large number of advanced people that excel at dedicating themselves to , and deeply went among the workers and the farmers to do the masses ' work .  
On the basis of meticulously reviewing the positive and negative experiences , recollecting its courage and confidence and correcting its mistakes , the party established and adhered to the ideological line of seeking the truth from facts , gradually understood the practical situation of China , created a road of " circling cities with rural areas and taking over political power through arms " ? which suited the Chinese practical situation and won the victory of a modern national democratic revolution .  
When practical problems faced by the masses are solved , their ideological problems will be solved immediately .  The majority of officers and soldiers will have a stronger conviction in firmly trusting the party , loving the party and being firm in following the party .  In this way , our planned objective of promoting the educational campaign to study and practice the important thinking of the " three represents " and maintain the advanced nature of party members will be realized .  
It is particularly necessary to enhance moral education , and conduct patriotic , collectivist , and socialist education for secondary and elementary school students , conduct education in the fine tradition of the Chinese nation , revolutionary tradition , and national defense , and enhance ideological and moral education .  
In carrying out ideological and political education in the military , it is necessary to focus on the reality of the primate phase of socialism and the objective existence of the socialist market economy , to be responsive to society 's diversified development , to grasp the mainstream and essence , and to work hard to utilize , incorporate , exploit , and develop positive factors .  
In carrying out ideological and political education , the military must adhere to the main melody , vigorously advocate patriotism , collectivism , and the spirit of sacrifice , adhere to the purpose of serving the people whole-heartedly , adhere to principles of materialism , resolutely fight against idealism and feudal superstitions as well as decadent bourgeois lifestyles and various erroneous currents of thought and phenomena .  
Therefore , in carrying out ideological and political education , the military should focus on characteristics and special features , in the process of developing or discarding ideas or ethical standards existing in society in a pluralistic context .  
In carrying out ideological and political education in the military , it is necessary to implement the strategic policy for the new period and to closely center on the requirements of military struggle , working to provide sustained , adequate spiritual motive force for " being able to win " .  
To aim ideological and political education at the war time , it is first of all necessary to intensify education on war-readiness in response to the prevailing situation to guide officers and soldiers , so that they will profoundly understand the importance and urgency of getting prepared for military struggle and educating officers and soldiers to make them understand that hegemonism is now rampant , that " Taiwan independence " forces are increasingly rampant , that there has been a continual tension at the Taiwan Strait , and that there are increasing uncertainties about " peaceful unification " .  
Examining ourselves , after over 50 years of development , especially since the 20 years of reform and opening up , we have the important ideological and political basis for basically realizing modernization , material and technical bases , as well as mass basis by the middle of this century , and the vigorous and rapidly developing socialist cause with Chinese characteristics .  
Mao Zedong 's thinking on the untied front , Deng Xiaoping 's theory on the united front in the new period , and the theses of the party 's third-generation leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core on the united front provide the powerful ideological weapons for guiding the triumphant advanced of the united front .  
Faced with the complex internal and external situation and the glorious mission that we shoulder , in order to meet the challenges on our way ahead , undergo the tests of various dangers and difficulties that may occur , and continually create a new situation in developing the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , we must stand in the forefront of the era , continually step up and improve our own building , and make efforts to raise the ideological , organization , and work style building of the party to a new level .  
Jiang Zemin inspected the building on 16 June . He exhorted the responsible comrades concerned to do a good job in building and managing the hall , turn it into an important window for imparting scientific thinking , spirit , knowledge , and methods , and make it play a positive role in enhancing the masses ' ideological and ethical qualities and scientific and cultural qualities .  
There are differences between countries in their social systems , ideological thinking , perceptions of values , and religious beliefs ; therefore , in international relations , we should strictly observe the basic principles of mutually respecting each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality , mutual benefits , and peaceful coexistence .  
The statement says that " in the past year , Lee Teng-hui has retired , but has continued to frequently make use of provincial sentiments to create ideological confrontation to satisfy his personal political desires in his attempt to bring about a complete split of the country .  This really has made us Chinese abroad feel angry . "  
In order to score even greater victories , we must uphold the basic line of the Party , further unify the thinking of the comrades of the whole Party on the major policy decision made by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , consciously maintain a high degree of ideological and political consistency with the Party Central Committee , and coagulate the strength of the people of all nationalities of the whole country around the magnificent objective of realizing the socialist modernization construction .  
These works containing tens of millions of characters have embodied in a concentrated way the two major theoretical achievements of the integration of the Marxist basic tenets with the specific realities in China - - the essence of Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory , and they are the most precious ideological wealth of the whole party .  
Especially since the beginning of the 1990 ' s , with the continuous progress of the domestic and international situation and the magnificent cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the central leadership collective of the party with Jiang Zemin as the core has adhered to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , and made new explorations in practice and a new summarization in theory of many major economic , political , cultural , military , and diplomatic issues , thus enriching and developing Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
The important thinking of the " three represents " is beneficial for China in the 21st century , in strengthening the ideological education of cadres , consistently moving the advanced nature of Party members forward , and in enabling reform , opening up and modernization construction , particularly in operating a market economic mechanism so that we can develop healthily along the socialist road .  
As long as our Party regards Marxism , Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guiding principle , uses the important thinking of the " three represents " to strengthen its ideological armament and effectively carry out correct lines , strategies and policies issued by the Party since the Third Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party , our Party will forever stand in an invincible position and our socialist system will be stable and safe in the long run .  
Cadres of naval and air forces have organized for party members and cadres , in light of the six-point requirements proposed by the General Department of Politics on maintaining the advanced nature of party members , to identify their weaknesses in ideological and political qualities and scientific , technological and cultural abilities , and strengthen the military 's sense of the urgency and responsibilities for advancing the military construction .  
A division of Jinan Military Area Command regarded strengthening the leadership over ideological and political work as an important responsibility of party committees .  In light of the rapid development in the international and domestic situations as well as with frequent occurrence of crucial issues , this division promptly analyzed the ideological trend of the military , and adhered to the system according to which leading cadres give reports on the situation , answer questions that officers and soldiers are generally concerned about and use decisions made by the party Central Committee to unite thinking .  
Liu Yunshan said : In various historical periods in which the CPC leads revolution , construction and reform , its propaganda and ideological work plays a very important role in disseminating the scientific truth , promoting the integration of Marxism with the practical reality in China , uniting with , mobilizing and rallying the masses , fulfilling historical tasks in various periods , advocating advanced moral practice and scientific and civilized way of life , and improving the ideological , moral , scientific and cultural quality of the whole nation .  
He has repeatedly pointed out : Our propaganda and ideological front is a very important front because it concerns the overall situation of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  We should persist in arming people with scientific theories , guiding people with correct public opinions , molding people with a noble spirit and encouraging people with outstanding art and literature works .  
New interpersonal relationships and healthy , scientific and civilized way of life are taking shape .  The strengthening of our ideological and moral building has become our powerful political advantage that enables our party to lead the people to overcome various kinds of difficulties and dangers .  It has become an important spiritual force that enables us to seize the opportunities , speed up development and promote all-round progress of the society .  
We should persist in sticking to the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , vigorously bring about our prosperous socialist culture and make efforts to provide our reform , opening up and modernization with a powerful spiritual motive power and ideological guarantee .  
Zheng Bijian said that in studying and understanding the important explication of " three represents , " it is imperative for us to further focus our understanding and actions on the issue of the advanced nature of the party and on the question of how the party , beginning from ideological building , organizational building , work-style building , and system building , can build itself into a genuine Marxist ruling party that always stays ahead of the trend of the times and that are completely consolidated ideologically , politically , and organizationally .  
independent culture ? to change the cultural identity of the Taiwan compatriots and then their national and state identities , eliminate their sense of belonging to the Chinese nation , undermine the basis of peaceful reunification between the two sides of the strait , and create an ideological and social basis for realizing their separatist plot . 
At this moment commemorating the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China , we should meticulously study these important expositions , in light of the Party 's glorious history , solve problems by uniting reality with history and combining perspectives with reasoning , genuinely base socialist conviction on a solid ideological and theoretical foundation and transform praises of socialism to a self-mobilized advancement of the great cause of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the 21st century .  
To raise the ideological and ethical standards and scientific and cultural levels of the workers , peasants , intellectuals , and other laboring people and the entire population and improve their work skills and creativity and give full scope to their enthusiasm , initiative , and creative power - - these should remain the tasks of primary importance that our party should perform in representing China 's advanced productive forces .  
To make our party represent the direction of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must make its theory , line , programs , principles , policies , and all its work reflect the requirements of the national , scientific , and popular socialist culture that develops toward modernization , the world , and the future , and enable them to upgrade the ideological and ethical quality and scientific and cultural quality of the whole nation and to provide spiritual impetus and intellectual support for China 's economic development and social progress .  
Strengthening socialist ideological and ethical building constitutes the essential content of and a key link in developing China 's advanced culture .  
In order to forever represent the orientation of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must make the party 's theory , line , program , principles , policies and all its work reflect the requirements of the national , scientific and popular socialist culture that develops toward modernization , the world and the future ; enable them to upgrade the ideological and ethical qualities and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation and to provide the motive power and support culturally and intellectually .  
All comrades in the party should set up a lofty communist ideal , fortify their conviction and spur themselves on by holding to lofty ideological and moral standards .  More importantly , they should make unremitting efforts in a down-to-earth manner to realize the party 's basic program for the current stage and put their heart into each single piece of work now .  
In conducting their respective theoretical study , ideological and political education , and political theory course teaching , the central study groups of party committees , armed forces , and military academies and schools must allot special time to organize the study of General Secretary Jiang 's important speech and properly unify the thinking and understanding of officers and soldiers on major issues so that they will willingly maintain a high degree of ideological and political unity with the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
Through development of more than 50 years , especially in the development of reform and opening up during the past two decades , China has established important ideological and political foundation and possessed a material , technological and human resource foundation for achieving the main modernization by the middle of this century .  
The participating comrades unanimously held that , showing great foresight and having far-reaching significance , General Secretary Jiang Zemin speech is a brilliant Marxist document and a political manifesto of the Chinese communists facing the 21st century .  It has strong political , theoretical , ideological , and strategic nature and is highly relevant .  
At today 's forum of the General Armament Party Secretariat , Cao Gangchuan , member of the Central Military Commission ( CMC ) and Director of the PLA General Armament Department , pointed out that General Secretary Jiang 's major address commemorating the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Party is a Marxist programmatic document , a new and glorious procedural scientific guide for overall advancement of building the Party under the new circumstances , and a great ideological weapon for guiding the entire Party in the new situation of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
They said : In his speech , Jiang Zemin made a new theoretical summary of the party 's nature , fundamental aim , guiding principle , historical mission , and progressiveness ; and clearly set forth demands in carrying through the party 's ideological line , organizational line , and work line , and in carrying forward the party 's good traditions and work style .  
They said : The important thinking on " three represents " set forth by General Secretary Jiang Zemin provides the foundation underlying our efforts for building the party , is the cornerstone for exercising the ruling power , and is also the source of our party 's strength .  It inherits and develops the Marxist party-building theory , embodies the ideological line of emancipating minds and seeking truth from facts , embodies our party 's character and fundamental principle , and embodies the spirit of theoretical innovation and advancing with the times .  
In and after the 1980 ' s , our party also began to establish friendly relations with leftist , centralist , and right-wing political parties and their international organizations in the Western countries by transcending ideological differences and the disparity of social systems with the spirit of seeking understanding , dialogue , and cooperation .  
To practice the requirement of representing the orientation of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must enhance the building of socialist spiritual civilization , persistently educate the people with Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , effectively implement the strategy of relying on science and education for national regeneration , promote the enhancement of the ideological and moral integrity and scientific and cultural attainments of the whole nation .  
We must learn from their love of their jobs and respect for their occupations , consciously standing in the front ranks of the construction of material and cultural / ideological progress , bringing the vanguard model functions into full play in each job with a solemn sense of mission and an intense sense of responsibility , striving to get ahead and making first-rate achievements in the course of reforms , opening up , and modernization .  
Shi Zhongquan , deputy director of the CPC Central Party History Research Center , said : The important concept of " three represents " was put forward to strengthen our party ideologically , to make large numbers of party cadres , especially the leading cadres , keep firmly in mind the nature and purpose of the party , to keep improving the political , ideological , theoretical , scientific , cultural , and other qualities of the party , and to always preserve and carry forward the its advanced nature .  
It may also bring us some possible and unpredictable difficulties and risks .  This new situation has imposed a new and even higher demand on the standards of Party and government leading bodies and cadres at and above the county level , particularly their ideological and political standards and their ability to handle complicated situation and solve actual problems .  
However , some of the outstanding problems in the Party , especially problems among leading cadres with regard to Party spirit and conduct , were not solved .  A considerable number of leading cadres still fail to meet or completely meet the requirements in carrying out their tasks and keep pace with the current situation in the ideological and political realm .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech delivered at the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China points out the Party 's historical task and objective in the new century and provides a powerful ideological weapon and enormous spiritual driving force that encourages the majority of Party members to live through all kinds of tests and forever maintain the advanced nature of Party members .  
The third liberation was cultural and ideological liberation .  This liberation released the people of Tibet , long-enslaved under the binding ties of a unitary religious and political system and the corruption of feudal serfdom , from the remnants of backward thought .  
publicized knowledge on relevant policies , laws , and regulations ; built up a socialist population culture and childbearing culture ; devoted great efforts to changing the backward childbearing concepts among the masses ; and have successfully enhanced the ideological and moral qualities , as well as the scientific and technological qualities , of the masses .  
Vice-Principal Feng Guoqiang of the Party school of the Shangxi provincial Party committee said that the thinking of " three represents " precisely grasps the three most fundamental and decisive factors about social order , most clearly reflects the advanced nature of our Party , brings to light the content of our Party 's advanced nature , and answers the issue of how to maintain the advanced nature of our Party from an ideological point of view .  
Second , we must further reinforce socialist ideological and cultural progress and promote the steady improvement of the ideological , moral , scientific and cultural qualities of our people in order to turn Guangzhou into a city that is truly " suitable for starting one 's business and suitable to live in . "  
Making full use of the powerful position of junior military academies and strengthening ideological and political education among the children and youth so that they will foster from childhood the fine quality of loving the party , the motherland , the people , and the army and give them training in acquiring a patriotic spirit of a high degree , a strong sense of national defense , a strong will , and strong physique is a major issue that has a bearing on the future of China 's socialist modernization .  
To study and resolve major party building issues in the spirit of reform , we would have to - - in accordance with practical criteria , particularly the criteria of the " three represents " - - test and examine the various aspects of the party 's ideological , political , organizational , and workstyle development to see whether they meet the requirements of the " three represents " and are proved through practice to be correct and effective .  
completely get rid of the soil on which the " Falungong " cult and various decadent ideologies and cultures breed ; strive to give rise to a sound general trend of opposing religious cults and upholding civilization in society ; and make positive contribution to improving the ideological and moral quality as well as the scientific and cultural quality of the entire nation , and to promoting the country 's undertaking of reform , opening up , and modernization building .  
With the development of reforms , opening-up and the modernization drive , the working class , including intellectuals , in China has expanded steadily , the quality of the working class has improved markedly in terms of the ideological and moral standard and the scientific and cultural level , a large group of conscientious , advanced elements within the working class has been accepted by the Party , and the class foundation of our Party has increased markedly .  
Therefore , to satisfactorily carry out the educational campaign on ideals and convictions , we must get rid of outdated educational strategies such as using detailed imaginative descriptions of the far future and using unrealistic fantasies and slogans to educate people .  We must consistently focus on the basic national situation in the initial period of socialist development and educate Party members firmly in accordance with their ideological realities .  
Because of the rapid development in education , science and technology , culture , public health and other social services , people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have achieved substantial progress in ideological and moral awareness and in their knowledge about science and other academic subjects .  
Enhancing socialist ideological and ethics building is a major content of developing an advanced culture , and one of the important things is to do well in ideological and ethics building among leading cadres , particularly among senior level cadres .  
Facing the US advances at every step , Beijing 's reaction in recent years was relatively low key .  This was considered by Communist China 's strategic circles as a " serious failure " of the diplomatic work .  The United States has long considered Beijing as its opponent and has made deployment of its forces beforehand , while the CPC Central Committee has not made ideological and material preparations in return .  
According to the uniform view expressed , Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech persisted in being guided by Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , applied the party 's ideological line of emancipating the minds and seeking truth from facts , grasped the overall situation , was based on an elevated perspective , and comprehensively reviewed and systematically summed up the party 's splendid history and basic experience of 80 years , thereby constituting a programmatic Marxist document rich in theoretical innovation , educating and encouraging the people , and urging the people forward .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , he pointed out , persisted in being guided by Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , applied the party 's ideological line of emancipating the minds and seeking truth from facts , systematically and comprehensively enunciated the scientific content of the " three represents " principle , provided profound answers to major issues to be resolved in order to enhance and improve party building under new historical conditions , and further clarified the party 's historical tasks and objectives of striving in the new century .  
As a powerful ideological weapon and tremendous spiritual motivation for army building , the " three represents " constitute a reliable guarantee of the army 's always keeping a firm and correct political orientation .  
To break out of the ideological deadlock and be free of the mode of " management by vertical lines of division , " the crucial thing to do is to proceed from the actual need of an integrated battlefield , firmly establish the mentality of the whole and , in light of the uniqueness of the essence of joint operation of various arms and services , build an organizational system that adapts to the blending of various support forces , to the release of various support capabilities and to the optimized allocation of various support resources .  
We should grasp the substance , stress the main points , link theory with practice , seek practical results and , in light of the major ideological and theoretical issues , which have been raised in practical life and which are of concern to the cadres and masses , and , in light of the new , major strategic issues with a bearing on the overall development of the cause of the party and state , conscientiously organize our studies and give scientific answers .  
literature and art work should be concentrated on creating excellent works in larger quantity ; ideological and political work should be concentrated on enhancing understanding , unifying ideas , and improving its pertinence and practical results ; and the building of spiritual civilization should be concentrated on consolidation , enhancement , extension , and radiation and on spreading the experience gained at selected units to , and promote , the entire area .  
Together with Political Commissar Liu Shaoqi and other comrades , he reorganized the troops , summed up experience and lessons , strengthened party leadership and ideological and political building among the troops , and thus turned the New Fourth Army into an invincible anti-Japanese army fighting north and south of the Chang Jiang and striking terror into the enemy troops .  
General Secretary Jiang 's July 1 speech , he said , is important because it provides our party with a powerful ideological weapon for understanding , strengthening , and improving itself under new historical conditions and provides a strong spiritual force for our great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  Studying the speech is not only an important political task for the entire military now , but also a long-term strategic task .  
After Jiang Zemin spoke , Zhang Wannian said that Chairman Jiang 's important speech was imbued throughout with Marxist world-view and methodology and filled with the truth-seeking and innovative spirit of emancipating the mind and moving with the times ; its political , theoretical , ideological , and targeted properties were extremely strong , it has further pointed out the orientation for the whole party and the whole army to study in depth and implement the 1 July speech and fully implement the demands of the " three represents , " and is of major guiding significance .  
Officials were of the view that on-line information should be able to satisfy the needs of the people 's just and healthy spiritual life , allow the world to understand China fully , accurately , and in a timely way , and resist the ideological and cultural infiltration of harmful information and its pernicious social influence .  
Officials were of the view that on-line information should be able to satisfy the needs of the people 's just and healthy spiritual life , allow the world to understand China fully , accurately , and in a timely way , and resist the ideological and cultural infiltration of harmful information and its pernicious social influence .  
foster and train small but highly trained professional work teams marked by ideological integrity , professional competence , and strict disciplines .  3 .  We should step up the building of a legal system and press ahead with the work of preventing earthquakes and reducing disasters in accordance with the law .  
These devious fallacies of fundamental knowledge " preached by Li Hongzhi have taken advantage of the bad phenomenon of people 's hatred for society and their pursuit of livelihood and morality in the good expectations and proper ideological trends of truthfulness , benevolence , and forbearance .  They have taken advantage of the indiscriminate mentality and blind faith of some people in traditional thought culture .  
Under the new circumstance , it is the military academies ' central task to cultivate new-type and high-quality military talents , who have comprehensive and excellent development in aspects such as ideological and political building , scientific and cultural building , military profession , and physical and psychological strength , and are endowed with comprehensive knowledge and talents as well as the spirit and ability to make initiative .  
The ideological and political building should be carried out with focus on this center , and the promotion of students ' ideological and political quality should always be given the priority .  Great efforts should be made to resolve the issue of ideal and faith so to form the spirit of devoting to the national defense cause .  Importance should be attached to the cultivation of sublime morality and the formation of characteristics unique for military personnel .  
It should actively propagate , popularize and promote advanced ideology and culture among the masses and develop a scientific , civilized and progressive ideological concept , way of production and way of life .  It should constantly enhance ideological and moral quality and scientific and cultural level of the whole nation and become the disseminator of China 's advanced culture .  
Since we have consistently attached importance to and persistently grasped ideological and political work as the central link , the central policy decision has deeply penetrated into people 's minds , and this has effectively eliminated interference in ideological understanding , mobilized the activism and initiative of all sectors , formed a powerful spiritual motive force for impelling the work , and ensured the smooth implementation of the central policy decision .  
Back then , Japan 's expression of reservations about the United States ' stern policies amid its own censure of China along with the Bush administration 's own hesitation and doubts that soon attracted much attention no doubt convinced Deng Xiaoping , a great strategist who deeply understood the meaning of " realpolitik , " that ideological consensus would not obstruct or stop the growing conflict between Japan and the United States nor would the ideological differences eliminate the possibility of those two countries ' respective long-term cooperative coexistence with China .  
The party 's leading organs or grassroots organizations , the party 's organizations in both the enterprises and the rural areas , and our work in economic , scientific , technological , education , ideological , or political fields should embody in an all-round way the requirement of " three represents . "  
He emphasized that comrades working for the NPC must conscientiously and assiduously study Marxist theory and acquire various kinds of specialized knowledge in order to improve their ideological and theoretical quality and do their job with flying colors .  In particular , they must use Deng Xiaoping Theory and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " to guide the NPC 's work , ensuring that these are fully embodied in legislation , supervision and the decision of important matters .  
The General Office of the NPC Standing Committee began offering systematic training to NPC cadres at various levels in 1989 in order to meet the needs of the NPC 's work and make the training of NPC cadres a regular , institutionalized and standard practice .  More than 8,000 cadres have been trained to date .  This has given great impetus to the political , ideological and theoretical development of the ranks of NPC cadres and improved their vocational quality , and is an important contribution to the work of the NPC in the new period .  
The making of these top-level , knowledge-intensive decisions requires that comrades of the NPC must have a high ideological , theoretical and policy level and possess various kinds of scientific and specialized knowledge .  Otherwise they will not be able to formulate distinct , precise , specific and feasible laws and regulations that embody the party 's views , represents the will of the whole nation , and conform with the laws of objective reality , and it will not be possible to make the decisionmaking process more scientific and democratic .  
With regard to the work contents , priority should be given to grasping the ideological and moral education and the training to foster their ability in practice and , through launching healthy , useful , lively , and specific activities , strive to let the patriotic , collective , and socialist ideas be deeply rooted in their young hearts so as to gradually form fine morality and lofty sentiments in their daily conduct , and to constantly enhance their ability in mental and physical work and skills in adapting themselves to society .  
It is necessary to firmly establish a correct outlook on education and qualified personnel , positively promote educational reform and development , take great pains to improve ideological and political education , moral education , education on discipline , and education on legal system , pay attention to the cultivation of enterprising spirit and practical ability , and seriously do a good job of lightening the excessively heavy homework assignments for the students of elementary and middle schools , so as to better promote children 's all-round development .  
Deng Xiaoping first readjusted the past practice of using the social system and ideology as a line of demarcation and advocated proceeding from the national strategic interests in handling state-to-state relations , transcending the similarities and differences in social systems and ideology , giving no thought to historical resentment , refraining from engaging in ideological disputes , and developing relations with all countries in accordance with the norms of international relations .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that to build our party well , we must , in the first place , help our party 's leading cadres at all levels improve their ideological and political quality .  Particularly we must strive to help the middle-aged and young leading cadres improve their ideological and political quality so that they will become a new generation of statesmen who remain loyal to Marxism and unswervingly adhere to the socialist road with Chinese characteristics , and are capable of running the party and the country .  
Second , it expresses their discontent of the West for ignoring Asian ideological traditions all these years .  What is more , it also reflects a kind of anxiety shown by people under the challenge of global economic globalization .  In the present-day world when economic activities become more " interdependent , " it is necessary to consider establishing some moral consensus on the spiritual and cultural levels .  
Correctly understanding their distinctive mentalities and behaviors is the basis for setting the goals , assignments , and requirements and developing the methods for ideological and political construction .  It is also the premise for making ideological and political work more relevant , systematic , and creative .  
The PLA [ People 's Liberation Army ] General Political Department the other day issued a circular demanding that the party committees and political organs at all levels further unify ideological understanding ; strengthen organization and leadership ; earnestly guide in an all-round way the positive education on " three stresses " with Chairman Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " ; and see to it that the education will yield tangible results .  
But we should also be aware that some issues and difficulties do exist in the work of people 's courts , particularly courts at the grassroots level .  The cases in point are their failure to cope with the profound changes in economic , social , ideological , and cultural aspects .  
In the new historical period , Chairman Jiang , based on the developmental changes in the domestic and foreign situation , summarized the new experience in our army 's modernization development , creatively putting forward the scientific concept of " ideological and political development " , stressing that we must put ideological and political development in the premier position among all the army 's development projects , and he gave a series of important instructions in regard to strengthening military ideological and political development under the new situation .  
In accordance with the requirements of Chairman Jiang 's " Two Armings " , the entire military , on the basis of conducting ideological theoretical arming , has put great efforts into strengthening modern science and technology arming , especially arming with high technology knowledge , actively transforming concepts , adjusting work thinking , and putting the focus on cultivating personnel , creating talent , and comprehensively raising the quality of officers and soldiers .  
Facing new situations and tasks , ideological and political development has shouldered heavy responsibilities .  The troops in the entire army will take Chairman Jiang 's important thinking regarding the " three represents " as the guide , constantly reforming , being brave in innovating , and industriously opening up a new page in military ideological and political work .  
The party 's ideological and political work , which has become even more arduous and difficult under the increasingly complicated circumstances , is by no means dispensable or fruitless ; rather , it is indispensable and well worth doing . 
In his speech , Jiang Zemin put forward and expounded on how to understand the historical process of the development of socialism and capitalism , the impact of the practice of China 's socialist reform on people 's thinking , the influence of the contemporary international environment and international political struggle , and other major issues that have a direct bearing on the mental state of cadres and the masses .  He urged all party comrades to jointly conduct in-depth study in an effort to acquire scientific knowledge in the ideological and political sphere .  
The speech was one of great foresight , profound thinking , incisive exposition , and rich content , containing many new thoughts and new viewpoints .  It constitutes an important Marxist document of strategic , overall , and farsighted nature , and it has the important significance of providing guidance on strengthening and improving the party 's ideological and political work , on comprehensively strengthening party building , and on advancing the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Our ideological and political work has not yet adapted to the changing objective circumstances and complicated ideological issues : The problem of " not attaching equal importance to both material and spiritual civilizations " has not been radically resolved in quite a number of localities and departments ; some grassroots party organizations are in a state of weakness and slackness ; problems of unreached areas , unclear goals , and outdated means and approaches are still quite prominent in ideological and political work .  
While inheriting fine traditions , the ideological and political work in the new period has expanded unceasingly in the light of new developments and characteristics and gradually developed a complete set of policies and principles which can be summarized into adherence to Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guide ; 
It is necessary to strive to cultivate an ideological and political contingent that is politically strong , that is professionally competent , that has strict discipline , and that is correct in work style to support their work , to show care in their daily life , to raise their quality , and to even better give play to their roles .  
A great era , magnificent goals , and arduous tasks set demands on us to firmly grasp the central link of the ideological education work .  All are urged to make this central ideological and political work conference a new starting point and a fresh motive force , and to do even better , down-to-earth , and effective ideological and political work .  
It clarifies the historical tasks shouldered by the ideological and political work in the new century .  It profoundly expounds a series of major theoretical and practical issues , which are of fundamental and overall importance in nature .  
We should focus on the understanding of the important status and role played by the ideological and political work in the overall interests of the party and the state .  We should clearly understand the new situation and new issue faced by the ideological and political work .  We also should understand basic Marxist viewpoint and scientific method for correctly revolving these major theoretical and practical issues .  
The circular urged that all units should treat the process of studying and carrying out Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech as a process of strengthening and improving the army 's ideological and political work .  Guided by the speech , they should further deepen the guiding spirit of the political work for the whole army .  We must make efforts to increase the feeling of the current times in our ideological-political work , give it a clearer objective , enable it to produce more tangible benefits , and make it more spontaneous .  
We must strengthen our investigations and studies of the trend of social thinking as well as the characteristics and the rules of changes in thinking among young officers and soldiers .  We must strengthen our studies on major theoretical and practical issues that will have impacts on the thinking activities among officers and soldiers .  We should have an initiative in carrying out the ideological and political work .  
Under conditions in which party work has been a part-time job In the past few years , we have done ideological and political work and engage in production and business operation at the same time and carried out varied and colorful enterprise-cultural activities ; by so doing , we have created a favorable environment full of healthy trends and encouraging people to make progress ; this has increased the cohesion of the enterprise and made the road of party building and ideological and political work broader and broader .  
Since its establishment , the enterprise 's economic efficiency and social effects have developed fast , to which the contribution of the highly effective ideological and political work can not be left unrecognized .  
They should meet the needs of the new situation and new task , make continued efforts to improve and strengthen the ideological and political work .  They must make special efforts to increase the feeling of the current times in our ideological and political work , give it a clearer objective , enable it to produce more tangible benefits , and make it more spontaneous .  They should further enhance the inspiring force , rally force , and fighting capacity of the ideological and political work .  
it should persist in " grasping two links at the same time and giving equal importance to both of them , " vigorously step up the building of the socialist spiritual civilization , strive to improve the ideological and moral standards and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation , bring up a new generation of people who have lofty ideals and moral integrity and who are well-educated and self-disciplined , and create a political atmosphere of respecting knowledge and talented people in the party ;  
Wang Zhaoguo pointed out that the united front has always paid attention to ideological and political work , especially since the Party 's 14th National Congress . With Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core of the Party 's Central Committee and with the ideological and political work of the united front as the key link in rallying and mobilizing people of all realms and all nationalities to bring about the responsibilities of the Party and country , it has effectively mobilized people of all realms to take part in modernization construction and enthusiasm for the glorious national rejuvenation .  
Only when the masses of the people are educated and armed with these two aspects of advanced culture can the Chinese nation 's ideological , ethical , scientific , and cultural qualities be improved unceasingly .  
The pictorial , in vivid visual form and simple language , provides graphic and rich materials for party members to fully understand and grasp the essence of the " three represents " theory .  It is a teaching aid for grass-roots party organizations to step up and improve party ideological and political work .  
The party committees and political organs at all levels of the army and armed police held during their study that , guided by Deng Xiaoping Theory , Chairman Jiang 's important speech has comprehensively analyzed the international and domestic situation and the tasks facing ideological and political work , profoundly explained the important role of ideological and political work in the overall situation of reform , development , and stability , and specifically proposed the guidelines and principles for further strengthening and improving ideological and political work .  
During their studies the officers and men of the army and the armed police pointed out that ours is a people 's army under the party 's absolute leadership , and strong and effective ideological and political work is the political strong point in our development and growth and our cherished magic weapon for defeating the enemy .  We must unswervingly assign ideological and political work the primary position in all work .  
Chen Zhili stressed : While fully affirming our achievements , we must soberly notice that there are still quite pronounced problems facing party building and ideological and political work in colleges and universities and that we are faced with a more complicated situation , heavier tasks , and more arduous work ahead .  
General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech shows great foresight , has the overall situation in view , contains rich and profound ideas , possesses the distinct features of the times , and aims at very definite objectives , which is of momentous practical significance as well as far-reaching historical significance to intensifying and improving the party 's ideological and political work oriented to the new century .  We must study the gist of the speech and put it into practice in a conscientious manner .  
However , we should fully understand the importance , protracted nature , and arduousness of intensifying the building of spiritual civilization , firmly foster the political awareness and the awareness on general interest , responsibility , ideological front , and innovation , and further increase the sense of mission , urgency , and the age , so as to carry out the building of spiritual civilization in a still more vivid , enlivened , and solid way .  
Ding Guangen stressed in his speech that to intensify the building of spiritual civilization , we must seriously study and put into effect the gist of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech , persist in taking Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guide to study how to answer the major strategic questions that have a bearing on the overall situation of developing the party and state 's cause and the major ideological and theoretical questions that are posed in real life and followed by cadres and masses with interest ; 
In this connection , Chang Shanna , a standing committee member , asserted : as far as the personal quality of judges and procurators is concerned , the key factor lies in their political integrity and ideological understanding .  So , in the revision of the two laws , stress should be laid on the academic requirements , and importance should be attached to the improvement of overall quality as well .  
Li Peng pointed out that along with the continuous deepening of reform , opening up , and modernization and the gradual establishment of the socialist market economic structure , relatively great changes have taken place in people 's ideological concepts and lifestyles , and some new conditions and problems have emerged in respect of the marriage and family relations .  Hence , it is extremely necessary to make relevant amendments to the existing Marriage Law .  
It is necessary to thoroughly understand the new and higher demands set by the " three represents " on the building the armed forces ideologically and politically .  It is necessary to further emancipate the mind , update concepts , courageously blaze new trails , and strive to make ideological and political work more lively , solid and effective in light of the new situation and tasks in order to provide a powerful spiritual motive force and a reliable political guarantee for " winning victories " and " preventing degeneration . "  
By grasping the " new reality , " " new problems , " " new demands , " and " new development " in accordance with the demands of the four " close connections , " and carrying out active explorations , we can carry out ideological and political work in a still more vivid and dramatic and effective way .  
The fundamental switch from planned to socialist market economy has brought about tremendous changes in China 's social life and has also set new challenges and demands on ideological and political work .  
To achieve practical results in ideological and political work , it is necessary to closely combine it with the new development of social spiritual and cultural life , and concentrate efforts on masking an issue of " new development " ; we should make efforts to explore a set of effective forms , ways , means , and mechanisms , and continually enhance the attraction and penetration of ideological and political work .  
By grasping the four " new " things , upholding the four " close connections , " and carrying out work in a creative way , ideological and political work will be closer to the era , the masses , and daily life , will be effectively intensified and improved , and will also be able to give fuller play to its role as spiritual motive force and political guarantee .  
All localities and all military units should conscientiously carry out the guiding spirit of the central ideological and political work conference .  They should launch the activities of building spiritual civilization through the joint efforts of servicemen and civilians and promote coordinated development of spiritual and material civilization .  
The speech has been made , the goal has been set , the road has been clearly pointed out , and the key lies in the whole party getting to work to vigorously grasp implementation and carry out ideological and political work in a more extensive , deep-going , vivid and dramatic , and effective way .  
The party 's ideological and political work must be continually strengthened and improved in light of the continually changing reality in the new historical period , and can not be relaxed or weakened in the slightest .  
In vigorously grasping implementation , we must profoundly analyze , from the angle of international and internal history and reality , the objective environment and its basic characteristics which play a role in the ideological activities of the cadres and masses in the new situation , and correctly judge and resolve the major theoretical and practical issues that influence those ideological activities .  
In vigorously grasping implementation , it is necessary to enhance and improve the party 's ideological and political work , and carry out some tangible innovation and improvement in its content , form , method , and means , on the basis of inheriting and carrying forward its fine traditions ; in particular , it is necessary to make big efforts in increasing the sense of the era and enhancing appropriateness , effectiveness , and initiative ; this will become the key point in enhancing and improving ideological and political work in the future .  
We should sum up in good time the new experiences and new understanding gained by the party and the people in the course of practice , give scientific , convincing , and realistic interpretations and explanations of major ideological and theoretical problems raised in practical life which concern the cadres and masses , and give full play to the basic role of theory in ideological and political work .  
Fourth , in close connection with the new development of social spiritual and cultural life , we should make efforts to explore a set of effective forms , methods , means , and mechanisms to continually enhance the attraction and penetration of ideological and political work .  
We must lay stress on forms and methods in ideological and political work , and strive to make it vivid and lively and attractive to the eye and ear ; it should soak into the depths of the heart like life-giving spring breeze and rain , and exert imperceptible influence like a silent lubricant .  
The Chinese Government , acting in accordance with the law , outlawed the " Falungong " cult and harshly censured the criminal elements that broke the law .  Especially after the local authorities ' deep-going and meticulous ideological education and enlightening efforts , the overwhelming majority of " Falungong " exercisers sobered up and awakened .  
strive to research and find answers for new and major strategic issues on the party and national development and major ideological and theoretical issues in practical life the cadres and people are concerned about ; bring into full play the basic role of theory in ideological and theoretical work ; and bring about theoretical progress in promoting social development and realize the value of theory in satisfying the people 's needs .  
The meeting held that upholding and consolidating the guiding position of Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory in the ideological sphere is the fundamental ideological base for ensuring that the party and people of the whole country will strengthen unity and always advance toward the correct direction .  A diverse guiding ideology must absolutely not be allowed .  
The meeting held that in theoretical work , it is necessary to stress the main theme , take the initiative , scientifically and vividly publicize Marxism , and lead the cadres and masses to continually overcome and resist the influence and erosion of wrong , backward , and corrupt ideological education .  
All publicity and ideological bases and spiritual and cultural products must be favorable to publicizing scientific theory , disseminating advanced education , and shaping good minds .  We must not provide the channels of dissemination for wrong things .  
In theoretical work , we must uphold the emancipation of the mind , do practical work , and closely link our work to actual conditions .  We must apply the Marxist stance , viewpoint , and method to make scientific , convincing , and practical explanations of major ideological and theoretical issues that the cadres and masses are concerned about , so as to unify thoughts and forces .  
Yu Yongbo said emphatically : The important speech given by Chairman Jiang at the central ideological and political work conference profoundly expounded on a host of major issues in strengthening and improving the party 's ideological and political work in the new situation .  A policy document of great theoretical and guiding significance , the speech further pointed the way for us to cope with the overall situation of party and government work and to do a good job in ideological and political work in the military .  
At that forum , which was presided over by Nanjing MR Commander Liang Guanglie , Fang Zuqi also reminded the responsible persons from the upper echelons of the party committees in the Nanjing MR to " strengthen and improve ideological and political work in the army " and " make great efforts to provide a powerful mental motive force for winning a war " in the process of making preparations for military struggle .  
It is necessary to build a contingent of ideological and political workers who are politically strong , professionally competent , highly disciplinary , and upright , according to the requirements of improving quality , optimizing the structure , and integrating full-time workers with part-time workers .  
The " three stresses " education has been conducting at party committees above regiment level and grass-roots party organizations , the cohesive and combat forces of party committees at all levels have been generally strengthened , the ideological and political level of the vast number of party members have been raised to a new plane , troops of the whole army have been conducting mass scientific and technological training activities in a down-to-earth way and their capability for defensive battles under modern conditions has been further intensified ;  
Chi Haotian emphasized that we should unswervingly uphold the absolute leadership of the party over the army , vigorously strengthen the ideological and political building of troops , earnestly study Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , earnestly study a series of expositions of Comrade Jiang Zemin , resolutely implement President Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents , " continue conducting the " three stresses " education in a profound way , enhance the ideological and political quality of officers and soldiers , and keep the political color of our army forever .  
promote scientific , civil , progressive ideas and ways of production and living .  We must continue to bring the nation to a higher ideological , ethical , scientific , educational , and cultural level .  We must be disseminators of advanced Chinese culture .  
Social conditions are complex here , the grassroots organizations are weak , the rural propaganda , ideological , and cultural position has not been built effectively , the work style of certain grassroots cadres is rather simple and crude , cadre-masses relations are relatively tense , and rural development and stability have been affected to some extent .  
The Ministry of Public Security has decided to spend one and a half years , starting the second half of this year , in unfolding in all public security organs and among all police personnel across the country an activity of " three educations , " which mainly centers on " education aimed at serving the people wholeheartedly , education on the ideological line of seeking truth from facts , and legal education on strict , just , and civilized enforcement of the law . "  
Many comrades have even given their precious lives !  However , when measured by the standard of the requirement of the " three represents , " our police contingent still lags far behind in terms of its political , ideological , and professional quality , as well as in its discipline and work style .  
When analyzing the current ideological status of the police contingent , Luo Gan noted : Today , some of our police officers have had a distorted outlook on the world , life , and values ; with shaken ideals and convictions , some have become increasingly indifferent to the aim of their work but have developed a strong desire for privileges ;  
On the other hand , in recent years , some local public security organs have concentrated on the building of a material civilization to the neglect of the building of a spiritual civilization and have overlooked and slackened their efforts in promoting their ideological and political work .  
The localities generally say that to carry out educational activities on " thinking of the origin after making a fortune and thinking about making progress after becoming rich " meets the objective need of China 's economic and social development , these activities are a profound ideological emancipation and mobilization at the turn of the centuries , and they are the important contents and effective carrier of the efforts to strengthen and improve the ideological and political work under new circumstances .  
So long as we seize the opportune time to implement the spirit of the central ideological and political work conference , seriously sum up our successful experience of the preceding stage , and earnestly overcome the weak links in our work , we will certainly be able raise the " double thinking " educational activities to a higher level .  
Qiu Xueqiang , director of the Political Department of the Supreme People 's Procuratorate , said : In conducting the " three kinds of education , " we should focus our attention on improving the quality of the procurators ' ranks as a whole , especially their ideological and political quality , so that they will become a force that is united with revolutionary ideals and conviction , that will unswervingly subordinate itself to the interests of the whole , and that is brave in fighting and will not worry the party re any degeneration .  
The forum seriously studied and implemented the spirit of the important speech delivered by General Secretary Jiang Zemin at the Central Ideological and Political Work Conference , discussed how to enhance the convincing and combat effectiveness of theoretical work , how to make ideological and political work more specific and effective , and how to make propaganda , ideological work , and spiritual civilization better serve the development of the west region .  
All the propaganda , ideological , and cultural front and all spiritual and cultural products should publicize scientific theory , spread advanced culture , portray a fine spirit , and encourage healthy social tendencies .  
As officials responsible for " security of their own area , " the party committees and government at all levels should frequently concern themselves with the progress of the investigation and handling of the contradictions and disputes .  Regarding the major contradictions and outstanding problems that might affect social stability , they should personally get involved , go deep into the realities of life , do well meticulous ideological and political work , seriously mitigate the contradictions , and resolve the problems .  
The principal leaders of the party committees and the governments at various levels , as the number one responsible person for " ensuring local peace and stability , " should constantly be concerned about the situation of the contradiction and dispute investigation and mediation work , personally take a hand in handling any major contradictions and conspicuous problems that affect local social stability , go deep into the realities of life , do a thorough and meticulous ideological and political work , and seriously resolve contradictions and problems .  
Our basic missions in strengthening ideological and political education in military academies are to " be victorious at war and not to degrade , " to ensure that we are on the correct path of developing advanced military academies , and to ensure that we can materialize the target of cultivating military professionals with high caliber .  
While paying attention to the pattern of modern education , the " Opinions " have also made use of the PLA 's political superiority .  The " Opinions " have summarized and incorporated the PLA 's basic experiences of strengthening ideological and political education in military academies under new circumstances .  The " Opinions " are currently , and will be for some time in the future , an important guiding document for strengthening ideological and political education in military academies .  
Our basic missions in strengthening ideological and political education in military academies under new circumstances are to " be victorious at war and not to degrade , " to ensure that we are on the correct path of developing advanced military academies , and to ensure that we can materialize the target of cultivating military professionals with high caliber .  
Since the securities commission and its affiliated organizations practiced the vertical management , party committees at all levels have done a lot of work in intensifying the party building and ideological and political work .  However , compared with the duties and missions shouldered by the securities regulatory departments and with the requirements of the party central committee and the State Council , it is still not enough .  
Yan Haiwang said : The intensification of ideological and political work must serve the party 's central work , and the achievements obtained by the securities sector in the ideological and political work must be embodied in the intensified supervision and control , the ensured healthy operation of the securities market , and the accelerated economic reform and development .  
Yan Haiwang stressed that to intensify the ideological and political work , it is imperative to strengthen the leadership , so the leading bodies at all levels must persist in " stressing theoretical study , stressing political awareness , and stressing ethical conduct , " place the ideological and political work in an important position , establish and amplify the ideological and political work responsibility system , make regular study , step up examination , and earnestly " do two types of work simultaneously and attach equal importance to both . "  
( 6 ) carrying out an extensive and thorough education on professional ethics in the entire sector ; in line with the requirements for being " up to the mark in politics , excellent in profession , upright in style , and strict in discipline , " taking the love and respect for work and observation of law and discipline as main contents , intensifying internal management in a bid to further heighten the ideological and political quality and work ability ;  
( 7 ) in light of the five basic requirements that the " leading bodies are staunch and powerful , the party member cadres are pure and up to the mark , the work system of party building is sound , the mechanisms of ideological and political work are perfect , and the work performance is outstanding , " and the three basic conditions of " firm political stand , prominent professional abilities , and excellent work style , " launching activities on creating advanced grassroots party organizations and striving to be fine Communist party members ;  
Each provincial , district , and municipal Party Committee , each higher educational institution operations department Party Committee ( Party Organization ) , and each higher educational institution Party Committee must take further steps in raising understanding and high level emphasis in order to reach the desired ideological goals , vitality goals , and work goals .  
We must treat thorough strengthening of Party building and ideological and political work , upholding Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guide , upholding implementation of consciousness of the Party 's basic line and educational policy , upholding the socialist direction for running a school , strengthening the ideological front , and providing reliable political guarantees and organizational assurances in order to promote reform and development of schools and nurturing of successors for building socialism as the outstanding substance and requirements of " three stresses " education for higher educational institutions .  
The experience the academy has gained in this respect has inherited the glorious tradition of the ideological and political work of the party and PLA , reflects the specific situation and characteristics of the new period , and is marked by innovations and improvements .  It is not only useful to military schools , but also worth drawing on by ordinary institutions of higher learning in various localities .  
As far as the cadet 's ideological and political quality is concerned , the academy holds that a revolutionary ideal embodies a concentrated reflection of the scientific world outlook , philosophy of life , and values , that the military spirit emphasizing the party 's absolute leadership over the PLA is the foundation for ensuring the PLA 's unchanged quality , and that the highly patriotic spirit of dedication is an inexhaustible driving force for service members to take root in the PLA to perform meritorious deeds .  
Confronted with the new situation marked by increasingly frequent updating and upgrade of naval weapon systems and equipment and their constantly rising technological level , the academy has given full play to the leading and service-ensuring roles of the ideological and political work in meeting the requirements of this new situation .  
He indicated that , by insisting on being guided by Deng Xiaoping theory and resolutely implementing the spirit of the 15th Party Congress and various plans from the central authorities , and in keeping with the reality of their own situations , the broad cadres and masses in Heilongjiang and Jilin have struggled hard and forged ahead , producing new achievements in the promotion of economic development , the transformation of the old industrial base , Party-building , the establishment of a democratic legal system , and cultural and ideological development .  
We should care about the old people 's ideology , actively explore new formats and new ways of doing ideological and political work under the new situation , and broadly launch healthy and beneficial cultural and sports activities , so that the masses of old people can enjoy their late years and live a healthy , scientific , and civilized lifestyle .  
According to the current conditions in ideological and political work in the state security organs , Xu Yongyue put forward eight measures for reinforcing and improving ideological and political work , strengthening ideal and belief education , building and managing the cadre contingent , and consolidating leading bodies and grass-roots party organizations .  
The state security organs should continue to carry forward its fine tradition in doing ideological and political work , provide strong and effective political guarantees for the state security work under the new situation , successfully fulfill all tasks assigned by the party central leadership , and triumphantly advance the cause of state security into the 21st century .  
In order to open up a new vista in carrying out ideological and political work , the CPC Central Committee had promulgated the " Several Suggestions of the CPC Central Committee on Strengthening and Improving Ideological and Political Work " in September 1999 .  The institutions of higher learning in Shanghai put forward their views on carrying out ideological and political work on the computer network and in academic organizations and societies and in classrooms .  This is aimed at occupying all educational fields and creating a fine environment for the healthy growth of young students .  
Leading bodies and leading cadres in colleges and universities have universally received education in basic Marxist tenets , party spirit , and party conduct and tempering in relatively strict inner-party political life and thus achieved new improvement in their ideological and political quality .  
Only when great importance is attached to ideological and political work ; the quality of students is improved comprehensively ; and qualified people are turned out can firm ideals and conviction as well as a firm orientation of running a school be embodied .  
In its effort to strengthen leading body construction and ideological and political work and build itself into a domestically first-class and internationally renown university , Beijing Institute of Technology conscientiously worked out numerous rules and regulations and adopted a lot of effective and practical measures .  After its rectification and reform plan was made public , the masses responded to it strongly and maintained that leaders of the institute had grasped the crux of the matter and something significant could be achieved in its development .  
Ding Guangen said : Building civilized communities is urgently needed for enhancing the ideological and political work and building a spiritual civilization , for gearing up our urban construction and management , for improving the living environment of residents and safeguarding social and political stability , and for building close party-mass ties and consolidating the foundation of our party as a ruling party .  
It successively formulated regulations for prevention , admonition , warning , and penalties .  Various supervision measures were combined properly and implemented comprehensively .  Through more intensive ideological education , stricter internal supervision inside the leading bodies , effective organizational adjustments , and serious handling of problems and cases , the sense of self-discipline among leading cadres was raised and the effectiveness of organizational supervision was also enhanced .  
Efforts should be taken to make the warning education a success , for it is a major content of our current efforts to strengthen the ideological and political work and it has a close inherent link with the task of thoroughgoingly conducting the " three-stresses " education .  
In line with Chairman Jiang 's important instructions , the all-military political work meeting has put forward the historical missions of ideological and political construction in the military in the new situation - - to provide powerful spiritual motivation for winning future high-tech wars , and to provide a reliable political guarantee for maintaining the nature , inherent qualities , and style of the people 's military .  
According to reports , along the journey of advancing into the new century , all units of the military have rode on the strong east wind of the central ideological and political work meeting , earnestly acted in the spirit of Chairman Jiang 's important speech , and with higher standard and full of enthusiasm , striven to produce new results in strengthening and improving ideological and political education in the armed forces and to create a new situation .  
The people 's courts should constantly maintain and carry forward the superiority of ideological and political work and realistically ensure the implementation of the party 's line , principles , and policies in the course of doing adjudication work , so as to forcefully provide judicial guarantees and good legal services for the progress of reform , the maintenance of stability , and the sustained , fast , and healthy development of the national economy .  
Xiao Yang said that money worship , hedonism , out-and-out egoism , the concept of special privileges , and some other negative and decadent ideas may certainly affect and corrode the contingent of judges under the current circumstances where the economic strategies at home and abroad are under restructuring and continuous changing and where contradictions and struggles in the ideological arena are getting sharper with each passing day .  
While carrying out ideological and political work , the people 's courts at various levels should ceaselessly strengthen education in communist ideals .  Under the conditions for strengthening the market economy , courts should pay attention to cultivating and enhancing judges ' moral quality and lay a solid foundation for the broad masses of cadres and policemen to justly enforce the law and work diligently for the people .  
At this critical juncture , when China is moving from the 20th century toward the 21st century , we must make material progress and cultural and ideological progress a uniform goal to strive for , unfailingly insisting on concentrating on both aspects .  We must put comprehensive social development in a strategic position , achieving the mutually-coordinated and sustainable development of the economy and society .  
General Secretary Jiang 's important speech at the central ideological and political work meeting , from a higher starting point , with a broader vision , and in a deeper sense , has brought to light the profound historical background , complicated social environment , and many other formidable challenges facing ideological and political work , and has raised our understanding of the life-line position of ideological and political work to the new height .  
The most fundamental and basic step to firm up our ideals and convictions is to unremittingly educate and arm the troops with Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping theory , in order to lay a solid ideological and theoretical foundation among the vast numbers of officers and men .  
The Central Propaganda Department held a meeting a few days ago to conscientiously study the spirit of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech on the grand western development , stressing that the propaganda , ideological , and cultural fronts should resolutely carry out the strategic arrangements of the central authorities , show concern for the grand development , conduct propaganda on the grand development , give support to the grand development , stress political awareness , concentrate energies on implementation , bring real drive into full play , and do practical things for the grand western development .  
Fabricating preposterous , bizarre , and astounding crooked theories and heretical doctrines and creating ideological disorder is the usual practice of all leaders of cults , who sail under false colors and hoodwink the masses .  
He expressed the hope that the youth of religious circles will carry forward and promote the fine traditions of religious personages of the older generation in loving their country and religion ; unswervingly uphold the principle of independent , autonomous , and self-run churches ; conscientiously resist the political and ideological infiltration of foreign forces through religion ; establish a good image of religious practitioners ; unite the youth of religious circles ; inspire greater enthusiasm for building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Remarkable changes have been noticed in the ideological thinking , discipline , and work style of the country 's police contingent ; the unifying force and the competitive effectiveness of the contingent have both been enhanced on a constant basis ; and the vast numbers of public security personnel and police officers have stood the test of severe and complicated struggles , and have made outstanding contribution to safeguarding the state security , to ensuring a sound social and political stability , and to maintaining a stable public order .  
The whole army should use as its guidance Chairman Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " as well as on strengthening the armed forces and improving their training through science and technology .  In light of the military strategic principle in the new period as well as the goal of realizing the preparations for military struggle , the whole army should continuously deepen its ideological understanding .  In addition , the whole army should ensure that it follows correct orientation during the whole process of training of troops through science and technology .  
We should take Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory as guidance , adhere to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , and use the broad vision of historical materialism and dialectical materialism to observe the world , understand the overall situation , study new issues and sum up new experiences in order to continuously improve the party 's level of administration and improve its ability in controlling the overall situation of economic and social development .  
The development of rural scientific , technological , and educational undertakings and the enhancement of peasants ' ideological and moral level as well as their scientific and cultural standard are the crucial links of implementing the strategy of invigorating agriculture on the strength of science and education and bringing about the change from traditional agriculture to modern agriculture , and also the important contents and guarantee for building the new socialist rural areas , which are the eager aspirations of the vast number of peasants too .  
We must make the development of material progress and cultural and ideological progress a unified fighting goal , always concentrating on both jobs and attaching equal importance to both to satisfy the ever-growing , multifaceted cultural and ideological needs of the people , achieving an overall improvement in the quality of the people and enhancing national solidarity .  
Deng Xiaoping Theory has provided the powerful ideological weapon for our party to understand the world and remold the world , and it is also the spiritual dynamic to gather and inspire the entire party and people of the whole country to attain the common ideal and promote overall social progress .  
We should give full consideration to the characteristics of the ideological work , which should be adapted to the requirements of the socialist market economic system and which should be conducive to strengthening party leadership , to giving full play to the initiative of propaganda and cultural workers , and to promoting the development and prosperity of various undertakings .  We should publish more works of excellence to satisfy the increasing spiritual and cultural needs of the people .  
All activities in connection with the ideological and political education must meet the basic requirements of the four kinds of education , namely , education in patriotic dedication , education in the revolutionary philosophy of life , education aimed at respecting cadres and loving soldiers , and education about the need for hard struggle .  
The " Opinion " puts forth the following demands : Political organs at all levels must have the ability to correctly analyze and understand the state of mind of officers and men in their respective units and make prompt suggestions on how to educate them , ability to give theoretical guidance and to study and solve hot and difficult issues , ability to discover typical examples and sum up experience , and ability to conduct the ideological and political education innovatively in accordance with the actual situation .  
We must seize historical opportunities , accelerate reform and development of the journalistic cause , increase strength and vitality , win over the masses , and occupy the market .  We must make General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's " Three Represents " as a major ideological guide , earnestly promote the building of the ranks of journalist workers , so that our journalistic workers will become honest recorders of the progress of the times and become active builders of material and spiritual civilizations .  
Hu Jintao pointed out that the ideas of " how to understand four things " put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin involve important theoretical and strategic issues of the contemporary general trends of development of China and the world , are basic questions that must be correctly answered by means of theoretical research on scientific socialism , and are also issues of ideological understanding at a deeper level which the broad masses of party members and cadres are concerned about .  
Zhang Quanjing pointed out that in conducting the activities of " reviewing the past , " we should lay special stress on the examination of our ideological and political level to see if it has been remarkably enhanced ; of the implementation of the central authorities ' line , principles , and policies to see if they have been carried out unrelentingly ; of the problems that have been checked out and laid bare earlier on , especially the problems that have evoked strong repercussions among the masses , to see if they have been resolved ;  
With regard to the leading groups and leading cadres who failed to distinctly enhance their ideological understanding , fully mobilize the masses , and properly resolve their conspicuous problems earlier on , they should be examined one by one in the current activities of " reviewing the past " to have them resolved in a conscientious way .  As regards the problems which have been settled during the concentrated " three stresses " education but have cropped up again , solution should be worked out through intensified education , appropriate criticism , and proper handling .  
They should fully recognize the importance of properly carrying out " three stresses " education in colleges and universities in accordance with the requirements of the " three represents " and from the strategic vantage point of making ideological , political , and organizational preparations for the challenges in the new century .  They should make active efforts to do a good job in every stage of their work , continuously raise their ideological awareness , and make genuine efforts to prevent and overcome jaded and lackadaisical feelings .  
Various localities should make conscientious efforts to build leading bodies at all levels , focusing on improving their ideological and political qualities , while working earnestly to meet the objectives and requirements set forth by the central authorities .  
with the " Three Represents " as an important ideological guidance , conscientiously implementing the spirit set forth at the 15th Party Congress , at the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee , and at the Central Economic Work Conference ; making strenuous efforts to help maintain social and political stability ; aggressively building up the political and legal ranks ; promoting judicial reforms ; ensuring strict and fair enforcement of the law ; and providing effective legal guarantees for the smooth execution of the Tenth Five-Year Plan and for reform and development .  
General Party Secretary Jiang Zemin pointed out that theoretical building is the basis for Party building , theoretical quality is the soul of the ideological and political quality of leading cadres , and strengthening the study of Marxist theory is still an urgent and important task confronting the whole party which must be pushed forward in a persistent way .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : The united front has assembled a large number of intellectuals , experts , and scholars who have been playing an important role in inheriting and developing the fine cultural tradition of the Chinese nation , learning from and drawing on the advanced scientific , technological , and cultural achievements of other countries , and improving the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the whole nation .  
We must hold high the banner of patriotism and socialism , combine the advanced and extensive requirements , and strive to give play to the united front 's positive role in advancing cultural construction ; at the same time , we must strengthen ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural construction within the united front , and promote the firm establishment of common ideals and moral pillars in society as a whole and the improvement of the whole nation 's scientific and cultural qualities .  
We must take further steps to integrate ideology with the Central Committee 's plans and requirements , increase understanding , strengthen confidence , take hold of opportunities , take prompt action , and conscientiously launch this round of study and educational activities in order to provide strong ideological and organizational assurances for progress in agricultural , rural , and peasant work .  
The various Party Committee levels must take firm hold of the beneficial opportunity afforded by this round of study and educational activities , blend the important " three represents " ideological study and education with the frequent work needed for grassroots organization building and work hard to start new aspects of rural grassroots organization building work .  
These associations have not only become new forces , but have also played a more important role in supporting and developing poor areas , serving the community , carrying out ideological and political work in the grass roots , and building democracy , the legal system , and socialist spiritual civilization .  
On the one hand , as a socialist country , China upholds the principal role of public ownership in the economic field , adheres to the leading position of the CPC in the political field , and persists in the guiding role of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory in the ideological and cultural fields .  The people 's uniformity has tremendously increased in terms of fundamental interests , common ideals , and target of endeavor .  
The " four educations " proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin has grasped the fundamental issues which need to be urgently resolved in the ideological and political building of the army under the new historical conditions and embody a high degree of integration between political steadfastness and ideological and moral purity and between carrying forward the excellent traditions and propagating the spirit of the times .  It is also the basic engineering work and path for strengthening the ideological and political building of the army in the new era .  
Revolving around the political steadfastness and ideological and moral purity of troops , the entire military and armed police force regard resisting " red lanterns and green wine " [ feasting and revelry ] and preventing the erosion of decadent ideology and culture as a breakthrough point to vigorously grasp the education and consolidation of ideologies , styles , and disciplines as well as the internal and external relations .  
They focus on establishing the correct world outlook , life outlook , and concept of value to vigorously improve the ideological and political quality of officers and soldiers , regard cadres , especially cadres at senior and intermediate levels , as focal points to employ the spirit of rectifying work styles to resolve those outstanding issues in the aspects of party styles , clean and honest administrations , and revolutionary integrity , thus conducting the " four educations " in a vivid and lively manner and a solid and effective manner .  
( III ) In the face of the complex and changeable international situation and the new situation of various ideologies and cultures surging against each other and the contradictions and struggles in the ideological and political realm being very complicated , what to grasp and how to grasp the ideological and political building is an issue which has a bearing on what kind of mental outlook the Party , the country , and the military should meet for the challenges of the 21st Century .  
The fruitful achievements of the " four educations " in the People 's Liberation Army and the armed police force have provided beneficial inspiration for strengthening and improving the ideological and political work in our Party and our military during the new historical period .  
As a fundamental engineering project of strengthening the ideological and political building of the army during the new era , the " four educations " have answered and resolved a series of fundamental issues about affirming revolutionary ideals and convictions like how to propagate the excellent traditions during the new era , how to lay a solid ideological foundation for establishing oneself and conducting oneself in life , and so on .  
Over the educational practice of the last six years , the party committees and political organs at all levels of the entire military and the armed police force have justifiably and loudly upheld high quality and style , explained well large principles , propagated advanced things and developed healthy tendencies in a large way , and refuted erroneous ways and rectified unhealthy tendencies in a clear-cut manner , thus creating a strong public opinion and excellent ideological atmosphere about taking the overall situation into consideration , emphasizing the dedication , and observing disciplines .  
Jia Qinglin stressed that the general requirement for the work of elderly cadres in the Beijing Municipality in a period of time to come should be closely revolving round the overall situation of the capital 's work and focusing on grasping well the political treatment and living treatment for elder cadres to fulfill all policies for elderly cadres , strengthen their ideological and political work , and strive to create excellent conditions for the care , medical treatment , teaching , learning , activities , and entertainment of elder cadres .  
and offer active cooperation to party and government authorities and other departments concerned in order to solve their practical difficulties and problems , make a good job of ideological education for employees in a patient and meticulous manner , and prevent any conflicts from intensifying and triggering incidents of a mass nature .  
We must uphold economic development as the center , and integrate spiritual civilization construction work with city and rural development work , as well as with business work for all industries and trades .  We must put efforts into raising the ideological and moral quality of people , and also their science and cultural quality , thus providing spiritual motivation and ideological assurance for modernization construction .  
can we ensure that the party 's line , principles , and policies can be put into effect in every aspect of our work and among the masses ; can we promptly eliminate and overcome the disturbances of erroneous stuffs of various kinds ; and can we consolidate and develop the ideological and political foundation for the common struggle that are currently carried out by the people of all nationalities throughout the country , and can we subsequently provide a strong driving power and a powerful guarantee for our economic work as well as work in other fields .  
We must fully understand the great guiding significance of the important " three represents " thinking to promoting good party style and ethical integrity and to deepening the anti-corruption struggle .  We must work according to the " three represents " requirements , conceive , plan and do the work of combating corruption and encouraging ethical integrity by even higher standards , further raise the level of our ideological understanding and work guidance , constantly further the work of promoting good party style and ethical integrity , and score even greater success in it .  
To counter the problems that exist in the implementation of the Criminal Procedure Law , Hou Zongbin said , further efforts should be made to solve the problems of ideological understanding in a bid to genuinely change the erroneous law-enforcement concepts that exist among a considerable number of units and public security cadres and officers , such as " valuing a substantive law more than a procedural law , " and foster a law-enforcement concept of laying equal emphasis on both the substantive law and the procedural law .  
The comrades attending the forum freely shared what they had learned from studying Comrade Jiang Zemin 's expositions on the party 's ideological style , style of study , and style of work in the context of their own work practice and the special subjects they had studied .  They came to a consensual understanding that the building of the party 's style is not only an inherent requirement of the " three represents , " but also an important safeguard for practicing the " three represents . "  
Through patient , meticulous and earnest ideological and political work over the past year and more , the overwhelming majority of Falungong followers have come to recognize Li Hongzhi 's true features , left the Falungong of their own accord and returned to their normal work , study and life .  
Toward Li Hongzhi and his followers who stayed behind the scene , fled overseas and surrendered to anti-China forces of the west , we must continue to expose and criticize them , expose their sinister political schemes and ugly cult nature to the light of day , create an ambiance of social justice , where they are chased by all like rats scurrying across the street , and thoroughly eliminate the ideological influence and social foundation of the Falungong .

As for those cadres who have a poor ideological and political quality , especially those who are found to have abused power for personal gains and have failed to remain honest in performing their official duties , we must firmly refuse to use them .  
What they are pursuing is no longer a simple " Cold-War mentality , " but an " imperial strategy " of seizing the sphere of influence , and their ideological basis is narrow ideology and ultra-nationalism .  And , with the two highly destructive " poisonous spiritual arrows " directly aimed at China , a marvelous strategic sight has taken shape , in which all the major forces with great interests in the region point their strategic focus at China .

We must firmly redress the erroneous tendency to neglect ideological and political work and to " pay more attention to material progress than to cultural and ideological progress " in some places and departments ; develop a stronger sense of responsibility and urgency ; and conscientiously pay attention to and step up the effort to solve a series of major issues facing the effort to strengthen and improve ideological and political work , from the perspective of consolidating the party 's status as a ruling party and accomplishing the party 's historical mission .  
Practice proves that this round of the " three stresses " education is a creative exploration in strengthening and improving party building in the new period , especially in ideological and political building of leading bodies and cadres .  It carries forward and enriches in the period the Yanan rectification spirit and the party 's " three great styles , " and is an important measure in promoting and implementing the principle that " the party must manage itself " and the principle of " sternly governing the party . "  
The ideological and political quality , the mental state and the work of cadres at this level have a direct bearing on the implementation of the party 's line , principles and policies , influence local reform , development and stability , and influence party-people and cadre-people relations .  On the whole , the situation of the contingent of the leading bodies and leading cadres of over 2,000 counties ( cities ) across the country is good .  
The CPC Central Commission for Guiding the Spiritual Civilization Building held its seventh plenary session today to study the gist of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important directive on strengthening and improving the ideological and political work , and to make work arrangements for further reinforcing the building of socialist spiritual civilization and for earnestly grasping the party 's ideological and political work under the present new situation .  
regard it a major and urgent task to strengthen and improve the party 's ideological and political work , and see to it that the task can run through every aspect of the spiritual civilization building ; strive for tangible results with earnest efforts ; and provide both a strong spiritual driving force and a powerful ideological guarantee for accelerating reform and development , and for maintaining social stability .  
It is imperative to build up a contingent of ideological and political workers at the grassroots level who maintain a close tie with the masses , care for the well-being of the masses , and are good at doing the mass work .  
To successfully reinforce the ideological and political work , the key is to practice what one preaches .  Communist party members must set an example for the entire society to follow , while leading cadres are required to play an exemplary role for the whole party .  
We face arduous tasks in strengthening and improving our ideological and political work in the new period .  There are many problems that need studying .  The key issue is to strengthen the ideals and beliefs of the broad masses of Party members , cadres , and the people through strong and effective ideological and political work .  
Currently , we are in an important historical period at the turn of two centuries .  Our country 's reform is in the period of storming the fortifications .  Faced with the changeable situation in the world and various complicated social phenomena , some people are at a loss and puzzled .  This is not strange .  The key is that our ideological and political work must adapt to the new situations in China and abroad .  The work must adapt to new changes in our society , politics , economy and cultural lives .  
Their ideological and political quality , work style , words and deeds have a direct bearing on the implementation of the party 's line , principles and policies in rural areas , on the reform , development and stability in rural areas , and on the relations between the party and the masses and between the cadres and the masses .  Generally speaking , the great majority of township ( town ) leading cadres are good , diligent , honest in performing official duties and working hard regardless of criticism ;  
The conference pointed out : Launching activities of " stressing civilization and fostering new practices " in depth is an urgent need for promoting reform and development and maintaining social stability .  It is an urgent need for meeting the growing material and cultural needs of the people and forging closer ties between the party and the government on the one hand and the masses on the other .  It is also necessary for implementing tasks of ideological and political work at the grassroots levels .  
If the departments concerned can work in close cooperation , coordinate their actions and produce some tangible results in these activities , it will be conducive to promoting the solution of major and difficult issues that the masses feel very strongly about , thus making the effects of ideological and political work felt deep in the heart of the masses , improving the quality of the population as civilized people , and making the urban and rural areas more civilized .  
Cultural and sports activists among the masses should be given ideological education and vocational training , and the more outstanding ones should be selected to serve as instructors for community cultural and sports activities in order to gradually bring these activities onto the track of organized , standardized and healthy development .  
On 1 March , the Central Propaganda Department called a departmental affairs meeting to further study General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech , enhance understanding , seek unity of thinking , make thoroughgoing reflections in the light of the realities , work out concrete arrangements for strengthening and improving the ideological and political work in its implementation of the directives of the central authorities , and to discuss a number of major issues which need to be resolved in the propaganda and ideological work during the country 's present cross-century development .  
regard the ideological and political work as the essential among essentials ; grasp the work firmly , create a sound atmosphere , and carry out the work in a down-to-earth manner ; and provide a strong spiritual motive power and a powerful ideological guarantee for our efforts to promote the development of reform and maintain the stability of the society .  
and put the ideological and political education in the primary position of quality education .  It is imperative to promote the integration of the students ' moral , intellectual , physical , aesthetic , and labor technical education with social practice ;  
The ministry points out that with the focus on improving teachers ' moral characters and work styles , we should realistically strengthen the construction of the contingent of teachers and make ceaseless efforts to improve teachers ' ideological and political quality and professional ability .  
In line with the current situation and tasks as well as the ideological reality of officers and men , by encouraging officers and men to study , analyze , and discuss theories and to compare and examine themselves with positive examples , this unit has drawn up measures to conduct rectification and correction and concentrated on enhancing officers and men 's sense of responsibility and mission in preparing for military combat with high standards and high quality .  
We should take seriously studying and all-round carrying out Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech as a turning point to launch widespread and profound studies and discussions among the Party Committees and governments at all levels and all related departments especially education departments as well as all social related parties .  We should deepen our understandings , unify the thinking and lay a good ideological foundation in order to carry out quality education , strengthen and promote educational work , and create a new situation of paying attention to the healthy growth of youths among the whole society .  
The members of Jingyang County 's leading group said : In the past , we always thought economic work meant inflexible tasks and targets while the party building and the building of spiritual civilization were flexible tasks , dealing with ideological work , not " grain production . "  So , we did not have a profound understanding of the principle of " building both material and spiritual civilizations and attaching equal importance to both " and our understanding of it was lopsided .  
Fourth , all localities in Guangdong must constantly enhance the ideological and ethical qualities , as well as the scientific and cultural qualities , of the people ; strengthen the building of a socialist spiritual civilization ; and bring about a well-coordinated economic and social development .  
In view of the development of the objective situation and the change in the ranks of workers and staff members , we should do in-depth and meticulous ideological and political work among them and keep improving their ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities .  
While fully developing the material productive forces , our party should attach great importance to the " cultural productive forces , " which are high-level productive forces ; the value and influence produced by such high-level productive forces will have a direct bearing on every aspect of our work and on our party 's ideological and political work in the new period .  
We will further strengthen our four major pillar industries of the processing industry of agricultural and sideline products , the energy industry , the metallurgical industry , and the chemical industry ; speed up the development of our four dominant industries of rare earth , biological technology , information , and heavy-duty vehicles ; take the ideological emancipation as the guide , and uphold the principle that " development is the last word " ;  
The basic spirit of the speech is suited to the county ( or city ) level as well as to the leadership at various levels ; the speech is particularly aimed at improving the ideological and political qualities of leading cadres at various levels ; so it is of great practical and far-reaching historical significance .  
He then pointed out : In studying Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , we should base ourselves on the purpose of enabling leading cadres at various levels to clearly understand the importance and necessity of doing a good job in conducting the " three stresses " education at the county ( or city ) level , on the purpose of improving the ideological and political quality of cadres at all levels , and on the purpose of solving problems in a down-to-earth manner .  
Some delegates indicated : During the current building of a spiritual civilization , the trend of promoting material progress to the neglect of cultural and ideological progress has yet to be checked permanently , and a major factor leading to such a situation is that the related legislation work remains relatively weak ; in view of such a problem , we ought to vigorously strengthen the legislation concerning the building of a socialist spiritual civilization .  
We must solidly and deeply launch the mass campaign of the exploration and construction of spiritual civilization and comprehensively conduct promotion and education , among all of the people , on scientific perspective on the world and methodology .  We must form a healthy atmosphere , in the entire society , which opposes superstition and ignorance and resists various false reasoning and heretical ideas .  We must continuously improve the masses ' ideological and moral levels and establish good spiritual habits .  
Guided by Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , ideological and political work has always accompanied the party 's founding , development , maturing , and strengthening ; it has become the fine tradition and political strong point of the CPC members in uniting for struggle , conquering difficulties , and winning victory , and has become the party 's " magic weapon " in gathering together the spiritual force of the Chinese nation .  
From instituting the household contract responsibility system to the establishment of coastal special economic zones , from planned economy to socialist market economy , and from the initial stage of socialism to the idea of " benefiting three things " - - every one of this series of reforms drawing forward the overall situation is attributable to guidance by the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts .  
Faced with the new situations and problems that have emerged in market economy , in accordance with the demands of the central authorities , the central departments concerned and many localities have engaged in bold exploration and practice , and regarded mass activities to build spiritual civilization as an important carrier for ideological and political work ; they have attached importance to the social education function of culture , and paid attention to giving play to the demonstration role of advanced typical examples .  
Guangdong , which is in the forefront of reform and opening up , must all the more enhance understanding of the importance of " grasping things with two hands , with both hands firm , " tangibly strengthen ideological and political work , and launch an extensive and thorough education drive to " think of the source when getting rich , and advance in thinking when getting rich . "  
Many deputies and committee members said that in the course of reform , opening up , and establishing a socialist market economy system , pluralistic trends have emerged in economic components and interests , ways of social life , and social organizational forms ; high technology has developed rapidly , new changes have occurred in people 's ideological concepts and value orientation , there are more social hot spots and difficult points , all kinds of ideas and cultures stir each other , and certain new situations and problems have arisen in social life .  
Deputy Tian Chengzhong , secretary of Pingdingshan City CPC Committee in Henan , said that ideological and political work includes many aspects such as education content , ways and means , leadership system , operational mechanism , component force , and position carriers [ zhen di zai ti , 7109-0966-6528-7555 ] , and is closely lined with structural reform , the building of the legal system , and cultural construction .  
It is necessary to establish and perfect a system , under the unified leadership of the party committees , in which the party and government departments and the mass bodies share the work and coordinate with each other and the leading cadres at all levels take on dual responsibilities in their posts ; it is necessary to establish a work mechanism for integrating ideological and political work with work in all aspects , and to form a good " integration " of mutual stimulation between them .  
While creating a model street for the " no fake goods in malls and shops " activity , Hunan Road of Gulou District in Nanjing City incorporated ideological and political work as well as spiritual civilization construction into commercial enterprise management and business operation in a lively and tangible manner , producing a set of experiences in double civilizations construction and turning a shabby , cluttered , and unknown street into a golden business location , a shopping paradise , and a national model street of no fake goods in just a few years .  
The party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core has held high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , unswervingly upheld the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces , and persistently put ideological and political building in the most important place .  The people 's armed forces have maintained their brilliant image of being mighty and civilized armed forces .  The armed forces are constantly scoring new victories in making themselves more revolutionary , modern and regular .  
Deputy Wang Zhihao is deputy regimental commander of an air force aviation unit with glorious traditions .  This 34 year-old lieutenant colonel , who has been flying for 15 years , stressed : " As a result of training through science and technology in recent years , the overall quality of the air force has been greatly enhanced , while ideological and political education over a long period has rooted in our minds the idea that ' the interests of the motherland and the people are forever supreme . '  
The PLA and armed police units are treating the campaign of learning from Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun as an important content of their ideological and political education , organizing the officers and men to learn from the advanced deeds of Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun in light of the realities of army building in the new period , and help the officers and men further their understanding of Lei Feng 's and Li Xiangqun 's lofty spirit .  
The PLA and armed police units are treating efforts to strengthen the ideological properties of young officers and men as the most important part of the campaign of learning from Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun ; and are guiding young officers and men to display a " spirit of the nail " [ grasping every available minute and second ] , painstakingly study Deng Xiaoping Theory and materialist dialectics , constantly lay a solid ideological theory foundation , and acquire correct world outlook , outlook on life , and values .  
Therefore , with Marxism as the guide and the training of people who have lofty ideas , moral integrity , education , and a sense of discipline as the goal , we must develop a national , scientific , and popular culture , which is oriented to modernization , the world , and the future , and concentrate efforts on improving the ideological and ethical quality as well as scientific and cultural quality of the entire Chinese nation .  
However , while liberating and developing social productive forces , we must also handle numerous issues about production relations and superstructures , especially those issues in the ideological and cultural realms and must let the building of material civilization and the building of spiritual civilization coordinately develop .  
Meanwhile , under the new historical conditions we are required to comprehensively push forward the ideological , organizational , and stylistic building of the Party and truly maintain and display the advanced nature of the Party on the basis of correctly mastering and handling the relationship of dialectical unity between the advanced nature of ourselves and the extensiveness of our contacts with the masses .  
disseminated , in a vivid way , the materialist ideological concept of respecting science and opposing superstition among the vast number of the visitors ; helped people see more clearly the true nature and the harms of such religious cults as the " Falungong " ; and will thus prove a great help to enhancing the spiritual civilization and the scientific attainment of our people .  
He specially pointed out : General Secretary Jiang Zemin has always been concerned about the ideological and political education among , as well as the healthy growth of , our teenagers .  All relevant departments should run more useful activities , so as to guide the teenagers to establish a correct outlook on life , science , and civilization ; besides , they should also provide more place of activities for teenagers , including scientific parks and cultural centers .  
In some places and schools in our city of Beijing , there still exist the tendency to emphasize cultural knowledge study and to slight ideological and political education as well as the stubborn disease , of varying degrees of seriousness , of one-sidedly pursuing admissions rates and examination results and slackening ideological and political education as well as social practice activities .  
Teachers are engineers of human souls ; improving teachers ' ideological and political qualities and ethics cultivation will be of decisive significance to the comprehensive ethical , intellectual , physical , and aesthetic development of children and youths and to training qualified personnel for modernization construction .  
To conduct the in-depth ideal and belief education , it is necessary to greatly carry forward the Marxist fighting and critical spirit , firmly hold the initiative in the ideological struggle , watch out for symptoms of incorrect tendencies , check erroneous ideas at the outset , nip an evil in the bud , always guard against the corrosive influence of various decadent ideologies and values , resist the offensive from various anti-Marxist ideological trends , enable people to more clearly understand and more firmly adopt the correct ideal and belief through the ideological struggle .  
The people of the entire province , from top to bottom , must take this important four-point instruction as a powerful dynamic and ideological weapon to promote their work in various fields and to put into effect the party central committee 's policy decision on the grand western development with actual deeds .  
and accelerate the process of transforming scientific research results into realistic productive forces .  Wu Bangguo stressed : Under the present new situation , we should further strengthen the party building in state enterprises , reinforce and improve the ideological and political work , step up the building of a spiritual civilization , tighten ties between cadres and masses , show concern for the livelihood of workers and staff , and give full rein to the role of party organizations in enterprises as a strong fighting force .  
The " three representations " is the scientific summary of the Party 's character and aim , is the centralized requirements of maintaining the Party 's advancement , is the creative utilization and development of Theory of Marxism Party building , and is the fundamental guiding ideology of strengthening Party building under new circumstances , which has strong ideological content , theoretical content and distinctive character of the day .  
In his speech , Yu Yongbo , member of the Central Military Commission , and director of the General Political Department , demanded all levels of the military to strengthen ideological and political work , teach the military-turned-cadres to consolidate the concept of taking in the interests of the whole into account , fully understanding the difficulties of local governments and the units that take in the demobilized army officers , and supporting the economic construction and various reforms of the state by practical deeds .  
In his speech celebrating the centennial of Beijing University , he called on the vast number of young people to integrate the acquisition of scientific and cultural knowledge with the strengthening of ideological cultivation , book learning with social practice , the attainment of values with serving the motherland and the people , and the cultivation of lofty ideals with the conduct of hard struggles .  
On the one hand , hostile forces in the West are still bent on " Westernizing " and " dividing " us and they try their utmost to step up ideological and cultural infiltration through a multitude of channels .  They publicize capitalist values in the large volumes of imported publications , film and television products , electronic games , computer software , and other spiritual and cultural products in an effort to compete with us for the younger generation .  
In the face of new changes taking place in the domestic and international situation and new development in ideological education for young people , we feel deeply that Comrade Jiang Zemin 's speech has a clear objective , that it targets at the current problems , and that it is of great practical meaning , and it has made us realize even more the urgency and difficult nature of young people 's ideological education .  
Schools of different types and at all levels should strive to explore new paths for conducting young people 's and students ' ideological education in the new period , reform and enrich the content of the ideological education courses taught at primary and middle schools and at colleges , actively support and help students to engage in extracurricular activities that are healthy in content , rich and colorful , and loved by them .  
It is necessary to adhere to the principle of doing ideological and political work and doing economic and vocational work at the same time .  Ideological and educational work should permeate practical work , and the actual results in ideological and political work should be increased .  
On the basis of its comprehensive analysis of the current international and domestic situation , the party central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core requires that the party 's ideological and political work be done intensively and effectively , and takes this as an urgent strategic task related to the general situation of socialist reform and construction in our country for the whole party and the entire people of the whole nation .  
Only by correctly understanding and handling the relationship between the economy and politics can we make comprehensive development in the economic , political , ideological and cultural fields , and build ours into a wealthy , strong socialist modern country with democracy and a high degree of civilization .  
If the grass-roots party organizations fail to conduct effective ideological and political work , people may become listless , their minds may be confused , and the organizations may become loose and lax in management .  In such circumstances , profit-making enterprises and advanced units may inevitably collapse .  
In the subjective aspect , a small number of communists and party cadres became corrupt and degenerated because they did not study , did not stress politics , and then began to vacillate in their ideal and belief .  Therefore , to effectively stop corruption , in addition to improving the legal system and the supervision mechanisms , it is also necessary to enhance political , ideological , and moral education .  
The most commendable thing about Xu Zhigong , who is both a theoretical worker and a high-ranking cadre , is that he " has made thoroughgoing studies , developed a firm faith in , and put into practice " Marxism in real terms .  He has all along maintained a highly developed sense of political responsibility and a firm ideological resolve that are required of a theoretical worker ; closely integrated scientific theories with the practice of reform and construction ;  
to insure that all could , on a basis of their own initiative , learn revolutionary theories , guard and fight against the corrosion of corrupt ideology and culture , persistently struggle against schools of reactionary ideological trends , against idealistic and pseudoscientific ideologies ; that all should take in fact the Marxist world outlook , outlook on life , values , and take the initiative in socialist cultural civilization construction ;  
In doing practical work , first political commissars should resolve problems in a timely manner , study and arrange the major work of reserve forces , clearly understand the ideological pulse of leading cadres , and organize and convene meetings to study and resolve major problems so as to ensure that reserve forces are developing toward a correct orientation .  
Thus , they are more liable to the impact of erroneous ideas and bad phenomena .  In addition , reserve officers and men are scattered over many areas and are engaged in the work of various professions and trades .  Hence , the changes in their political attitude and ideological state are hard to be controlled .  
This is the marked difference between reserve forces and active military units .  To counter this , first political commissars of reserve forces must , when doing ideological and political work , embrace an advanced consciousness and must be fast in making judgement , in transmitting instructions , in giving feedback signals , and in tracking the results .  This is the only way to succeed .  
Zhu Rongji stressed : The leaders of state enterprises should all act in line with the requirements of the central authorities ; and strive to turn themselves into operators and managers who have a sound ideological and political quality , enjoy a strong ability in business operation and management , strictly observe the law and discipline , and remain honest and self-disciplined in performing their official duties .  To this end , they should be eager to study , diligent in their studies , and good at their studies .  
and we should take earnest steps to strengthen leadership over the ideological and political building in military academies , give priority to selecting highly capable cadres to form the leading bodies of military academies , and see to it that the school-running work can keep to its correct orientation and that the able personnel we bring up are all politically qualified .  
The 10-year history of Pudong development also demonstrates the adherence to the strategy of Emphasizing both on economy and ideology and of the ideological education of stressing both spiritual civilization and material civilization as a key reason of the successful development of Pudong . The adherence also is the guarantee of a Party free of corruption , and of a fine social mood .  The Pudong development project stuck to the principle of To accelerate the first-class development project with first-class Party construction .  
Such practice of using the human rights issue as a political tool to create ideological confrontation and promote hegemonism epitomizes politicization of the human rights issue , utterly violates the purpose and principles of the UN Charter and runs counter to the trend of the times , in which the international community calls for dialogue and cooperation .  It is only natural that the resolution was rejected by a majority of the members of the UN Human Rights Commission , and opposed by the just world opinion .  
In the wake of the deepening of reforms and the development of socialist market economy , economic components and interests , social organizational forms and social ways of life , and jobs and employment methods are becoming more varied by the day , and this inevitably affects people 's ideological concepts and human relations in various ways , and some of these influences are negative ;  
In recent years Comrade Jiang Zemin has repeatedly emphasized that leading cadres must stress study , politics , and healthy trends , work hard to enhance the ideological and political quality of the ranks of party members and cadres , do a good job in resolving problems of world view , view of life , and values , and firmly embrace correct ideals and beliefs .  
We must , through vigorous ideological-political work , enable Marxism to firmly control the ideological and cultural fields and make it difficult for all kinds of reactionary , decadent , and backward political viewpoint , ideology , and life style to gain a foothold and spread .  
In short , we must , under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels , carry out vigorous ideological-political work to explain and answer the masses ' questions , resolve contradictions , straighten out their feelings , coordinate interest relationship , bring about cohesion , and mobilize all positive factors .  Only by so doing can we provide our country 's reform , opening up , and modernization with powerful spiritual motive force and ideological safeguards ; can our economic construction advance in a healthy and smooth way .  
We should apply Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory to enhance the ideological and political levels of the young cadres ; apply modern scientific knowledge and the fruits of outstanding human culture to enhance their professional standards ; apply the practice of arduous and complex environment and a variety of posts to temper and enhance their leadership ability ;  
and apply regular ideological education and strict management and supervision to foster a good work style among them .  In connection with implementing the strategy of the major development of west China , we should guide young cadres to actively join the ranks of developing the west ; we should select young cadres from the central and state organs and from regions where the economically is relatively developed , and send them to the western regions in a planned manner .  
In view of such an understanding , we have specially stressed the point in our ideological and theoretical education that theory and practice are not of a relationship of simply fitting one into the other ; meanwhile , we have also taken special note to guide people to study and master a series of intermediate links in the process of transforming theory into reality , and guide people to consciously work hard for the materialization of such a transformation .  
Leading cadres at all levels must arm themselves fully with Mao Zedong Thought , Deng Xiaoping Theory , and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important exposition ; willingly enhance their sense of historical responsibility and urgency ; broaden their horizons ; work hard and keep forging ahead ; foster a scientific spirit ; master scientific methods ; learn knowledge about science ; and persist in working hard unremittingly on the basis of what has been achieved so far .  They must make efforts to further improve their ideological and cultural quality ;  
Wang Ke pointed out : The important speech , which Chairman Jiang made from a strategic height and after having reviewed the whole situation , is a scientific summation of our party 's historical experience , a deep revelation of the inherent laws governing the work of party building , and an enrichment and development of Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's thoughts on party building .  It has further pointed out the direction of party building in the new period and has a high theoretical and ideological level and a guiding function .  
Especially since its Third Plenary Meeting of the 11th National People 's Congress , our Party has re-established its ideological lines and has made significant decisions and taken strategic measures like reforms and opening-up policies to meet the development needs of the times.has greatly emancipated and developed the productive forces , accelerated the construction of the socialist material civilization and of the socialist spiritual civilization and has paved a way toward building up socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
The fundamental task of the ideological and political construction in military academies and universities in the new situation is , on the basis of winning wars and opposing corruption , to insure constructing high-quality military academies and universities in the correct direction and to insure realizing the purpose of cultivating high-quality talented military people .  
On the one hand , the ideological and political construction should push forward military academies and universities to further emancipate their thinking , change their perceptions , face modernization , face the world , face the future , catch up with the world trend of scientific and technological advances , of military revolution and of educational advances , create famous brands and struggle to be first class .  
In the process of ideological and political construction , we must take improving ideological and political qualities as the first task in cultivating high-quality talented military people ; meanwhile , we should insure students are competent in such aspects as science and culture , professional military skills , physical abilities and psychological qualities .  
At present , our military 's political and ideological work is facing many new problems like how to correctly understand and appropriately handle the relationship of honoring modern educational laws versus bringing to full play our military 's political advantages , teaching scientific and cultural knowledge versus cultivating military people 's ideological and political qualities and stimulating an academic and research atmosphere versus maintaining high ideological unity .  
To keep to the orientation of the progress of advanced culture , it is necessary to adapt ourselves to the requirements of reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization , to concentrate on improving the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the people across the country , and to unite and mobilize the people of all nationalities throughout the country to build our country into a prosperous , powerful , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist state .  
Since our army is an important force for building the socialist spiritual civilization and an advanced group composed of outstanding young people from all walks of life , it must conscientiously uphold the requirement for the advanced quality in ideological , moral , and cultural construction .  
Through reinforcing and improving ideological and political work , clearly explaining the common interest relations and our trans-century development objectives , plans , and policies among the masses though propaganda and inculcation , we shall make the 1.2-billion people share the same ideological base , hold the same ideal and belief , and strive for the same goal .  Thus , greater enthusiasm , initiative , and creativity will burst forth among our people in their joint struggle for building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Through ideological and political work , we will enhance people 's ideological consciousness , promote good public conduct in society , solve various problems in people 's minds , facilitate communication and mutual understanding among the people , and thus coordinate interpersonal relations , mitigate various social contradictions , and maintain a stable and orderly condition in society while keeping all the vigor and dynamism .  
However , under the current material conditions , ideological and political work can solve problems in people 's minds to different degrees , can better give play to the initiative role of people 's mentality , and make up for the temporary shortage of the material forces with people 's mental forces .  This will prompt the people to create more material wealth .  
He meticulously studied Deng Xiaoping Theory and learned a broad range of knowledge related with modern science and technology and ideological and political work .  He came up with a series of methods on how to lead soldiers in the new era , solved a series of problems that officials and soldiers face along their road of life , and promoted the progressive transformation of over a-hundred officials and soldiers .  
The important concept of " three represents " put forward by General Secretary Jiang is an in-depth summing-up of historical experiences in the building of our party , a scientific generalization of the party 's nature , aims , and tasks , and new requirements set for party building in the new period .  It embodies the distinct characteristics of the times and is of profound ideological and scientific guiding significance .  
During our major political struggle against " Falun Gong , " some veteran comrades who had been party members for many years were confused by its false reasoning and heresy .  This fact profoundly shows that in new historical conditions , the struggle between right and wrong , between the advanced and the backward , between science and superstition , and between civilization and ignorance in the ideological sphere appears to be ever more complicated .  
In the march toward the new century , in order to conscientiously implement Comrade Jiang Zemin 's requirement on the " three represents " and " comprehensively advance party building around the two major historical topics , that is , constantly raising our leading and governing ability and improving our ability to guard against corruption and degeneration and withstand risks , " it is necessary to thoroughly implement the principle of strictly administering the party and satisfactorily resolve the ideological , organizational , and work style problems that exist in our party .  
It is necessary to deeply understand and master the new requirements put forth by the " three represents " for the ideological and political building , so as to lay a firm theoretical foundation to unwaveringly uphold the revolutionary ideals and beliefs , consolidate the ideological defense line to unwaveringly uphold the essence and aim of the people 's army , and master the correct direction to unwaveringly uphold the absolute leadership of the party over the army .  
The Central Committee gives its full support to the Party 's basic line , continuing to uphold economic construction as the center , working hard to rectify the phenomenon of ' one hand rather hard , one hand rather soft ' , and strengthening ideological and political work and the building of the Party " .  
This is an important measure that the General Department of Politics took to carry out and implement Chairman Jiang 's important directive on improving the purposefulness , efficiency and creativeness of the military 's ideological and political work , and it is a lively and vivid textbook for the military to deeply promote the ideological and ethic education .  
It is one of our military 's excellent traditions in ideological and political work to help the broad number of officials and soldiers to strengthen their conviction , mold their sentiment and inspire their fighting spirit by singing revolutionary songs .  
In the new situation of reform and opening-up and developing a socialist market economy , when the historic topic of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " lies ahead , it is both the earnest expectation of the Party and the masses and the objective requirement for implementing our military 's sacred mission to strengthen the military 's ideological and morality construction and to cultivate revolutionary military professions with the " Four Haves " .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " firmly takes hold of this critical topic , retells in artistic form that officials and soldiers like to hear and see the brilliant history in which the people 's military united to struggle under the Party 's leadership , reflects the fundamental moral requirements for revolutionary military professionals in the new phase and displays the vigorous and progressive spiritual outlook of modern military professionals , having developed a new thinking on reforming the military 's ideological and political education .  
All troops should associate singing these songs with ideological and political education , enthusiastically respond to Chairman Jiang 's call that " the military 's civilization construction should proceed at the forefront of the whole society " , make effort to become exemplary figures who put into practice , and enthusiastically spread this advanced ideology and culture .  
We should sing aloud the " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " to enable these songs that are revolutionary , advanced , healthy and progressive to echo in military camps , to enrich our lives , to inspire our spirit , to serve our strengthening and accelerating our military 's fighting strength , to serve our strengthening and improving ideological and political work , and to serve our constructing a socialist spiritual civilization .  
The group of songs reflects the basic ethical demands on the revolutionary military personnel in the new period and is the vivid teaching material to enhance the troop units ' ideological and political building .  
Conscientious organization of the singing of these songs by military personnel is of major significance to nurture high ethical standards for officers and men , to carry forward the excellent tradition and style of the people 's army , to build an excellent image for a powerful and civilized army , and to promote reform of ideological and political education .  
The rich ideological content of those songs realizes the spirit of Chairman Jiang 's major instructions on enhancing the Army 's ideological and political education , warmly eulogizes the nature and purposes of the people 's army and the glorious chapters of unity and struggle under the Party leadership , and displays the spiritual outlook of the vigorous and high-fighting spirit contemporary military personnel .  Songs are varied in style .  
The PLA General Political Department held a training course for the party secretaries of its directly subordinate units from 10 May to 15 June to conscientiously study and implement Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents " .  The training course aimed to further improve the ideological level and the ability of leadership of the secretaries and deputy secretaries of party committees , and to enhance the coherent force and the fighting capacity of the leading bodies of party committees .  
Last year , after conducting research it proposed : The evil religion peddles spiritual opium in the guise of " making one into a Buddha or celestial being " , thus achieving the goal of opposing the government and society .  Therefore , thoroughly exposing and criticizing , and resolutely resisting all kinds of crooked reasons and heretical ideas are important tasks in strengthening ideological and political construction .  
Practice in the three major political struggles showed : The mission of ideological and political construction in the army under the new historical condition , as proposed by the All-Army Political Work Conference , is of extreme significance to providing a powerful spiritual motivation for " winning our fight " , and to providing a reliable political guarantee for " not deteriorating " .  
In line with their sacred missions and tasks , officers and men adhered to high standards and strove to set first-class standard .  They comprehensively improved their ideological and political quality ; quality of military professionalism ;  
scientific , technological , and cultural quality ; and physical and mental quality .  All these also reflected an important trend in the implementation of the conference spirit by all units : The units closely integrated theory with practice , and always focused on major issues such as direction and strategy , so as to earnestly strengthen ideological and political work , and actively promote military modernization .  
Strengthening the Party 's and the military 's aims should be taken as the basic requirement for such study programs as Party committees ' central groups , the Party 's life , theoretical learning programs for cadres and ideological education periodically held in the military .  We should devote unswerving , profound and permanent efforts , brand it and root it through periodic and repeated and effectively find answers from the bottom of their heart for the questions of " Why did we join the Party ?  What do we work for ?  
Even the leading cadres with workers ' or farmers ' backgrounds had raised their ideological and theoretical proficiency and knowledge and cultural qualities up to a considerable level through their diligent learning .  
In leading our army 's modernization , Comrade Jiang Zemin is applying Mao Zedong 's military thinking and Deng Xiaoping 's army-building thinking for the new period while adopting some new practices .  He has put forward the task of " ideological and political education " which is of great importance and epochal significance , emphasized the necessity to put ideological and political education above all else in the army , discussed in many ways how to strengthen ideological and political education , and advanced a series of important thinking .  
To strengthen ideological and political education is of extremely great significance to upholding the party 's absolute leadership over the army , stepping up our army 's revolutionization , modernization and regularization , providing a strong spiritual motive force for " winning in war " , and providing a political guarantee for " being immune to degeneration " .  
Upholding the party 's absolute leadership over the army is always a main subject of our army 's ideological and political education .  After they join the army , the most important education service members receive is " military spirit " .  In the final analysis , when troop units hold lectures , publish blackboard newspapers , show motion pictures , stress traditions , and organize visits to sacred places of revolution , all such activities are closely linked to " the gun obeying the party " .  
Everywhere , from South China Sea outposts to northern borders , from east coasts to snowy plateau , headquarters offices , grass-roots companies and other units have done a great deal of arduous and meticulous ideological education work , focusing on " forever unchanged military spirit " .  Some generals personally give political lectures .  
Many of them are teachers and students .  This may bring the impact of their administrative posts , academic status , and master-student relations into the party .  Thus , it is more necessary to intensify study , enhance the ideological and theoretical quality , strictly follow the requirement of the democratic centralist system , set aright the position of an individual , approach things from the across-the-board interests of section development .  
The Party 's grassroots organizations should profoundly solve the conspicuous problems arising in strengthening the leadership over ideological and political construction , in adhering to the principle of democratic centralism , in strengthening their sense of principles and their combat strength , in conforming to the system of regular activities at grassroots organizations , and in purifying the trend at the grassroots units .  
Under the conditions of promoting reform and opening up and being in the ruling position , our party must constantly resist all kinds of corrosive influence and culture .  Therefore , to the broad masses of party members and cadres , it is particularly important to strengthen the building of spiritual civilization and continuously raise their ideological , moral , scientific and cultural qualities .  
We must persist in " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to each " and firmly promote the building of spiritual civilization while grasping the building of material civilization .  We should use Marxism to firmly occupy the ideological and cultural front , vigorously strengthen education on developing a fine party style and building a clean and honest government , and construct an ideological and moral defensive line to repel the corrupting influence and guard against degeneration .  
Holding the major responsibility for ensuring the quality of the training , regular schools of higher learning should attach great importance to ideological and political education , persistently arm the students with scientific theory , and help the students firm up their faith in communist ideals and embrace correct outlook on the world , life , and value .  
It was pointed out in the " decision " of the all-army political work conference on the need to , with regard to the army 's political work reform , pay attention to " employing advanced scientific methods " , to " aggressively absorbing results of modern scientific and technological development and to giving play to the roles of modern information technology like computer networks and the mass media in the areas of information gathering , situation handling , knowledge dissemination , and ideological education " .  
With the introduction of modern information technology and with some units hit by an " online craze " , there arises the problem of " deviation " in the content of the ideological and political education , that is , neglect in employing advanced methods to conduct basic indoctrination of basic theories , and unsystematic , incomplete , and even fragmentary expounding of basic principles related to enhance convictions and to conduct oneself .  
Adopting advanced scientific means is meant to serve for ideological and political education .  First of all , content of political education must meet the needs of the times .  Political education content should be colorful and knowledge-based or it will not only not be conducive to solving ideological problems but also will produce negative impacts and cancel out the results of ideological and political education .  
In the network and information age , Western political ideology tends to infiltrate us via various channels .  In this connection , the army must persist in a correct direction in the ideological and political education work and must concentrate efforts on raising the ideological , ethical , scientific , and cultural quality of officers and men .  
We should combine that basis with the thinking of officers and men , carry out psychological adjustment education , provide guidance to officers and men to cultivate lofty ideals , for good mentality , for living well , and to help lay a solid ideological foundation for training " four haves " military personnel .  
When conducting ideological and political education , we should expand intention and extension of ideological and political education , and while helping raise the ethical quality of officers and men we must also incorporate the raising of their scientific and technological levels into the educational scope .  
In the second half of 1995 , units at the grassroots level of the South China Sea Fleet stationed in the opening area of the special economic zone reflected that the original experience and methods of ideological and political work seemed to be unworkable now .  
The Guangzhou Military Region , which is located on the forefront of reform and opening up , has always been carrying out ideological and political work with emphasis on studying and solving new situation and problems under the conditions of reform , opening up and the development of a socialist market economy , on studying and solving main , difficult , hot and doubtful problems faced by various units at present , and on summing up and promoting effective experiences in army building in the new period with good results .  
The second signal company of a garrison district of a navy unit stationed in Shantou has often carried out " letting everyone talk " activities in promoting ideological work and encouraged fighters to mount on the stage of self-education .  Everyone can offer his opinions on specific topics and on methods to solve problems and make contributions .  In this way , the unit has promoted the " appropriate , systematic and creative nature " of ideological and political work through mass work .  
Treating young officers and solders in the new period , we must understand them with a high period feel and by breaking away from old thinking .  We should see from them their epochal spirit and positive factors , see more of their fine points and less of their shortcomings and see more about the innate character and less from the outside appearance .  Only in this way , can we truly carry out ideological and political work with a definite objective in view .  
The purpose of the " three stresses " education by positive examples conducted at the grass-roots level is to bring into play the role of grass-roots party organizations as fighting bastions and the role of party members as exemplary vanguards , pool together the strength of the vast numbers of officers and men , and provide a strong organizational and ideological safeguards for all-round construction of our grass-roots units and for meeting the requirements of " winning the war " and " preventing degeneration " .  
It is beyond any doubt that we need to study and master professional knowledge and the knowledge of science and technology ; however , we should also see clearly that along with the deepening of modern scientific research and as a result of the increasingly detailed division of labor , we have a greater need for the guidance of advanced ideological theories and a correct world outlook .  
Focusing on and serving this center of economic construction , constantly strengthening and improving the ideological and political work and the building of spiritual civilization to fully display its role of clearing up doubts , remove apprehensions , and inspire spirit can vigorously safeguard and promote the building and development of the socialist material civilization .  
Nevertheless , it should also be noticed that some leading cadres still do not have sufficient understanding about the importance of ideological and political work and that they grasp economic work in a relatively solid way but grasp the ideological and political work and the building of spiritual civilization in a relatively vague way .  
They do not manage nor bother to know those issues affecting the personal interests and feelings of the masses and do not conduct patient and meticulous ideological and political work for giving timely guidance .  Some grass-roots party organizations are in a weak and slack state and do not display the roles they should in the ideological and political work .  
They do not have a comprehensive and scientific understanding about the relationship between economic construction and ideological and political works and do not have sufficient understanding about the importance , urgency , and protracted nature of the ideological and political work .  If this state of affairs is allowed to go on , the guiding position of Marxism will be shaken and the people will lose the correct ideological foundation for jointly forging ahead , ending with ideological confusion .  This is very dangerous .  
We should make full use of these favorable conditions , adhere to the mass line , fulfill the work amid the actual activities of the material and spiritual productions of the masses of the people , let ideological education run through the handling of solid affairs , and guide the masses to enhance their spiritual realm through resolving realistic problems .  
In his speech , Wang Ke pointed out that Chairman Jiang 's major expositions on logistical work , which closely evolve around the national and military conditions and address such basic questions as what logistics should be built and how to develop logistics , represent a new development of Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's military logistical ideology , a scientific summary of logistical work 's features and patterns under a new situation , and a powerful ideological weapon and an action guidebook for military logistical modernization in a new era .  
Specifically , it is necessary to achieve actual effects in correcting the guiding ideology for work and overcoming the formalism , in enhancing the unit 's level of training the military with science and technology , in strengthening the ideological and political building of the unit , and in resolving the hot and difficult issues which have confounded the grass-roots level over a long period of time .  
In his important speech at the central ideological and political work meeting , Comrade Jiang Zemin made a brilliant analysis and profound exposition of the important position , main tasks , guiding ideology , and basic requirements of the party 's ideological and political work in the new period , and major issues that need handling in doing the work , from the height of both international and domestic overall situations .  
The protracted nature of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that it will take a process of considerably long historical struggle to achieve the grand objective of socialist modernization and it is not plain sailing because many difficulties and problems will crop up in the course of our advance .  
The protracted nature of socialist modernization determines that ideological and political work is a measure of fundamental and lasting importance rather than an expedient measure and it is an indispensable task that should be carried out perseveringly and unremittingly .  
The complexity of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that we are improving and developing the self-reform of the socialist system and the world is undergoing a profound change .  Against this background , people 's thinking has become lively ;  
If we lack an adequate understanding of these new complicated situations and problems and a sober understanding of the ever changing situation , our ideological and political work will lose contact with reality and lack a clear aim in view and fighting will .  
The arduousness of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that international and domestic factors are complex and people 's thinking is lively , complex , varied , and constantly changeable from person to person , from matter to matter , and from time to time .  
To study Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , we must get an ever clearer understanding of the requirements of the new situation for ideological and political work , enhance our sense of suffering , not lose sight of the importance of ideological and political work , foster the sense of urgency in doing a good job of the work , see of the protracted nature , complexity , and arduousness of the work , and make adequate mental preparations to carry out the work in the long term .  
In the present information age , there are much more frequent ideological and information exchanges among the people .  This is particularly true in the current situation when the country is further opening up its doors to the outside world .  The influx and convergence of different spiritual and cultural products and different ideas and information through different channels have not only enlivened people 's minds and enriched the cultural market but have set higher demands on ideological and cultural development and on ideological and political work .  
Thus , fully making use of information technology , especially information network technology , to widen the space and channels of ideological and political work and create newer and more effective forms of ideological and political work that meet the characteristics of information exchange by the modern people should be a pressing issue that must be studied and tackled with concentrated efforts .  
We should pay special attention to the use of modern tools of the mass media , such as the press , the radio , the television and the Internet , bring into play their role as the main channel for ideological education , and make continuous efforts to create lively forms that can reach people 's ears , brain and heart .  
Meticulously studying and understanding Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important directive combined with closely adhering to the kernel of education on ideals and convictions form an important guidance in strengthening and improving ideological and political work and in instructing people to set up a common ideal of building up socialism with Chinese characteristics and to establish a scientific view on the world , life values and values .  
Since the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy , many developments have taken place in their spiritual and cultural life and the masses have proposed new demands for spiritual and cultural life .  This requires that we profoundly study the characteristics of the times , have a firm grip on the times , and continuously probe for new forms , methods , means , and mechanisms .  And this is the key to making ideological and political work more purposeful and more inspiring .  
In general , economic issues have been relatively outstanding subjects discussed at G-7 and G-8 summits .  Examples are macroeconomic management , international trade , and relations with developing countries .  Meanwhile , however , the summits have preserved a very clear political and ideological tradition .  
Along with the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy and the development of the socialist market economy , and along with the increase in economic and social contradictions and the increase in different ideological and conceptual problems , corruptive ideas and culture can take advantage and build up .  In addition , the remains of feudal ideas , including feudal superstition and ignorant ideas and concepts that have long been in our society , can arise - - as the popular Chinese saying goes , " dregs float to the surface " .  
All ideological and cultural battlefields , all departments of publicity , culture and education , and all spiritual and cultural products at levels ranging from high to low , should facilitate the spread of advanced culture , publicize scientific theories and mold beautiful souls .  
Meanwhile , military lawyers , as political workers , should consider the ultimate goal of their legal services as one of serving the armed forces ' political and ideological construction and increasing the relevancy and effectiveness of ideological and political work in the new period while performing their professional duties .  
It is necessary to integrate education with management and punishment .  In view of the special feature that the financial sector has more economic crimes than any other sectors and through the establishment of three defensive lines of ideology , system , and law , the financial sector should coordinate its regular ideological education with strict management and its efforts to strictly crack crimes , so as to form an education-management-crackdown structure .  
According to the requirements for improving quality , optimizing structures , and pulling the efforts of both full-time and part-time workers , we should set up a contingent of ideological and political workers who have political integrity , professional ability , a strict sense of discipline , and correct work styles .  
In addition to making great efforts to strengthen ideological and political construction , all military colleges and universities should face modernization , face the world and face the future .  All military colleges and universities should be motivated to update their concepts of education , further update curricular content and methodology , continuously add new aspects to existing theories , knowledge , technology and tactics , and form a curriculum oriented toward the 21st century .  
among the objective environment and major theories and problems of implementation which affect people 's ideological activities , one is the actual situation where the lightning increase in the total quantity of human knowledge and the rapid breakthroughs in modern technology of the " knowledge economy " which has the entire world as its scope have already shown themselves .  
It is a major political advantage of our Party and state.Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech is not only a powerful ideological weapon to strengthen ideological and political construction in the military , but also the fundamental strategy for devoting efforts to doing well the positive " Three Stresses " education in grassroots organizations and for correctly handling the relationship between the education and work .  
It will have a powerful theoretical weapon for developing advanced ideologies and eradicating backward ones , and it will have an ideological basis that is fundamental to the whole Party and people of the whole country in reinforcing unity and in consistently marching forward in the correct direction .  
We must stick to the study trend of associating theory with reality , consistently emancipate thinking and seek truth from facts , and consistently regard scientific theory as the guide .  Regarding currently obvious problems that urgently require theoretical guidance and explanation , we must provide scientific , convincing and realistic explanations and interpretation and make full use of the fundamental role of scientific theory in ideological and political work .  
The thinking of persisting in the " three represents " under the new historical conditions has clearly defined the political direction , political standard , and political requirement for the building of our military ; and is of an extremely important and far-reaching significance to strengthening the party 's ideological leadership , political leadership , and organizational leadership over the military , and to ensuring that our military can forever march forward under the banner of the party and can always retain the nature and the aim of a people 's military .  
and guide the vast numbers of our officers and men to establish a correct outlook on the world , life , and values so that they can always retain the true political color of revolutionary military men .  Third , we should keep to the correct direction , and never waver in upholding the principle that the party should command the gun .  To strengthen the ideological and political building in line with the requirement of " three represents " , the heart of the issue is to uphold the party 's absolute leadership over the military ;  
At the Central Committee Ideological and Political Work Conference , Comrade Jiang Zemin emphasized that , in the face of the new circumstances and new situation , ideological and political work must make efforts to carry out innovation and improvement on a foundation of carrying on and developing superior traditions and in such areas as content , form , method , means , and mechanisms .  In particular , he stressed , efforts must be made to heighten the sense of the times and strengthen direction , effectiveness , and initiative .  
In diligently studying and understanding this important exposition , we have the profound feeling that only by firmly grasping the key points of strengthening and improving ideological and political work and working hard to enhance " one feeling three qualities " can ideological and political work provide formidable impetus and guarantees for reform and opening up and modernization construction in an atmosphere of continuing innovation and expanding advances .  
Each region must pay thorough attention to developing spiritual and cultural products and healthy entertainment activities that have the ability to imperceptibly influence people 's ideological views and moral sentiments so as to allow the masses to achieve enlightenment and mold their sentiments in a relaxed and happy atmosphere .  
The fostering of noble ideology and morals and formation of excellent prevailing social customs must not only rely on patient and meticulous ideological education , it must also rely on scientifically stringent management .  
Many localities give prominence to special characteristics , conduct propaganda to suit local needs , and expand inputs , and have formed certain principal fronts for ideological and political work , including a public opinion front , a training front , and a cultural entertainment front .  
In recent years , the whole party carried out the activities of studying Deng Xiaoping Theory , conducted " three stress " education among cadres at and above the county level , recently studied and propagated Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thesis on " three represents " , and held a central ideological and political work conference not long ago .  All this has given full play to our party 's strong political advantages and effectively guaranteed the guiding position of Marxism in the ideological field .  
In his important speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin enunciated a series of fundamental theoretical and practical issues that have a bearing on the overall situation , gave a new summary to the status of ideological and political work in the overall tasks of the party and the state , and also set forth new requirements .  
He said : The party 's ideological and political work is the lifeblood of economic and all other work , is the central link for uniting the whole party and the entire people of all ethnical groups throughout the country to fulfill all tasks of the party and the state , and is the major political superiority of our party and socialist state .  
We must prevent trouble before it appears , must eliminate the wrong thing as soon as they begin to crop up , must not allow them to spread unchecked or swell viciously , must not allow them to confuse people 's minds and disrupt our overall situation .  Thus , we can lay a solid ideological foundation for achieving the party 's general objective and fulfilling the party 's general tasks in the initial stage of socialism .  
The " opinions " are based on profound research and scientific proof and on repeated discussions and revisions at the all-military conference on ideological and political work that was held not long ago at colleges and universities .  
The most fundamental requirement of these is the explicitly stated task for doing ideological and political construction well at military schools in the new situation .  That is : based on " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " , we should ensure the correct direction to build up high-quality military academies and ensure the objective of fostering high-quality military professionals is realized .  
To make it simple , that is to " ensure the correct direction and to produce skilled students " .  This task is based on basic requirements and the historical mission that Chairman Jiang imposed on military schools for ideological and political construction in the new stage .  
To implement the policy of managing the party strictly , the most fundamental measure is to draw up a set of practical and binding rules and mechanisms to strengthen ideological and institutional construction at the same time , to give full scope to the role of party committees being the leading cores , the role of party branches being the fighting fortresses , and the role of party members being vanguards and models .  
After he assumed the post of executive vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , under the leadership and support of Premier Zhou , he intensified the building of the ministry 's leading body , upheld collective leadership , developed democracy , regularly held meetings on the ministry 's affairs and discussions on ideological guidelines , and instituted a system of daily meeting and timely report of the situation .  
Some comrades have abandoned the Marxist viewpoint on classes and method of class analysis ; they can not see the background to " a world filled with love " or perceive that extremely sharp and complex struggles still exist in the ideological and political field ; and they can not see the conspiracy of hostile western forces to " westernize " and " disintegrate " China .  
With regard to their penetration channels and means , while vigorously intensifying ideological penetration through traditional means such as newspapers , television , and radio , hostile western forces are continually resorting to new methods , and these moreover are becoming more and more concealed and deceptive .  
While persisting in reform and opening up and speeding up exchanges with foreign countries , we must maintain high political vigilance and clear political heads , have a clear understanding of the true features of hostile western forces , lay a firm foundation in ideals and beliefs , build a strong ideological defense line , and win the initiative in the ideological battle .  
By grasping overall and key problems related to the comprehensive building of the grassroots party organizations , we can truly resolve problems in the grassroots party organizations that are of the nature of trends , ensure the effects and quality of " three stresses " education , and successfully achieve marked ideological improvement , marked political progress , marked transformation of work style , marked strengthening of discipline , marked progress in work , marked changes in quality , marked strengthening of the fortress role , and marked improvement in relations between officers and men .  
Seeing the situation clearly , mastering the overall situation , correctly distinguishing between the essentials and the nonessentials , and safeguarding and developing the excellent situation in the ideological and political realm is an important guarantee for continuously pushing forward the reform and opening up and the socialist modernization drive as well as a fundamental requirement for shaping and nurturing a national spirit in the new century .  
Through making efforts over the last 20 years or so , we have eventually opened up a most lively , active , and creative ideological and political situation in the history of our party and country and the ideological level and understanding capability of the masses of people have been greatly increased .  
The progress of the socialist materialist civilization and spiritual civilization has been constantly cleansing the outdated ideas and concepts and the advanced ideological and cultural mentalities like independent mentality , innovative mentality , competitive mentality , open-up mentality , and so on as well as those civilized and progressive social concepts like efficiency concept , effectiveness concepts , and so on which can promote the development of social productive forces have gradually gone deeply into the hearts of the people .  
Relying on the correct understandings which are formed in practice , we can make ideological and theoretical judgment through making objective and cool-headed comparisons under richer and as a matter of course more complicated cultural and theoretical background .  This is an indication of the psychological progress of a nation .  
Along with the development of the social , political , economic , and cultural life , the independent and optional space for people 's ideological activities will become more extensive .  
In contemporary China , the correct and progressive ideological concept under the guidance of Marxism is the main current of the whole social ideology and some wrong and backward concepts running against Marxism are only branch currents .  
In accordance with its peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , and based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence , China did not draw ideological lines but respected the political system which these countries had chosen , rapidly extended diplomatic recognition to those states which emerged as independent from the former Soviet Union , and established diplomatic relations with them .  
Since the beginning of the new stage , especially since the 14th National Party Congress , and facing the complex international situation and profound social change , our military can live through all tests with ideological and political education serving as an important guarantee .  
These changes will exert an extensive , profound and comprehensive influence on the military 's thinking , and challenge ideological and political education in fundamental and temporal ways .  
Through military training , students have enhanced concept of national defense and sense of organization and discipline , raised their ideological and political consciousness , received education on patriotism and collectivism , promoted their all-round development of morality , intelligence , and physique , and laid down a firm ideological and political foundation for becoming a generation of new people with lofty ideals , moral integrity , education and a sense of discipline .  Military training of students has cultivated high quality reserve people for national defense .  
And as to making our civil air defense organs " quasi-militarized " , we need to intensify civil air defense organ building .  Through constant building , we need to turn our civil air defense organs at all levels in the entire northeast China region into " quasi-militarized " administrative organs with political and ideological firmness , strong and effective unity , excellent professional skills , efficient organizational command , honest and clean administration , and a good administrative climate .  
According to the developing or changing situation , especially the complicated struggle going on in the ideological field , and in view of salient problems affecting the quality and effects of education , we should lay special stress on and adhere to such principles as educating people in Marxism , combining the advanced nature of the overall requirements with the level of specific work , being good at drawing on and acting in a spirit reflecting the progress of the times , and always focusing our attention on solving problems .  
At the central conference on ideological and political work , Chairman Jiang clearly pointed out : " On the basis of inheriting and carrying forward the fine traditions , we must strive to innovate in and improve the contents , forms , methods , means , mechanisms , and other aspects of our ideological and political work ; we must especially increase the purposefulness and practical results of this work and enhance our initiative in this regard .  
They felt : In the new century , changes will continue to take place in the international environment and the international political struggle , the practice of socialist reform will develop in depth in our country , and an unprecedentedly complicated situation will appear in the social ideological field .  The diversification of socioeconomic elements , organizational forms , material benefits , and ways of employment will influence officers and men deeply , on all sides , and in a long-term way .  
Whether or not we can uphold democratic centralism , regularly and consciously take up the weapon of criticism and self-criticism , and unfold active and healthy ideological struggle represent an important yardstick for measuring whether a leadership group is strong and effective and whether a leading cadre is truly upright .  
With the ideological and political quality of the party rank and file and party cadres being enhanced , they will have a strong sense of fighting against corruption and keeping themselves clean and honest in performing official duties .  This will not only eliminate the root cause that engenders corruption , but will also make it hard for corrupt elements to cover up their malpractices .  
As far as party building is concerned , while ensuring the party 's leading status , how are we going to further perfect the party 's leadership , truly enhance the ideological and political quality of our cadres at all levels , ensure that our party is always the " loyal representative in three aspects " , and effectively curb the corrosive influence of corrupt phenomena on our party 's ranks of cadres ?  
Therefore , it is necessary to further strengthen and improve the work of controlling the political and ideological conditions of the cadres .  In particular , it is necessary to set up concrete procedures and work out concrete standards and methods for assessing the political and ideological quality of a cadre .  The conclusion of the assessment should also be more specific and detailed .  
Since the implementation of the " Ninth Five-Year " Plan , we have scored glorious achievements in promoting spiritual civilization , while attaining tremendous successes in developing material civilization .  All this has provided a gigantic spiritual motive force and a strong ideological guarantee for the development of the reform and opening-up program and the socialist modernization drive .  
They have brought into full play the exemplary role of the advanced models well in all fields of social life and among various mass groups .  They have vigorously given full scope to healthy tendencies in society and created a fine general mood to respect the advanced and vie with each other to become the advanced .  They have also given a powerful ideological guarantee and intellectual support to creating a fine atmosphere in society for the development of the reform and opening-up program and the socialist modernization drive .  
The " opinion " also proposes explicit requirements on solutions to many realistic problems in ideological and political construction throughout military academies and universities .  These five documents were formulated in accordance with the " Opinion " on the basis of extensive investigation and study , sufficient solicitation of opinions from every field and repeated study and proof .  They are targeted and practical .  
All level of party organizations of the armed forces brought into play their roles as the core of leadership and fighting bastions while the broad masses of communist party members acted as exemplary vanguards .  Through forceful ideological and political work , these party organizations imbued all commanders and fighters with party policy decisions and instructions .  
At the Party Central Committee 's conference on ideological and political work , Comrade Jiang Zemin noted that , " to do the ideological and political work well in the new period , we must profoundly analyze both the objective environment and the characteristics of the thinking of the larger number of cadres and the masses in the new situation from international , domestic , historical and realistic perspectives .  We must correctly examine and solve significant problems in both theory and reality that are influential to the thinking of cadres and the masses .  
This important directive was made from a long-term and broad perspective , through both dialectical materialism and historical materialism , and with an eye on the requirements for the development of the times .  This directive has set the direction for strengthening and improving ideological and political work in the new period .  
Selecting officers from the grassroots with both working abilities , moral integrity and outstanding political achievements and placing them in correct posts is an important guide in stimulating the enthusiasm of grassroots cadres in making achievements and strengthening the ideological stability of grassroots units .  Stimulating their enthusiasm merely by promotion and position transfer is not only unrealistic , however , but also can not root out problems .  If the right cadre as the proper exemplary figure is promoted , this promotion will stimulate the enthusiasm of a large number of cadres .  
In the course of advancing their work in the key fields , trade unions at all levels actively assisted the party organizations and the local governments in doing effective ideological and political work among the working masses , carried out " economic and technical innovation projects " among the working masses , organized and guided workers to enhance their work skills , learn from the advanced , do a first-class job , and make greater contributions .  All this played a positive role in the course of fulfilling the across-the-board tasks of the party and the state .  
During this centralized education , Party members and cadres in grassroots units meticulously studied the important thinking of the " three represents , " touched on and solved some problems that are incongruous with the needs of the Party 's advanced nature , improved their ideological conscientiousness , and inspired their revolutionary will to fight .  
The second generation of the Party leadership with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at its core as well as the third generation of the Party leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core restored , upheld and advanced the ideological line of " emancipate one 's thinking , be practical and realistic " , and led the entire party and the entire Chinese people in concentrating efforts on reforms and opening to the outside world , such that China has been seeing miraculous economic and social growth .  
To this end , those engaged in ideological and political work must study and apply Marxism 's materialist dialectics .  They must use the " Three Represents " and other theoretical innovations of our Party . They must penetrate phenomena and see their basic nature , differentiate primary from secondary , and grasp the overall situation .  They must not make a tempest in a teapot because problems appear , nor must they allow matters to go unchecked .  They must analyze objectively , and actively seek countermeasures .  
The emergence of key and difficult problems makes some new demands on the organizational structure , the internal division of effort , the means and methods , and the scope of application of ideological and political work , and in the mutual relationships among these things .  How to draw new boundaries and achieve new standardization of these things , and make them form up an integrated whole which is full of vitality , is an important aspect of strengthening and improving ideological and political work in the new situation .  
The openness of society will inevitably bring about ideological and cultural diversification .  While people are receiving positive and progressive ideas and conceptions , they are also exposed to the influence of backward and decadent things .  The complex situation in the realm of ideology and culture in society , where the good and the bad exist side by side , brings about a multi-tiered and diversified feature in people 's mental pursuits and values .  
While failing to achieve their purpose , they began to change their strategies .  While maintaining their economic , political , and military pressure , they shifted the focus onto making ideological infiltration against the socialist countries and took this as an important means of pursuing their " peaceful evolution " strategy .  
Such infiltration is not limited to the ideological and cultural fields , but has also be extended to the economic , political , military , scientific , and technological fields .  In their exchanges with us , they also brought ideological things along with them .  
Theory , journalism , publications , literature , and arts are all important ideological and public opinion positions .  We should continuously create and produce good cultural products being favorable to social progress and being beneficial to people 's physical and mental health .  We should boost healthy public conduct in society and develop a progressive spirit of our times , advocate a healthy and civilized lifestyle , resist all reactionary , decadent , and backward ideological and cultural dregs .  
The military should reinforce Party-building in the military according to the requirements of the " three represents " and strengthen ideological and political construction in light of the assurance of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption . "  The military should be ready for military struggles with the military strategic principle in the new period as the guideline , profoundly study characteristics and rules regarding not only the military administration in the new situation but also high-tech regional wars , improve leadership skills and devote efforts to solid implementation .  
Centered on establishing the correct world view , view of life and values , we must combine inheriting the fine traditions with promoting the spirit of the age , integrate respect for the legitimate rights of the individual with shouldering social responsibilities , coordinate attention to efficiency with upholding social fairness , combine progressive demands with broad demands , and make efforts to form healthy , harmonious , and upwardly progressive ideological and ethical standards commensurate with economic and social development .  
The pro-Taiwan forces in the United States , who have called themselves " the blue unit , " have also advanced quite a few political propositions marked by strong ideological colors , and this has undermined the US-China relations ' healthy development and has frequently contravened the US strategic interests as well .  
The Mormon Church , for instance , boasts of 4.6-million followers .  Evil cults have their own characteristics : authoritative leader , anti-social mode of actions , absolute loyalty to chieftains and to the group one belongs , consciousness of being persecuted , mysterious and secret internal organization , arbitrary self-advertisement , exclusiveness , strict discipline , ideological control and manipulation of fellow believers , compelled service and preaching activities .  
The new situation and arduous tasks require that we must regard vigorously disseminating and promoting the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career as an important task of the current ideological and political construction , and devote efforts to carrying out this task in a persistent and effective manner .  
Not only has it been innovative in adopting new ideological concepts and modes of thinking in carrying out its domestic construction , it has also changed the isolationism of its past foreign policy , enthusiastically taking the initiative in developing relations with various countries .  
Western countries headed by the United States always draw an ideological line by only recognizing western value standards and human rights concepts , and they want every country to completely copy their ways , irrespective of their historical traditions and level of social and economic development .  This has already caused social turmoil and even war in certain African countries .  
The five kinds of spirit proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin are a new development and summation of various kinds of lofty spirit that have emerged in a long process of the party 's cause of uniting with and fighting together with the people .  They have carried forward and nurtured our national spirit .  They have a rich ideological content and distinct characteristics of the times .  
We must persist in the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences and being understanding and tolerant , we can not regard personal problems as organizational issues , we can not treat cognitive issues as political issues , and we should not create a tense atmosphere only because certain isolated cases of erroneous ideological and political views arise .  
Party committees , political institutions and leaders at all levels should profoundly and satisfactorily do this ideological and political work , guiding retired cadres to think from a strategic perspective of the reforming , dynamic and stable overall situation of the country and the military construction .  
Firm ideals and convictions are the ideological basis of assuring our revolutionary military professionals are politically qualified and maintaining their essential qualities and the spiritual backbone and resources for these professionals to live through tests , overcome difficulties and make achievements in their careers .  
In promoting the campaign to learn from Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun in the new century , young military professionals must keep our military 's fundamental duty firmly in mind , vigorously promote and develop the " five-point spirits " of struggling with persistent efforts , create endurable ideological styles and acquire competent qualities for " winning wars " through completing ordinary tasks in grassroots construction , through hard work and hardship and through tests of life or death .  
The good situation has been pioneered by the people of the whole country under the leadership of the party .  The ideological and political foundation , the material and technical foundation , and the mass foundation , that we have already possessed to realize the three major historical tasks in the new situation , have been laid by the people of the whole country under the leadership of the party .  
Thereby , the key to consolidating and developing the current gratifying situation , realizing objectives in the Outline of the 10th Five-Year Plan , and fulfilling the three major historical tasks in the new century hinges on further implementing the important thinking of the " three represents " as put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin . Besides , the party should achieve its ideological and organizational construction , improve its work styles , and ceaselessly improve its leadership , its ruling level , and its capability of resisting corruption and preventing peaceful evolution .  
Deputy Chi Haotian pointed out that great achievements were recorded in modernizing national defense and the armed forces during the Ninth FYP .  In the face of the complex situation at home and abroad , our army held aloft the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , and resolutely obeyed the commands of the CPC Central Committee and CMC with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core ; ideological and political building was further stepped up ;  
We should profoundly understand the great significance of studying , and practicing the important thinking on " three represents " from the level of " the foundation of building the party , the basis of ruling the country , and the source of strength , " vigorously step up ideological and political building , and ensure that the important thinking on " three represents " is truly implemented in building national defense and the armed forces .  
We must focus on maintaining the party 's advanced nature , cohesion , and combat strength , vigorously strengthen the ideological , work style , organizational , and disciplinary building of the party in the armed forces , promote healthy practices , oppose unhealthy practices , guard against lax organization and discipline and the growth and spread of corruption , resolutely overcome formalism and bureaucratism , and build the party organizations at all levels into combat collectives able to withstand severe tests .  
maintain sharp vigilance against the attempts of " westernization " and " disintegration " made by western hostile forces , and against the infiltration and erosion of such erroneous ideological trends as " the non-party affiliation of the army " ; resolutely resist the corrosive influence and the attacks of decadent ideologies and cultures ; and firmly defend the authority of the party 's leading collective of the third generation with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core .  
To implement the Tenth Five-Year Plan , we must work hard to improve the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the entire population in the forward direction of an advanced culture , adhere to the idea of " tackling with both hands , both hands hard , " combine the rule of law with the rule of morality , and vigorously push ahead with the building of a socialist spiritual civilization . 
It is necessary to firmly establish the idea of strengthening grass-roots units by science and technology and prospering grass-roots units by talented people .  While improving the ideological and political , military professional , and physical and psychological qualities , efforts should be made to improve their scientific and technological quality .  
The building of national defense is an important part of the great cause of the party and the country and various sectors have attached great importance to it .  Politically speaking , it is in a high and glorious position .  Besides , it is guaranteed with powerful ideological and political work and the conditions for political life is favorable .  
The second contradiction is that in the process of international interactions in the post-Cold War era , international contradictions and conflicts may lead to the formation of the current of thought of radical nationalism which will get combined with leftist speech because of the existence of a large amount of leftist speech in China 's traditional ideological resources , resulting in the undermining of balanced development of pluralist intellectual differentiation and , eventually , affecting the democratic process . 
We should penetratingly study the contents , forms , methods , means , and mechanisms for doing the ideological and political work well in the current situation , study how to enhance the period feel of our ideological and political work , set more definite aims for it in order to achieve more actual results , and better play the enormous role of ideological and political work in clarifying people 's hazy understanding , distinguishing right from wrong , fostering firm ideal and faith , strengthening confidence in forging ahead , and propelling reform and construction .  
We must uphold the guideline of grasping things with both hands , with both hands firm , combine ruling the country according to law with ruling the country with ethics , follow the orientation for progress of advanced culture , and make efforts to enhance the ideological and moral standard and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation .  
This is certainly not saying something frightening just to scare people .  In doing a good job in rural work , we must not only depend on correct theory , line , guidelines , and policies , but also on a rural grassroots cadre contingent of a quality capable of withstanding severe tests , with good ideological and work style , and genuinely bent on pursuing the masses ' interests .  
and further enhance the quality of rural grassroots cadres and strengthen the cohesion and combat strength of the rural grassroots party organizations , so as to provide strong and effective ideological and organizational guarantee for making a success of agriculture and rural work .  In carrying out this work it is essential to strictly act in accordance with the principles , methods , and measures laid down by the central authorities , and pay particular attention to getting a good grasp of the following issues .  
Over the past 100 years , the world underwent untold tribulations caused bywars , diseases , hunger , crises , and disasters ; but more importantly , the peopleof various countries carried out momentous social and natural struggles on amagnificent scale , and thus made unprecedented progress in the political , economic , ideological , cultural , scientific , technological , education , military , and medical aspects .  
At present , the mutual stirring of various cultural and ideological trends on a worldwide scale , the mingling of progressive and backward concepts , the increasing diversification of people 's orientations of value , moral concepts , and cultural choices and , in particular , the infiltration and offensives of the Western hostile forces against us , such as " Westernization " and " disintegration , " have made the contradiction and struggle in the ideological field more and more acute and complicated .  
It is necessary , in line with the requirements of maintaining the advanced nature , to vigorously step up ideological and political building , constantly enhance our steadfastness and consciousness in carrying out the party 's line , principles , and policies , energetically endorse and support reform , subordinate ourselves to and serve the overall interests of the state 's economic construction , conscientiously fulfill the fundamental functions of the armed forces , ensure unimpeded implementation of military orders , and provide a powerful security guarantee for the state 's reform , development , and stability .  
It is necessary , in line with the requirement of maintaining the advanced nature , to vigorously step up the building of our ranks , constantly improve the ideological and political quality , the scientific and cultural level , and the professional skills of party-member cadres , and train and bring up a contingent of high-quality party-member cadres .  
They should unite more closely around the party CentralCommittee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner ofDeng Xiaoping Theory , seriously implement the important thinking of " threerepresents , " strengthen the party building and improve the ideological andpolitical levels of the military , and provide a powerful spiritual motivationand reliable political guarantee for " winning in wars " and " neverdegenerating . "  
While instituting and developing a socialist legal system suited to the socialist market economy , we need to institute a moral system commensurate with it , and be good at merging the basic , important moral requirements into relevant laws and regulations and into various kinds of management in society , so as to ceaselessly promote the formation and perfection of the socialist ideological and ethical system .  
Second , greater efforts should be made to enhance the ideological and political quality of the new party members , education should be given to female activists who are striving to join the party .  According to the relevant stipulations for party member recruitment , concentrated training should be given to activists striving to join the party .  They should be organized to study the party constitution and the basic knowledge about the party so that they can adopt a correct ideal and belief and set aright the motivation of joining the party .  
Our military has made noticeable achievements in these efforts , but we should understand that , as sources of military professionals have been continuously changing and we are facing complex circumstances and vital struggles , unswervingly adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership of the military and using this military spirit to unite officers and soldiers , is still a significant and serious topic for our military 's ideological and political construction in the new situation .  
In light of the security work situation in the unit , the army unit party committee has conducted defense safety education with a specific problem in mind .  In the course of the education , both officers and men are guided to foster the idea of placing national defense interests above everything else , resist the temptation of money and material interests , think of danger in times of peace , take preventive measures , strive to be extremely careful in security work , and thus set up an ideological defense line .  
Second , new progress was made in the work of training and educating young cadres .  Through theoretical training , practical exercise , and routine education and management , the ideological and political quality of the young cadres was enhanced , and their ability to do organizational work and exercise leadership was also enhanced .  
Zeng Qinghong pointed out : In commanding various rural work with the important thinking of " three represents , " we must devote major efforts to advancing the building of socialist spiritual civilization , democracy , and the legal system and safeguarding social stability in the countryside to provide an ideological guarantee and good sociopolitical environment for rural economic and social development .  
They should also emulate Wang Wei 's lofty ideological character of making selfless dedication , loving and respecting his work , disregarding personal gains and loses , and being indifferent to fame and profit so that they will be able to take the initiative to subordinate themselves to and serve the cardinal needs of reform and construction , cultivate a fine moral character , establish a lofty goal of life , and maintain the unchangeable integrity of revolutionary military personnel .  
We must strengthen our building of leadership teams , keep our objectives firmly in mind , strengthen Party spirit , consider the situation as a whole , unite closely , fulfill promises , strive to implement the Party line , have an effective and strong ideological level , political awareness and professional capability , building a strong leadership collective capable of bearing its historical responsibility .  
It is reported that running in-depth education study classes are mainly aimed at meeting the needs of giving additional knowledge to former " Falungong " practitioners who have basically been reformed through persuasion , changing their mode of thinking , and exploring a law governing ideological and political work in the new age .  
The large body of young writers keep in step with the times , pay close attention to reality , engage themselves in the practices of the masses , devote themselves to literary creation , present numerous excellent works with both the flavor of the times and historical substance , as well as with definite ideological depth and artistic appeal .  
We must introduce more excellent ideological and artistic work , encourage better scenes that are positive and forward-looking as well as healthy and beneficial , and produce more good literary writings that are to the point and clear , as well as drive out evil and usher in good .  
In light of the many and heavy tasks faced by brigades and regiments , their Party committee secretaries should pay special attention to observing and analyzing the situation from the political perspective , adhere to the correct direction of military construction , give top priority to ideological administration and education .  They should rely on correct education and instruction to assure that the military is under the Party 's effective control and rely on the powerful spiritual backbone to unite military professionals and inspire their fighting spirit .  
Party committee secretaries should take the lead in studying and understanding the major contents of this opinion , straighten out the main theme of their work , and firmly stick to ideological and political education , the key to their work .  In this way , they can pool effort , coordinate relationships between different sectors and tasks and advance the overall situation of military construction .  
On the one hand , this reflects the serious harm created when " Falungong " followers practice spirit control .  On the other hand , it reflects the results of relaxed education , including correct ideological and scientific education , not interfering with feudal ignorance , and the spreading of backward and corrupt things .  
the spirit of pressing forward in the face of difficulties indomitably and relentlessly , the spirit of working hard and seeking solid results , and the spirit of being indifferent to fame and fortune and making selfless contributions ; continuously enhance their moral and ideological quality and their scientific , cultural , and technological quality ; and strive to become workers with a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good education , and a sense of discipline .  
You should make efforts to ensure that you have fine ideological and political qualities and also scientific and cultural ability that can withstand severe tests ; you should have both strong physique and sound minds .  
[ passage omitted ] In the 10 years beginning in 2001 , based on their yearning for an American century , extreme rightwing American politicians , tycoons , the military industrial complex , the media , and its ideological wildness will wallow together in the mire , and unscrupulously stir up the " theory of the China threat " ; in coordination with a psychological offensive , they will carry out a new " physical offensive . "  
The propaganda and ideological front must center closely on the theme of celebrations defined by the central authorities ; firmly grasp the correction orientation ; loudly chorus the main theme of the Communist Party , socialism , and the drive of reform and opening up being good ; vigorously create a rich and dense atmosphere of loving the party , loving the motherland , and loving socialism ;  
This professional contingent of helpers and educators are required to hold themselves responsible for the party and the people , enjoy a profound understanding of policy as well as a fairly high theoretical level , have an intimate knowledge of the harms of the evil cult , understand the mentality of " Falungong " practitioners , and are good at doing a patient and painstaking ideological and political work .  
18 percent felt that fierce political fighting led to weakening economic competitiveness ; 15 percent attributed it to the authorities ' ideological command and inability to take proper steps ; and 6 percent felt that people have not put in sufficient efforts .  
and how to implement General Secretary Jiang 's principle of dunning the country by virtue , satisfactorily unify efforts to run the army according to law with efforts to step up ideological and moral education among officers and men and , while enhancing the legal system concept and moral quality of officers and men , enhance the management level of army units , raise the consciousness of officers and men in loving the army , learning military skills , and strictly observing discipline , and so on .  
Therefore , correctly understanding and mastering the relationship between common characters and individual characters , fully understanding the protracted nature , complexity , and importance of the ethnic and religious issues , upholding the ideological line of seeking truth from facts , and proceeding from the actual conditions in Tibet in doing everything are important principles which must be mastered in doing work well .  
do a better job in the ideological and political work , the organizational work , the propaganda work , and the mass work under the present new situation ; resolutely eliminate such social malignant tumors as the " Falungong " ; and resolutely dump all the social garbage that runs counter to the development direction of advanced productive forces and advanced cultures , and that sets itself against the fundamental interests of the masses of the people .  
Particularly since the Third Central Forum on Work in Tibet , the region has taken the initiative in launching offensive and sought both a permanent cure and a temporary solution to the separatist problem .  The in-depth anti-separatist struggle in the political , ideological , educational , and cultural fields has dealt a crashing blow to all kinds of separatist activities , reversed the passive situation , and retaken the initiative .  As a result , basic stability of Tibet 's social and political situation has been maintained for a fairly long period .  
It is the ideological foundation and spiritual motive force inspiring people of different ethnic backgrounds in the whole region to fight bravely in unity .  It is a powerful ideological weapon enabling us to know and transform the world .  We must always uphold it without wavering .  
At present , every locality , on the basis of summing-up and applying successful experiences , is further implementing the demands of " three represents " for the construction of party grassroots organizations , making efforts to heighten the focus and fighting force of the rural grassroots organizations , comprehensively enhancing the overall quality of rural grassroots cadres , and providing solid and forceful ideological and organizational guarantees so that good work can be done on agricultural and rural tasks under the new conditions that confront us .  
During the initial days of reform , due to the heavy shackles of the " Left " thinking , reform met with strong obstruction .  In view of such a situation , the party 's leading collective of the second generation with Deng Xiaoping at the core successfully clarified confusions and brought things back to order in the political and ideological field , stood up to pressure , and removed all obstacles ; as a result , the ship of reform set sail smoothly .  
The basic theories , basic line , and basic program established by the party have provided an important ideological and theoretical weapon for our settlement of these problems ; the constantly enhanced bearing capacity of the vast numbers of masses in society has provided a more favorable social environment for our settlement of these problems ;  
All military forces profoundly carried out and implemented the important strategy of administering the military according to the law , through which they have further raised their level of making decisions , administering the military , managing military training and managing soldiers all according to the law and have effectively accelerated ideological and political construction and the comprehensive construction of the military .  
We have also emphasized that since the party 's leadership means ideological , political and organizational leadership , party committees must bring into play their role in assuming overall responsibility and coordinating the work of different quarters and make the decisionmaking process more scientific and democratic .  
We should closely associate with the domestic and international situation , military construction and the ideological reality of every individual person .  We should inspect ourselves in accordance with the requirements of the " three represents " , profoundly consider and effectively understand the essence and internal relations of the " three represents " .  We must thoroughly understand the historical background and the era-oriented significance of the " three represents " .  
We should not only be aware of the significant development and the significant contributions , but also profoundly understand the substantial significance for the practice and the guiding role .  In this way , we can comprehensively and accurately master the ideological and theoretical system and lay down a solid theoretical and ideological foundation for Party members to conscientiously put their advanced nature into practice .  
Marxism is our guiding ideology on building our party and state , the guide to actions in all our work , the ideological foundation and spiritual motive force pushing people of all nationalities of the entire country to fight for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation through concerted efforts , and also a powerful ideological weapon for our efforts to understand the world and to reform the objective world and subjective world .  
The dominant position of public ownership , the nature of state power of people 's democracy , and the CPC 's ruling position have determined that the ideological reflection of such economic and political relationships can only be the use of Marxism as the party 's and the state 's guiding ideology .  
From the very beginning , the party openly and explicitly regarded the most beautiful ideal of human beings - socialist society and communist society - as its objective for struggle , employed Marxism as an ideological weapon to sharply observe and analyze issues regarding China , united a large number of advanced people that excel at dedicating themselves to , and deeply went among the workers and the farmers to do the masses ' work .  
On the basis of meticulously reviewing the positive and negative experiences , recollecting its courage and confidence and correcting its mistakes , the party established and adhered to the ideological line of seeking the truth from facts , gradually understood the practical situation of China , created a road of " circling cities with rural areas and taking over political power through arms " ? which suited the Chinese practical situation and won the victory of a modern national democratic revolution .  
When practical problems faced by the masses are solved , their ideological problems will be solved immediately .  The majority of officers and soldiers will have a stronger conviction in firmly trusting the party , loving the party and being firm in following the party .  In this way , our planned objective of promoting the educational campaign to study and practice the important thinking of the " three represents " and maintain the advanced nature of party members will be realized .  
It is particularly necessary to enhance moral education , and conduct patriotic , collectivist , and socialist education for secondary and elementary school students , conduct education in the fine tradition of the Chinese nation , revolutionary tradition , and national defense , and enhance ideological and moral education .  
In carrying out ideological and political education in the military , it is necessary to focus on the reality of the primate phase of socialism and the objective existence of the socialist market economy , to be responsive to society 's diversified development , to grasp the mainstream and essence , and to work hard to utilize , incorporate , exploit , and develop positive factors .  
In carrying out ideological and political education , the military must adhere to the main melody , vigorously advocate patriotism , collectivism , and the spirit of sacrifice , adhere to the purpose of serving the people whole-heartedly , adhere to principles of materialism , resolutely fight against idealism and feudal superstitions as well as decadent bourgeois lifestyles and various erroneous currents of thought and phenomena .  
Therefore , in carrying out ideological and political education , the military should focus on characteristics and special features , in the process of developing or discarding ideas or ethical standards existing in society in a pluralistic context .  
In carrying out ideological and political education in the military , it is necessary to implement the strategic policy for the new period and to closely center on the requirements of military struggle , working to provide sustained , adequate spiritual motive force for " being able to win " .  
To aim ideological and political education at the war time , it is first of all necessary to intensify education on war-readiness in response to the prevailing situation to guide officers and soldiers , so that they will profoundly understand the importance and urgency of getting prepared for military struggle and educating officers and soldiers to make them understand that hegemonism is now rampant , that " Taiwan independence " forces are increasingly rampant , that there has been a continual tension at the Taiwan Strait , and that there are increasing uncertainties about " peaceful unification " .  
Examining ourselves , after over 50 years of development , especially since the 20 years of reform and opening up , we have the important ideological and political basis for basically realizing modernization , material and technical bases , as well as mass basis by the middle of this century , and the vigorous and rapidly developing socialist cause with Chinese characteristics .  
Mao Zedong 's thinking on the untied front , Deng Xiaoping 's theory on the united front in the new period , and the theses of the party 's third-generation leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core on the united front provide the powerful ideological weapons for guiding the triumphant advanced of the united front .  
Faced with the complex internal and external situation and the glorious mission that we shoulder , in order to meet the challenges on our way ahead , undergo the tests of various dangers and difficulties that may occur , and continually create a new situation in developing the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , we must stand in the forefront of the era , continually step up and improve our own building , and make efforts to raise the ideological , organization , and work style building of the party to a new level .  
Jiang Zemin inspected the building on 16 June . He exhorted the responsible comrades concerned to do a good job in building and managing the hall , turn it into an important window for imparting scientific thinking , spirit , knowledge , and methods , and make it play a positive role in enhancing the masses ' ideological and ethical qualities and scientific and cultural qualities .  
There are differences between countries in their social systems , ideological thinking , perceptions of values , and religious beliefs ; therefore , in international relations , we should strictly observe the basic principles of mutually respecting each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality , mutual benefits , and peaceful coexistence .  
The statement says that " in the past year , Lee Teng-hui has retired , but has continued to frequently make use of provincial sentiments to create ideological confrontation to satisfy his personal political desires in his attempt to bring about a complete split of the country .  This really has made us Chinese abroad feel angry . "  
In order to score even greater victories , we must uphold the basic line of the Party , further unify the thinking of the comrades of the whole Party on the major policy decision made by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , consciously maintain a high degree of ideological and political consistency with the Party Central Committee , and coagulate the strength of the people of all nationalities of the whole country around the magnificent objective of realizing the socialist modernization construction .  
These works containing tens of millions of characters have embodied in a concentrated way the two major theoretical achievements of the integration of the Marxist basic tenets with the specific realities in China - - the essence of Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory , and they are the most precious ideological wealth of the whole party .  
Especially since the beginning of the 1990 ' s , with the continuous progress of the domestic and international situation and the magnificent cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the central leadership collective of the party with Jiang Zemin as the core has adhered to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , and made new explorations in practice and a new summarization in theory of many major economic , political , cultural , military , and diplomatic issues , thus enriching and developing Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
The important thinking of the " three represents " is beneficial for China in the 21st century , in strengthening the ideological education of cadres , consistently moving the advanced nature of Party members forward , and in enabling reform , opening up and modernization construction , particularly in operating a market economic mechanism so that we can develop healthily along the socialist road .  
As long as our Party regards Marxism , Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guiding principle , uses the important thinking of the " three represents " to strengthen its ideological armament and effectively carry out correct lines , strategies and policies issued by the Party since the Third Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party , our Party will forever stand in an invincible position and our socialist system will be stable and safe in the long run .  
Cadres of naval and air forces have organized for party members and cadres , in light of the six-point requirements proposed by the General Department of Politics on maintaining the advanced nature of party members , to identify their weaknesses in ideological and political qualities and scientific , technological and cultural abilities , and strengthen the military 's sense of the urgency and responsibilities for advancing the military construction .  
A division of Jinan Military Area Command regarded strengthening the leadership over ideological and political work as an important responsibility of party committees .  In light of the rapid development in the international and domestic situations as well as with frequent occurrence of crucial issues , this division promptly analyzed the ideological trend of the military , and adhered to the system according to which leading cadres give reports on the situation , answer questions that officers and soldiers are generally concerned about and use decisions made by the party Central Committee to unite thinking .  
Liu Yunshan said : In various historical periods in which the CPC leads revolution , construction and reform , its propaganda and ideological work plays a very important role in disseminating the scientific truth , promoting the integration of Marxism with the practical reality in China , uniting with , mobilizing and rallying the masses , fulfilling historical tasks in various periods , advocating advanced moral practice and scientific and civilized way of life , and improving the ideological , moral , scientific and cultural quality of the whole nation .  
He has repeatedly pointed out : Our propaganda and ideological front is a very important front because it concerns the overall situation of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  We should persist in arming people with scientific theories , guiding people with correct public opinions , molding people with a noble spirit and encouraging people with outstanding art and literature works .  
New interpersonal relationships and healthy , scientific and civilized way of life are taking shape .  The strengthening of our ideological and moral building has become our powerful political advantage that enables our party to lead the people to overcome various kinds of difficulties and dangers .  It has become an important spiritual force that enables us to seize the opportunities , speed up development and promote all-round progress of the society .  
We should persist in sticking to the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , vigorously bring about our prosperous socialist culture and make efforts to provide our reform , opening up and modernization with a powerful spiritual motive power and ideological guarantee .  
Zheng Bijian said that in studying and understanding the important explication of " three represents , " it is imperative for us to further focus our understanding and actions on the issue of the advanced nature of the party and on the question of how the party , beginning from ideological building , organizational building , work-style building , and system building , can build itself into a genuine Marxist ruling party that always stays ahead of the trend of the times and that are completely consolidated ideologically , politically , and organizationally .  
independent culture ? to change the cultural identity of the Taiwan compatriots and then their national and state identities , eliminate their sense of belonging to the Chinese nation , undermine the basis of peaceful reunification between the two sides of the strait , and create an ideological and social basis for realizing their separatist plot . 
At this moment commemorating the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China , we should meticulously study these important expositions , in light of the Party 's glorious history , solve problems by uniting reality with history and combining perspectives with reasoning , genuinely base socialist conviction on a solid ideological and theoretical foundation and transform praises of socialism to a self-mobilized advancement of the great cause of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the 21st century .  
To raise the ideological and ethical standards and scientific and cultural levels of the workers , peasants , intellectuals , and other laboring people and the entire population and improve their work skills and creativity and give full scope to their enthusiasm , initiative , and creative power - - these should remain the tasks of primary importance that our party should perform in representing China 's advanced productive forces .  
To make our party represent the direction of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must make its theory , line , programs , principles , policies , and all its work reflect the requirements of the national , scientific , and popular socialist culture that develops toward modernization , the world , and the future , and enable them to upgrade the ideological and ethical quality and scientific and cultural quality of the whole nation and to provide spiritual impetus and intellectual support for China 's economic development and social progress .  
Strengthening socialist ideological and ethical building constitutes the essential content of and a key link in developing China 's advanced culture .  
In order to forever represent the orientation of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must make the party 's theory , line , program , principles , policies and all its work reflect the requirements of the national , scientific and popular socialist culture that develops toward modernization , the world and the future ; enable them to upgrade the ideological and ethical qualities and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation and to provide the motive power and support culturally and intellectually .  
All comrades in the party should set up a lofty communist ideal , fortify their conviction and spur themselves on by holding to lofty ideological and moral standards .  More importantly , they should make unremitting efforts in a down-to-earth manner to realize the party 's basic program for the current stage and put their heart into each single piece of work now .  
In conducting their respective theoretical study , ideological and political education , and political theory course teaching , the central study groups of party committees , armed forces , and military academies and schools must allot special time to organize the study of General Secretary Jiang 's important speech and properly unify the thinking and understanding of officers and soldiers on major issues so that they will willingly maintain a high degree of ideological and political unity with the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
Through development of more than 50 years , especially in the development of reform and opening up during the past two decades , China has established important ideological and political foundation and possessed a material , technological and human resource foundation for achieving the main modernization by the middle of this century .  
The participating comrades unanimously held that , showing great foresight and having far-reaching significance , General Secretary Jiang Zemin speech is a brilliant Marxist document and a political manifesto of the Chinese communists facing the 21st century .  It has strong political , theoretical , ideological , and strategic nature and is highly relevant .  
At today 's forum of the General Armament Party Secretariat , Cao Gangchuan , member of the Central Military Commission ( CMC ) and Director of the PLA General Armament Department , pointed out that General Secretary Jiang 's major address commemorating the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Party is a Marxist programmatic document , a new and glorious procedural scientific guide for overall advancement of building the Party under the new circumstances , and a great ideological weapon for guiding the entire Party in the new situation of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
They said : In his speech , Jiang Zemin made a new theoretical summary of the party 's nature , fundamental aim , guiding principle , historical mission , and progressiveness ; and clearly set forth demands in carrying through the party 's ideological line , organizational line , and work line , and in carrying forward the party 's good traditions and work style .  
They said : The important thinking on " three represents " set forth by General Secretary Jiang Zemin provides the foundation underlying our efforts for building the party , is the cornerstone for exercising the ruling power , and is also the source of our party 's strength .  It inherits and develops the Marxist party-building theory , embodies the ideological line of emancipating minds and seeking truth from facts , embodies our party 's character and fundamental principle , and embodies the spirit of theoretical innovation and advancing with the times .  
In and after the 1980 ' s , our party also began to establish friendly relations with leftist , centralist , and right-wing political parties and their international organizations in the Western countries by transcending ideological differences and the disparity of social systems with the spirit of seeking understanding , dialogue , and cooperation .  
To practice the requirement of representing the orientation of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must enhance the building of socialist spiritual civilization , persistently educate the people with Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , effectively implement the strategy of relying on science and education for national regeneration , promote the enhancement of the ideological and moral integrity and scientific and cultural attainments of the whole nation .  
We must learn from their love of their jobs and respect for their occupations , consciously standing in the front ranks of the construction of material and cultural / ideological progress , bringing the vanguard model functions into full play in each job with a solemn sense of mission and an intense sense of responsibility , striving to get ahead and making first-rate achievements in the course of reforms , opening up , and modernization .  
Shi Zhongquan , deputy director of the CPC Central Party History Research Center , said : The important concept of " three represents " was put forward to strengthen our party ideologically , to make large numbers of party cadres , especially the leading cadres , keep firmly in mind the nature and purpose of the party , to keep improving the political , ideological , theoretical , scientific , cultural , and other qualities of the party , and to always preserve and carry forward the its advanced nature .  
It may also bring us some possible and unpredictable difficulties and risks .  This new situation has imposed a new and even higher demand on the standards of Party and government leading bodies and cadres at and above the county level , particularly their ideological and political standards and their ability to handle complicated situation and solve actual problems .  
However , some of the outstanding problems in the Party , especially problems among leading cadres with regard to Party spirit and conduct , were not solved .  A considerable number of leading cadres still fail to meet or completely meet the requirements in carrying out their tasks and keep pace with the current situation in the ideological and political realm .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech delivered at the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China points out the Party 's historical task and objective in the new century and provides a powerful ideological weapon and enormous spiritual driving force that encourages the majority of Party members to live through all kinds of tests and forever maintain the advanced nature of Party members .  
The third liberation was cultural and ideological liberation .  This liberation released the people of Tibet , long-enslaved under the binding ties of a unitary religious and political system and the corruption of feudal serfdom , from the remnants of backward thought .  
publicized knowledge on relevant policies , laws , and regulations ; built up a socialist population culture and childbearing culture ; devoted great efforts to changing the backward childbearing concepts among the masses ; and have successfully enhanced the ideological and moral qualities , as well as the scientific and technological qualities , of the masses .  
Vice-Principal Feng Guoqiang of the Party school of the Shangxi provincial Party committee said that the thinking of " three represents " precisely grasps the three most fundamental and decisive factors about social order , most clearly reflects the advanced nature of our Party , brings to light the content of our Party 's advanced nature , and answers the issue of how to maintain the advanced nature of our Party from an ideological point of view .  
Second , we must further reinforce socialist ideological and cultural progress and promote the steady improvement of the ideological , moral , scientific and cultural qualities of our people in order to turn Guangzhou into a city that is truly " suitable for starting one 's business and suitable to live in . "  
Making full use of the powerful position of junior military academies and strengthening ideological and political education among the children and youth so that they will foster from childhood the fine quality of loving the party , the motherland , the people , and the army and give them training in acquiring a patriotic spirit of a high degree , a strong sense of national defense , a strong will , and strong physique is a major issue that has a bearing on the future of China 's socialist modernization .  
To study and resolve major party building issues in the spirit of reform , we would have to - - in accordance with practical criteria , particularly the criteria of the " three represents " - - test and examine the various aspects of the party 's ideological , political , organizational , and workstyle development to see whether they meet the requirements of the " three represents " and are proved through practice to be correct and effective .  
completely get rid of the soil on which the " Falungong " cult and various decadent ideologies and cultures breed ; strive to give rise to a sound general trend of opposing religious cults and upholding civilization in society ; and make positive contribution to improving the ideological and moral quality as well as the scientific and cultural quality of the entire nation , and to promoting the country 's undertaking of reform , opening up , and modernization building .  
With the development of reforms , opening-up and the modernization drive , the working class , including intellectuals , in China has expanded steadily , the quality of the working class has improved markedly in terms of the ideological and moral standard and the scientific and cultural level , a large group of conscientious , advanced elements within the working class has been accepted by the Party , and the class foundation of our Party has increased markedly .  
Therefore , to satisfactorily carry out the educational campaign on ideals and convictions , we must get rid of outdated educational strategies such as using detailed imaginative descriptions of the far future and using unrealistic fantasies and slogans to educate people .  We must consistently focus on the basic national situation in the initial period of socialist development and educate Party members firmly in accordance with their ideological realities .  
Because of the rapid development in education , science and technology , culture , public health and other social services , people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have achieved substantial progress in ideological and moral awareness and in their knowledge about science and other academic subjects .  
Enhancing socialist ideological and ethics building is a major content of developing an advanced culture , and one of the important things is to do well in ideological and ethics building among leading cadres , particularly among senior level cadres .  
Facing the US advances at every step , Beijing 's reaction in recent years was relatively low key .  This was considered by Communist China 's strategic circles as a " serious failure " of the diplomatic work .  The United States has long considered Beijing as its opponent and has made deployment of its forces beforehand , while the CPC Central Committee has not made ideological and material preparations in return .  
According to the uniform view expressed , Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech persisted in being guided by Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , applied the party 's ideological line of emancipating the minds and seeking truth from facts , grasped the overall situation , was based on an elevated perspective , and comprehensively reviewed and systematically summed up the party 's splendid history and basic experience of 80 years , thereby constituting a programmatic Marxist document rich in theoretical innovation , educating and encouraging the people , and urging the people forward .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , he pointed out , persisted in being guided by Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , applied the party 's ideological line of emancipating the minds and seeking truth from facts , systematically and comprehensively enunciated the scientific content of the " three represents " principle , provided profound answers to major issues to be resolved in order to enhance and improve party building under new historical conditions , and further clarified the party 's historical tasks and objectives of striving in the new century .  
As a powerful ideological weapon and tremendous spiritual motivation for army building , the " three represents " constitute a reliable guarantee of the army 's always keeping a firm and correct political orientation .  
To break out of the ideological deadlock and be free of the mode of " management by vertical lines of division , " the crucial thing to do is to proceed from the actual need of an integrated battlefield , firmly establish the mentality of the whole and , in light of the uniqueness of the essence of joint operation of various arms and services , build an organizational system that adapts to the blending of various support forces , to the release of various support capabilities and to the optimized allocation of various support resources .  
We should grasp the substance , stress the main points , link theory with practice , seek practical results and , in light of the major ideological and theoretical issues , which have been raised in practical life and which are of concern to the cadres and masses , and , in light of the new , major strategic issues with a bearing on the overall development of the cause of the party and state , conscientiously organize our studies and give scientific answers .  
literature and art work should be concentrated on creating excellent works in larger quantity ; ideological and political work should be concentrated on enhancing understanding , unifying ideas , and improving its pertinence and practical results ; and the building of spiritual civilization should be concentrated on consolidation , enhancement , extension , and radiation and on spreading the experience gained at selected units to , and promote , the entire area .  
Together with Political Commissar Liu Shaoqi and other comrades , he reorganized the troops , summed up experience and lessons , strengthened party leadership and ideological and political building among the troops , and thus turned the New Fourth Army into an invincible anti-Japanese army fighting north and south of the Chang Jiang and striking terror into the enemy troops .  
General Secretary Jiang 's July 1 speech , he said , is important because it provides our party with a powerful ideological weapon for understanding , strengthening , and improving itself under new historical conditions and provides a strong spiritual force for our great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  Studying the speech is not only an important political task for the entire military now , but also a long-term strategic task .  
After Jiang Zemin spoke , Zhang Wannian said that Chairman Jiang 's important speech was imbued throughout with Marxist world-view and methodology and filled with the truth-seeking and innovative spirit of emancipating the mind and moving with the times ; its political , theoretical , ideological , and targeted properties were extremely strong , it has further pointed out the orientation for the whole party and the whole army to study in depth and implement the 1 July speech and fully implement the demands of the " three represents , " and is of major guiding significance .  
Officials were of the view that on-line information should be able to satisfy the needs of the people 's just and healthy spiritual life , allow the world to understand China fully , accurately , and in a timely way , and resist the ideological and cultural infiltration of harmful information and its pernicious social influence .  
Officials were of the view that on-line information should be able to satisfy the needs of the people 's just and healthy spiritual life , allow the world to understand China fully , accurately , and in a timely way , and resist the ideological and cultural infiltration of harmful information and its pernicious social influence .  
foster and train small but highly trained professional work teams marked by ideological integrity , professional competence , and strict disciplines .  3 .  We should step up the building of a legal system and press ahead with the work of preventing earthquakes and reducing disasters in accordance with the law .  
These devious fallacies of fundamental knowledge " preached by Li Hongzhi have taken advantage of the bad phenomenon of people 's hatred for society and their pursuit of livelihood and morality in the good expectations and proper ideological trends of truthfulness , benevolence , and forbearance .  They have taken advantage of the indiscriminate mentality and blind faith of some people in traditional thought culture .  
Under the new circumstance , it is the military academies ' central task to cultivate new-type and high-quality military talents , who have comprehensive and excellent development in aspects such as ideological and political building , scientific and cultural building , military profession , and physical and psychological strength , and are endowed with comprehensive knowledge and talents as well as the spirit and ability to make initiative .  
The ideological and political building should be carried out with focus on this center , and the promotion of students ' ideological and political quality should always be given the priority .  Great efforts should be made to resolve the issue of ideal and faith so to form the spirit of devoting to the national defense cause .  Importance should be attached to the cultivation of sublime morality and the formation of characteristics unique for military personnel .  
It should actively propagate , popularize and promote advanced ideology and culture among the masses and develop a scientific , civilized and progressive ideological concept , way of production and way of life .  It should constantly enhance ideological and moral quality and scientific and cultural level of the whole nation and become the disseminator of China 's advanced culture .  
Since we have consistently attached importance to and persistently grasped ideological and political work as the central link , the central policy decision has deeply penetrated into people 's minds , and this has effectively eliminated interference in ideological understanding , mobilized the activism and initiative of all sectors , formed a powerful spiritual motive force for impelling the work , and ensured the smooth implementation of the central policy decision .  
Back then , Japan 's expression of reservations about the United States ' stern policies amid its own censure of China along with the Bush administration 's own hesitation and doubts that soon attracted much attention no doubt convinced Deng Xiaoping , a great strategist who deeply understood the meaning of " realpolitik , " that ideological consensus would not obstruct or stop the growing conflict between Japan and the United States nor would the ideological differences eliminate the possibility of those two countries ' respective long-term cooperative coexistence with China .  
The party 's leading organs or grassroots organizations , the party 's organizations in both the enterprises and the rural areas , and our work in economic , scientific , technological , education , ideological , or political fields should embody in an all-round way the requirement of " three represents . "  
He emphasized that comrades working for the NPC must conscientiously and assiduously study Marxist theory and acquire various kinds of specialized knowledge in order to improve their ideological and theoretical quality and do their job with flying colors .  In particular , they must use Deng Xiaoping Theory and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " to guide the NPC 's work , ensuring that these are fully embodied in legislation , supervision and the decision of important matters .  
The General Office of the NPC Standing Committee began offering systematic training to NPC cadres at various levels in 1989 in order to meet the needs of the NPC 's work and make the training of NPC cadres a regular , institutionalized and standard practice .  More than 8,000 cadres have been trained to date .  This has given great impetus to the political , ideological and theoretical development of the ranks of NPC cadres and improved their vocational quality , and is an important contribution to the work of the NPC in the new period .  
The making of these top-level , knowledge-intensive decisions requires that comrades of the NPC must have a high ideological , theoretical and policy level and possess various kinds of scientific and specialized knowledge .  Otherwise they will not be able to formulate distinct , precise , specific and feasible laws and regulations that embody the party 's views , represents the will of the whole nation , and conform with the laws of objective reality , and it will not be possible to make the decisionmaking process more scientific and democratic .  
With regard to the work contents , priority should be given to grasping the ideological and moral education and the training to foster their ability in practice and , through launching healthy , useful , lively , and specific activities , strive to let the patriotic , collective , and socialist ideas be deeply rooted in their young hearts so as to gradually form fine morality and lofty sentiments in their daily conduct , and to constantly enhance their ability in mental and physical work and skills in adapting themselves to society .  
It is necessary to firmly establish a correct outlook on education and qualified personnel , positively promote educational reform and development , take great pains to improve ideological and political education , moral education , education on discipline , and education on legal system , pay attention to the cultivation of enterprising spirit and practical ability , and seriously do a good job of lightening the excessively heavy homework assignments for the students of elementary and middle schools , so as to better promote children 's all-round development .  
Deng Xiaoping first readjusted the past practice of using the social system and ideology as a line of demarcation and advocated proceeding from the national strategic interests in handling state-to-state relations , transcending the similarities and differences in social systems and ideology , giving no thought to historical resentment , refraining from engaging in ideological disputes , and developing relations with all countries in accordance with the norms of international relations .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that to build our party well , we must , in the first place , help our party 's leading cadres at all levels improve their ideological and political quality .  Particularly we must strive to help the middle-aged and young leading cadres improve their ideological and political quality so that they will become a new generation of statesmen who remain loyal to Marxism and unswervingly adhere to the socialist road with Chinese characteristics , and are capable of running the party and the country .  
Second , it expresses their discontent of the West for ignoring Asian ideological traditions all these years .  What is more , it also reflects a kind of anxiety shown by people under the challenge of global economic globalization .  In the present-day world when economic activities become more " interdependent , " it is necessary to consider establishing some moral consensus on the spiritual and cultural levels .  
Correctly understanding their distinctive mentalities and behaviors is the basis for setting the goals , assignments , and requirements and developing the methods for ideological and political construction .  It is also the premise for making ideological and political work more relevant , systematic , and creative .  
The PLA [ People 's Liberation Army ] General Political Department the other day issued a circular demanding that the party committees and political organs at all levels further unify ideological understanding ; strengthen organization and leadership ; earnestly guide in an all-round way the positive education on " three stresses " with Chairman Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " ; and see to it that the education will yield tangible results .  
But we should also be aware that some issues and difficulties do exist in the work of people 's courts , particularly courts at the grassroots level .  The cases in point are their failure to cope with the profound changes in economic , social , ideological , and cultural aspects .  
In the new historical period , Chairman Jiang , based on the developmental changes in the domestic and foreign situation , summarized the new experience in our army 's modernization development , creatively putting forward the scientific concept of " ideological and political development " , stressing that we must put ideological and political development in the premier position among all the army 's development projects , and he gave a series of important instructions in regard to strengthening military ideological and political development under the new situation .  
In accordance with the requirements of Chairman Jiang 's " Two Armings " , the entire military , on the basis of conducting ideological theoretical arming , has put great efforts into strengthening modern science and technology arming , especially arming with high technology knowledge , actively transforming concepts , adjusting work thinking , and putting the focus on cultivating personnel , creating talent , and comprehensively raising the quality of officers and soldiers .  
Facing new situations and tasks , ideological and political development has shouldered heavy responsibilities .  The troops in the entire army will take Chairman Jiang 's important thinking regarding the " three represents " as the guide , constantly reforming , being brave in innovating , and industriously opening up a new page in military ideological and political work .  
The party 's ideological and political work , which has become even more arduous and difficult under the increasingly complicated circumstances , is by no means dispensable or fruitless ; rather , it is indispensable and well worth doing . 
In his speech , Jiang Zemin put forward and expounded on how to understand the historical process of the development of socialism and capitalism , the impact of the practice of China 's socialist reform on people 's thinking , the influence of the contemporary international environment and international political struggle , and other major issues that have a direct bearing on the mental state of cadres and the masses .  He urged all party comrades to jointly conduct in-depth study in an effort to acquire scientific knowledge in the ideological and political sphere .  
The speech was one of great foresight , profound thinking , incisive exposition , and rich content , containing many new thoughts and new viewpoints .  It constitutes an important Marxist document of strategic , overall , and farsighted nature , and it has the important significance of providing guidance on strengthening and improving the party 's ideological and political work , on comprehensively strengthening party building , and on advancing the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Our ideological and political work has not yet adapted to the changing objective circumstances and complicated ideological issues : The problem of " not attaching equal importance to both material and spiritual civilizations " has not been radically resolved in quite a number of localities and departments ; some grassroots party organizations are in a state of weakness and slackness ; problems of unreached areas , unclear goals , and outdated means and approaches are still quite prominent in ideological and political work .  
While inheriting fine traditions , the ideological and political work in the new period has expanded unceasingly in the light of new developments and characteristics and gradually developed a complete set of policies and principles which can be summarized into adherence to Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guide ; 
It is necessary to strive to cultivate an ideological and political contingent that is politically strong , that is professionally competent , that has strict discipline , and that is correct in work style to support their work , to show care in their daily life , to raise their quality , and to even better give play to their roles .  
A great era , magnificent goals , and arduous tasks set demands on us to firmly grasp the central link of the ideological education work .  All are urged to make this central ideological and political work conference a new starting point and a fresh motive force , and to do even better , down-to-earth , and effective ideological and political work .  
It clarifies the historical tasks shouldered by the ideological and political work in the new century .  It profoundly expounds a series of major theoretical and practical issues , which are of fundamental and overall importance in nature .  
We should focus on the understanding of the important status and role played by the ideological and political work in the overall interests of the party and the state .  We should clearly understand the new situation and new issue faced by the ideological and political work .  We also should understand basic Marxist viewpoint and scientific method for correctly revolving these major theoretical and practical issues .  
The circular urged that all units should treat the process of studying and carrying out Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech as a process of strengthening and improving the army 's ideological and political work .  Guided by the speech , they should further deepen the guiding spirit of the political work for the whole army .  We must make efforts to increase the feeling of the current times in our ideological-political work , give it a clearer objective , enable it to produce more tangible benefits , and make it more spontaneous .  
We must strengthen our investigations and studies of the trend of social thinking as well as the characteristics and the rules of changes in thinking among young officers and soldiers .  We must strengthen our studies on major theoretical and practical issues that will have impacts on the thinking activities among officers and soldiers .  We should have an initiative in carrying out the ideological and political work .  
Under conditions in which party work has been a part-time job In the past few years , we have done ideological and political work and engage in production and business operation at the same time and carried out varied and colorful enterprise-cultural activities ; by so doing , we have created a favorable environment full of healthy trends and encouraging people to make progress ; this has increased the cohesion of the enterprise and made the road of party building and ideological and political work broader and broader .  
Since its establishment , the enterprise 's economic efficiency and social effects have developed fast , to which the contribution of the highly effective ideological and political work can not be left unrecognized .  
They should meet the needs of the new situation and new task , make continued efforts to improve and strengthen the ideological and political work .  They must make special efforts to increase the feeling of the current times in our ideological and political work , give it a clearer objective , enable it to produce more tangible benefits , and make it more spontaneous .  They should further enhance the inspiring force , rally force , and fighting capacity of the ideological and political work .  
it should persist in " grasping two links at the same time and giving equal importance to both of them , " vigorously step up the building of the socialist spiritual civilization , strive to improve the ideological and moral standards and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation , bring up a new generation of people who have lofty ideals and moral integrity and who are well-educated and self-disciplined , and create a political atmosphere of respecting knowledge and talented people in the party ;  
Wang Zhaoguo pointed out that the united front has always paid attention to ideological and political work , especially since the Party 's 14th National Congress . With Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core of the Party 's Central Committee and with the ideological and political work of the united front as the key link in rallying and mobilizing people of all realms and all nationalities to bring about the responsibilities of the Party and country , it has effectively mobilized people of all realms to take part in modernization construction and enthusiasm for the glorious national rejuvenation .  
Only when the masses of the people are educated and armed with these two aspects of advanced culture can the Chinese nation 's ideological , ethical , scientific , and cultural qualities be improved unceasingly .  
The pictorial , in vivid visual form and simple language , provides graphic and rich materials for party members to fully understand and grasp the essence of the " three represents " theory .  It is a teaching aid for grass-roots party organizations to step up and improve party ideological and political work .  
The party committees and political organs at all levels of the army and armed police held during their study that , guided by Deng Xiaoping Theory , Chairman Jiang 's important speech has comprehensively analyzed the international and domestic situation and the tasks facing ideological and political work , profoundly explained the important role of ideological and political work in the overall situation of reform , development , and stability , and specifically proposed the guidelines and principles for further strengthening and improving ideological and political work .  
During their studies the officers and men of the army and the armed police pointed out that ours is a people 's army under the party 's absolute leadership , and strong and effective ideological and political work is the political strong point in our development and growth and our cherished magic weapon for defeating the enemy .  We must unswervingly assign ideological and political work the primary position in all work .  
Chen Zhili stressed : While fully affirming our achievements , we must soberly notice that there are still quite pronounced problems facing party building and ideological and political work in colleges and universities and that we are faced with a more complicated situation , heavier tasks , and more arduous work ahead .  
General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech shows great foresight , has the overall situation in view , contains rich and profound ideas , possesses the distinct features of the times , and aims at very definite objectives , which is of momentous practical significance as well as far-reaching historical significance to intensifying and improving the party 's ideological and political work oriented to the new century .  We must study the gist of the speech and put it into practice in a conscientious manner .  
However , we should fully understand the importance , protracted nature , and arduousness of intensifying the building of spiritual civilization , firmly foster the political awareness and the awareness on general interest , responsibility , ideological front , and innovation , and further increase the sense of mission , urgency , and the age , so as to carry out the building of spiritual civilization in a still more vivid , enlivened , and solid way .  
Ding Guangen stressed in his speech that to intensify the building of spiritual civilization , we must seriously study and put into effect the gist of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech , persist in taking Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guide to study how to answer the major strategic questions that have a bearing on the overall situation of developing the party and state 's cause and the major ideological and theoretical questions that are posed in real life and followed by cadres and masses with interest ; 
In this connection , Chang Shanna , a standing committee member , asserted : as far as the personal quality of judges and procurators is concerned , the key factor lies in their political integrity and ideological understanding .  So , in the revision of the two laws , stress should be laid on the academic requirements , and importance should be attached to the improvement of overall quality as well .  
Li Peng pointed out that along with the continuous deepening of reform , opening up , and modernization and the gradual establishment of the socialist market economic structure , relatively great changes have taken place in people 's ideological concepts and lifestyles , and some new conditions and problems have emerged in respect of the marriage and family relations .  Hence , it is extremely necessary to make relevant amendments to the existing Marriage Law .  
It is necessary to thoroughly understand the new and higher demands set by the " three represents " on the building the armed forces ideologically and politically .  It is necessary to further emancipate the mind , update concepts , courageously blaze new trails , and strive to make ideological and political work more lively , solid and effective in light of the new situation and tasks in order to provide a powerful spiritual motive force and a reliable political guarantee for " winning victories " and " preventing degeneration . "  
By grasping the " new reality , " " new problems , " " new demands , " and " new development " in accordance with the demands of the four " close connections , " and carrying out active explorations , we can carry out ideological and political work in a still more vivid and dramatic and effective way .  
The fundamental switch from planned to socialist market economy has brought about tremendous changes in China 's social life and has also set new challenges and demands on ideological and political work .  
To achieve practical results in ideological and political work , it is necessary to closely combine it with the new development of social spiritual and cultural life , and concentrate efforts on masking an issue of " new development " ; we should make efforts to explore a set of effective forms , ways , means , and mechanisms , and continually enhance the attraction and penetration of ideological and political work .  
By grasping the four " new " things , upholding the four " close connections , " and carrying out work in a creative way , ideological and political work will be closer to the era , the masses , and daily life , will be effectively intensified and improved , and will also be able to give fuller play to its role as spiritual motive force and political guarantee .  
All localities and all military units should conscientiously carry out the guiding spirit of the central ideological and political work conference .  They should launch the activities of building spiritual civilization through the joint efforts of servicemen and civilians and promote coordinated development of spiritual and material civilization .  
The speech has been made , the goal has been set , the road has been clearly pointed out , and the key lies in the whole party getting to work to vigorously grasp implementation and carry out ideological and political work in a more extensive , deep-going , vivid and dramatic , and effective way .  
The party 's ideological and political work must be continually strengthened and improved in light of the continually changing reality in the new historical period , and can not be relaxed or weakened in the slightest .  
In vigorously grasping implementation , we must profoundly analyze , from the angle of international and internal history and reality , the objective environment and its basic characteristics which play a role in the ideological activities of the cadres and masses in the new situation , and correctly judge and resolve the major theoretical and practical issues that influence those ideological activities .  
In vigorously grasping implementation , it is necessary to enhance and improve the party 's ideological and political work , and carry out some tangible innovation and improvement in its content , form , method , and means , on the basis of inheriting and carrying forward its fine traditions ; in particular , it is necessary to make big efforts in increasing the sense of the era and enhancing appropriateness , effectiveness , and initiative ; this will become the key point in enhancing and improving ideological and political work in the future .  
We should sum up in good time the new experiences and new understanding gained by the party and the people in the course of practice , give scientific , convincing , and realistic interpretations and explanations of major ideological and theoretical problems raised in practical life which concern the cadres and masses , and give full play to the basic role of theory in ideological and political work .  
Fourth , in close connection with the new development of social spiritual and cultural life , we should make efforts to explore a set of effective forms , methods , means , and mechanisms to continually enhance the attraction and penetration of ideological and political work .  
We must lay stress on forms and methods in ideological and political work , and strive to make it vivid and lively and attractive to the eye and ear ; it should soak into the depths of the heart like life-giving spring breeze and rain , and exert imperceptible influence like a silent lubricant .  
The Chinese Government , acting in accordance with the law , outlawed the " Falungong " cult and harshly censured the criminal elements that broke the law .  Especially after the local authorities ' deep-going and meticulous ideological education and enlightening efforts , the overwhelming majority of " Falungong " exercisers sobered up and awakened .  
strive to research and find answers for new and major strategic issues on the party and national development and major ideological and theoretical issues in practical life the cadres and people are concerned about ; bring into full play the basic role of theory in ideological and theoretical work ; and bring about theoretical progress in promoting social development and realize the value of theory in satisfying the people 's needs .  
The meeting held that upholding and consolidating the guiding position of Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory in the ideological sphere is the fundamental ideological base for ensuring that the party and people of the whole country will strengthen unity and always advance toward the correct direction .  A diverse guiding ideology must absolutely not be allowed .  
The meeting held that in theoretical work , it is necessary to stress the main theme , take the initiative , scientifically and vividly publicize Marxism , and lead the cadres and masses to continually overcome and resist the influence and erosion of wrong , backward , and corrupt ideological education .  
All publicity and ideological bases and spiritual and cultural products must be favorable to publicizing scientific theory , disseminating advanced education , and shaping good minds .  We must not provide the channels of dissemination for wrong things .  
In theoretical work , we must uphold the emancipation of the mind , do practical work , and closely link our work to actual conditions .  We must apply the Marxist stance , viewpoint , and method to make scientific , convincing , and practical explanations of major ideological and theoretical issues that the cadres and masses are concerned about , so as to unify thoughts and forces .  
Yu Yongbo said emphatically : The important speech given by Chairman Jiang at the central ideological and political work conference profoundly expounded on a host of major issues in strengthening and improving the party 's ideological and political work in the new situation .  A policy document of great theoretical and guiding significance , the speech further pointed the way for us to cope with the overall situation of party and government work and to do a good job in ideological and political work in the military .  
At that forum , which was presided over by Nanjing MR Commander Liang Guanglie , Fang Zuqi also reminded the responsible persons from the upper echelons of the party committees in the Nanjing MR to " strengthen and improve ideological and political work in the army " and " make great efforts to provide a powerful mental motive force for winning a war " in the process of making preparations for military struggle .  
It is necessary to build a contingent of ideological and political workers who are politically strong , professionally competent , highly disciplinary , and upright , according to the requirements of improving quality , optimizing the structure , and integrating full-time workers with part-time workers .  
The " three stresses " education has been conducting at party committees above regiment level and grass-roots party organizations , the cohesive and combat forces of party committees at all levels have been generally strengthened , the ideological and political level of the vast number of party members have been raised to a new plane , troops of the whole army have been conducting mass scientific and technological training activities in a down-to-earth way and their capability for defensive battles under modern conditions has been further intensified ;  
Chi Haotian emphasized that we should unswervingly uphold the absolute leadership of the party over the army , vigorously strengthen the ideological and political building of troops , earnestly study Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , earnestly study a series of expositions of Comrade Jiang Zemin , resolutely implement President Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents , " continue conducting the " three stresses " education in a profound way , enhance the ideological and political quality of officers and soldiers , and keep the political color of our army forever .  
promote scientific , civil , progressive ideas and ways of production and living .  We must continue to bring the nation to a higher ideological , ethical , scientific , educational , and cultural level .  We must be disseminators of advanced Chinese culture .  
Social conditions are complex here , the grassroots organizations are weak , the rural propaganda , ideological , and cultural position has not been built effectively , the work style of certain grassroots cadres is rather simple and crude , cadre-masses relations are relatively tense , and rural development and stability have been affected to some extent .  
The Ministry of Public Security has decided to spend one and a half years , starting the second half of this year , in unfolding in all public security organs and among all police personnel across the country an activity of " three educations , " which mainly centers on " education aimed at serving the people wholeheartedly , education on the ideological line of seeking truth from facts , and legal education on strict , just , and civilized enforcement of the law . "  
Many comrades have even given their precious lives !  However , when measured by the standard of the requirement of the " three represents , " our police contingent still lags far behind in terms of its political , ideological , and professional quality , as well as in its discipline and work style .  
When analyzing the current ideological status of the police contingent , Luo Gan noted : Today , some of our police officers have had a distorted outlook on the world , life , and values ; with shaken ideals and convictions , some have become increasingly indifferent to the aim of their work but have developed a strong desire for privileges ;  
On the other hand , in recent years , some local public security organs have concentrated on the building of a material civilization to the neglect of the building of a spiritual civilization and have overlooked and slackened their efforts in promoting their ideological and political work .  
The localities generally say that to carry out educational activities on " thinking of the origin after making a fortune and thinking about making progress after becoming rich " meets the objective need of China 's economic and social development , these activities are a profound ideological emancipation and mobilization at the turn of the centuries , and they are the important contents and effective carrier of the efforts to strengthen and improve the ideological and political work under new circumstances .  
So long as we seize the opportune time to implement the spirit of the central ideological and political work conference , seriously sum up our successful experience of the preceding stage , and earnestly overcome the weak links in our work , we will certainly be able raise the " double thinking " educational activities to a higher level .  
Qiu Xueqiang , director of the Political Department of the Supreme People 's Procuratorate , said : In conducting the " three kinds of education , " we should focus our attention on improving the quality of the procurators ' ranks as a whole , especially their ideological and political quality , so that they will become a force that is united with revolutionary ideals and conviction , that will unswervingly subordinate itself to the interests of the whole , and that is brave in fighting and will not worry the party re any degeneration .  
The forum seriously studied and implemented the spirit of the important speech delivered by General Secretary Jiang Zemin at the Central Ideological and Political Work Conference , discussed how to enhance the convincing and combat effectiveness of theoretical work , how to make ideological and political work more specific and effective , and how to make propaganda , ideological work , and spiritual civilization better serve the development of the west region .  
All the propaganda , ideological , and cultural front and all spiritual and cultural products should publicize scientific theory , spread advanced culture , portray a fine spirit , and encourage healthy social tendencies .  
As officials responsible for " security of their own area , " the party committees and government at all levels should frequently concern themselves with the progress of the investigation and handling of the contradictions and disputes .  Regarding the major contradictions and outstanding problems that might affect social stability , they should personally get involved , go deep into the realities of life , do well meticulous ideological and political work , seriously mitigate the contradictions , and resolve the problems .  
The principal leaders of the party committees and the governments at various levels , as the number one responsible person for " ensuring local peace and stability , " should constantly be concerned about the situation of the contradiction and dispute investigation and mediation work , personally take a hand in handling any major contradictions and conspicuous problems that affect local social stability , go deep into the realities of life , do a thorough and meticulous ideological and political work , and seriously resolve contradictions and problems .  
Our basic missions in strengthening ideological and political education in military academies are to " be victorious at war and not to degrade , " to ensure that we are on the correct path of developing advanced military academies , and to ensure that we can materialize the target of cultivating military professionals with high caliber .  
While paying attention to the pattern of modern education , the " Opinions " have also made use of the PLA 's political superiority .  The " Opinions " have summarized and incorporated the PLA 's basic experiences of strengthening ideological and political education in military academies under new circumstances .  The " Opinions " are currently , and will be for some time in the future , an important guiding document for strengthening ideological and political education in military academies .  
Our basic missions in strengthening ideological and political education in military academies under new circumstances are to " be victorious at war and not to degrade , " to ensure that we are on the correct path of developing advanced military academies , and to ensure that we can materialize the target of cultivating military professionals with high caliber .  
Since the securities commission and its affiliated organizations practiced the vertical management , party committees at all levels have done a lot of work in intensifying the party building and ideological and political work .  However , compared with the duties and missions shouldered by the securities regulatory departments and with the requirements of the party central committee and the State Council , it is still not enough .  
Yan Haiwang said : The intensification of ideological and political work must serve the party 's central work , and the achievements obtained by the securities sector in the ideological and political work must be embodied in the intensified supervision and control , the ensured healthy operation of the securities market , and the accelerated economic reform and development .  
Yan Haiwang stressed that to intensify the ideological and political work , it is imperative to strengthen the leadership , so the leading bodies at all levels must persist in " stressing theoretical study , stressing political awareness , and stressing ethical conduct , " place the ideological and political work in an important position , establish and amplify the ideological and political work responsibility system , make regular study , step up examination , and earnestly " do two types of work simultaneously and attach equal importance to both . "  
( 6 ) carrying out an extensive and thorough education on professional ethics in the entire sector ; in line with the requirements for being " up to the mark in politics , excellent in profession , upright in style , and strict in discipline , " taking the love and respect for work and observation of law and discipline as main contents , intensifying internal management in a bid to further heighten the ideological and political quality and work ability ;  
( 7 ) in light of the five basic requirements that the " leading bodies are staunch and powerful , the party member cadres are pure and up to the mark , the work system of party building is sound , the mechanisms of ideological and political work are perfect , and the work performance is outstanding , " and the three basic conditions of " firm political stand , prominent professional abilities , and excellent work style , " launching activities on creating advanced grassroots party organizations and striving to be fine Communist party members ;  
Each provincial , district , and municipal Party Committee , each higher educational institution operations department Party Committee ( Party Organization ) , and each higher educational institution Party Committee must take further steps in raising understanding and high level emphasis in order to reach the desired ideological goals , vitality goals , and work goals .  
We must treat thorough strengthening of Party building and ideological and political work , upholding Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guide , upholding implementation of consciousness of the Party 's basic line and educational policy , upholding the socialist direction for running a school , strengthening the ideological front , and providing reliable political guarantees and organizational assurances in order to promote reform and development of schools and nurturing of successors for building socialism as the outstanding substance and requirements of " three stresses " education for higher educational institutions .  
The experience the academy has gained in this respect has inherited the glorious tradition of the ideological and political work of the party and PLA , reflects the specific situation and characteristics of the new period , and is marked by innovations and improvements .  It is not only useful to military schools , but also worth drawing on by ordinary institutions of higher learning in various localities .  
As far as the cadet 's ideological and political quality is concerned , the academy holds that a revolutionary ideal embodies a concentrated reflection of the scientific world outlook , philosophy of life , and values , that the military spirit emphasizing the party 's absolute leadership over the PLA is the foundation for ensuring the PLA 's unchanged quality , and that the highly patriotic spirit of dedication is an inexhaustible driving force for service members to take root in the PLA to perform meritorious deeds .  
Confronted with the new situation marked by increasingly frequent updating and upgrade of naval weapon systems and equipment and their constantly rising technological level , the academy has given full play to the leading and service-ensuring roles of the ideological and political work in meeting the requirements of this new situation .  
He indicated that , by insisting on being guided by Deng Xiaoping theory and resolutely implementing the spirit of the 15th Party Congress and various plans from the central authorities , and in keeping with the reality of their own situations , the broad cadres and masses in Heilongjiang and Jilin have struggled hard and forged ahead , producing new achievements in the promotion of economic development , the transformation of the old industrial base , Party-building , the establishment of a democratic legal system , and cultural and ideological development .  
We should care about the old people 's ideology , actively explore new formats and new ways of doing ideological and political work under the new situation , and broadly launch healthy and beneficial cultural and sports activities , so that the masses of old people can enjoy their late years and live a healthy , scientific , and civilized lifestyle .  
According to the current conditions in ideological and political work in the state security organs , Xu Yongyue put forward eight measures for reinforcing and improving ideological and political work , strengthening ideal and belief education , building and managing the cadre contingent , and consolidating leading bodies and grass-roots party organizations .  
The state security organs should continue to carry forward its fine tradition in doing ideological and political work , provide strong and effective political guarantees for the state security work under the new situation , successfully fulfill all tasks assigned by the party central leadership , and triumphantly advance the cause of state security into the 21st century .  
In order to open up a new vista in carrying out ideological and political work , the CPC Central Committee had promulgated the " Several Suggestions of the CPC Central Committee on Strengthening and Improving Ideological and Political Work " in September 1999 .  The institutions of higher learning in Shanghai put forward their views on carrying out ideological and political work on the computer network and in academic organizations and societies and in classrooms .  This is aimed at occupying all educational fields and creating a fine environment for the healthy growth of young students .  
Leading bodies and leading cadres in colleges and universities have universally received education in basic Marxist tenets , party spirit , and party conduct and tempering in relatively strict inner-party political life and thus achieved new improvement in their ideological and political quality .  
Only when great importance is attached to ideological and political work ; the quality of students is improved comprehensively ; and qualified people are turned out can firm ideals and conviction as well as a firm orientation of running a school be embodied .  
In its effort to strengthen leading body construction and ideological and political work and build itself into a domestically first-class and internationally renown university , Beijing Institute of Technology conscientiously worked out numerous rules and regulations and adopted a lot of effective and practical measures .  After its rectification and reform plan was made public , the masses responded to it strongly and maintained that leaders of the institute had grasped the crux of the matter and something significant could be achieved in its development .  
Ding Guangen said : Building civilized communities is urgently needed for enhancing the ideological and political work and building a spiritual civilization , for gearing up our urban construction and management , for improving the living environment of residents and safeguarding social and political stability , and for building close party-mass ties and consolidating the foundation of our party as a ruling party .  
It successively formulated regulations for prevention , admonition , warning , and penalties .  Various supervision measures were combined properly and implemented comprehensively .  Through more intensive ideological education , stricter internal supervision inside the leading bodies , effective organizational adjustments , and serious handling of problems and cases , the sense of self-discipline among leading cadres was raised and the effectiveness of organizational supervision was also enhanced .  
Efforts should be taken to make the warning education a success , for it is a major content of our current efforts to strengthen the ideological and political work and it has a close inherent link with the task of thoroughgoingly conducting the " three-stresses " education .  
In line with Chairman Jiang 's important instructions , the all-military political work meeting has put forward the historical missions of ideological and political construction in the military in the new situation - - to provide powerful spiritual motivation for winning future high-tech wars , and to provide a reliable political guarantee for maintaining the nature , inherent qualities , and style of the people 's military .  
According to reports , along the journey of advancing into the new century , all units of the military have rode on the strong east wind of the central ideological and political work meeting , earnestly acted in the spirit of Chairman Jiang 's important speech , and with higher standard and full of enthusiasm , striven to produce new results in strengthening and improving ideological and political education in the armed forces and to create a new situation .  
The people 's courts should constantly maintain and carry forward the superiority of ideological and political work and realistically ensure the implementation of the party 's line , principles , and policies in the course of doing adjudication work , so as to forcefully provide judicial guarantees and good legal services for the progress of reform , the maintenance of stability , and the sustained , fast , and healthy development of the national economy .  
Xiao Yang said that money worship , hedonism , out-and-out egoism , the concept of special privileges , and some other negative and decadent ideas may certainly affect and corrode the contingent of judges under the current circumstances where the economic strategies at home and abroad are under restructuring and continuous changing and where contradictions and struggles in the ideological arena are getting sharper with each passing day .  
While carrying out ideological and political work , the people 's courts at various levels should ceaselessly strengthen education in communist ideals .  Under the conditions for strengthening the market economy , courts should pay attention to cultivating and enhancing judges ' moral quality and lay a solid foundation for the broad masses of cadres and policemen to justly enforce the law and work diligently for the people .  
At this critical juncture , when China is moving from the 20th century toward the 21st century , we must make material progress and cultural and ideological progress a uniform goal to strive for , unfailingly insisting on concentrating on both aspects .  We must put comprehensive social development in a strategic position , achieving the mutually-coordinated and sustainable development of the economy and society .  
General Secretary Jiang 's important speech at the central ideological and political work meeting , from a higher starting point , with a broader vision , and in a deeper sense , has brought to light the profound historical background , complicated social environment , and many other formidable challenges facing ideological and political work , and has raised our understanding of the life-line position of ideological and political work to the new height .  
The most fundamental and basic step to firm up our ideals and convictions is to unremittingly educate and arm the troops with Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping theory , in order to lay a solid ideological and theoretical foundation among the vast numbers of officers and men .  
The Central Propaganda Department held a meeting a few days ago to conscientiously study the spirit of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech on the grand western development , stressing that the propaganda , ideological , and cultural fronts should resolutely carry out the strategic arrangements of the central authorities , show concern for the grand development , conduct propaganda on the grand development , give support to the grand development , stress political awareness , concentrate energies on implementation , bring real drive into full play , and do practical things for the grand western development .  
Fabricating preposterous , bizarre , and astounding crooked theories and heretical doctrines and creating ideological disorder is the usual practice of all leaders of cults , who sail under false colors and hoodwink the masses .  
He expressed the hope that the youth of religious circles will carry forward and promote the fine traditions of religious personages of the older generation in loving their country and religion ; unswervingly uphold the principle of independent , autonomous , and self-run churches ; conscientiously resist the political and ideological infiltration of foreign forces through religion ; establish a good image of religious practitioners ; unite the youth of religious circles ; inspire greater enthusiasm for building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Remarkable changes have been noticed in the ideological thinking , discipline , and work style of the country 's police contingent ; the unifying force and the competitive effectiveness of the contingent have both been enhanced on a constant basis ; and the vast numbers of public security personnel and police officers have stood the test of severe and complicated struggles , and have made outstanding contribution to safeguarding the state security , to ensuring a sound social and political stability , and to maintaining a stable public order .  
The whole army should use as its guidance Chairman Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " as well as on strengthening the armed forces and improving their training through science and technology .  In light of the military strategic principle in the new period as well as the goal of realizing the preparations for military struggle , the whole army should continuously deepen its ideological understanding .  In addition , the whole army should ensure that it follows correct orientation during the whole process of training of troops through science and technology .  
We should take Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory as guidance , adhere to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , and use the broad vision of historical materialism and dialectical materialism to observe the world , understand the overall situation , study new issues and sum up new experiences in order to continuously improve the party 's level of administration and improve its ability in controlling the overall situation of economic and social development .  
The development of rural scientific , technological , and educational undertakings and the enhancement of peasants ' ideological and moral level as well as their scientific and cultural standard are the crucial links of implementing the strategy of invigorating agriculture on the strength of science and education and bringing about the change from traditional agriculture to modern agriculture , and also the important contents and guarantee for building the new socialist rural areas , which are the eager aspirations of the vast number of peasants too .  
We must make the development of material progress and cultural and ideological progress a unified fighting goal , always concentrating on both jobs and attaching equal importance to both to satisfy the ever-growing , multifaceted cultural and ideological needs of the people , achieving an overall improvement in the quality of the people and enhancing national solidarity .  
Deng Xiaoping Theory has provided the powerful ideological weapon for our party to understand the world and remold the world , and it is also the spiritual dynamic to gather and inspire the entire party and people of the whole country to attain the common ideal and promote overall social progress .  
We should give full consideration to the characteristics of the ideological work , which should be adapted to the requirements of the socialist market economic system and which should be conducive to strengthening party leadership , to giving full play to the initiative of propaganda and cultural workers , and to promoting the development and prosperity of various undertakings .  We should publish more works of excellence to satisfy the increasing spiritual and cultural needs of the people .  
All activities in connection with the ideological and political education must meet the basic requirements of the four kinds of education , namely , education in patriotic dedication , education in the revolutionary philosophy of life , education aimed at respecting cadres and loving soldiers , and education about the need for hard struggle .  
The " Opinion " puts forth the following demands : Political organs at all levels must have the ability to correctly analyze and understand the state of mind of officers and men in their respective units and make prompt suggestions on how to educate them , ability to give theoretical guidance and to study and solve hot and difficult issues , ability to discover typical examples and sum up experience , and ability to conduct the ideological and political education innovatively in accordance with the actual situation .  
We must seize historical opportunities , accelerate reform and development of the journalistic cause , increase strength and vitality , win over the masses , and occupy the market .  We must make General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's " Three Represents " as a major ideological guide , earnestly promote the building of the ranks of journalist workers , so that our journalistic workers will become honest recorders of the progress of the times and become active builders of material and spiritual civilizations .  
Hu Jintao pointed out that the ideas of " how to understand four things " put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin involve important theoretical and strategic issues of the contemporary general trends of development of China and the world , are basic questions that must be correctly answered by means of theoretical research on scientific socialism , and are also issues of ideological understanding at a deeper level which the broad masses of party members and cadres are concerned about .  
Zhang Quanjing pointed out that in conducting the activities of " reviewing the past , " we should lay special stress on the examination of our ideological and political level to see if it has been remarkably enhanced ; of the implementation of the central authorities ' line , principles , and policies to see if they have been carried out unrelentingly ; of the problems that have been checked out and laid bare earlier on , especially the problems that have evoked strong repercussions among the masses , to see if they have been resolved ;  
With regard to the leading groups and leading cadres who failed to distinctly enhance their ideological understanding , fully mobilize the masses , and properly resolve their conspicuous problems earlier on , they should be examined one by one in the current activities of " reviewing the past " to have them resolved in a conscientious way .  As regards the problems which have been settled during the concentrated " three stresses " education but have cropped up again , solution should be worked out through intensified education , appropriate criticism , and proper handling .  
They should fully recognize the importance of properly carrying out " three stresses " education in colleges and universities in accordance with the requirements of the " three represents " and from the strategic vantage point of making ideological , political , and organizational preparations for the challenges in the new century .  They should make active efforts to do a good job in every stage of their work , continuously raise their ideological awareness , and make genuine efforts to prevent and overcome jaded and lackadaisical feelings .  
Various localities should make conscientious efforts to build leading bodies at all levels , focusing on improving their ideological and political qualities , while working earnestly to meet the objectives and requirements set forth by the central authorities .  
with the " Three Represents " as an important ideological guidance , conscientiously implementing the spirit set forth at the 15th Party Congress , at the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee , and at the Central Economic Work Conference ; making strenuous efforts to help maintain social and political stability ; aggressively building up the political and legal ranks ; promoting judicial reforms ; ensuring strict and fair enforcement of the law ; and providing effective legal guarantees for the smooth execution of the Tenth Five-Year Plan and for reform and development .  
General Party Secretary Jiang Zemin pointed out that theoretical building is the basis for Party building , theoretical quality is the soul of the ideological and political quality of leading cadres , and strengthening the study of Marxist theory is still an urgent and important task confronting the whole party which must be pushed forward in a persistent way .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : The united front has assembled a large number of intellectuals , experts , and scholars who have been playing an important role in inheriting and developing the fine cultural tradition of the Chinese nation , learning from and drawing on the advanced scientific , technological , and cultural achievements of other countries , and improving the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the whole nation .  
We must hold high the banner of patriotism and socialism , combine the advanced and extensive requirements , and strive to give play to the united front 's positive role in advancing cultural construction ; at the same time , we must strengthen ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural construction within the united front , and promote the firm establishment of common ideals and moral pillars in society as a whole and the improvement of the whole nation 's scientific and cultural qualities .  
We must take further steps to integrate ideology with the Central Committee 's plans and requirements , increase understanding , strengthen confidence , take hold of opportunities , take prompt action , and conscientiously launch this round of study and educational activities in order to provide strong ideological and organizational assurances for progress in agricultural , rural , and peasant work .  
The various Party Committee levels must take firm hold of the beneficial opportunity afforded by this round of study and educational activities , blend the important " three represents " ideological study and education with the frequent work needed for grassroots organization building and work hard to start new aspects of rural grassroots organization building work .  
These associations have not only become new forces , but have also played a more important role in supporting and developing poor areas , serving the community , carrying out ideological and political work in the grass roots , and building democracy , the legal system , and socialist spiritual civilization .  
On the one hand , as a socialist country , China upholds the principal role of public ownership in the economic field , adheres to the leading position of the CPC in the political field , and persists in the guiding role of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory in the ideological and cultural fields .  The people 's uniformity has tremendously increased in terms of fundamental interests , common ideals , and target of endeavor .  
The " four educations " proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin has grasped the fundamental issues which need to be urgently resolved in the ideological and political building of the army under the new historical conditions and embody a high degree of integration between political steadfastness and ideological and moral purity and between carrying forward the excellent traditions and propagating the spirit of the times .  It is also the basic engineering work and path for strengthening the ideological and political building of the army in the new era .  
Revolving around the political steadfastness and ideological and moral purity of troops , the entire military and armed police force regard resisting " red lanterns and green wine " [ feasting and revelry ] and preventing the erosion of decadent ideology and culture as a breakthrough point to vigorously grasp the education and consolidation of ideologies , styles , and disciplines as well as the internal and external relations .  
They focus on establishing the correct world outlook , life outlook , and concept of value to vigorously improve the ideological and political quality of officers and soldiers , regard cadres , especially cadres at senior and intermediate levels , as focal points to employ the spirit of rectifying work styles to resolve those outstanding issues in the aspects of party styles , clean and honest administrations , and revolutionary integrity , thus conducting the " four educations " in a vivid and lively manner and a solid and effective manner .  
( III ) In the face of the complex and changeable international situation and the new situation of various ideologies and cultures surging against each other and the contradictions and struggles in the ideological and political realm being very complicated , what to grasp and how to grasp the ideological and political building is an issue which has a bearing on what kind of mental outlook the Party , the country , and the military should meet for the challenges of the 21st Century .  
The fruitful achievements of the " four educations " in the People 's Liberation Army and the armed police force have provided beneficial inspiration for strengthening and improving the ideological and political work in our Party and our military during the new historical period .  
As a fundamental engineering project of strengthening the ideological and political building of the army during the new era , the " four educations " have answered and resolved a series of fundamental issues about affirming revolutionary ideals and convictions like how to propagate the excellent traditions during the new era , how to lay a solid ideological foundation for establishing oneself and conducting oneself in life , and so on .  
Over the educational practice of the last six years , the party committees and political organs at all levels of the entire military and the armed police force have justifiably and loudly upheld high quality and style , explained well large principles , propagated advanced things and developed healthy tendencies in a large way , and refuted erroneous ways and rectified unhealthy tendencies in a clear-cut manner , thus creating a strong public opinion and excellent ideological atmosphere about taking the overall situation into consideration , emphasizing the dedication , and observing disciplines .  
Jia Qinglin stressed that the general requirement for the work of elderly cadres in the Beijing Municipality in a period of time to come should be closely revolving round the overall situation of the capital 's work and focusing on grasping well the political treatment and living treatment for elder cadres to fulfill all policies for elderly cadres , strengthen their ideological and political work , and strive to create excellent conditions for the care , medical treatment , teaching , learning , activities , and entertainment of elder cadres .  
and offer active cooperation to party and government authorities and other departments concerned in order to solve their practical difficulties and problems , make a good job of ideological education for employees in a patient and meticulous manner , and prevent any conflicts from intensifying and triggering incidents of a mass nature .  
We must uphold economic development as the center , and integrate spiritual civilization construction work with city and rural development work , as well as with business work for all industries and trades .  We must put efforts into raising the ideological and moral quality of people , and also their science and cultural quality , thus providing spiritual motivation and ideological assurance for modernization construction .  
can we ensure that the party 's line , principles , and policies can be put into effect in every aspect of our work and among the masses ; can we promptly eliminate and overcome the disturbances of erroneous stuffs of various kinds ; and can we consolidate and develop the ideological and political foundation for the common struggle that are currently carried out by the people of all nationalities throughout the country , and can we subsequently provide a strong driving power and a powerful guarantee for our economic work as well as work in other fields .  
We must fully understand the great guiding significance of the important " three represents " thinking to promoting good party style and ethical integrity and to deepening the anti-corruption struggle .  We must work according to the " three represents " requirements , conceive , plan and do the work of combating corruption and encouraging ethical integrity by even higher standards , further raise the level of our ideological understanding and work guidance , constantly further the work of promoting good party style and ethical integrity , and score even greater success in it .  
To counter the problems that exist in the implementation of the Criminal Procedure Law , Hou Zongbin said , further efforts should be made to solve the problems of ideological understanding in a bid to genuinely change the erroneous law-enforcement concepts that exist among a considerable number of units and public security cadres and officers , such as " valuing a substantive law more than a procedural law , " and foster a law-enforcement concept of laying equal emphasis on both the substantive law and the procedural law .  
The comrades attending the forum freely shared what they had learned from studying Comrade Jiang Zemin 's expositions on the party 's ideological style , style of study , and style of work in the context of their own work practice and the special subjects they had studied .  They came to a consensual understanding that the building of the party 's style is not only an inherent requirement of the " three represents , " but also an important safeguard for practicing the " three represents . "  
Through patient , meticulous and earnest ideological and political work over the past year and more , the overwhelming majority of Falungong followers have come to recognize Li Hongzhi 's true features , left the Falungong of their own accord and returned to their normal work , study and life .  
Toward Li Hongzhi and his followers who stayed behind the scene , fled overseas and surrendered to anti-China forces of the west , we must continue to expose and criticize them , expose their sinister political schemes and ugly cult nature to the light of day , create an ambiance of social justice , where they are chased by all like rats scurrying across the street , and thoroughly eliminate the ideological influence and social foundation of the Falungong .
