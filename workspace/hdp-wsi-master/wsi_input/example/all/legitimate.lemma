In the meantime , the Chinese Government repeatedly issued stern statements to express its determination to adhere to the principle of one China and foiled all kinds of schemes of so-called " dual recognition " plotted by certain anti-China western forces .

The Assembly will agree with me that the generally proper and legitimate election , the peaceful behaviour of the vast majority of the national political class , the courageous and responsible attitude of the people of Benin and the unwavering rigour of the Constitutional Court are telling signs of genuine political maturity and an irreversible commitment to building a truly democratic society in the Republic of Benin .  
Recalling the paramount importance of the bilateral talks mediated by some powers with legitimate interests in facilitating a comprehensive solution to the situation in the Middle East , the Brazilian delegation also pays tribute to the indisputable role the United Nations has been playing over the years in this field , not only by means of peacekeeping , but also through economic , social and humanitarian assistance .  
Hence , we emphasize the importance of making rapid progress towards a final settlement , which would ensure that the Palestinian people is granted its legitimate rights , especially its right to self-determination and to establish an independent state with Al-Quds as its capital , in accordance with relevant international resolutions and the basic principles of the Madrid Conference .  
We would like to emphasize , however in accordance with statements made by the Heads of State and Government of the Ibero-American Conference recently held in Chile that it is our position that the problems of that region must be solved in accordance with the constructive spirit of the agreements concluded between the parties involved , while protecting the legitimate rights of all the inhabitants and guaranteeing access to holy places , in full respect of international law .  
It establishes clearly , among other elements , the link and interdependence that exists between the processes of nuclear and conventional disarmament , conventional disarmament at the global level , the specific features of each region which must be taken into account the need for initiatives and participation by all States of the region concerned in the search for agreements on regional disarmament , and the danger posed by the excessive accumulation of weapons by States over and above their legitimate defence needs .  
With regard to the assets freeze imposed under resolution 883 ( 1993 ) , at its 43rd meeting , on 4 May 1994 , the Committee authorized the Chairman to convey to all States and international organizations its decision by which it stated that the transfer of funds through Libyan blocked accounts for legitimate diplomatic missions and international organizations in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , was , as an exception , permissible in terms of resolution 883 ( 1993 ) .  
Such problems include breaches of basic discipline such as the non-wearing of uniforms and lack of proper identification on vehicles ; the bearing of arms while off duty ; the disproportionate use of force in carrying out police duties ; lack of experience in the legitimate use of firearms ; inappropriate methods of crowd control ; and insufficient use of techniques for the peaceful settlement of disputes .  
In his report to the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , the Secretary-General had stated that the lives of millions of Iraqis were threatened by hunger , which had not deterred the Power that currently dominated the world from deliberately ignoring the humanitarian and legal aspects of such threats or from using the pretext of human rights to serve its political purposes and seeking to overthrow the current legitimate Government of Iraq .  
Expresses deep concern at the slow pace of quartering and disarming UNITA troops , notes the public commitment by UNITA to quarter its troops in an expeditious and comprehensive fashion and reiterates its conviction that the quartering of UNITA forces , as the first step in its transformation to a legitimate political party , is a crucial component of the peace process ;

Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
The Council recalls the resolutions adopted by Arab Summit Conferences , particularly the most recent Conference held in Cairo , which reaffirmed the commitment to a just , comprehensive and lasting peace , based on legitimate international resolutions and the principle of land for peace , in view of the fact that peace is a strategic choice for the Arab community of nations .  
This trust fund was established pursuant to Security Council resolution 940 ( 1994 ) to assist the legitimate constitutional authorities of Haiti in establishing an environment conducive to the organization of free and fair legislative elections to be called by those authorities and , when requested by them , monitored by the United Nations , in cooperation with the Organization of American States ( OAS ) .  
Recognizing that the export / import mechanism is not a regime for international licensing , but rather for the timely provision of information by States in which companies are located which are contemplating sales or supplies to Iraq of items covered by the plans for ongoing monitoring and verification and will not impede Iraq 's legitimate right to import or export for non-proscribed purposes , items and technology necessary for the promotion of its economic and social development ,  
Recognizing that the export / import mechanism is not a regime for international licensing , but rather for the timely provision of information by States in which companies are located which are contemplating sales or supplies to Iraq of items covered by the plans for ongoing monitoring and verification and will not impede Iraq 's legitimate right to import or export for non-proscribed purposes , items and technology necessary for the promotion of its economic and social development ,  
The Governments recognized the sovereign right and legitimate interest of each country to safeguard its boundaries and to enforce its own immigration laws , always observing strict respect for the human rights of the migrants , as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and other relevant international instruments , irrespective of their nationality , race , age , religion , sex or immigration status . 
In conveying to you once again our pride in and deep appreciation for your dedicated and constructive efforts and the conspicuous and honourable positions you have taken in support of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people , I am hopeful that your worthy endeavours will be crowned with success so that we may achieve the desired peace based on justice , equality and respect for human rights . 
In the field of labour a major method is racketeering , a term used to describe a variety of tactics such as engaging in fraudulent deals or extortion through intimidation and blackmail or the abuse of legitimate positions for illegitimate ends , as in the case of businessmen or labour union and government officials .  In the field of vice , organized crime engages in trafficking in women , which involves international prostitution and sexual slavery .  
In a confidential assessment completed by the Australian Federal Police , it was noted that Italian organized criminal organizations had penetrated a number of government and non-government agencies and at least one political party and had entrenched themselves in legitimate business to give themselves an air of respectability . 7 Even when they have not achieved this level of penetration , transplanted criminal organizations can still pose formidable challenges to law enforcement , as Chinese organized criminal organizations seem to be doing in South Africa and Russian organized criminal organizations are doing throughout much of Europe . 
On the contrary , this threat is an inevitable consequence of the activities of organizations that deny the State its legitimate monopoly of violence , corrupt State institutions , undermine the rule of law , threaten the integrity of financial and commercial sectors of society , contravene legal and social norms and conventions , transgress national sovereignty and violate national borders . 
The challenge is made more daunting by the fact that such organizations are a complex mix , with various shapes and sizes , intersecting in multiple ways with the legitimate economy and society , simultaneously amorphous and concrete , and engaged in corruption , as well as coercion and confrontation , depending on exigencies and opportunities .  
This requires : complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan to the line of 4 June 1967 ; complete and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa to the internationally recognized boundaries ; the complete withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Palestinian territories , including Arab Jerusalem ; and recognition of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people , including its right to exercise self-determination and establish an independent State on its own soil . 
The attending Heads of State and Government had received a delegation of the Coordinating Committee of the Diplomatic Front for Timorese Resistance and had reiterated that they were ready to promote concerted action to guarantee respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in East Timor and a just , comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution that would achieve respect for the legitimate rights and aspirations of its people in conformity with international law .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Although the Special Envoy received commitments from all the parties to attend talks , the new political environment resulting from developments in March-April ( presidential and legislative elections in the Sudan ; realignment of certain southern movements with the Government ) prevented their actual resumption owing to the absence of recognized , legitimate interlocutors among the parties concerned .  
His delegation believed that terrorism could be defined as the commission of acts of murder , assassination , bombing , hostage-taking or the seizure of aircraft or ships in order to provoke a state of terror for political purposes , whether by individuals or States and whether against other individuals or other States , in circumstances other than those of legitimate armed conflict for liberation from all forms of foreign domination or from colonial , occupying , racist or other forces , and , in particular , when undertaken by liberation movements recognized by regional and international organizations .  
The Secretary-General 's programme to achieve staff reductions deserved support in that it sought to preserve organizational viability and performance with minimum negative impact on the international civil service and the legitimate career expectations of staff .  
On the question of an increase in permanent membership , many States have retained an open mind , asking legitimate questions regarding the criteria on which to base such a decision , now and in the future , for any course of action adopted will , in fact , establish a precedent .  Can the historical realities which influenced the Council 's composition 50 years ago be paralleled or matched in any way by present contingencies ?  
His Government was deeply concerned at the lack of progress towards democratization and the continuing violation of human rights in Myanmar , particularly the continuing detention of political prisoners under very harsh conditions , the use of forced labour , the forced displacement of ethnic communities and the ongoing harassment of those engaged in legitimate political activity .  
Yemen reaffirms the need to move quickly towards a final settlement of the question of Palestine that will allow the Palestinian people to attain their legitimate rights , especially their right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital , in keeping with international law and with the fundamental principles established at the Madrid Conference and in the Oslo and subsequent agreements .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Kenya shares the legitimate concerns of many Member States regarding the need to minimize the operational costs of the institutions we have created and to adopt an evolutionary and cost-effective approach that takes into account the increasing financial difficulties of Governments in providing for institutional development at the international level .  We believe , however , that it is crucial for the international community to provide these new institutions with sufficient resources to enable them to discharge their important functions .  
The future of the Maghreb countries could be assured only within a strong , united and homogeneous union capable of meeting the legitimate expectations of the peoples of the region .  
But would it be outrageous to say that it is not completely true either , because it is obvious that in Africa there exist countries whose development level is already allowing them to cherish some legitimate commercial and trade ambitions on the international market as well as countries that still require assistance , at least in certain areas , and particularly in the social area . 
Only substantive consideration by the Council of the legitimate interests and concerns expressed by Member States during the debates can accurately guide the Council in its work and provide it with the necessary and impartial information that will enable it to assess the real causes of conflicts , counteract their consequences and take action to find just and lasting solutions , free from politically motivated prejudices and not dominated by the illegitimate interests of just one country or a small group of countries .  
Today , as we celebrate the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People , my delegation would like to express to the Chairman and members of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People its appreciation for the role it has played in mobilizing international public opinion in support of the Palestinian people in their legitimate and just struggle to regain their inalienable rights to self-determination and to establish their own independent State on their national soil .  
The time has come for us all to display the necessary political will and determination in order to reach agreement on a comprehensive set of measures which will lead to the creation of a Security Council which is transparent , democratic , accountable and thus credible and legitimate .  
We hope in particular that the United Nations-system organizations involved in humanitarian assistance do not lose sight of the legitimate requirements of the United Nations in providing humanitarian assistance to encourage the States concerned to pursue a national policy in accordance with the purposes and basic principles of the United Nations Charter and various international legal regimes , such as , in particular , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , which all Members of the United Nations and the international community as a whole are to promote .  
In considering the allocation of resources to disarmament , the United Nations should not only take into account the priority which this necessitates and the high emphasis given to it by the entire international community ; it should also be focused on the work that is already being done and still needs to be done by the international community on the future agenda to eliminate all weapons of mass destruction and to halt the proliferation of conventional weapons beyond the legitimate requirements of self-defence .  
The Ministers asserted that the establishment of truly cooperative relations between regional parties in the Middle East was subject to complete Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab land , and the achievement by the Palestinian people of their legitimate national rights , in order that a climate of peace , security and stability could prevail in the region .  
Considering the crucial importance of financial investigations designed to target the wealth of organized crime and thereby deprive it of one of the most important means of its power , the working group agreed that measures could be implemented to detect and monitor the physical transportation of cash and bearer negotiable instruments at the border , subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper use of information thereby obtained and without impeding in any way the freedom of movement of legitimate capital .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
States , in cooperation with relevant international organizations , where appropriate , should not promote or allow the storage or disposal of high-level , intermediate-level and low-level radioactive wastes near the marine environment unless they determine that scientific evidence , consistent with the applicable internationally agreed principles and guidelines , shows that such storage or disposal poses no unacceptable risk to people and the marine environment or does not interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea .  
The implication that incitement to violence and violence itself is a legitimate and understandable response to political differences is irresponsible in the extreme and can only be considered complicity in the repeated deliberate attempts to escalate artificially violence in the territories .  
States , in cooperation with relevant international organizations , where appropriate , should not promote or allow the storage or disposal of high-level , intermediate-level or low-level radioactive wastes near the marine environment unless they determine that scientific evidence , consistent with the applicable internationally agreed principles and guidelines , shows that such storage or disposal poses no unacceptable risk to people or the marine environment and does not interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea .  
May I recall , in this respect , my letter to your predecessor ( A / 50 / 216-S / 1995 / 476 ) dated 9 June 1995 , with which I brought to his attention the similar threats , expressed at the highest and most official political level in Turkey through the resolution adopted on 8 June 1995 by the Turkish National Assembly , empowering the Turkish Government to declare war if Greece implemented the Convention on the Law of the Sea and exercised her legitimate right to extend her national territorial waters to 12 miles . 
China is in favour of imposing strict and feasible restrictions on anti-personnel landmines and their use , with a view to achieving the objective of an ultimate ban in a step-by-step manner .  In order to meet its legitimate defence requirements , China can not but reserve its legitimate right to use anti-personnel landmines on its own territories before alternative means are found and defensive capabilities established .  
It has never engaged in overseas aggression , nor does it have any intention of using landmines in other countries .  Should China use anti-personnel landmines in legitimate circumstances , it would be entirely for the purpose of defending against foreign military intervention and aggression , safeguarding its national unification and territorial integrity , and ensuring a peaceful life for its own people .  
Thirdly , it is necessary to prevent a small number of countries taking advantage of their advanced military technology and economic power to seek their absolute security and military superiority over others while they focus the target of disarmament on the developing countries and deprive them of their legitimate right and means of self-defence .  Fourthly , the countries with the largest and most sophisticated conventional and nuclear arsenals should continue to bear special responsibility for disarmament .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
My delegation would like once again to reaffirm its profound wish to support any international initiatives that could genuinely help to find more effective solutions to the humanitarian problems stemming from the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of mines which at the same time protect the legitimate national security interests of States making use of such weapons for strictly defensive purposes and in compliance with all international provisions that apply to such weapons .  
Lastly , we would like to place on record that we joined in the consensus on this resolution on the understanding that any negotiating exercise that may take place in the immediate future must ensure that a requisite and necessary balance be struck between humanitarian concerns and the legitimate security interests of the States concerned .  
Ecuador will continue to participate in these talks , motivated by a true spirit of peace , because we desire a global , final , honourable and realistic solution that reflects the legitimate expectations of our people , which , together with the other peoples of the Americas , are seeking to create a future of mutual benefit and constructive and peaceful cooperation .  
The second point is the upholding of a just and comprehensive peace as a strategic choice and objective on the basis of the principles of the peace process , and in particular of the relevant Security Council resolutions , the principle of land for peace and the attainment of the legitimate political rights of the Palestinian people , and a reaffirmation of complete Arab solidarity with this position .  
These disturbing trends are in contrast with the global consensus that has emerged during major international conferences organized over the past decade under the auspices of the United Nations . They raise legitimate questions as to the very future of the system established to organize international cooperation for development .  
Given the noble and legitimate aspirations of the entire international community for the future of the planet , the Organization certainly needs to be renewed in order to confront effectively and successfully the exciting yet disturbing challenges posed by globalization .  
We therefore support the set of constructive and objective proposals put forward by the members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , which take cognizance of the realities of change , the results of the political developments witnessed by today \ x { e5b8 } world and the legitimate concerns of the developing countries in keeping with the concepts of the Charter and of the rules of international law .  
Subsequent developments have continued to be positive , and in 1997 we are witnessing for the first time in many years a Central America free of armed conflict , with legitimate Governments chosen through the free expression of popular will in transparent and pluralistic elections , thus strengthening democratic institutions and , as result , the rule of law . 
Thus , we have taken the first step in a broad and complex process that can bring us closer to the vision of a Central American Union , with the ultimate goal of producing the concrete results sought by our populations : overcoming poverty , creating opportunities , increasing the number of jobs , activating our production capacity , increasing our competitiveness , equitable and unified participation in the benefits of development , genuine democratization , equitable access to an efficient system of justice and the legitimate enjoyment of peaceful coexistence .  
This has preserved and duly protected the right of legitimate defence , both individual and collective , provided for in Article 51 of the Charter a right that my country believes is one of the pillars underlying international coexistence and a guarantee for the respect of the territorial integrity of States .  
With regard to the defensive use of these devices for the sole purpose of protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity , we concur with the views expressed in the ministerial communiqu of the Non-Aligned Movement of 25 September 1997 , which underlined that any negotiations or agreements thereon should take into account the legitimate security concerns of States as well as their legitimate rights under the Charter of the United Nations .  
This peace was pursued on the basis of the mutual recognition of the legitimate rights of both peoples and their desire to live in peaceful coexistence and mutual dignity and security and to achieve a just , lasting and comprehensive peace settlement and a historic reconciliation through the agreed political process .  
Regrettably , the continuing military occupation by Israeli forces of large areas of Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , the presence of a large number of armed settlers in the occupied territories , the frequent roadblocks and boundary closures and the serious damage caused to the Palestinian economy all of them unilateral measures have a negative impact on the search for a just and peaceful settlement that respects the legitimate rights and claims of all the parties .  
Arab leaders have repeatedly affirmed their insistence on the peace option as a strategic and political goal , provided that it is based on the principle of land for peace , on respect for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people in particular its right to establish an independent State of its own and on Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories on the basis of binding international resolutions .  
We also express our commitment to all the various tracks of the peace process without exception , with a view to guaranteeing Israel 's total withdrawal from all occupied Arab and Palestinian territories , including the Syrian Golan , southern Lebanon and the Beka'a valley , and respect by Israel for international law and for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people , including its rights to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State on its national territory , with Al-Quds as its capital .  
Optimism , combined with an awareness of the enormous task ahead , will be necessary in creating an environment in which the people of Guatemala are able , among other things , to exercise their legitimate civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
An express and clear incitement to hatred or to the use of violence that poses a clear and imminent danger to the legitimate interests of the State and all of its citizens calls for the State to take strong action to protect all human rights as well as national security and public order , bearing in mind the necessity and proportionality of those measures in relation to the threat posed .  
With regard to new article W , the representative of Germany stated that his delegation placed mental brackets on the adoption by consensus of new article W . His delegation reserved its final position with the understanding that either lawfully and openly or from a legitimate source would be removed from the present wording . 
Therefore , the members of such groups should either be covered by the conditions applicable to popular armed resistance groups , thereby subjecting them to the provisions and obligations of international humanitarian law to a certain extent , or should be regarded as groups that fail to meet the international requirements for classification as legal combatants , either as members of a regular army or a legitimate resistance movement , in which case , being totally beyond the pale of the law , there would be no point in placing them under any obligation . 
It was the Greek Cypriot armed onslaught in December 1963 against the Turkish Cypriot people and the bi-communal order that led to division on the island when the Turkish Cypriot people were forced to live in enclaves , deprived of all basic necessities and fundamental human rights , for 11 years prior to the legitimate Turkish intervention of 1974 .  
At the same tie , however , the legitimate wishes of many States to combat international terrorism were being held hostage by the double standards of powerful countries that preached against terrorism even as they impeded the negotiations on the draft Convention on the matter with all the diplomatic means and political pressure at their disposal , thus blocking the adoption of the clear and all-inclusive definition of terrorism that was needed and an unequivocal and impartial condemnation . 
No comparison should be drawn between the legitimate struggle of peoples against colonial or foreign domination , and terrorist acts instigated , organized , directed or financed by one State or any of its organizations against another with the aim of undermining its political , economic and social system or subverting its Government .  
That position seemed tenable and acceptable inasmuch as it satisfied the main objectives pursued , namely , to reduce to the maximum possible extent the cases of statelessness as a result of State succession and to find a balance between the legitimate interests of successor States in regulating a broad range of issues connected with the attribution of their nationality and the right of natural persons to opt for the nationality of one of the successor States .  
The mandatory moratorium triggered by the recognition of the foreign main proceeding thus provides a quick freeze essential to prevent fraud , protect the legitimate interests of the parties involved until the court has an opportunity to notify all concerned and to assess the situation .  
States , in cooperation with relevant international organizations , where appropriate , should not promote or allow the storage or disposal of high-level , intermediate-level or low-level radioactive wastes near the marine environment unless they determine that scientific evidence , consistent with the applicable internationally agreed principles and guidelines , shows that such storage or disposal poses no unacceptable risk to people or the marine environment and does not interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea .  
Political events worldwide have shown that war , national and regional conflicts , occupation , the imposition of fait accompli policies and the denial of the legitimate rights of peoples under occupation have an adverse impact not only on peace and security in a region but on economic , social and environmental development .  
Warren Marik has acknowledged that considerable sums of money , at least $ 100-million , were swallowed up by these efforts , just as he has acknowledged the role played by the United States Senate Intelligence Committee in mounting a secret action against the legitimate authorities of Iraq and preparing a programme of aggression against Iraq to topple the regime in power , despite the duplicitous statements by senior United States Administration officials to the effect that they would not use such heinous procedures against foreign Heads of State .  
In the face of those developments , on 20 July 1997 , Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus announced a number of measures which would be implemented towards economic and financial integration to alleviate the effects of the illegal embargoes on the Turkish Cypriots and to forge closer ties in defence and foreign policy with a view to protecting the legitimate interests of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus .  
Competition authorities could make a key contribution in the formulation and implementation of economic policies by ( a ) expressing their views relating to policies or measures that restrict competition , and advising on how legitimate economic goals might be attained through less competition _ restricting measures ; and ( b ) combining effective enforcement against RBPs with an economically realistic approach to cooperation and concentration and a dynamic assessment of markets .  
In supporting that regional effort , we view it as essential that an unequivocal signal should be sent to the junta that the whole international community firmly stands behind the legitimate Government of Sierra Leone under the popularly elected President , Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah .  
Multilateral and bilateral assistance seems to be driving market growth at present , much as in the rest of the developing world , although provincial and municipal governments are emerging as legitimate customers for environmental service providers .  
Threats to international peace and security have been posed not only by weapons of mass destruction but also by the excessive build-up of conventional weapons beyond a level considered legitimate for the purpose of self-defence .  
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia considers that this vital issue for Republika Srpska should be settled in a principled manner , by strict compliance with the Dayton / Paris agreement and respect for the legitimate interests of Republika Srpska , which is an essential prerequisite for final success of the Dayton / Paris peace agreement .  
By virtue of its inherent right of legitimate individual or collective self-defence , the Democratic Republic of the Congo is conducting appropriate military and diplomatic action to regain its sovereignty and territorial integrity , and to make its cause triumphant in the community of nations .  
While other agencies had long faced problems in choosing legitimate or representative partners in the private sector , those partners were usually non-profit bodies , whereas working on operational projects with profit-seeking partners was clearly more problematic ; association with the United Nations could be interpreted as giving an unfair commercial advantage over its competitors , national and international . 
Mr . Nesho ( Albania ) : The moment that we are going through is a historic moment for the future of the Balkans , as the international community is intervening in order to stop the humanitarian catastrophe and the tragedy of a nation whose people have been tortured , killed and buried in common graves , a nation that is justly demanding its legitimate rights to freedom and to its very existence undeniable rights for all peoples .  
Ever since the Greek Cypriot side 's forceful usurpation of the legitimate seat of government in 1963 , the Greek Cypriot administration has been violating the Turkish Cypriot people 's vested rights of sovereign equality , partnership and fundamental freedoms through a campaign of ethnic cleansing during 1963-1974 and thereafter maintaining an inhuman embargo in all fields . 
The Government of Iraq further rejects outright the pretexts advanced by Turkey to justify such incursions into northern Iraq , given that the alleged pursuit of elements that pose a threat to Turkish national security does not make it legitimate for Turkey to implement a policy that is entirely at odds with its declared commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq .  
It is incomprehensible to request the withdrawal of the legitimate forces of a sovereign State from its own territory instead of calling for an urgent ending of foreign military aggression , killing of civilians and destruction of civilian targets .  
Every political and popular capability will be mobilized in order to protect Palestinian land , the Palestinian people and Palestinian rights , sustained by national unity and the just and legitimate struggle to reach the single national goal of ending the occupation , exercising self-determination , establishing the State and resolving the issue of the refugees , pursuant to General Assembly resolution 194 ( III ) and the resolutions of international legitimacy . 
The Government of Iraq further rejects outright the pretexts advanced by Turkey to justify such incursions into northern Iraq , given that the alleged pursuit of elements that pose a threat to Turkish national security does not make it legitimate for Turkey to implement a policy that is entirely at odds with its declared commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq . 
The Government of Iraq further rejects outright the pretexts advanced by Turkey to justify such violations in northern Iraq , given that the alleged pursuit of elements that pose a threat to Turkish national security does not make it legitimate for Turkey to pursue a policy that is entirely at odds with its declared commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq .  
All the arguments put forward by officials of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Government , however plausible and legitimate , can not explain its failure to exercise its obligation to protect its own citizens against generalized acts of violence prohibited by and punishable under international law , believed to have been largely committed by its own agents .  
The Group is of the opinion that the careful management of worldwide legitimate stocks of ammunition , including the reduction of surplus stocks , combined with active encouragement for former combatants to hand over their stocks for destruction , can reduce the negative impact of the uncontrolled proliferation of ammunition in post-conflict areas .  
The Government of Iraq further rejects outright the pretexts advanced by Turkey to justify such incursions into northern Iraq , given that the alleged pursuit of elements that pose a threat to Turkish national security does not make it legitimate for Turkey to implement policies that are entirely at odds with its declared commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq .  
There are reports of illegal occupation of land and property in areas left by departing Albanian and Serbian local residents , as well as indications that criminal groups may be taking control of vacant housing and property in flagrant violation of the legitimate rights of the original owners and occupants . 
Viewed from this perspective the FMT could capture in an irreversible way weapons material declared as excess in an ongoing process ; prevent altogether or regulate the further production of weapons _ grade materials for legitimate uses such as fuel for research reactors , naval reactors , etc . ; make closed _ down production and associated facilities subject to verification to prevent their reuse for weapons purposes .

The Government of Iraq further rejects outright the pretexts advanced by Turkey to justify such incursions into northern Iraq , given that the alleged pursuit of elements that pose a threat to Turkish national security does not make it legitimate for Turkey to adopt policies that are entirely at odds with its declared commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq .  
Furthermore , the international community must examine the continued viability of frameworks for the protection of intellectual property , ensuring a balance between the legitimate rights of owners and innovators to a secure and appropriate return on their investment and the larger social benefit that would result from wide , unrestricted knowledge flows .

We are searching for a generally acceptable formula for a more representative , more legitimate , more democratic , more efficient and effective , as well as a more transparent and accountable Security Council .

They are compounded by political instability , waste and mismanagement of resources , corruption and lack of transparency , which have been diverting the scarce financial resources away from legitimate expenditures , including investment in social development .  
Codes and standards of prudential conduct essential for financial stability needed to be prepared in a more democratic way to ensure that they were adapted to different countries situation and that countries considered them to be legitimate .

The simple fact that a particular category of the population suffers from underprivileged economic or social conditions does not mean that , in order to upgrade its material position , any distinction based on a characteristic defining the group should be considered legitimate , even if the ground is irrelevant as a basis of distinction with regard to a particular right .

Speaking on how the people 's courts mediated in civil , commercial , and administrative relations , resolved social contradictions , and promoted national economic and social development , Xiao Yang said : Last year , people 's courts at all levels stepped up their efforts in protecting intellectual property rights , punished illegal infringement upon intellectual property rights , curbed improper competition , and protected legitimate rights and interests of property rights owners .  
On cases that closely related to the people 's production and life , which could easily lead to intensified contradictions , such as those involved forestry land , natural resources , peasants ' burdens , and removal and resettlement of residents , the courts identified responsibilities , properly resolved the disputes , and protected the legitimate rights and interests of related parties , thereby promoting administrative relations in accordance with the law .

" The presumption is reasonable because illicit fuel usually has a sulphur content higher than 0.05% by weight whereas light diesel oil from legitimate sources on which duty has been paid must have a sulphur content at or below 0.05% .

To ensure that there is no blockage of free flow of advanced technology for legitimate commercial and research use while at the same time to prevent Hong Kong from being used as a conduit for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , it is necessary for Hong Kong to maintain a comprehensive and stringent control over the import and export of strategic commodities .  
Premier Lien Chan however stressed that by redoubling its efforts to hamstring the ROC internationally Beijing showed scant regard for the legitimate rights of the people of the Taiwan Area , and that its actions were conducive neither to cross-strait relations nor to national reunification . Future reunification could only be built on a foundation of mutual respect , and the ROC would continue to develop its international room for maneuver .  
Ever since 1991 when the ROC amended its constitution , it has defined cross-strait relations as state-to-state relations or at least a special state-to-state relationship , rather than an internal relationship between a legitimate government and a renegade group , or between a central government and a local government .  
For 40 years the authorities labeled this tragic historical event as an uprising against legitimate authority .

A military that has ultimate allegiance to the Constitution and other laws of the land , and to the democratic Government , and is trained in and committed to the principles of human rights and humanitarian law attending legitimate military duties ;  
The goal of such projects is to strengthen the capacity of such organizations to fulfil their legitimate and important role in generating a vigilant , continuous , informed and effective domestic demand for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The ultimate protection , however , lay in the legitimate exercise of Chamorro selfdetermination and the subsequent structuring of a political status conducive to their cultural survival and entry into the modern world in their own right .  
Future work on trade and environment must be aimed at developing an agreed framework for the use of necessary legitimate , transparent and predictable measures for environmental objectives while preventing unilateral and arbitrary green protectionism .  
Reiterates that any administering or occupying Power that deprives the colonial peoples of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
However , the fact that , in the new situation , the economic interests of the major Powers continued to have the upper hand frustrated the hopes of the developing countries that a new era of genuine solidarity between the rich and the poor was about to emerge and serve the legitimate interests of all the members of the international Community .  
Just a few years ago , at the Rio Conference , we , the Member countries of the United Nations , established as a primary concern the need to ensure a rational balance between realizing legitimate national goals and safeguarding the well-being of future generations through the protection of the world 's natural resources .  
China believes that the improved safeguards system should be fair , objective , rational , transparent and feasible , and implemented strictly in accordance with the statute and relevant international agreements , on the basis of respect for the sovereignty of countries concerned , without jeopardizing their legitimate rights .  
But the rather widespread expression of a sincere desire to make the Security Council more effective , more transparent , more legitimate and more democratic are coming up against the fact that this exercise brings together States which are pursuing contradictory perhaps even irreconcilable goals .  
We do recognize also that there are some legitimate considerations that have to be addressed in the negotiating process , including internal territorial delineations and means to rebuild the confidence of the population in the political processes and mechanisms that are designed to secure respect for human rights .

In cases where a peace-keeping operation has been necessary , we believe it is legitimate and useful for the United Nations to maintain a presence on the ground after the end of the operation in order to ensure that its action is followed up in such a way as to contribute to a lasting restoration of peace through measures for coordinated consolidation in the economic , social , institutional , electoral , humanitarian and human rights fields .  
The causes are many : the earlier supply of weapons to client States by the parties to the cold war , internal conflicts , competition for commercial markets , criminal activity and the collapse of governmental law and order functions ( which both gives free rein to the criminals and creates a legitimate reason for ordinary citizens to acquire weapons for their own defence ) .  
The election on 29 June 1993 of a parliamentary majority representing FRODEBU , which gained 65 of the 81 seats in the National Assembly , made his victory over the previous regime complete and strengthened his claim , which was undoubtedly legitimate , to a more active role in the country 's political , economic , social and cultural life . 
Such actions affecting private property or public utilities designed to meet the needs of the civilian population involve a high degree of risk for civilians and can not be justified as legitimate military operations .  
The support extended by the General Assembly , in terms of both its endorsement of the strategy and the provision of additional limited budgetary resources to develop a planning and policy coordination capacity within the Office of Human Resources Management represents a modest step forward towards addressing the legitimate concerns expressed by the Inspectors .  
In the recent UNCTAD / UNEP high-level meeting on trade , environment and development , it was felt that future work on multilateral environmental agreements should focus on a more detailed empirical analysis of the use of trade measures , including conditions for the legitimate use of trade measures , the design of such measures , special circumstances of developing countries in relation to the agreements and trade policy , and the additional financial and other requirements for developing countries .  
During the work on the new arrangement and the present draft resolution , which will be adopted today , one Member State , regrettably , expressed low tolerance for the legitimate interests of Croatia , a Member State , and instead directed efforts into forms of short-term political pragmatism , at the expense of legal and operative logic of the relevant United Nations documents .

In governmental systems , this is the basic infrastructure for the exercise of legitimate authority : a legal system , a judicial system , a police system , a prison system for those who act outside the law , and the design of governmental institutions that ensure informed , voluntary choice by the citizens .

The failures of the international community in providing protection to the people of Bosnia , in halting policies of ethnic cleansing , as constituting a war crime and a crime against humanity , and in ending the deliberate obstruction of the delivery of humanitarian assistance mean that we must reconsider the maintenance of the arms embargo imposed on Bosnia with a view to enabling its people to exercise its legitimate right to self-defence .

Recalling the paramount importance of the bilateral talks mediated by some powers with legitimate interests in facilitating a comprehensive solution to the situation in the Middle East , the Brazilian delegation also pays tribute to the indisputable role the United Nations has been playing over the years in this field , not only by means of peacekeeping , but also through economic , social and humanitarian assistance .  
Hence , we emphasize the importance of making rapid progress towards a final settlement , which would ensure that the Palestinian people is granted its legitimate rights , especially its right to self-determination and to establish an independent state with Al-Quds as its capital , in accordance with relevant international resolutions and the basic principles of the Madrid Conference .

On the contrary , this threat is an inevitable consequence of the activities of organizations that deny the State its legitimate monopoly of violence , corrupt State institutions , undermine the rule of law , threaten the integrity of financial and commercial sectors of society , contravene legal and social norms and conventions , transgress national sovereignty and violate national borders . 
The challenge is made more daunting by the fact that such organizations are a complex mix , with various shapes and sizes , intersecting in multiple ways with the legitimate economy and society , simultaneously amorphous and concrete , and engaged in corruption , as well as coercion and confrontation , depending on exigencies and opportunities .  
This requires : complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan to the line of 4 June 1967 ; complete and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa to the internationally recognized boundaries ; the complete withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Palestinian territories , including Arab Jerusalem ; and recognition of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people , including its right to exercise self-determination and establish an independent State on its own soil .

Kenya shares the legitimate concerns of many Member States regarding the need to minimize the operational costs of the institutions we have created and to adopt an evolutionary and cost-effective approach that takes into account the increasing financial difficulties of Governments in providing for institutional development at the international level .

May I recall , in this respect , my letter to your predecessor ( A / 50 / 216-S / 1995 / 476 ) dated 9 June 1995 , with which I brought to his attention the similar threats , expressed at the highest and most official political level in Turkey through the resolution adopted on 8 June 1995 by the Turkish National Assembly , empowering the Turkish Government to declare war if Greece implemented the Convention on the Law of the Sea and exercised her legitimate right to extend her national territorial waters to 12 miles . 
China is in favour of imposing strict and feasible restrictions on anti-personnel landmines and their use , with a view to achieving the objective of an ultimate ban in a step-by-step manner .  In order to meet its legitimate defence requirements , China can not but reserve its legitimate right to use anti-personnel landmines on its own territories before alternative means are found and defensive capabilities established .  
It has never engaged in overseas aggression , nor does it have any intention of using landmines in other countries .  Should China use anti-personnel landmines in legitimate circumstances , it would be entirely for the purpose of defending against foreign military intervention and aggression , safeguarding its national unification and territorial integrity , and ensuring a peaceful life for its own people .  
Thirdly , it is necessary to prevent a small number of countries taking advantage of their advanced military technology and economic power to seek their absolute security and military superiority over others while they focus the target of disarmament on the developing countries and deprive them of their legitimate right and means of self-defence .  Fourthly , the countries with the largest and most sophisticated conventional and nuclear arsenals should continue to bear special responsibility for disarmament .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
My delegation would like once again to reaffirm its profound wish to support any international initiatives that could genuinely help to find more effective solutions to the humanitarian problems stemming from the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of mines which at the same time protect the legitimate national security interests of States making use of such weapons for strictly defensive purposes and in compliance with all international provisions that apply to such weapons .  
Lastly , we would like to place on record that we joined in the consensus on this resolution on the understanding that any negotiating exercise that may take place in the immediate future must ensure that a requisite and necessary balance be struck between humanitarian concerns and the legitimate security interests of the States concerned .  
Ecuador will continue to participate in these talks , motivated by a true spirit of peace , because we desire a global , final , honourable and realistic solution that reflects the legitimate expectations of our people , which , together with the other peoples of the Americas , are seeking to create a future of mutual benefit and constructive and peaceful cooperation .  
The second point is the upholding of a just and comprehensive peace as a strategic choice and objective on the basis of the principles of the peace process , and in particular of the relevant Security Council resolutions , the principle of land for peace and the attainment of the legitimate political rights of the Palestinian people , and a reaffirmation of complete Arab solidarity with this position .  
These disturbing trends are in contrast with the global consensus that has emerged during major international conferences organized over the past decade under the auspices of the United Nations . They raise legitimate questions as to the very future of the system established to organize international cooperation for development .  
Given the noble and legitimate aspirations of the entire international community for the future of the planet , the Organization certainly needs to be renewed in order to confront effectively and successfully the exciting yet disturbing challenges posed by globalization .  
We therefore support the set of constructive and objective proposals put forward by the members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , which take cognizance of the realities of change , the results of the political developments witnessed by today \ x { e5b8 } world and the legitimate concerns of the developing countries in keeping with the concepts of the Charter and of the rules of international law .  
Subsequent developments have continued to be positive , and in 1997 we are witnessing for the first time in many years a Central America free of armed conflict , with legitimate Governments chosen through the free expression of popular will in transparent and pluralistic elections , thus strengthening democratic institutions and , as result , the rule of law . 
Thus , we have taken the first step in a broad and complex process that can bring us closer to the vision of a Central American Union , with the ultimate goal of producing the concrete results sought by our populations : overcoming poverty , creating opportunities , increasing the number of jobs , activating our production capacity , increasing our competitiveness , equitable and unified participation in the benefits of development , genuine democratization , equitable access to an efficient system of justice and the legitimate enjoyment of peaceful coexistence .  
This has preserved and duly protected the right of legitimate defence , both individual and collective , provided for in Article 51 of the Charter a right that my country believes is one of the pillars underlying international coexistence and a guarantee for the respect of the territorial integrity of States .  
With regard to the defensive use of these devices for the sole purpose of protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity , we concur with the views expressed in the ministerial communiqu of the Non-Aligned Movement of 25 September 1997 , which underlined that any negotiations or agreements thereon should take into account the legitimate security concerns of States as well as their legitimate rights under the Charter of the United Nations .  
This peace was pursued on the basis of the mutual recognition of the legitimate rights of both peoples and their desire to live in peaceful coexistence and mutual dignity and security and to achieve a just , lasting and comprehensive peace settlement and a historic reconciliation through the agreed political process .  
Regrettably , the continuing military occupation by Israeli forces of large areas of Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , the presence of a large number of armed settlers in the occupied territories , the frequent roadblocks and boundary closures and the serious damage caused to the Palestinian economy all of them unilateral measures have a negative impact on the search for a just and peaceful settlement that respects the legitimate rights and claims of all the parties .  
Arab leaders have repeatedly affirmed their insistence on the peace option as a strategic and political goal , provided that it is based on the principle of land for peace , on respect for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people in particular its right to establish an independent State of its own and on Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories on the basis of binding international resolutions .  
We also express our commitment to all the various tracks of the peace process without exception , with a view to guaranteeing Israel 's total withdrawal from all occupied Arab and Palestinian territories , including the Syrian Golan , southern Lebanon and the Beka'a valley , and respect by Israel for international law and for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people , including its rights to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State on its national territory , with Al-Quds as its capital .  
Optimism , combined with an awareness of the enormous task ahead , will be necessary in creating an environment in which the people of Guatemala are able , among other things , to exercise their legitimate civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
An express and clear incitement to hatred or to the use of violence that poses a clear and imminent danger to the legitimate interests of the State and all of its citizens calls for the State to take strong action to protect all human rights as well as national security and public order , bearing in mind the necessity and proportionality of those measures in relation to the threat posed .  
With regard to new article W , the representative of Germany stated that his delegation placed mental brackets on the adoption by consensus of new article W . His delegation reserved its final position with the understanding that either lawfully and openly or from a legitimate source would be removed from the present wording . 
Therefore , the members of such groups should either be covered by the conditions applicable to popular armed resistance groups , thereby subjecting them to the provisions and obligations of international humanitarian law to a certain extent , or should be regarded as groups that fail to meet the international requirements for classification as legal combatants , either as members of a regular army or a legitimate resistance movement , in which case , being totally beyond the pale of the law , there would be no point in placing them under any obligation . 
It was the Greek Cypriot armed onslaught in December 1963 against the Turkish Cypriot people and the bi-communal order that led to division on the island when the Turkish Cypriot people were forced to live in enclaves , deprived of all basic necessities and fundamental human rights , for 11 years prior to the legitimate Turkish intervention of 1974 .  
At the same tie , however , the legitimate wishes of many States to combat international terrorism were being held hostage by the double standards of powerful countries that preached against terrorism even as they impeded the negotiations on the draft Convention on the matter with all the diplomatic means and political pressure at their disposal , thus blocking the adoption of the clear and all-inclusive definition of terrorism that was needed and an unequivocal and impartial condemnation . 
No comparison should be drawn between the legitimate struggle of peoples against colonial or foreign domination , and terrorist acts instigated , organized , directed or financed by one State or any of its organizations against another with the aim of undermining its political , economic and social system or subverting its Government .  
That position seemed tenable and acceptable inasmuch as it satisfied the main objectives pursued , namely , to reduce to the maximum possible extent the cases of statelessness as a result of State succession and to find a balance between the legitimate interests of successor States in regulating a broad range of issues connected with the attribution of their nationality and the right of natural persons to opt for the nationality of one of the successor States .  
The mandatory moratorium triggered by the recognition of the foreign main proceeding thus provides a quick freeze essential to prevent fraud , protect the legitimate interests of the parties involved until the court has an opportunity to notify all concerned and to assess the situation .  
States , in cooperation with relevant international organizations , where appropriate , should not promote or allow the storage or disposal of high-level , intermediate-level or low-level radioactive wastes near the marine environment unless they determine that scientific evidence , consistent with the applicable internationally agreed principles and guidelines , shows that such storage or disposal poses no unacceptable risk to people or the marine environment and does not interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea .  
Political events worldwide have shown that war , national and regional conflicts , occupation , the imposition of fait accompli policies and the denial of the legitimate rights of peoples under occupation have an adverse impact not only on peace and security in a region but on economic , social and environmental development .  
Warren Marik has acknowledged that considerable sums of money , at least $ 100-million , were swallowed up by these efforts , just as he has acknowledged the role played by the United States Senate Intelligence Committee in mounting a secret action against the legitimate authorities of Iraq and preparing a programme of aggression against Iraq to topple the regime in power , despite the duplicitous statements by senior United States Administration officials to the effect that they would not use such heinous procedures against foreign Heads of State .  
In the face of those developments , on 20 July 1997 , Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus announced a number of measures which would be implemented towards economic and financial integration to alleviate the effects of the illegal embargoes on the Turkish Cypriots and to forge closer ties in defence and foreign policy with a view to protecting the legitimate interests of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus .  
Competition authorities could make a key contribution in the formulation and implementation of economic policies by ( a ) expressing their views relating to policies or measures that restrict competition , and advising on how legitimate economic goals might be attained through less competition _ restricting measures ; and ( b ) combining effective enforcement against RBPs with an economically realistic approach to cooperation and concentration and a dynamic assessment of markets .  
In supporting that regional effort , we view it as essential that an unequivocal signal should be sent to the junta that the whole international community firmly stands behind the legitimate Government of Sierra Leone under the popularly elected President , Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah .  
Multilateral and bilateral assistance seems to be driving market growth at present , much as in the rest of the developing world , although provincial and municipal governments are emerging as legitimate customers for environmental service providers .  
Threats to international peace and security have been posed not only by weapons of mass destruction but also by the excessive build-up of conventional weapons beyond a level considered legitimate for the purpose of self-defence .  
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia considers that this vital issue for Republika Srpska should be settled in a principled manner , by strict compliance with the Dayton / Paris agreement and respect for the legitimate interests of Republika Srpska , which is an essential prerequisite for final success of the Dayton / Paris peace agreement .  
By virtue of its inherent right of legitimate individual or collective self-defence , the Democratic Republic of the Congo is conducting appropriate military and diplomatic action to regain its sovereignty and territorial integrity , and to make its cause triumphant in the community of nations .  
While other agencies had long faced problems in choosing legitimate or representative partners in the private sector , those partners were usually non-profit bodies , whereas working on operational projects with profit-seeking partners was clearly more problematic ; association with the United Nations could be interpreted as giving an unfair commercial advantage over its competitors , national and international . 
Mr . Nesho ( Albania ) : The moment that we are going through is a historic moment for the future of the Balkans , as the international community is intervening in order to stop the humanitarian catastrophe and the tragedy of a nation whose people have been tortured , killed and buried in common graves , a nation that is justly demanding its legitimate rights to freedom and to its very existence undeniable rights for all peoples .  
Ever since the Greek Cypriot side 's forceful usurpation of the legitimate seat of government in 1963 , the Greek Cypriot administration has been violating the Turkish Cypriot people 's vested rights of sovereign equality , partnership and fundamental freedoms through a campaign of ethnic cleansing during 1963-1974 and thereafter maintaining an inhuman embargo in all fields . 
The Government of Iraq further rejects outright the pretexts advanced by Turkey to justify such incursions into northern Iraq , given that the alleged pursuit of elements that pose a threat to Turkish national security does not make it legitimate for Turkey to implement a policy that is entirely at odds with its declared commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq .  
It is incomprehensible to request the withdrawal of the legitimate forces of a sovereign State from its own territory instead of calling for an urgent ending of foreign military aggression , killing of civilians and destruction of civilian targets .  
Every political and popular capability will be mobilized in order to protect Palestinian land , the Palestinian people and Palestinian rights , sustained by national unity and the just and legitimate struggle to reach the single national goal of ending the occupation , exercising self-determination , establishing the State and resolving the issue of the refugees , pursuant to General Assembly resolution 194 ( III ) and the resolutions of international legitimacy . 
The Government of Iraq further rejects outright the pretexts advanced by Turkey to justify such incursions into northern Iraq , given that the alleged pursuit of elements that pose a threat to Turkish national security does not make it legitimate for Turkey to implement a policy that is entirely at odds with its declared commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq . 
The Government of Iraq further rejects outright the pretexts advanced by Turkey to justify such violations in northern Iraq , given that the alleged pursuit of elements that pose a threat to Turkish national security does not make it legitimate for Turkey to pursue a policy that is entirely at odds with its declared commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq .  
All the arguments put forward by officials of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Government , however plausible and legitimate , can not explain its failure to exercise its obligation to protect its own citizens against generalized acts of violence prohibited by and punishable under international law , believed to have been largely committed by its own agents .  
The Group is of the opinion that the careful management of worldwide legitimate stocks of ammunition , including the reduction of surplus stocks , combined with active encouragement for former combatants to hand over their stocks for destruction , can reduce the negative impact of the uncontrolled proliferation of ammunition in post-conflict areas .  
The Government of Iraq further rejects outright the pretexts advanced by Turkey to justify such incursions into northern Iraq , given that the alleged pursuit of elements that pose a threat to Turkish national security does not make it legitimate for Turkey to implement policies that are entirely at odds with its declared commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq .  
There are reports of illegal occupation of land and property in areas left by departing Albanian and Serbian local residents , as well as indications that criminal groups may be taking control of vacant housing and property in flagrant violation of the legitimate rights of the original owners and occupants . 
Viewed from this perspective the FMT could capture in an irreversible way weapons material declared as excess in an ongoing process ; prevent altogether or regulate the further production of weapons _ grade materials for legitimate uses such as fuel for research reactors , naval reactors , etc . ; make closed _ down production and associated facilities subject to verification to prevent their reuse for weapons purposes .  
Before we stand in judgement on the merits of individual applications , many of them dating back at least two decades , or link the issue of expansion to any transitory events , we all have to be aware that the credibility of this Conference , like that of its individual members , can withstand the test of time only when based on enduring commitments to the principles of genuine and effective disarmament and equal and legitimate security for all .  
The United States , which has continued to apply laws and measures affecting the sovereignty and legitimate interests of other States and freedom of trade and navigation , as well as inflicting tremendous pain on the Cuban people , should , in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and relevant resolutions of the United Nations , put an end to the economic , commercial and financial embargo that it has imposed on Cuba .  
On the basis of the foregoing , the Sudan opposes the economic and commercial embargo imposed by the United States against Cuba , which has caused great damage to the Cuban people and violated its legitimate rights and interests , being a flagrant violation of international law and the Charter of the United Nations and showing disregard for their lofty and noble principles .  
The objectives of the joint action are : ( a ) to combat and contribute to ending the destabilizing accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons ; ( b ) to contribute to the reduction of existing accumulations of these weapons to levels consistent with the legitimate security needs of countries ; and ( c ) to help those regions suffering from the problems associated with excessive accumulation and spread of small arms to tackle them .  
Refrain from developing military capacity beyond their legitimate defence requirements , while at the same time reaffirming their resolve to achieve the necessary degree of security and mutual confidence with the lowest possible levels of troops and weaponry , and adhere to the Convention on Chemical Weapons . 12 .  The European Union is convinced that greater transparency in military issues will induce stability at the regional level .  
In the 1997 report , while stating that accumulations of small arms and light weapons become excessive and destabilizing when a State , whether supplier or recipient , does not exercise restraint in the production , transfer , acquisition and holding of such weapons beyond those needed for legitimate national or collective defence and internal security , notes that there is no single cause for the accumulation of small arms and their subsequent transformation into instability and conflict . 
Police restructuring involves reducing the number of excess police and ensuring that the rationalized police forces are representative of the ethnic composition of the community they serve and that they work within legitimate , transparent , accountable and professional organizational structures .  
If the United Nations role is to be strengthened , it is essential to ensure that all Member States have the right to equal participation in international affairs , so that their reasonable propositions will be fully reflected and their legitimate rights and interests protected by the United Nations .  
Second , exploring innovative and practical measures of assistance to third States should also include the provision of a special or preferential treatment for the suppliers from affected non-target States in allocating them appropriate quotas for legitimate humanitarian supplies to the target countries , material supplies for the United Nations peacekeeping operations and participation in international efforts for post-conflict rehabilitation , reconstruction and development .  
The Government of Iraq further rejects outright the pretexts advanced by Turkey to justify such incursions into northern Iraq , given that the alleged pursuit of elements that pose a threat to Turkish national security does not make it legitimate for Turkey to adopt policies that are entirely at odds with its declared commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq .  
Furthermore , the international community must examine the continued viability of frameworks for the protection of intellectual property , ensuring a balance between the legitimate rights of owners and innovators to a secure and appropriate return on their investment and the larger social benefit that would result from wide , unrestricted knowledge flows .  
Stressing that the international community must not enter the new millennium with the prospect that the possession of nuclear weapons will be considered legitimate for the indefinite future , and convinced of the imperative to proceed with determination to prohibit and eradicate them for all time ,  
It further rejects outright the pretexts advanced by Turkey to justify these acts of aggression against northern Iraq , given that the alleged pursuit of elements that pose a threat to Turkish national security does not make it legitimate for Turkey to adopt policies that are entirely at variance with its declared commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq .  
Their activities were legitimate , competitive and regulated ; they were not dissimilar from those of developed countries that encouraged foreign direct investment .  
They include numerous illegal measures that interfere with the legitimate economic and commercial activities of foreign companies based outside United States jurisdiction , as well as complete prohibitions not only against the Republic of Cuba , but against all Cuban nationals , without exception , residing in Cuban territory , who are prevented from engaging in any transactions , while all of their property , deposits , savings , inheritances and pensions in the United States have been confiscated . 
Similarly , the twelfth summit of the Non-Aligned Movement , held at Durban in September 1998 , reiterated the Movements position , that the international community must oppose all acts of interference , external intervention and coercive economic measures and other measures , including extraterritorial laws and regulations that affect the sovereignty of States , the legitimate interests of entities and persons under their jurisdiction and the freedom of trade and of navigation .  
We also believe that the Bethlehem 2000 project has a distinct spiritual value , over and above other important economic concerns , and that this event , which commemorates the birth of Christ , must be shielded from harmful and unnecessary political hindrances that could frustrate its legitimate goal .  
My country reaffirms its principled position that just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East must be based , first and foremost , on the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people , particularly their right to self-determination and the establishment of their independent State with Al-Quds as its capital .  
We hope that international efforts will bear fruit and that the restoration of cultural properties to their legitimate owners will be encouraged , so that our various cultural heritages , which not only have historical and ancestral value but which also represent the intellectual and moral heritage of future generations , can be preserved .  
Slovakia recognizes as legitimate the efforts to secure an adequate position in an enlarged Security Council made by certain countries which are capable of assuming global responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
All the Movement ' s conferences have addressed it with the utmost gravity , because the Movement is fully aware that , despite international developments and the vast increase in the number of States Members of the United Nations , those States do not enjoy genuine representation commensurate with their number , international influence and desire to express their legitimate interests .  
Stressing that the international community must not enter the third millennium with the prospect that the possession of nuclear weapons will be considered legitimate for the indefinite future , and convinced that the present juncture provides a unique opportunity to proceed to prohibit and eradicate them for all time ,  
Knowledge , intent or purpose required as an element of the offences set forth in that paragraph may be inferred from strong evidence or objective , factual circumstances , the offender being required to give proof of the legitimate origin of the funds , rights or property .  
To try to make this topic the private domain of the nuclear Powers thus excluding the vast majority of States from the multilateral negotiations necessary in order to attain nuclear disarmament in a time-bound framework and under strict international control would only delay further the legitimate aspirations of mankind to live in a nuclear-weapon-free world .  
States Parties shall consider collecting and exchanging information with respect to registered legal persons and the physical persons involved in their creation , direction and funding , with a view to preventing the penetration of organized crime in the public and legitimate private sector .  
Moreover , the accuseds spouse , legitimate or acknowledged illegitimate forebears or descendants , legitimate collateral blood relatives up to the fourth degree or relatives by marriage up to the second degree and siblings born out of wedlock are not required to testify in a criminal case ( article 201 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ) .  
Article 17 of the Criminal Code stipulates that persons who act as accessories after the fact for their spouse or legitimate relatives by blood or marriage , throughout the direct and collateral lines up to the second degree , as well as natural parents and children born out of wedlock , shall be exempt from the penalties imposed for concealment , unless they have profited from the effects of the crime or ordinary offence . 
With regard to the law on children , as stated above , Law No . 19 , 585 of 26 October 1998 , which amended the Civil Code in the area of filiation in order to confer equal status on all children ( who are now categorized as legitimate , born out of wedlock and illegitimate ) by providing for the free establishment of paternity , improving the inheritance rights of the surviving spouse and extending paternal authority ( patria potestad ) to the mother , has already been adopted . 
The laundering of money accruing from illegal drug trafficking , and the use of such money in order to finance illegal activities , such as providing financial support for armed rebel movements that threatened legitimate Governments , posed a threat to international peace and security and made it essential for the international community to cooperate with the relevant international bodies . 
The representative of Australia recognized that the intention of article 3 was to enunciate a key concept in the draft declaration , namely the legitimate aspirations of indigenous peoples to enjoy more direct and meaningful participation in decision-making and political processes and greater autonomy over their own affairs .  
We are searching for a generally acceptable formula for a more representative , more legitimate , more democratic , more efficient and effective , as well as a more transparent and accountable Security Council .  
We understand that it demands coordinated and concerted efforts on the multilateral level and requires a thorough study of the political , military and economic aspects , in particular States legitimate defence and security needs .  
They are compounded by political instability , waste and mismanagement of resources , corruption and lack of transparency , which have been diverting the scarce financial resources away from legitimate expenditures , including investment in social development .  
Codes and standards of prudential conduct essential for financial stability needed to be prepared in a more democratic way to ensure that they were adapted to different countries situation and that countries considered them to be legitimate .  
The formula of success is straightforward : zero tolerance for violence combined with a high level of openness towards legitimate differences in political views and transparent accountability in a credible court , national or international , for serious crimes .  
Achieving a just , comprehensive and lasting peace requires putting an end to Israels occupation of all occupied Palestinian territories , including AlQuds AlSharif , and enabling the Palestinian people to secure their legitimate national and political rights .  
Secondly , clear definitions of terms loosely used in the previous report , such as illegal , legitimate , power and control , should be established in relation to the specific and unique political situation prevailing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in the region .  
The overall goal is to find what Mr . Brahimi called a home-grown solution one which is credible , legitimate and sustainable and leads to a broad-based Government which is responsible , representative , stable and accountable ; enjoys both internal and external stability ; respects the human rights of the Afghan people ; and will never again allow the country to be used as a breeding ground for terror or drug trafficking .  
The Supreme Council reviewed the bloody events that have taken place in the occupied Palestinian territories owing to the savage aggression , repressive measures and policies of closure and encirclement directed by Israel against a fraternal Palestinian people seeking the restoration of all of its legitimate rights , including its right to return and to establish an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital .  
The Ministerial Council reviewed the Israeli practices of aggression against the Palestinian people , especially the escalation against towns , villages and camps , and the policy of closures and economic and political blockade being pursued by Israel against the fraternal Palestinian people demanding the restoration of its legitimate rights , including the right of return and its right to establish an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital . 
Given the vehement and heroic resistance of the Iraqi armed forces , and foremost among them the valiant air defence forces , to this brutal aggression , the United States and the United Kingdom have resorted to a crude method of breaking the legitimate resistance of Iraqis , namely dropping from the air on Iraqi towns and villages leaflets cautioning the Iraqi armed forces against engaging the attacking United States and British aircraft and threatening to destroy sites that orient their radar systems or from which fire is directed in order to oppose these aircraft .  
The United Arab Emirates also vehemently condemns the continuing Israeli aerial and land attacks on the Gaza Strip and Palestinian towns and villages elsewhere as systematic and deliberate aggression of daily increasing ferocity against the Palestinian people struggling for the restoration of its legitimate rights , amid the silence of the international community , which stands by and does not differentiate between the offending party and the victim .  
The suffering of Palestinian children caused by Israeli acts of aggression aimed at killing and maiming children , coupled with the lack of facilities to shelter them , Israels abandonment of all values and human rights and its flouting of all international instruments , and its refusal to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories and to establish a just peace in accordance with the legitimate decisions of the international community , causing heightened suffering among the Arab population under occupation and denying their children all the rights enshrined in the precepts of God and humanitarian law .  
In accordance with the now general practice of using the term discrimination exclusively to designate arbitrary distinctions , the term positive discrimination is a contradictio in terminis : either the distinction in question is justified and legitimate , because not arbitrary , and can not be called discrimination , or the distinction in question is unjustified or illegitimate , because arbitrary , and should not be labelled positive .  
The simple fact that a particular category of the population suffers from underprivileged economic or social conditions does not mean that , in order to upgrade its material position , any distinction based on a characteristic defining the group should be considered legitimate , even if the ground is irrelevant as a basis of distinction with regard to a particular right .  
The occupying power may , then , invoke its long occupancy as proof that its occupation is legitimate and characterize any and all use of force against it as terrorism . [ 115 ] ( b ) There is a situation of nascent civil war - i.e . , a situation where there are armed groups who either do not control sufficient territory , or who engage in military activities that are more than sporadic but less than sustained , or whose actions do not qualify as military actions under the laws and customs of war . 
The presenter requested the Special Committee to recommend that the 2001 General Assembly resolution call upon the administering Power to realistically re-evaluate its land holding and facilitate the unrestricted return of unused lands to Guam for inclusion in programmes beneficial to original Chamorro landowners ; recognize and sanction the Chamorro Land Trust programme for native Chamorros of Guam ; discontinue immigration policies and practices which impact the demographics of the Territory ; facilitate the legitimate exercise of self-determination by the indigenous Chamorro people of Guam .  
But it has to be understood that the use of such professional services also extends to other unlawful acts such as the trafficking in persons , whether migrants or women , the trafficking in arms and munitions , drug trafficking , terrorism , acts of destabilization of legitimate Governments , acts to take forcible control of valuable natural resources , and even organized crime such as the seizure or theft of vehicles on a large scale .  
It is recommended that the General Assembly should reaffirm its full support for the self-determination of the African peoples and their right to live in peace , to benefit from the development that can result from the rational use of their own natural resources and to have their legitimate governments respected and stable , and in that regard it should condemn the mercenary activities frequently organized with the aim of undermining the rights of the African peoples .  
Affirming that responses to climate change should be coordinated with social and economic development in an integrated manner with a view to avoiding adverse impacts on the latter , taking into full account the legitimate priority needs of developing countries for the achievement of sustained economic growth and the eradication of poverty ,  
He also agreed with the call for the establishment of concrete provisions relating to special and differential treatment and to provide developing countries with technical assistance to allow them to meet their legitimate needs , such as rural development and food security .  
While noting that anti-dumping and countervailing actions were legitimate measures , he said that AD actions had increased owing to the less than stringent implementation of the relevant WTO agreements , because of their somewhat vague and ambiguous provisions , which had permitted domestic complainants to make full use of the flexibility deriving from imprecise and ambiguous provisions .  
I am convinced that a political solution based on the twin pillars of enabling the Afghan people to freely determine their own future and securing the legitimate national interests of Afghanistans neighbours through mutually binding commitments offers the best guarantee for a lasting peace in Afghanistan .  
In a document circulated last year , the Group of 21 stated that the prevention of an arms race in outer space has assumed greater urgency because of legitimate concerns that existing legal instruments are inadequate to deter imminent attempts for the further militarization of outer space .  
In view of the failure of the global community to harness the benefits of globalization , as evidenced by increasing poverty and marginalization , it was legitimate to ask whether the best interests of the global community were served in a world of short-term profit-taking subject to acute cyclical reverses , where the biggest segment of the market remained undeveloped .  
The source stressed in conclusion the position of the State of Qatar and the States of the Organization of the Islamic Conference in support of the Palestinian people in its just struggle to regain its legitimate rights , in accordance with the resolutions based on international legitimacy , the foremost of which is the establishment of an independent Palestinian State on its national soil with Al-Quds al-Sharif as its capital .  
How can we be expected to view as legitimate norms of conduct dictated by the Security Council , when some of its members are responsible for the fact that there are more than 30,000 nuclear weapons in the world , directly threatening the international peace and security that the Council is supposed to defend ?
