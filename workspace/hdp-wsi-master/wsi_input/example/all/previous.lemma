[ Liu Shijin ] After we started the reform and opening-up drive , we reexamined and adjusted our previous strategy of giving priority to developing the heavy industry .  This resulted in the pattern of industrial development with emphasis on the textile and other light industries during the early and middle periods of the 80 ' s of the 20th century .  
Training for our army 's mechanized troops has entered a new phase because we have inspected our science-and-technology military training achievements in a " stage " of war that resembled modern war , and departed from previous " playacting " exercises that were based on wishful thinking .

Led bythe Clinton Administration over the past eight years , the United States has enjoyed economic prosperity , reinforced national strength , and won a series of diplomatic victories .

If the United States deploys NMD , this will mean that the currently fragile Russian-US strategic balance will be broken , that Russia 's nuclear deterrent force will " be rendered ineffective , " and that the previous Russian-US nuclear disarmament will turn to be a disguised move for doing away with Russia 's nuclear weapons .  
What stirred Peng Qin deeply at a later time was the moral lessons given by two former " Falungong " practitioners on the basis of their own experiences , whom the provincial reeducation-through-labor center had released before the due date .  Ever since then , Peng Qin started to calm down and do some serious thinking .  Little by little , she recalled the path that she had covered over the previous three years ;  
Moreover , because its previous East European allies are now leaning toward the West , the pro-Western and separatist elements in the Commonwealth of Independent States are increasing , and Russia 's national strength is weakening , it can not afford much fund to help developing countries ; therefore its role in international affairs will be restricted .  
The Interim Procedures are more all-compassing , standardized and reasonable than the previous procedures , but since each national and military reform must advance step by step , the establishment and completion of the socialist market economy takes time and the Interim Procedures should be implemented in an enthusiastic , reliable and gradual manner .

It is only right and natural that such an action is unacceptable to them .

Referring to the situation where cadres still lack a democratic and legal system , the 13th Party Congress consequently proposed to regard the establishment of a state public functionary system as the focus for reforming the personnel system of cadres to conduct scientific management of the contingent of cadres according to law ; thus transforming the previous outdated unitary management pattern and allowing the establishment of a new-type personnel system of cadres based on the principles of attaching importance to solid performance , encouraging competition , and exercising democratic and separated supervisions .

By casting aside previous grievances and looking ahead to the future , we gradually restored friendly relations with Communist Parties and Workers ' Parties in other countries .  At the same time , we also gradually came into extensive contacts with nationalist and democratic political parties in developing countries .  
It is just like what has transpired in the past - - when all previous Japanese prime ministers and political heavyweights visited the Yasukuni Shrine , the feelings of the people from every victimized country in Asia were hurt , and the alarm bell was sounded alerting to the resurgence of militarism .

The Military Region Air Force not only further increased the frequency of no-notice attacks , it also made them more difficult and intense .  When it selected air routes , it broke free of the previous method of using high altitudes and the same routes .

"  The meeting reviewed and exchanged the experience gained in conducting the " double thinking " educational activities in the previous stage , analyzed and studied their developments , and made specific plans and arrangements for the next stage of " double thinking " educational work .  
Judging from these reports , the " double thinking " educational activities in the previous stage went on smoothly and achieved initial successes because the leaders attached importance to them and because they were integrated with the reality and were conducted in numerous forms .  
Nakasone first assigned the Liberal Democratic Party to set up the " Yasukuni Shrine Subcommittee " to find legal grounds for formal visits by officials to Yasukuni Shrine .

Rarely did any of the previous US presidents make it so clear on the issue .

What is different from the previous plans is that the 10th Five-Year Plan regards raising the living standard of the broad masses as a basic point of departure .  It embodies the alignment of national planning with the people 's livelihood and is a plan that fully reflects General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents . "

"  In the US , where politics is deeply partisan , such a shift is not without justification , but in reality the new US administration will not move in the direction of the other extreme , which would mean applying Cold War thinking to an emergent China and a wholesale repudiation of the positive results gained by the China policies of the previous administration .  
This decision is completely consistent with Bush 's line of thinking that we would do " whatever it took to defend Taiwan . " No wonder that Luo-de , former U.S . ambassador to China and assistant secretary of state for Asian-Pacific affairs during the Clinton administration believe that undoubtedly the Bush administration , which has assumed office for less than 100 days , is changing the established policy pursued by the previous administrations on the Taiwan issue .

Of them , those entering Hong Kong on Two-way Exit Permits have increased by 74 per cent when compared with the average monthly figure last year , following an increase of 19 per cent in 2001 and 34 per cent in 2000 over the previous yearly figures .  
The Housing Authority ( HA ) endorsed today ( November 28 ) the Government 's request to reposition itself from its previous role as a direct provider of subsidized sale flats to assume a facilitation and enabling role , while pledging to hold fast to its commitment to providing affordable rental housing to those in genuine need .  
( b ) The Housing Department has completed the investigations on the cracks and water seepage found in some flats in Tin Yuet Estate . These problems are caused by unsatisfactory workmanship at individual flats , resulting in minor non-structural cracks and water seepage at joints when the jointing materials between precast partition walls shrink .  These problems are unrelated to building structure and the previous remedial works in Yuet Fu House and Yuet Kwai House .  
It was during that time that he became heavily involved in the investigation of several complex cases that included the Wong Tak-fai Kidnapping , a major cash-in-transit armed robbery in which $ 167 million was stolen , and the apprehension of an extremely dangerous gang of armed robbers who had committed a total of at least 30 armed robberies over the previous three years .  
For 2003 , the Campaign adopts the theme of " We Care and Share for Healthy and Bright Future " with the slogan of " Serve with Heart , Live with Passion " .  In addition to the general theme of mutual support as in previous year , the aims for this year are also on encouraging active participation in community activities for the betterment of the physical and social environment , contributing to a caring , healthy and bright Hong Kong .  
Campaign speeches were more reserved , and there were fewer verbal attacks and mud-slinging than during previous elections . Peace and order prevailed in the elections , clearly demonstrating the maturity of both voters and candidates . The polls were open from 8 a.m . to 5 p.m . on a mild but cool day , ensuring a good percentage turnout . Most votes had been counted early Sunday morning , with only the results from some remote areas still pending .

By chemical injections into the roots , combined with periodic drainage of underground water during the heavy rain season , many of the trees have recovered their previous vitality . Matou pomelos , approximately palm sized , are round and plump at the base and pointed towards the top .  
The rapidly rising standard of living in the Republic of China has led to the increasing diversification of life for its citizens . As options increase , the average citizen becomes busier - - previous chores become more difficult to accomplish as a greater proportion of time is spent engaged in differing activities .  
Beginning with that term , the grand prize announced during the Chinese New Year rose from a previous US $ 600000 to the alluring sum of US $ 3,750,000 . The possibility of winning a huge sum of money with a mere US $ 2.50 ( 100 NTD ) ticket makes it easy to understand the lottery 's popularity .  
The rest of the passengers were terrified but Lu sat calmly and still . In the tenth and last test , Lu was sitting alone in a room when a swarm of monstrous ghosts and demons rushed in as if to kill him , but he was absolutely unperturbed . Then a band of yakshas came in with a chained and bloody corpse who howled , " You killed me in your previous life , and now it 's time to pay me back . "  
Three years ago , Dr . Huang did a study of 800 middle and primary school students in Taipei , and discovered the percentage of overweight kids nearly double the previous survey . Between ten and eighteen percent of the different age groups were 20 percent over the standard , while between 20 and 29 percent were 10 to 20 percent overweight . "  
These two legends , which are almost identical in content , tell of a pious woman ( actually Ksitigharbha in a previous existence ) whose earthly mother often killed living things and committed sinful deeds .  
What 's different is , the ones doing best are no longer first-generation immigrants but Chinese Americans born in the U . S . The main reason is that the new wave of immigrants is more of a mixed bag than the previous one . That group , for coincidental reasons , was so high in quality that its like has rarely been seen . They not only improved the status of Chinese Americans as a whole , but many of their children have made brilliant accomplishments .  
In this flourishing market the real estate companies often inflated prices even within a single day , producing a stampede of buyers anxious not to lose out and sending house prices skyrocketing to almost double their previous level .  
Another prominent young Chinese of the upper echelons is Jose Chen Barria , previous head of the Bureau of Immigration , and current deputy chief auditor , who is considered something of a rising star .  
What 's more , banks have discovered that the trade surplus has continued to grow . There was US $ 2.5 billion in the first quarter of this year alone - - but most of it was not remitted to Taiwan . When one adds that capital outflow was as high as US $ 1.1 billion for the quarter , it is obvious that this wave of mainland fever is bringing capital across the strait at several times the previous rate .  
Because the liberalization of the electronic media has followed on the tails of the graphic media , many people compare it to the profligate development of political magazines during the 1980s . During the era when there was a ban on publishing , dissidents operated " non-partisan magazines " to strive for freedom of speech . After censorship was lifted , the scope of subjects in magazines vastly expanded , and public opinion forums and discussion exchange sections increased . The previous form of magazine exited the battlefield .  
When employers cut and runThe method of calculating severance pay is that workers are entitled to receive one month 's average wages for each full year worked . So-called " average wages " is the average amount of money earned over the previous six months , including basic salary , overtime pay , and fixed subsidies .  
Transient desiresHaving grown up in the wealthy environment after Taiwan 's economic development reached maturity , the new new youth are sophisticated about more than just material things . In recent years the problems of divorce and extramarital affairs have become increasingly serious , the schools have gone co-ed , boys and girls have manifold opportunities to meet , and there is information about sex everywhere one turns . Young people have come to grips with intersex relations earlier than previous generations .  
But in previous years when public health insurance was principally administered under labor insurance , limitations in terms of equipment , manpower , and even information about the total number of monthly registered cases in all the clinics and hospitals , made it completely unattainable . Computerized statistical analysis and cross-referencing of the vast amounts of information was even farther outside the realm of possibility .  
Contrary to the common impression that expatriates have little contact with their native land , more than 80% of the respondents had been back in Taiwan within the past three years . More than half had been in Taiwan within the previous year . This suggests that they have maintained close ties with Taiwan . In terms of provincial origin , a plurality of our respondents - - more than 40% - - were second generation mainlanders ( that is , children of fathers who left mainland China before 1949 ) .  
After learning more about the great masses of women of previous generations , you suddenly feel close to all women , as if all were family , and feel pained by how this patriarchal and colonial society of Taiwan has oppressed women and given them no respect over the normal course of their lives . These books drive home the importance of the women 's and Taiwan autonomy movements , so as to prevent society here from regressing as a result of political troubles .  
Based on his previous research work and on the finds at the ongoing test dig , Liu Yi-chang can offer a general description of the first Puli-ites - - " Tamalin Man " - - living 2400-1700 years ago . They were a late neolithic people who used flaked stone tools . From the large number of hitching stones and animal jawbones it can be inferred that they knew fishing and agriculture .  
Tea by that time had already become an international commodity . The price went through constant fluctuations , so during those years some people made money , and some people lost money . In this way , the stable system of agricultural production and commerce in previous times , as well as the systems of wholesale distribution and management , were all destroyed .  
The internationalization of the Taiwan stock market has smashed the previous " mini-mart " situation of the last boom period . Given the expanded size of the market , plus the overall conceptual shift , some local experts have concluded : " Do n't worry ! The speculative money games of the past will never rise from the grave now . "  
Porter pointed out that previous ideas about national power and competitive advantage focused on countries with vast territory and abundant natural resources , which ideally were backed up by military strength .  
Suddenly , it seemed , all the previous procedural problems-such as the fact that the petroleum industry law has not yet been implemented , or the amended power industry law is still held up in the Legislative Yuan-had been wished away overnight ! The privatization process is still very uncertain . Indeed , the very term itself is often misunderstood , and used in a simplistic or distorted way .  
The reason for the change in their itinerary was that , like every other previous foreign excursion by top-ranking officials of the ROC , Vice President Lien 's trip was met the entire way with pressure from Beijing . Firstly , after the senior officials of the ROC and Iceland met , PRC foreign affairs spokesman Shen Guofang issued a strongly worded criticism . He asserted that Prime Minister Oddson was interfering in " the internal affairs of China " and damaging relations between the PRC and Iceland , and that Iceland would be responsible for the consequences .  
Because the results of research over the previous decade gradually received international affirmation , in 1989 the World Bank approved the center 's five-year plan and provided substantial funding . The number of research projects increased substantially and regional cooperation projects were successively begun .  
This will make it much easier for them to understand the abstract concepts . But if this previous experience is insufficient , or if the students are having trouble with step-by-step logical reasoning-such as understanding that if two sides of triangle are equal , then their corresponding angles are as well-then when they get to analysis required in more advanced geometry , they 're going to have trouble , " says teacher Lin Chia-jung .  
Lin Chia-jung points out that junior high math teachers are too hurried in the way they teach . Students have had insufficient previous experience with abstract reasoning , and because complex geometrical concepts are unconnected to daily life , geometry becomes a source of math anxiety .  
After the ROC government lifted the ban on cultural contacts with mainland China , practitioners of traditional Chinese theater enthusiastically took advantage of the opportunity to visit the land where their art was born . Those with antiquarian interests , too , were very excited about the loosening of restrictions , for even though many of China 's greatest archeological treasures are already to be found right here in Taiwan , extremely important new archeological discoveries had been made in mainland China during the previous two decades .  
Such occurrences might sound like complete fantasy to someone who has never practiced martial arts before . Chan wants to try and use modern scientific methods to explain these phenomena . " I 've been fortunate enough to win medals . This good fortune has come about thanks to good karma from a previous existence . "  
The day she completed apprenticeship , the shaman prepared chicken and pork as offerings to previous shamans in the line . Thereafter , he gave Labay a piece of rolled-up sticky rice through a bamboo divination tube . When Labay accepted the rice , this symbolized that the shaman had transferred to her all the magic powers of the line , and she thus became the eighth shaman in the succession .  
This visit , which has been called " soft diplomacy , " breaks the previous mold of focusing on political and economic power . Instead , the vice president 's delegation included members of the cultural , religious , and scientific communities , and elected officials as well .  
He then issued a second statement , mainly to apologize for his previous gaffe , but this gesture was late in coming , and did little to assuage his critics , who continue to lambaste him . The most regrettable aspect of the whole brouhaha is the fact that it has thrown salt on the wounds of Taiwan 's former comfort women and focused painful public attention upon them once again . No one should have to go through what these women have endured .  
When the regulations were announced , 90% of major international producers , including NEC and Fujitsu , discovered that their previous efforts in the field had been wasted . Startek , however , had correctly guessed that recognition standards would be based on key points for each print . Startek is now one of only three firms anywhere in the world that can provide the proper fingerprint recognition software , and its products are technically the most advanced .  
Although the political gulf between family members was perhaps not as wide as it had been in previous decades , he was worried that a scholar like himself might not have what it took to do a good job as principal after a lifetime of operating within a socialist system and enjoying powerful political backing .  
Wu admits that university students are not as knowledgeable as they used to be , but feels that the wider availability of a university education is not the only reason . He notes that five years ago , graduate school admissions committees would never have asked an applicant if he or she had been abroad . Now , however , many university students and even high-school students have traveled overseas . " This generation of students has had a more diverse array of experiences than the previous .  
Because the basic aptitude test is only one hurdle , rather than ( as with the previous exams ) a one-shot effort to survey everything the student learned in three years of junior high school or high school , it can place more emphasis on the overall capabilities of the child . Thus , the scope is much broader-no longer limited to school textbooks-while the questions can be framed in a much more lively and flexible way .  
Each jumbo lotto ticket costs NT $ 50 . If 10.4 million tickets are sold for every drawing , the jackpot is NT $ 45 million . The game has a rolling jackpot that grows on each drawing when the previous jackpot has not been won . The rolling jackpot can accumulate for a maximum of five weeks , and if 10.4 million tickets are sold each drawing , the top prize will build to NT $ 250 million .  
On his one previous visit in the winter of 1958 , accompanied by his mother , Taipei always seemed grayish and wet as it was raining most of the time . A child prodigy with a phenomenal memory , Joppert never forgot the rainy month he spent here .  
Through satellite observations , the fishing industry has gradually come to understand the waxing and waning of cold and warm currents . Noting the succession of warm winters in the 1990s , and a 1 �X C rise in sea temperatures around Taiwan , the Taiwan Fisheries Research Institute also began making fish catch forecasts based on sea temperatures . For instance , the temperature that best suits mullet is 21-23 �X C , but last year the institute predicted that sea temperatures around southern Taiwan would be 2-3 �X C warmer this winter than in previous years .  
This year , someone who had a lucky year over the previous year offered the temple 230 taels ( 8.6 kilos ) of gold . The temple decided to break up that amount and make a family of one large and three small golden turtles which would be open to qigui for the public . In front of the temple they even built a clever little landscape garden where the four golden turtles can live a leisurely existence .  
In order to resolve the controversy over the relative importance of " national security " and " economic development , " when I was minister of economic affairs I raised a new idea : " The internationalization of Taiwan 's economic position is the best guarantee of national security .

"  
When the ROC 's Immigration Law was promulgated in 1999 , it offered foreign nationals the right of permanent residency for the first time . But the conditions were that at the time of applying , a foreigner had to have accumulated " seven years of continuous lawful residency , " during which time they had to have been in Taiwan for at least 270 days each year . In other words , an applicant could not have left Taiwan for more than three months in any of the previous seven years .  
Today , it 's nothing special to have the chance to go overseas to study , and a more diversified value system has overturned the previous tradition of invariably studying in the US . The opening up of travel for the purpose of tourism has also allowed many people from different social strata to have the ability to experience foreign cultures .  
In 1999 , the Japanese physician H . Takada isolated BPA from the umbilical cords of women giving birth at a clinic .

In a coffee shop smelling of stale cigarette smoke and pipe tobacco , Lin reflects on his new film . Not only was it the most expensive of all his previous works , but the actual filming was also the most painstaking . Each day , as work began , two to three hours were spent on setting up lighting alone , in an attempt to bring out the essence of middle-class urban life . The Cruise of Robinson portrays a real-estate agent who makes his home in a hotel .  
In visiting the area , IACT members found that the Tibetans , accustomed to living in a cool , dry climate at high altitudes , still maintained some of their previous customs even after moving to southern India , and these created a higher incidence of transmission of disease .  
Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon 's exquisite imagery and dramatic plot , and its rhythm which alternates between moments of understatement and boisterousness , have helped to inject new life into an ailing genre . However , Crouching Tiger 's success in breaking free of the previous martial arts mold must be viewed in light of its hybrid origins .  
Early this March , Tzu Chi branches from Singapore , Malaysia , Indonesia , and Taiwan joined together for Tzu Chi 's fourth free clinic on the Indonesian island of Batam . On each occasion so far , the number of local volunteers has grown , and patients and their families who have been helped in previous years have come forward on their own to lend a hand . At the clinic site , you can hear Mandarin Chinese , English , Indonesian , Malaysian , and Hokkien rising and falling .  
But the downside of having conquered these illnesses is that the number of patients is constantly falling , so most young doctors prefer to specialize in growth fields like illnesses of advanced industrial societies or problems of the elderly . Virology , bacteriology , and epidemiology are considered " sunset subjects . " The result is that there has been no one to take the baton from the previous generation , and gatherings of specialists in these fields can be mistaken for meetings of a senior citizens group .  
Comparing the economic effects of SARS to downturns in previous years , Jeng notes that the epidemic struck just as the world economy was bottoming out . Although SARS upset forecasts of a quick recovery , it has had a relatively mild impact on the economy , because the mood in the business community has remained one of cautious optimism .  
In addition to private entrepreneurs abandoning their hide-bound attitudes and moving forward hand in hand to develop the market , the Executive Yuan 's plan to double the number of foreign tourists was already on track last year with an estimated investment over the next six years of almost NT $ 80 billion and a yearly target for visitors to Taiwan in 2003 and beyond of three million , up from 2.6 million of previous years .  
Leaving aside families " in name only , " whether it 's the " single-parent family , " the " second family " ( after remarriage , bringing children from a previous marriage ) , the " geographically divided family , " or the " pseudo-single-parent family " ( one spouse absent for extended periods ) , they all have increased with surprising speed . Showing a slight increase in number are families where , because of the absence of both parents , Grandma and Grandpop are raising the children in their place " across generations . "  
Chou takes the nine-year integrated curriculum as an example . Neither the idea of a system integrating the content to be studied in Grades 1-9 , nor that of academic " fields , " are new . In fact , these things had been spelled out in previous curricular standards . In past decades , however , one saw the prevalent use of " contracting out " specialized tasks within Taiwan 's education system , so much so that now that things have been opened up , people can not imagine doing otherwise .  
During previous typhoons , after a flood release from the reservoir , it was always possible to wait a few days for the river water to clear up and start providing potable water again .

After gaining the understanding of and establishing mutual trust with his previous employer , Chung went into the same business of contract manufacturing of inverters . However , he was scrupulous in not poaching his previous employer 's customers , even as he expanded his two-person company into a factory employing more than 50 people in just three or four years . He was also occupied by additional investments in more than ten different industries , including real estate , computers , import / export trade , automotive care , and energy-efficient light bulbs .

The lack of progress in addressing the fundamental political problems during the fourth round of inter-Tajik negotiations at Almaty from 22 May to 1 June , about which I informed the Council in my previous report , as well as continued tension along the Tajik-Afghan border and inside Tajikistan , created a stalemate in the negotiating process and in the implementation of the confidence-building measures agreed upon at Almaty .  
In its agreed conclusions / 1995 / 1 , the Economic and Social Council decided that a theme related to the follow-up of conferences , to be considered at the coordination segment , should be chosen at the Council 's previous substantive session to allow for adequate preparations by the functional commissions , other relevant intergovernmental bodies and the Secretariat .

The average monthly cost for the previous period was $ 5,000 , but requirements for the current period are expected to be much higher because , while some of these services were covered under the logistic support services contract during the last mandate , the new service contract does not provide for them , thus requiring use of local contractors to provide these services .  
In that light , the Russian delegation joined the sponsors of the original draft resolution on multilingualism , and guided by the spirit of compromise and having tried to ensure that the comments expressed at previous meetings were taken into account as fully as possible , is prepared to support the draft in its revised form . 
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,

The massive exodus of almost the entire Serb population from Krajina and western Slavonia , preceded by the previous exodus of over 300,000 Serb population from Croatia outside Krajina , as well as military intervention of the regular units of the Croatian army in Western Bosnia served the purpose of the current leadership of Croatia to create " Greater Croatia " , i.e . , an ethnically pure State without the Serbs .  
Noting also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation , and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
During the current discussions , the Iraqi counterparts retracted their previous explanation that the sphere had been cast merely to optimize the mass-to-surface area ratio in connection with their work on melting and purification and declared that the casting of the sphere had been done to gain some preliminary experience that would be of assistance in their eventual production of the pits of nuclear weapons .  
also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation , and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
invoking the data from the reports of the previous Special Rapporteur , with whom the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia severed all relations because of his proven partiality , the authors of draft resolution A / C . 3 / 50 / L . 46 wish to portray that in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia there are " massive and systematic violations of human rights and international humanitarian law " .  
At a meeting of ACC held the previous month in New York , all the Executive Heads of the organizations of the United Nations system had expressed deep awareness of the need for improved performance management and increased productivity at a time of increasing demands and scarce financial resources .  
its previous relevant resolutions , as well as those of the Commission on Human Rights , particularly resolution 1995 / 88 , and the conclusions of the World Conference on Human Rights , which recognized that gross violations of human rights , including in armed conflicts , are among the multiple and complex factors leading to displacement of people , and the need for a comprehensive approach by the international community to address root causes and effects of movements of refugees and other displaced persons and the strengthening of emergency preparedness and response mechanisms ,  
As I stated on a previous occasion , Bolivia is of the view that many conflict situations can be explained by the persistence of unresolved social and national problems , as well as by the accumulation of age-old injustices and resentments ; by geopolitical and economic interests that for decades have been fuelling confrontation from without and from within ; and , above all , by Governments ' inability to cooperate effectively so as to provide timely and peaceful solutions to the problems of greatest national concern . 
The fundamental difficulties which faced our nation in its previous efforts at building a viable democracy are being progressively addressed , taking into account the objective realities of our national situation , so as to ensure an orderly transition and the establishment of durable democratic structures of governance at all levels in our country .  
At the two previous sessions of the General Assembly , we pointed out that the lack of visible signs of understanding and tangible measures on the part of the developed nations in assisting the new and restored democracies could be interpreted as an unfavourable external factor and have serious consequences for both national harmony and regional stability .  
The delegation of Ukraine considers that the issue of special economic assistance to countries affected by the sanctions regime should remain on the agenda of the United Nations , taking into account the fact that the previous resolutions on the issue have not been duly implemented , at least with respect to my country , which has not received adequate assistance to cover the tremendous losses caused by its strict and consistent observance of the sanctions regime .  
Inasmuch as the Security Council bears the primary responsibility for carrying out the major purpose of the United Nations , namely , the achievement and maintenance of world peace and stability , its importance is obvious .  As it has indicated on previous occasions , Japan , with the endorsement of many other countries , is prepared to discharge its responsibilities as a permanent member of the Security Council in accordance with its basic philosophy of the non-resort to the use of force prohibited by its Constitution .  
Our previous bilateral efforts have demonstrated that nuclear disarmament is an extremely intricate process involving careful trade-offs , specialized and highly tailored verification , and very sensitive security calculations .  
The World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children , held in Stockholm in August 1996 , had greatly contributed to that awareness , as had the tragic deaths in Belgium the previous summer of young teenagers who had been sexually abused , which had shattered the myth that only children in developing countries fell prey to commercial sexual exploitation . 
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] / and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
This seminar will provide instruction in the development of peace-keeping training methods and programmes to a select group of military and civilian police officers who already have previous United Nations peace-keeping experience and who are presently involved in peace-keeping training at the national level , or will likely become involved in the future .  
Noting also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
The topics covered at previous sessions of the Committee , such as labour relations , recruitment career and training policies , social security , the effects of structural and technological change , formed part of the ILO record in defending democratic values in the public service .  
Although it was a body that could boast of noteworthy achievements over the previous 30 years in the preparation of legal instruments governing outer space , there seemed to be a current of opinion to the effect that it had now served its purpose , since future space activities would tend to be regulated by market forces .  
The previous report , in describing the activities concerned , paid particular attention to projects aimed at enhancing the capacity of developing countries and countries with economies in transition to develop effective foreign investment policies and negotiate mining agreements and to develop and implement adequate social policies to respond to the ongoing trend towards privatization of the mining sector .  
A number of scenarios of future world transportation demand prepared by IIASA suggest that based on current policies , recent observed trend increases in mobility and changes in transportation modes will dominate the evolution of fuel efficiency , which implies the growth of global transportation energy demand at more or less similar ( linear ) rates as in previous decades .  
In addition , the costs of building additional storage facilities and conveyance systems are soaring , and attempts to recover costs have so far met with little progress ; financial constraints are contributing to a revision of previous policies ; and many contemporary projects are being questioned by vocal environmental movements .  
The Under-Secretary-General went on to explain , on the basis of the Council 's previous practice in such cases , that it was probable that the Office would initially be established for a period of six months and that this initial mandate would subsequently be extended for further periods of a similar duration if the Government so wished and the Council was satisfied that the Office 's achievements justified the expenditure involved .  
Decides further , as an ad hoc and exceptional arrangement , that Member States shall waive their respective shares in the remaining credits arising from previous budgets of the United Nations Protection Force in an amount of 8,455,336 dollars gross ( 8,601,911 dollars net ) , to be transferred to the Special Account for the International Tribunal from the Special Account for the United Nations Protection Force established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 46 / 233 of 19 March 1992 ;

As stated in the previous report of the Secretary-General on the subject ( see A / 50 / 361 , paras . 44-49 , despite several cases of application of Article 50 of the Charter of the United Nations , in connection with sanctions against Southern Rhodesia , Iraq and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , there is no uniform and internationally recognized methodology for identifying and assessing the special economic problems of non-target States affected by the implementation of mandatory economic sanctions .  
Consequently , in his previous report to the General Assembly ( A / 50 / 390 , para . 28 ) , the Special Rapporteur indicated that illicit activities in which nationality is used to mask their mercenary nature by a Power that recruits , prepares and pays an individual to perpetrate a criminal act against another country , its Government , its property or a given sector of its population should be analysed and debated with a view to revising current international provisions on the subject .  
The fact that our Kurdish people sought help from its national Government in order to end its suffering exposes the persistent claims of the Special Rapporteur and certain of the allied States , principally the United States , that their military intervention in the northern part of Iraq was intended to protect the Kurds , and supports our previous assertions , namely , that the secret but true intention behind that intervention is to tear apart Iraq and fragment its territorial integrity .  
The strengthening of the monitoring , internal audit , inspection and evaluation , and investigation functions provided for in the resolution is an important and integral part of the Secretary-General 's management plan , as outlined in his current and his previous annual reports on the work of the Organization , and is all the more essential at a time of major resource constraints .  
The revised cost estimates for the maintenance of the Observer Mission for the 12-month period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 represented a 47 per cent reduction in the previous estimate , due to the reduced staffing level , comprising 34 military observers , 43 international staff and 47 local staff , and the non-implementation of disarmament and demobilization programme .  
All that the people of southern Africa are asking for now is a chance to live in peace so that they can address the myriad problems and challenges left unattended for decades by previous colonial and racist regimes in their region . 
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
Recalling the long-standing determination of the international community to achieve the effective prohibition of the development , production , stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons as well as the continuing support for measures to uphold the authority of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating , Poisonous or Other Gasses , and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare , signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 , [ 1 ] / as expressed by consensus in many previous resolutions ,  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space [ 3 ] / and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
For all those reasons , and in view of its previous request for the strengthening of support to the Committee , made at its fourth session it expressed its willingness to be involved in future consultations with the Secretariat to ensure the optimal use of available resources and the effective performance of its functions , in the light of article 43 , paragraph 11 of the Convention .  
As for previous thematic discussions , the Committee had invited , in the light of article 45 of the Convention , representatives of United Nations organs , bodies and specialized agencies , and other competent bodies , including non-governmental organizations , media representatives , research and academic organizations , and children to contribute to the discussion and provide expert advice on the topics identified .

Since its address to the Sixth Committee at the previous session , ICRC had continued its work to clarify the content of international humanitarian law and to ensure its continued adaptation to the conditions of modern warfare , with particular emphasis on its applicability to United Nations peacekeeping and enforcement operations , on rules applicable to war at sea , and on the prohibition of anti-personnel mines and blinding laser weapons .  
Although the establishment of a rapidly deployable mission headquarters was a constructive step , it would not be a panacea for the range of problems experienced in previous United Nations peacekeeping missions ; it would provide operational and planning improvements , however , and would enable the United Nations to deploy more quickly to the field a well-prepared and jointly trained team of military and civilian personnel in the most critical phase of peacekeeping operations .  
The representative of Norway , a country with which Burundi had excellent cooperative relations , had , at a previous meeting , said that the coup d ' \ x { 5f4b } at that had taken place in Burundi in 1995 had not improved the security or human rights situation but , on the contrary , had exacerbated the suffering of the people .  
To achieve its goals in this area , UNCTAD uses to its maximum extent the leverage of the information technology paradox : contrary to previous technological revolutions , which have largely concentrated economic power and competitiveness in a handful of capital-rich and technology-intensive national economies , the information revolution has made strategic technologies and information much more affordable , even for the smaller players . 
Convinced that education and public information activities in the field of human rights were prerequisites for the full and effective enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the three main sponsors , Australia , Costa Rica and Namibia , had decided to draft a single text combining two previous General Assembly resolutions on that issue .

As I pointed out in my previous report , it is in these areas that MICIVIH has placed emphasis since its redeployment in October 1994 and it is in these areas that the Mission , because of its extensive field experience and accumulated expertise , would be able to make a significant contribution to the consolidation of key structures charged with protection of human rights and to the deepening of the democratic process . 
In fact , the much needed international humanitarian and technical assistance to the Palestinian people remains hindered by the apparent non-cooperative attitude of the Israeli authorities , who continue to enforce upon the population of today 's Palestine the same restrictive bureaucratic formalities that they designed to deal with the people living under their military occupation in previous years . 
If the number of candidates obtaining such majority is less than the number of persons or members to be elected , there shall be additional ballots to fill the remaining places , the voting being restricted to the candidates obtaining the greatest number of votes in the previous ballot to a number not more than twice the places remaining to be filled , provided that , after the third inconclusive ballot , votes may be cast for any eligible person or member .

Noting also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
It would appear that the views of the Inspectors in this report vary significantly from the conclusions and recommendations of two previous JIU reports on the subject of advancing the status of women , issued in June 19943 and October 1995.4 Both reports were fully supportive of the special measures introduced by the Secretary-General to improve the status of women in the Secretariat and called for increased accountability of programme managers , in particular those who did not demonstrate real efforts to improve the status and representation of women in their respective departments .  
His delegation supported in part the approach followed by the Commission in its previous sessions , namely , to retain only those crimes whose gravity could not easily be contested , as well as crimes of a clearly political nature which posed a threat to international peace and security and therefore to exclude crimes , such as piracy , trafficking in women and children , racial discrimination , recruitment of mercenaries and foreign intervention .  
A proposal for a zero or negative increase for the biennium 1998-1999 at the current stage would be arbitrary and unrealistic , and a proposal to set the general level of the contingency fund simply on the basis of the experience of the previous biennium would be of doubtful reliability and validity .  
His delegation , which fully associated itself with the views expressed at a previous meeting by the representative of Ireland on behalf of the European Union , was of the view that the court , though closely linked to the United Nations , should be an independent international institution established by a multilateral treaty .  
He had also dedicated a detailed analysis in his previous report to on the causes of the large number of women detainees in State prisons in northern Sudan and drew attention to the numerous deficiencies in the legal procedures and to abuses and violations of which convicted women had been victims during the previous five years : rape in police custody , malnourishment , enforced conversion to Islam , physical assault and other forms of harassment .  
At previous international conferences , Governments agreed upon a set of goals and objectives for national and international efforts in the area of education and literacy , and health , in particular for maternal and child health and the control of major communicable diseases .

Any specific agreements should take into account the special geographic , climatic , historical and hydrological characteristics of a given river , as well as previous bilateral and multilateral agreements and the customary uses of its water resources .  
In fact , the much-needed international humanitarian and technical assistance to the Palestinian people also remains hindered by the apparent non-cooperative attitude of the Israeli authorities , which still continue to enforce upon the population of today 's Palestine the same restrictive bureaucratic formalities that they had designed to deal with the people living under their military occupation in previous years .  
In themselves such weapons threaten an imbalance in nature , and many of the biological agents that can be used as weapons are capable of frustrating all the efforts made in previous decades to eradicate diseases that are highly contagious and extremely dangerous to human health worldwide .  
We are here to consolidate our collective efforts and to concentrate on developing a more pragmatic and mutually beneficial relationship so that in the years ahead we are better able to tackle the problems we have already identified at previous conferences and at the national level .

Despite the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur in his previous reports , insufficient publicity is still given to laws and governmental acts , to such an extent that they are unknown not only to the general public , but also to sectors of the public administration _ especially the peripheral authorities responsible for public order , who take advantage of their ignorance to deny legally granted rights to applicants .  
As mentioned in his previous report , the Special Rapporteur continued to receive reports and information on grave and widespread violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms by government agents , and abuses and atrocities committed against the life , liberty and security of individuals by members of different parties to the armed conflict in the country other than the Government of the Sudan in the areas under their control .  
While the number of personnel requiring rations is lower than in the prior period , the increase is attributable to the higher cost of bottled water ( $ 0.57 ) than in the previous period ( $ 0.50 ) and the additional requirement for bottled water for the team sites for cooking purposes , consumption by visiting flight crews and its use for generators to prevent potential damage to the equipment by the high salt and mineral content of local water . ( e ) Daily allowance .  
In its decision 96 / 25 , the Executive Board decided , inter alia , to introduce an annual work plan and , in paragraph 5 of the same decision , requested that UNDP and UNFPA prepare , for the third regular session " an outline of issues that could be considered by the Board in 1997 , based on previous deliberations of the Board and the organizational priorities and objectives set for 1997 " .  
The Agreement brings into effect all the previous agreements encompassing military , political , social , economic and environmental issues and binds them into a comprehensive nationwide agenda for peace .  
He made it clear in his previous report to the General Assembly that those measures were beginning to have a real impact on the people in the towns , particularly the urban elite , and that they were adding to the suffering in rural areas , where people are often poor and where , owing to the violence and the civil war , regular access to , inter alia , health care , hygiene , various essential goods and primary and secondary education have become even more curtailed .

The Philippines - as expressed in previous comments - favoured the draft minimum rules and stated that the Department of Justice of the Philippines was developing several activities intended to improve the capabilities of prosecutors and enhance the working relations among law enforcers and trial court judges , in order to fulfil the desired goals set by the draft minimum rules .  
Reaffirming that activities to improve public knowledge in the field of human rights are essential to the fulfilment of the principles and purposes of the United Nations set out in Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter of the United Nations , and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , education and information are essential to the achievement of lasting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , Recalling previous General Assembly and its own resolutions on this subject ,  
He also noted that the Secretariat , as requested by the Subcommittee at its previous session in 1996 , had submitted a working paper entitled An analysis of the compatibility of the approach contained in the working paper entitled Some considerations concerning the utilization of the geostationary satellite orbit with the existing regulatory procedures of the International Telecommunication Union relating to the use of the geostationary orbit ( A / AC . 105 / C . 2 / L . 205 ) .  
As on previous occasions , the Polish delegation expresses its strong belief that only genuine national reconciliation and respect for the interests of all ethnic and religious population groups in Afghanistan , as well as the long-standing tradition of Afghan statehood , can provide a true basis for a peaceful settlement of the conflict .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit an in-depth evaluation and subsequent budgetary proposals that reflect as closely as possible the overall evolution of peacekeeping trends , including any relevant restructuring of the various divisions and units involved in backstopping activities , taking into account the lessons learned from previous years ' experience of operating the support account and the workload relating to closed and completed missions ;

Requests the Secretary-General to submit an in-depth evaluation and subsequent budgetary proposals that reflect as closely as possible the overall evolution of peacekeeping trends , including any relevant restructuring of the various divisions and units involved in backstopping activities , taking into account the lessons learned from previous years ' experience of operating the support account and the workload relating to closed and completed missions ;  
It is based on the contributions requested by the Division for the Advancement of Women , which focused on additional action taken by the relevant entities in support of the implementation of the Platform for Action since the submission of the previous report of the Secretary-General on the subject ( A / 51 / 322 ) and on means of implementation , including new human resources , financial means and structural changes .

The Expert Meeting observed that the growth of international food trade had been high , at almost 7 per cent a year during the previous 10 years , not much lower than that of trade in manufactured goods .  
As noted in the previous annual report , rule 72 ( B ) was amended at the eleventh plenary session in order to allow interlocutory appeal , that is , provisional appeal before the end of the trial , from decisions rendered by Trial Chambers on parties ' preliminary motions .  
The Secretary-General had , in his previous report ( A / 50 / 480 ) , suggested that themes be selected in the light of the principal objectives of the dialogue ; that is , to promote broader and deeper understanding of issues of a global or transboundary nature that cut across individual , regional or group interests .  
VIII . 177 .  The Advisory Committee was informed that the arrangements for common and joint services in Vienna that had been in place since 1979 and were based on a tripartite agreement between IAEA , UNIDO and the United Nations , have changed to the extent that certain programmes have become increasingly difficult to maintain at the previous levels .  
Since my previous report on questions relating to information ( A / 51 / 406 ) , the Department of Public Information has continued to enhance its outreach efforts by strengthening its partnerships with influential media organizations , leaders of civil society , intellectual and educational groups , among others , and by utilizing information technology to its fullest capacity , while continuing to make gains in outreach through the traditional media : press , radio and television .  
That lack left the door open to different interpretations even of such generally recognized principles as the sovereign equality of States , non-discrimination , non-interference , negotiation in good faith , cooperation between States and the non-use of force , and experience showed how changing the agreed or implied rules of negotiation or backtracking on previous agreements complicated subsequent negotiations .  
Singapore believed , however , that the guiding principles which would allow for the application of international law without the exercise of political influence and afford States , large and small alike , a level playing field , should include those principles that prohibited discrimination , coercion and reneging on previous agreements as well as those that encouraged the open and candid exchange of information and discouraged misinformation and the introduction of irrelevant considerations .  
At previous international conferences , Governments agreed upon a set of goals and objectives for national and international efforts in the areas of education , literacy and health , in particular maternal and child health , and the control of major communicable diseases .  
At that time , the restructuring process was fully under way in both the private and public sectors , with the addition of new technologies and production , distribution and marketing processes , a significant increase in productivity resulting from the stability and with a change in the previous economy 's suffocating rules of the game , such as the cheapening of capital goods and the disappearance of inflation as an instantaneous means of relaxing labour costs .  
As in previous years , it is to be stressed that guidelines contained in General Assembly resolutions should be followed , in particular the desirability of using , as far as possible , the resources and facilities made available by Member States , international organizations and others ; as well as the need , in appointing lecturers for the seminars of the Fellowship Programme to secure representation of the major legal systems and to ensure balance among various geographical regions .  
As documented in the present report and in previous reports , these restrictions relate primarily to access by Operation Lifeline Sudan to needy populations , whether in the form of relief flights from the base at Lokichokio into southern Sudan , humanitarian action in favour of the over 2-million internally displaced persons living in and around greater Khartoum , or permission to assess the conditions of civilian populations in the Nuba Mountains or in new areas of need created as a result of a resurgence of hostilities .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
With regard to the Boards principal findings on the voluntary funds administered by UNHCR , he said that as far as previous recommendations not fully implemented were concerned the main persistent irregularities were the non-assessment of the capabilities of implementing partners ; delays in the submission of project-monitoring reports ; the selective basis on which work plans were prepared ; and the failure of implementing partners to maintain separate accounts for UNHCR funds .  
If the number of candidates obtaining such majority is less than the number of persons or delegations to be elected , there shall be additional ballots to fill the remaining places , the voting being restricted to the candidates obtaining the greatest number of votes in the previous ballot , to a number not more than twice the places remaining to be filled , provided that , after the third inconclusive ballot , votes may be cast for any eligible person or delegation .  
Recalling its previous relevant resolutions , as well as those of the Commission on Human Rights , in particular Commission resolution 1997 / 75 of 18 April 1997 , and the conclusions of the World Conference on Human Rights , [ 1 ] which recognized that gross violations of human rights , including in armed conflicts , are among the multiple and complex factors leading to displacement of people ,  
As was indicated at that time , budget implementation during the current biennium would be notably more challenging than in previous bienniums owing to the dynamic efforts required to manage the sharply reduced level of resources within a short budget cycle and within a budgetary structure with limited flexibility or requiring longer lead times to address the necessary savings other than through significant reductions in staff costs .  
With regard to earlier notification of Member States in danger of falling under Article 19 , requested in paragraph 12 of General Assembly resolution 50 / 207 B , the Committee was advised that uncertainty about the amounts and timing of assessments for peacekeeping and the international tribunals precluded accurate calculations for the application of Article 19 much before the end of the previous year .  
Indeed , with all of these trends and tendencies in the world economy , it was recognized by both developed and developing countries , States Members of the United Nations , that it was imperative to launch an endeavour of charting a framework of objectives and measures for national and international actions to address development more squarely and comprehensively than any other previous initiative undertaken by the United Nations .  
Recurrent drought in the southern Africa region this decade , the weak economic base of the country , which is almost exclusively agricultural , a rather unbalanced social infrastructure , which is partly due to the low literacy rate inherited from the previous regime , and the problem of disease , including HIV / AIDS , pose a serious threat to our nascent democracy .  
We support the Syrian position calling for the resumption of the negotiations with the current Israeli Government from where they ended with the previous Israeli Government , based on full and complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan to the boundaries prior to 4 June 1967 , with the concomitant mutual obligations to guarantee the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace between Syria and Israel and in the region at large .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
As recently as 1995 , all the CIS countries shared one basic feature : precipitous and sweeping economic decline ( the two notable exceptions in 1995 were Armenia and Georgia , where GDP had grown a little after the nearly catastrophic collapse of previous years ) .  
In its decision 96 / 25 , the Executive Board decided , inter alia , to introduce an annual work plan and , in paragraph 5 of the same decision , requested that UNDP and UNFPA prepare , for the third regular session " an outline of issues that could be considered by the Board in 1997 , based on previous deliberations of the Board and the organizational priorities and objectives set for 1997 " .  
As in previous years , the responses indicated that the major causal factors of mass exoduses are international and internal conflicts , as well as systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
Noting the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
As stated in his previous report , the Special Representative believes that the speedy creation of an independent electoral commission would send an unambiguous signal to the people of Cambodia that the Government of Cambodia is committed to free and fair elections .  
In previous reports the information and data available to the Special Rapporteur were grouped in chapters on specific categories of violations of human rights such as summary executions , arbitrary arrests , torture , violations of the rights of the child and the rights of women , freedom of expression and movement , etc . with additional paragraphs , whenever necessary , on special questions , such as incidents which prevented humanitarian activities or the situation in the Nuba Mountains .  
The Commission on Human Rights , in its decision 1996 / 112 of 23 April 1996 , decided to retain on its agenda item 10 ( a ) entitled Question of human rights in Cyprus , it being understood that action required by previous resolutions of the Commission on that subject would continue to remain operative , including the request to the Secretary-General to provide a report to the Commission regarding their implementation .  
Those documents contain many factual clarifications and rebuttals of the allegations and fabrications , totally unsubstantiated by any material proof , which the Special Rapporteur included in his previous reports and which he is still reiterating for political reasons the main aim of which is to besmirch the reputation of Iraq and its national leadership .  
Since 1968 , one of the Government 's priorities has been to put an end to all the manifestations of administrative corruption , which were widespread during previous eras , through the promulgation of numerous decrees and the adoption of effective measures to enable the Iraqi people to enjoy their economic , social and cultural rights .  
The net additional requirements of $ 536,400 for commercial communications were attributable to the satellite user charges from the previous mandate period ( $ 356,200 ) , recorded in the reporting period because of the late submission of invoices and the extensive use of satellite facilities by the military , civilian police and electoral observer components of the mission in November and December 1994 ( $ 626,000 ) . ( b ) Main trunking contract .  
As the Commission may recall , in its previous statement on the question , the Indonesian Government unequivocally stressed that ' one particular problem in this matter is that many of those who were involved in the violent demonstrations leading to the incident have not come forward or have left the country clandestinely ' .  
I am delighted to see you in the Chair of this distinguished assembly , as the representative of a country with which Italy has maintained , through centuries , deep relations of cooperation and cultural exchanges of which I , myself , had the privilege , in a previous professional experience , to be a witness and a promoter . 
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;  
Noting with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,  
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;  
At its 67th meeting , on 16 April 1997 , the Commission , taking into account its heavy schedule of work , as well as the need to give adequate consideration to all the items on the agenda , and recalling that in previous years the Economic and Social Council had approved the Commission 's request for additional meetings for its thirty _ seventh to fifty _ third sessions , decided , without a vote :  
At its 67th meeting , on 16 April 1997 , the Commission decided , without a vote , to retain on its agenda item 10 ( a ) , entitled Question of human rights in Cyprus , and to give it due priority at its fifty _ fourth session , it being understood that action required by previous resolutions of the Commission on the subject would continue to remain operative , including the request to the Secretary _ General to provide a report to the Commission regarding their implementation .  
General information on the Territorys offshore financial services industry is contained in the previous working paper prepared by the Secretariat ( A / AC . 109 / 2051 , paras . 12 and 13 ) .  15 .  Among the attractions for offshore companies are the use of the United States dollar as the official currency , the absence of direct taxation , a growing financial infrastructure , fast and straightforward company registration procedures , extensive financial freedom and confidentiality .  
UNDP assistance under the fifth cycle country programme ( 1992-1996 ) to the Caribbean dependent Territories which includes the Turks and Caicos Islands , had as its principal focus the provision of support for human resource development , capacity-building , institutional strengthening and environment and natural resources management .  With this in view , the proposed strategy of UNDP at the start of the current sixth cycle has been to continue its emphasis on providing support in those areas , building upon the outputs of its previous interventions .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit an in-depth evaluation and subsequent budgetary proposals that reflect as closely as possible the overall evolution of peacekeeping trends , including any relevant restructuring of the various divisions and units involved in backstopping activities , taking into account the lessons learned from previous years ' experience of operating the support account and the workload relating to closed and completed missions ;  
If the number of candidates obtaining such majority is less than the number of persons or delegations to be elected , there shall be additional ballots to fill the remaining places , the voting being restricted to the candidates obtaining the greatest number of votes in the previous ballot , to a number not more than twice the places remaining to be filled , provided that , after the third inconclusive ballot , votes may be cast for any eligible person or delegation .  
At previous international conferences , Governments agreed upon a set of goals and objectives for national and international efforts in the area of education and literacy , and health , in particular for maternal and child health and the control of major communicable diseases .  
During plenary meetings of the Conference , delegations reaffirmed or further elaborated their respective positions on the agenda item , the detailed descriptions of which were duly recorded in the plenary records of this session as well as in the previous annual reports of the Conference , in particular paragraphs 41-56 of the 1992 report to the General Assembly of the United Nations ( CD / 1173 ) and related official documents and working papers .  
During plenary meetings of the Conference , delegations reaffirmed or further elaborated their respective positions on the agenda item , the detailed descriptions of which were duly recorded in the previous annual reports of the Conference , in particular paragraphs 62-71 of the 1992 report to the General Assembly of the United Nations ( CD / 1173 ) , related official documents and working papers , as well as plenary records .  
During plenary meetings of the Conference , delegations reaffirmed or further elaborated their respective positions on the agenda item , the detailed descriptions of which were duly recorded in the plenary records of this session , as well as in the previous annual reports of the Conference , in particular paragraph 32 of the 1994 report to the General Assembly of the United Nations ( CD / 1281 ) and related official documents and working papers .  
During plenary meetings of the Conference , delegations reaffirmed or further elaborated their respective positions on the agenda item , the detailed descriptions of which were duly recorded in the plenary records of this session , as well as in the previous annual reports of the Conference , in particular paragraph 33 of the 1994 report to the General Assembly of the United Nations ( CD / 1281 ) and related official documents and working papers .  
During plenary meetings of the Conference , some delegations reaffirmed or further elaborated their respective positions on the agenda item , the detailed descriptions of which were duly recorded in the previous annual reports of the Conference , related official documents and working papers , as well as plenary records .  
During plenary meetings of the Conference , some delegations reaffirmed or further elaborated their respective positions on the agenda item , the detailed descriptions of which were duly recorded in the previous annual reports of the Conference , in particular paragraphs 83-89 of the 1992 report to the General Assembly of the United Nations ( CD / 1173 ) , related official documents and working papers , as well as plenary records .  
During plenary meetings of the Conference , delegations reaffirmed or further elaborated their respective positions on the agenda item , the detailed descriptions of which were duly recorded in the plenary records of this session , as well as in the previous annual reports of the Conference , in particular paragraph 36 of the 1994 report to the General Assembly of the United Nations ( CD / 1281 ) and related official documents and working papers .  
However , those various strategies had been no more than a palliative since , as indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on the developing country debt situation ( A / 51 / 294 ) , in 1995 the gross external debt of capital-importing developing countries had grown by 7.4 per cent compared with the previous year and , according to World Bank data , 16 of the 52 countries classified that year as heavily indebted countries were middle-income countries .  
The Government of the United States of America has not only deliberately ignored the opinion and decisions of the international community and the purposes and principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations , but has also decided to step up its economic , commercial and financial blockade against Cuba , in this case by means of the law known as the Helms-Burton Act , whose scope exceeds that of all previous legislation by grouping together , intensifying and conferring legal status on all earlier measures and provisions relating to the blockade . 
Even though there was a decrease of 1.8 per cent in the overall percentage of promotions of women in posts subject to geographical distribution , the percentage of promotions for women at the D-1 and P-5 levels has increased considerably as compared with the previous year , thus increasing the pool of women eligible for promotion to senior decision-making levels in the near future .  
Although his previous requests have remained unanswered , the Special Rapporteur is still waiting for the existing Government to carry out an independent , neutral , objective and complete investigation into the exact circumstances of the murder of three delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross on 4 June 1996 , near Mugina , Cibitoke province , to establish clearly who was responsible , and to publish the results without further delay .  
Having received no response to the request he made in his previous report , the Special Rapporteur reiterates the urgent request he made to the existing Government to provide , as promised earlier by Major Buyoya , the results of the investigation into allegations of the expulsion manu militari of 392 Burundian refugees in Rwanda to Cibitoke province , on 30 September 1996 , by soldiers of the Rwandan Patriotic Front , at a time when numerous violations of human rights were being reported in that region .  
The Special Rapporteur reiterates his solemn and urgent appeal to the Burundian authorities to defer the 38 death sentences and 19 sentences of life imprisonment handed down during the February-March , April-May and July-August sessions of the criminal chambers , as well as the previous 133 death sentences and 54 sentences of life imprisonment , at least until the peace negotiations have been completed and a reformed judicial system , capable of playing its role with complete independence and impartiality , has been established .  
Many countries acknowledged that the root causes of the continuing financial crisis were , on the one hand , a poorly thought out and excessive expansion of the scope of United Nations activities during the previous decade , which had had an adverse impact on the effectiveness of the activities of almost all the specialized agencies , funds and programmes of the United Nations , and , on the other hand , the unjust apportionment of the Organization 's expenses among its Member States .  
Despite the severe economic difficulties brought about by the unjust economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States against Cuba , her Government had paid the sum of $ 1.193-million to the Organization during the previous week ; that was a reflection of Cuba 's commitment to the Organization .  
We suggest that the 661 Committee should conduct an objective , professional and administrative review of the manner in which the previous phase of the procurement and distribution plan has been implemented , with a view to eliminating all the negative aspects and procedures that led to the delay and dilatoriness by which it was characterized , and which all but emptied Security Council resolution 986 ( 1995 ) and the memorandum of understanding of their content and turned them into something to be exploited for political purposes that bear no relation to any humanitarian objective . 
The passing of sentences and carrying out executions without previous judgement pronounced by a regularly constituted court , affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples .  
The passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgement pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples .  
It was now possible to face the future with a degree of realistic optimism , especially as the economic indicators during the current decade represented a clear improvement over previous decades in terms of growth , trade and direct foreign investment .  
The arsenals accumulated by some of the most repressive regimes in Africa in previous decades , with either ostensible or covert support from external Powers , had particularly deleterious consequences that stretched well into the nineties .  
Regrettably , he was bound to report that the situation of human rights in Iraq had not improved during the previous year , and that the Iraqi Government continued to commit massive and systematic violations of the basic rights of the population .  
Such information may relate to the size and type of previous projects carried out by the bidders ; the level of experience of the key personnel to be engaged in the project ; sufficient organizational capability , including minimum levels of construction , operation and maintenance equipment .  
We look forward to participating actively and constructively at the coming preparatory meeting for the 2000 Review Conference , which in our view should recoup the ground lost at previous meetings and resume the positive spirit and substantive role with which the strengthened review process started in 1995 .  
As the independent expert pointed out in her two previous reports , as long as the warlords , the militias and other irregular armed forces continue their fight in Somalia , and until a peaceful settlement is reached , international humanitarian law relating to non _ international armed conflict applies in the whole territory of Somalia , irrespective of whether a specific area is engulfed in active fighting or not .  
the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgement pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples .  
Upon instructions from my Government and further to my previous letters , the latest dated 5 October 1998 ( A / 53 / 460-S / 1998 / 917 ) I have the honour to bring to your attention the following additional documented information regarding the continuous and systematic plundering of the religious , historical and cultural identity of the Turkish-occupied part of Cyprus .  
Noting with grave concern , that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,  
In addition , removing pregnancy and maternity benefits from a social insurance scheme and placing them under the Law on Social Care at a level below the minimum standard of living was a major step backward from the previous arrangement .  
The Office 's background investigations of targeted violence further confirmed the observations expressed in my previous report that the nature of violent activity in Kosovo , which has now spread to urban areas , has increased the number of persons who live in fear of being directly affected by violence or arbitrary treatment .  
Ms . Cardoze ( Panama ) , speaking on behalf of the Rio Group , said that the consequences for the Rio Group region of the global financial crisis which had begun during the previous year had included a decrease of two percentage points in the growth rate of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) , a decline in imports and exports , particularly of raw materials and semi-manufactured products , an increase in the current account deficit and , in some cases , a decrease in international reserves .  
The 1998 report and the 1998 interim report ( memorandum ) of the previous Special Rapporteur referred to alleged massacres and summary executions , to outbursts of ethnic violence and other violations of human rights ranging from the infliction of inhuman and degrading punishment to systematic gender discrimination , including denial to women of access to medical care and employment .  
That figure , which was much lower than in any of the previous three years , could be attributed to two main factors : first , the major contributor had made a significantly larger regular budget payment during the final quarter of 1998 than in previous years , with less being deferred for payment in the year ; and , second , a record 117 Member States had paid their regular budget assessments in full by the end of 1998 , a continued upward trend which the Secretary-General wished to acknowledge .  
At its fifty-fourth session , the Commission on Human Rights decided to retain on its agenda the sub-item entitled Question of human rights in Cyprus , it being understood that action required pursuant to previous resolutions of the Commission on the subject would continue to remain operative , including the request to the Secretary-General to provide a report to the Commission regarding their implementation ( decision 1998 / 109 ) .  
In fact , contrary to expectations based on previous studies , the deep drilling survey brought to light unexpected geological problems regarding the thickness of the Quaternary filling in the subsoil of the strait .  
The most noteworthy aspect of the results of the survey ( March 1999 ) is that , despite progress in operational terms , which resulted in a near doubling of the maximum penetration achieved in the previous survey , the geological substratum sought in certain critical areas in the central part of the strait has still not been detected .  
As far as financing for the implementation of Agenda 21 from countries own public and private sectors is concerned , it may be useful to focus the discussion at the eighth session on the particular problems of developing countries in the current economic situation and continue the discussion held at previous sessions on new policy approaches in both developed and developing countries .  
The increase in the level of resources requested in 20002001 should be viewed in the context of the historically low levels of funding provided for programmes of preventive maintenance and repair and the significant reductions effected in this section during previous bienniums during periods of severe financial constraint in lieu of higher-priority substantive programme activities .  
At its 60th meeting , on 28 April 1999 , the Commission on Human Rights , taking into account its heavy schedule of work , as well as the need to give adequate consideration to all the items on its agenda , and recalling that in previous years the Economic and Social Council had approved the Commission 's requests for additional meetings for its thirty _ seventh to fifty _ fifth session , decided , without a vote : 
A unilateral act is also void if it is contrary to a States own previous norms or to a peremptory or jus cogens norm , the latter being understood as a norm accepted and recognized by the international community , as stated in the 1969 Convention .  
Seen in relation to the total annual appropriations for ESA programmes and other national programmes , the financial leeway for full implementation of a revised space policywith respect to previous commitments to such programmesis relatively limited , at least in the short term .  
The Committee reiterates its previous recommendation that if measures are taken to incorporate civil and political rights treaty obligations in the Icelandic legal system , similar measures should be taken simultaneously in respect of economic , social and cultural rights .  
The food basket distributed under the first three phases of the programme raised the daily caloric intake by 60 per cent and protein intake by 65 per cent over the previous national ration , reflecting a net gain compared to the pre-programme period .  
Like previous regional urban forums , the Third Forum would include representatives of national and local governments , private sector businesses , civil society organizations , including NGOs , academic and training institutes , and the media .  
She informed the Committee that the pre-session working group had before it draft lists of issues and questions prepared by the Secretariat in accordance with decision 19 / III of the Committee , based on an analytical comparison of current reports of States parties with previous reports , the Committees discussion thereon and other relevant information , including concluding observations of other treaty bodies .  
The present document is submitted pursuant to Executive Board decision 97 / 21 of 18 September 1997 , in which the Board requested the Executive Director to report biennially on the appropriateness of the level of the operational reserve of the United Nations Office of Project Services ( UNOPS ) , established in the same decision at 4 per cent of the combined expenditure on administrative and project budgets of the previous year .  
The Convention favours an integrated approach to those rights , avoiding the categorization of rights that , in previous decades , had separated civil and political rights on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights on the other .  
The Food and Agricultural Organization ( FAO ) reported that , based on its ongoing projections of production , trade and consumption to the year 2005 , the agricultural exports of developing countries could become more dynamic in the coming period than in the previous decade .  
While the previous decades left a negative heritage , as is summarized below , the political and financial commitment to investment in education that led to UPE in 1997 promises to remedy the inherited dissociation between political and economic governance and open the way towards defining the right to education within Ugandas specific international and domestic environment .  
Although this represents a slight increase over the previous year , FDI continues to be hampered by some characteristics shared by most of the LDCs , such as adverse climatic conditions , small domestic markets , export vulnerability , limited transport and communications infrastructure , insufficient domestic investment and lack of a skilled labour force , as well as lack of information on profitable business opportunities ( box 2 ) .  
Ecuador has stated on previous occasions that it has not adopted , nor will it adopt in future , any laws that run counter to freedom of international trade or violate the principle of non-interference in the internal and international policies of States , which is set forth in the Political Constitution of Ecuador and , accordingly , is reflected in each and every legal , political and economic action taken by Ecuador both domestically and internationally .  
Additionally , we would like to reiterate our suggestion contained in the previous written submission that the Working Group on Communications at its first meeting would be requested to ensure that 1503 submissions meet the following preconditions : ( a ) domestic remedies have been exhausted ; ( b ) the matter under consideration is demonstrably a gross and reliably attested violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms ; ( c ) the submissions are clearly devoid of politicization .  
That decision means that the Security Council will start to be involved in the protection of civilians in armed conflict as an implementation mechanism of the international community to enforce international humanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions , which until now , as stressed by previous speakers , have often been ignored , unsatisfactorily implemented , seriously violated and abused ; their violators have not really been brought to justice . 
The Department for Disarmament Affairs has continued consultations with international and regional organizations receiving reporting on military expenditures and has received their views and comments on the recommendations contained in the previous report of the Secretary-General ( A / 53 / 218 ) deriving from the consultations held on 23 April 1998 .  
Mr . Gbeho ( Ghana ) : I am happy and privileged to participate in this crucial Security Council debate on the situation in Africa , and I wish to begin by joining in the warm sentiments expressed to you , Sir , and to other members of the Council by previous speakers .  I must also highly commend the Secretary-General for the comprehensive progress report ( S / 1999 / 1008 ) on the implementation of the recommendations contained in his earlier report ( S / 1998 / 318 ) .  
Noting with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,  
As in previous years , it is to be stressed that guidelines contained in General Assembly resolutions should be followed , in particular , the desirability of using , as far as possible , the resources and facilities made available by Member States , international organizations and others ; as well as the need , in appointing lecturers for the seminars of the Fellowship Programme , to secure representation of the major legal systems and balance among various geographical regions .  
Noting with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,  
Under the terms of operative paragraph 12 , the General Assembly would , inter alia , request the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to convene expert meetings , as requested in previous General Assembly resolutions in the past , to study and update the international legislation in force and to propose recommendations for a clearer legal definition of mercenaries that would make for more efficient prevention and punishment of mercenary activities .  
It is , perhaps , ironic that this impasse in international commodity policy , which has continued throughout the 1990s , began just as the dominant feature of world commodity markets changed ( as explained in the previous Section ) from excessive short-term price volatility to a sharp downward trend in real commodity prices .  
The report showed that the human rights situation in the occupied territories had remained very much the same as in previous years : the Israeli authorities were continuing to pursue their repressive practices , with a heavy psychological impact on the Arabs living under Israeli occupation .  
Noting with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to the present day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,  
After intense negotiations and substantive progress in the definition of the text of the protocol , the meeting had been suspended without having achieved its final objective ; informal consultations had been held in Vienna the previous month , but no progress had been achieved .  
Further to my letter dated 17 November 1999 addressed to you ( S / 1999 / 1188 , annex ) , I should like to draw your attention to the fact that on 23 November 1999 units of the Turkish armed forces consisting of two brigades supported by armoured cars and the forces maintained in the area following previous hostile operations carried out a fresh act of aggression against the territory of northern Iraq .  
The overall quality of the proposals , as compared to proposals analysed in previous funding cycles by UNFIP and the Foundation , proved to be markedly superior , reflecting a solid understanding of the framework and a genuine willingness on the part of the United Nations system to work in a joint and cohesive manner .  
This new development , and the co-evolution that resulted between the two families of historical national economies the capitalist and the socialist deeply influenced and modified the three other dimensions ( intellectual , political and normative ) of socialism inherited from the previous century .  
Related to this assumption is the implicit association of this type of activity with organized crime , therefore conveying the notion that those engaged are full-time criminal entrepreneurs who have developed expertise and accumulated resources in previous illegal activities .  
The Working Group was informed by several non-governmental organizations that members of the armed and security forces accused of having committed enforced or involuntary disappearances and other grave human rights violations in previous decades had not been brought to court .  
The excesses of the so-called military justice , a regular cause of arbitrary detention and impunity for human rights violations , as demonstrated by cases brought before the Working Group , have prompted the Group , in its recommendations in previous reports , to underline the need for an international conference to analyse the subject and seek to limit the actual powers of the military justice system ;  
The increase in the level of resources requested in 20002001 should be viewed in the context of the historically low levels of funding provided for programmes of preventive maintenance and repair and the significant reductions effected in this section in previous bienniums during periods of severe financial constraint in lieu of higher-priority substantive programme activities .

In keeping with the operational state of the national economy , China 's financial expenditures and outlays maintained fairly rapid growth during the first half of the year , with fiscal revenues coming to 624 billion yuan , an increase of 94.6 billion yuan ( or 17.9% ) over the same period last year , while nationwide fiscal outlays came to 583.8 billion yuan , an increase of 119.0 billion yuan ( or 25.6% ) over the same period the previous year . 
The Central Organization Department and the Central Propaganda Department jointly held in Beijing today a report meeting on the educational activities of " thinking of the origin after making a fortune and thinking about making progress after becoming rich . "  The meeting reviewed and exchanged the experience gained in conducting the " double thinking " educational activities in the previous stage , analyzed and studied their developments , and made specific plans and arrangements for the next stage of " double thinking " educational work .  
Judging from these reports , the " double thinking " educational activities in the previous stage went on smoothly and achieved initial successes because the leaders attached importance to them and because they were integrated with the reality and were conducted in numerous forms .  
Nakasone first assigned the Liberal Democratic Party to set up the " Yasukuni Shrine Subcommittee " to find legal grounds for formal visits by officials to Yasukuni Shrine . Then he established " a discussion meeting regarding officials visiting Yasukuni Shrine " within the cabinet .  On this foundation , Chief Cabinet Secretary Takao Fujinami announced on 14 August 1985 a reversal of the previous " united interpretation by the government . "  
For this reason , the revised draft law has provided an additional regulation : " When tax organs discover that taxpayers have evaded tax payment obligations and have showed obvious signs of transferring and hiding the taxable commodities , goods , and other properties or the taxable income during the legal examination of tax payment situation in previous years , tax organs are authorized to take tax protective measures in accordance with the Article 35 of this law , with the approval of directors of tax bureaus ( sub-bureaus ) at or above the county level . "  
A relevant responsible official of the Township Enterprises Bureau under the Ministry of Agriculture claimed that compared with the previous two national symposiums held in Henan 's Zhumadian , the current one in Guizhou embarked on a new stage not only in scale and grade but also in contracted projects .  
In particular , in the contemporary world , from nature to human society , from the economic and political realms to culture and science , things are developing and changing at a speed unimaginable to people in the previous periods .  
In his eight years of administration , there has been economic prosperity , enhanced national strength , and fruitful diplomatic relations .  Although he has been troubled by scandals , the public support rate is still more than 60 percent , rarely seen for previous post-war presidents .  
Zhu Rongji said that last year , we resolutely implemented the decision by the party Central Committee , dealt destructive blows at some criminal smuggling gangs , and obtained important results .  Politically , this showed the image of " opposing corruption and cracking down on crimes , and strictly enforcing law " of the party and the government .  Economically , smuggling cases involving nearly 80 billion yuan were cracked and the revenue from tariffs increased by more than 71 billion yuan over the previous year .  
Although he has asserted to the Taiwan people that he will change the " cash diplomacy " method of the previous Taiwan authorities , he said when visiting six Central American and African countries in mid-August that " far from having a diplomatic cease-fire , we need to step up our efforts " ; in addition , for $ 350 million he received three medals , three live goats , and three live chickens , being satirized by international opinion as the " prodigal son " ; and the actual results were " just a diplomatic struggle . "

"  
This responsible person denied an earlier report carried by the Voice of America on 16 September , which claimed that the Chinese Government had arrested a total of 35,000 " Falungong " members over the previous four months .  He said that " this report does not tally with objective facts , and it is a highly irresponsible act to spread fabricated stories . "  
In 1999 , our country utilized almost $ 40.4 billion of foreign capital in real terms , down by 12.8 percent from the previous year , despite maintaining a significant scale , which showed the first negative growth in the last few years , with the amount of contracted foreign capital also falling for the first time in the past many years . 
and the East Asian countries have practiced a series of more favorable and open policies to attract foreign capital in an attempt to accelerate economic recovery in the wake of the Asian financial crisis .  In 1999 , the direct foreign investment in the Republic of Korea grew by 75.6 percent over the previous year , which is also an important factor leading to the decline of foreign capital flowing into China .  
The military source said that the establishment of the Fuzhou Theater signifies the intensified degree of tension in the Taiwan strait compared with the previous stages and increased possibility of a breakout of a partial war by adding that the military had raised a level of military alert in this theater .  
Rarely did any of the previous US presidents make it so clear on the issue .  In particular , Bush Junior holds a more conservative attitude toward getting involved in international affairs , while Gore is more active in terms of getting involved in the maintenance of the international order .  It is fairly difficult to decide on a short view as to the election of which will be more favorable to Taiwan .  
What formed a sharp contrast to the election , which proceeded in an unprecedentedly intense way , was that diplomatic issues , particularly the China issue which became a hot issue in previous general elections , were unprecedentedly left out in the cold .  
this fund is closely connected with several of the previous bureau directors .  Because of the seriousness of the charges made against Lin , and because of how widespread are the official and issues involved , with such a complicated background , the working group made up of officials from the Guangdong provincial Office of Discipline and Inspection and the censorate , with Beijing in agreement , undertook this sudden raid to arrest Lin Hui without notifying the Guangzhou municipal government .  
Third , great efforts should be made to carry out the reform of financial expense management structure and perfect the reform of taxation system , positively practice the centralized treasury receipt and payment system , tighten the unified transfer and management of the government 's financial funds , and radically change the previous chaotic situation of decentralized management of financial funds and multiple accounts opened by departments and units . 
He also claimed that although the previous rectification drive has closed down many places of entertainment , there are still many fire precaution problems in such places , such as skimping on equipment work or reducing the materials , thus failing to meet the fire precaution standards ; and there are even cases of businesses opening without first being checked and accepted by the fire departments .  The most common problem is the blocking of fire exits , which is extremely dangerous .  
From their practice of changing Jilin'sbackward look , the city party committee and the city government of Jilin have learned that to bring the spiritual civilization building into factories , mines , and communities in real terms , what counts is to introduce a new practice of activating the ideological-political work from bottom to top instead of the other way round , and to move the foothold of the work from the previous practice of holding oneself responsible for higher authorities to a new practice of holding oneself responsible for lower levels .  
He noted that , during 2000 , customs offices in the whole country maintained a high vigilance against smuggling activities and discovered and solved 11,421 smuggling cases involving a total of 8.61 billion yuan , decreasing by 16.6 percent and increasing by 13.9 percent respectively as compared with the number of cases and amount in the previous year .  
To this end , Japan has changed its previous military deployment against the Soviet Union and comprehensively moved its main force to the west and southwest .  This year , it has also decided to establish an " island-protection force " to cope with the " activities of China 's naval vessels . "  Japan has even planned to equip itself with aircraft carriers in the next 15 years .  
The fifth is to vigorously streamline the administrative structure and cut down the staff , and thoroughly change the practice of setting up institutions according to the principles of " industrial categories " and " departmental management " formed under the previous planned economic structure and try , as far as possible , to set up comprehensive institutions in charge of urban construction , transport , culture , and agriculture in light of the realities .  
Since the beginning of 2000 , the volume of contracted foreign investment has rapidly recovered and begun to climb up , driven by the effect of the pending WTO accession and a major turnaround in China 's domestic economy .  However , the volume of actual foreign investment continued to drop , due to the delayed effect from the drop of contracted foreign investment in the previous year .  By the end of November , the amount of foreign investment in real terms was 2.29 percent lower than the same period of the previous year .  
The development environment over the next five years suggests that the 10th Five-Year Plan will be implemented against a backdrop that is entirely different from the backdrop to all previous five-year plans - - one that is characterized by China 's impending accession to the World Trade Organization , the growing trend toward economic globalization , the close integration of domestic and foreign markets , a world swept up in a knowledge-based economy and a new technological revolution , and the launching of the strategy of developing western China on a massive scale .  
What is different from the previous plans is that the 10th Five-Year Plan regards raising the living standard of the broad masses as a basic point of departure .  It embodies the alignment of national planning with the people 's livelihood and is a plan that fully reflects General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents . "  
The Republican-led government can not blindly imitate the China policies of the Clinton administration , nor can it go back to the doctrine of " strategic partnership . "  In the US , where politics is deeply partisan , such a shift is not without justification , but in reality the new US administration will not move in the direction of the other extreme , which would mean applying Cold War thinking to an emergent China and a wholesale repudiation of the positive results gained by the China policies of the previous administration .  
This decision is completely consistent with Bush 's line of thinking that we would do " whatever it took to defend Taiwan . " No wonder that Luo-de , former U.S . ambassador to China and assistant secretary of state for Asian-Pacific affairs during the Clinton administration believe that undoubtedly the Bush administration , which has assumed office for less than 100 days , is changing the established policy pursued by the previous administrations on the Taiwan issue .  
The rainfall in October amounted to only 112.8 millimetres or 32.0 millimetres below average .  However , the accumulated rainfall since January 1 of 3,329.4 millimetres was 55 per cent above the normal figure , surpassing the previous record maximum annual rainfall of 3,247.5 millimetres set in 1982 .  
Under the principle of " One Country , Two Systems " , the socialist system and policies are not practiced in Hong Kong , and the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged .  The HKSAR enjoys executive , legislative and independent judicial power , including that of final adjudication .  
In certain busy areas , cleansing services last until mid-night .  Since the number of local residents in the New Territories has risen from 2.07 million ( 37 per cent of Hong Kong population ) to 3.11 million ( 47 per cent of Hong Kong population ) over the previous decade , the RSD opined that the standard of environmental hygiene should be improved .  
The subjects covered by previous speakers include a wide range of medical , social , political , international , ethical and educational issues .  
The fireworks will be accompanied with Chinese music to give audience an impressive light and sound spectacular .  The fireworks display will be live broadcast on various television channels , Radio 2 and Radio 4 of Radio Television Hong Kong . Members of the public therefore can enjoy the fireworks display either on site or at home .  The event , as in previous years , is co-organised by the Provisional Urban Council .  
She said Government expenditure would be increased by 3% in real terms in 2000-01 ( or $ 5.4 billion in additional spending ) This amount , together with the EPP savings of $ 1 billion , means an extra $ 6.4 billion for the delivery of all pledges on new or improved services made in the prevailing and two previous Policy Addresses . 
The limited effect of the controlled explosion during the disposal demonstrated that there was no explosives left from the previous blasting at that location .  Therefore the question as to who should be responsible for leaving behind any explosive does not arise in this case .  
The Basic Law particularly provides that the socialist system and policies shall not be practised in Hong Kong and the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged ; the social and economic systems , the system for safeguarding the fundamental rights and freedoms of its residents , the executive , legislative and judicial systems and the relevant policies shall be based on the provisions of the Basic Law .  
The delinquency ratio ( measured as the amount of credit card receivables overdue for more than 90 days as a percentage of total credit card receivables ) and the quarterly charge-off ratio ( annualised ) increased to 0.76% and 3.72% respectively in the December quarter from 0.71% and 3.57% in the previous quarter , after falling for five consecutive quarters .  
Through his previous industrial experience and current position at the ITC , Dr Lee has developed an international outlook and a broad perspective on biotechnology and Chinese medicine development in Hong Kong . He has established a useful network with key stakeholders in the field and has accumulated valuable expertise in project management , including the examination and monitoring of publicly-funded projects .  
For applications that have previous approvals from the Board but have been revoked because of non-compliance of planning conditions , planning permission will only be granted if the applicants have included in the submissions technical assessments or proposals to demonstrate that the proposed uses will not generate adverse drainage , environmental and traffic impacts on the surrounding areas , and the assessments are acceptable to concerned departments .  
Despite the deterioration of the external environment which has clouded Hong Kong 's economic outlook , general insurance business continued to grow with gross premiums increasing by 11.8% to $ 15.0 billion for the first three quarters of 2001 , compared with the corresponding period for the previous year .  The first three-quarter underwriting results also improved with a modest profit of $ 109 million .  
Energy Ministers in previous meetings agreed that the application of economically sound measures to minimise the adverse environmental impacts of energy production and use was essential for protecting the well-being of both present and future generations .  
The total number of illegal workers arrested has shown an upward trend as compared with the last three years .  Of them , those entering Hong Kong on Two-way Exit Permits have increased by 74 per cent when compared with the average monthly figure last year , following an increase of 19 per cent in 2001 and 34 per cent in 2000 over the previous yearly figures .  
The Housing Authority ( HA ) endorsed today ( November 28 ) the Government 's request to reposition itself from its previous role as a direct provider of subsidized sale flats to assume a facilitation and enabling role , while pledging to hold fast to its commitment to providing affordable rental housing to those in genuine need .  
( b ) The Housing Department has completed the investigations on the cracks and water seepage found in some flats in Tin Yuet Estate . These problems are caused by unsatisfactory workmanship at individual flats , resulting in minor non-structural cracks and water seepage at joints when the jointing materials between precast partition walls shrink .  These problems are unrelated to building structure and the previous remedial works in Yuet Fu House and Yuet Kwai House .  
It was during that time that he became heavily involved in the investigation of several complex cases that included the Wong Tak-fai Kidnapping , a major cash-in-transit armed robbery in which $ 167 million was stolen , and the apprehension of an extremely dangerous gang of armed robbers who had committed a total of at least 30 armed robberies over the previous three years .  
For 2003 , the Campaign adopts the theme of " We Care and Share for Healthy and Bright Future " with the slogan of " Serve with Heart , Live with Passion " .  In addition to the general theme of mutual support as in previous year , the aims for this year are also on encouraging active participation in community activities for the betterment of the physical and social environment , contributing to a caring , healthy and bright Hong Kong .  
Campaign speeches were more reserved , and there were fewer verbal attacks and mud-slinging than during previous elections . Peace and order prevailed in the elections , clearly demonstrating the maturity of both voters and candidates . The polls were open from 8 a.m . to 5 p.m . on a mild but cool day , ensuring a good percentage turnout . Most votes had been counted early Sunday morning , with only the results from some remote areas still pending .  
Three years ago popular box fans began to replace the traditional round models . Innovative colored plastic fans which could be purchased for half the price of previous electric fans became widespread .  
By chemical injections into the roots , combined with periodic drainage of underground water during the heavy rain season , many of the trees have recovered their previous vitality . Matou pomelos , approximately palm sized , are round and plump at the base and pointed towards the top .  
The rapidly rising standard of living in the Republic of China has led to the increasing diversification of life for its citizens . As options increase , the average citizen becomes busier - - previous chores become more difficult to accomplish as a greater proportion of time is spent engaged in differing activities .  
Beginning with that term , the grand prize announced during the Chinese New Year rose from a previous US $ 600000 to the alluring sum of US $ 3,750,000 . The possibility of winning a huge sum of money with a mere US $ 2.50 ( 100 NTD ) ticket makes it easy to understand the lottery 's popularity .  
The rest of the passengers were terrified but Lu sat calmly and still . In the tenth and last test , Lu was sitting alone in a room when a swarm of monstrous ghosts and demons rushed in as if to kill him , but he was absolutely unperturbed . Then a band of yakshas came in with a chained and bloody corpse who howled , " You killed me in your previous life , and now it 's time to pay me back . "  
Three years ago , Dr . Huang did a study of 800 middle and primary school students in Taipei , and discovered the percentage of overweight kids nearly double the previous survey . Between ten and eighteen percent of the different age groups were 20 percent over the standard , while between 20 and 29 percent were 10 to 20 percent overweight . "  
These two legends , which are almost identical in content , tell of a pious woman ( actually Ksitigharbha in a previous existence ) whose earthly mother often killed living things and committed sinful deeds .  
What 's different is , the ones doing best are no longer first-generation immigrants but Chinese Americans born in the U . S . The main reason is that the new wave of immigrants is more of a mixed bag than the previous one . That group , for coincidental reasons , was so high in quality that its like has rarely been seen . They not only improved the status of Chinese Americans as a whole , but many of their children have made brilliant accomplishments .  
In this flourishing market the real estate companies often inflated prices even within a single day , producing a stampede of buyers anxious not to lose out and sending house prices skyrocketing to almost double their previous level .  
Another prominent young Chinese of the upper echelons is Jose Chen Barria , previous head of the Bureau of Immigration , and current deputy chief auditor , who is considered something of a rising star .  
What 's more , banks have discovered that the trade surplus has continued to grow . There was US $ 2.5 billion in the first quarter of this year alone - - but most of it was not remitted to Taiwan . When one adds that capital outflow was as high as US $ 1.1 billion for the quarter , it is obvious that this wave of mainland fever is bringing capital across the strait at several times the previous rate .  
Because the liberalization of the electronic media has followed on the tails of the graphic media , many people compare it to the profligate development of political magazines during the 1980s . During the era when there was a ban on publishing , dissidents operated " non-partisan magazines " to strive for freedom of speech . After censorship was lifted , the scope of subjects in magazines vastly expanded , and public opinion forums and discussion exchange sections increased . The previous form of magazine exited the battlefield .  
When employers cut and runThe method of calculating severance pay is that workers are entitled to receive one month 's average wages for each full year worked . So-called " average wages " is the average amount of money earned over the previous six months , including basic salary , overtime pay , and fixed subsidies .  
Transient desiresHaving grown up in the wealthy environment after Taiwan 's economic development reached maturity , the new new youth are sophisticated about more than just material things . In recent years the problems of divorce and extramarital affairs have become increasingly serious , the schools have gone co-ed , boys and girls have manifold opportunities to meet , and there is information about sex everywhere one turns . Young people have come to grips with intersex relations earlier than previous generations .  
But in previous years when public health insurance was principally administered under labor insurance , limitations in terms of equipment , manpower , and even information about the total number of monthly registered cases in all the clinics and hospitals , made it completely unattainable . Computerized statistical analysis and cross-referencing of the vast amounts of information was even farther outside the realm of possibility .  
Contrary to the common impression that expatriates have little contact with their native land , more than 80% of the respondents had been back in Taiwan within the past three years . More than half had been in Taiwan within the previous year . This suggests that they have maintained close ties with Taiwan . In terms of provincial origin , a plurality of our respondents - - more than 40% - - were second generation mainlanders ( that is , children of fathers who left mainland China before 1949 ) .  
After learning more about the great masses of women of previous generations , you suddenly feel close to all women , as if all were family , and feel pained by how this patriarchal and colonial society of Taiwan has oppressed women and given them no respect over the normal course of their lives . These books drive home the importance of the women 's and Taiwan autonomy movements , so as to prevent society here from regressing as a result of political troubles .  
Based on his previous research work and on the finds at the ongoing test dig , Liu Yi-chang can offer a general description of the first Puli-ites - - " Tamalin Man " - - living 2400-1700 years ago . They were a late neolithic people who used flaked stone tools . From the large number of hitching stones and animal jawbones it can be inferred that they knew fishing and agriculture .  
Tea by that time had already become an international commodity . The price went through constant fluctuations , so during those years some people made money , and some people lost money . In this way , the stable system of agricultural production and commerce in previous times , as well as the systems of wholesale distribution and management , were all destroyed .  
The internationalization of the Taiwan stock market has smashed the previous " mini-mart " situation of the last boom period . Given the expanded size of the market , plus the overall conceptual shift , some local experts have concluded : " Do n't worry ! The speculative money games of the past will never rise from the grave now . "  
Porter pointed out that previous ideas about national power and competitive advantage focused on countries with vast territory and abundant natural resources , which ideally were backed up by military strength .  
Suddenly , it seemed , all the previous procedural problems-such as the fact that the petroleum industry law has not yet been implemented , or the amended power industry law is still held up in the Legislative Yuan-had been wished away overnight ! The privatization process is still very uncertain . Indeed , the very term itself is often misunderstood , and used in a simplistic or distorted way .  
The reason for the change in their itinerary was that , like every other previous foreign excursion by top-ranking officials of the ROC , Vice President Lien 's trip was met the entire way with pressure from Beijing . Firstly , after the senior officials of the ROC and Iceland met , PRC foreign affairs spokesman Shen Guofang issued a strongly worded criticism . He asserted that Prime Minister Oddson was interfering in " the internal affairs of China " and damaging relations between the PRC and Iceland , and that Iceland would be responsible for the consequences .  
Because the results of research over the previous decade gradually received international affirmation , in 1989 the World Bank approved the center 's five-year plan and provided substantial funding . The number of research projects increased substantially and regional cooperation projects were successively begun .  
This will make it much easier for them to understand the abstract concepts . But if this previous experience is insufficient , or if the students are having trouble with step-by-step logical reasoning-such as understanding that if two sides of triangle are equal , then their corresponding angles are as well-then when they get to analysis required in more advanced geometry , they 're going to have trouble , " says teacher Lin Chia-jung .  
Lin Chia-jung points out that junior high math teachers are too hurried in the way they teach . Students have had insufficient previous experience with abstract reasoning , and because complex geometrical concepts are unconnected to daily life , geometry becomes a source of math anxiety .  
After the ROC government lifted the ban on cultural contacts with mainland China , practitioners of traditional Chinese theater enthusiastically took advantage of the opportunity to visit the land where their art was born . Those with antiquarian interests , too , were very excited about the loosening of restrictions , for even though many of China 's greatest archeological treasures are already to be found right here in Taiwan , extremely important new archeological discoveries had been made in mainland China during the previous two decades .  
Such occurrences might sound like complete fantasy to someone who has never practiced martial arts before . Chan wants to try and use modern scientific methods to explain these phenomena . " I 've been fortunate enough to win medals . This good fortune has come about thanks to good karma from a previous existence . "  
The day she completed apprenticeship , the shaman prepared chicken and pork as offerings to previous shamans in the line . Thereafter , he gave Labay a piece of rolled-up sticky rice through a bamboo divination tube . When Labay accepted the rice , this symbolized that the shaman had transferred to her all the magic powers of the line , and she thus became the eighth shaman in the succession .  
This visit , which has been called " soft diplomacy , " breaks the previous mold of focusing on political and economic power . Instead , the vice president 's delegation included members of the cultural , religious , and scientific communities , and elected officials as well .  
He then issued a second statement , mainly to apologize for his previous gaffe , but this gesture was late in coming , and did little to assuage his critics , who continue to lambaste him . The most regrettable aspect of the whole brouhaha is the fact that it has thrown salt on the wounds of Taiwan 's former comfort women and focused painful public attention upon them once again . No one should have to go through what these women have endured .  
When the regulations were announced , 90% of major international producers , including NEC and Fujitsu , discovered that their previous efforts in the field had been wasted . Startek , however , had correctly guessed that recognition standards would be based on key points for each print . Startek is now one of only three firms anywhere in the world that can provide the proper fingerprint recognition software , and its products are technically the most advanced .  
Although the political gulf between family members was perhaps not as wide as it had been in previous decades , he was worried that a scholar like himself might not have what it took to do a good job as principal after a lifetime of operating within a socialist system and enjoying powerful political backing .  
Wu admits that university students are not as knowledgeable as they used to be , but feels that the wider availability of a university education is not the only reason . He notes that five years ago , graduate school admissions committees would never have asked an applicant if he or she had been abroad . Now , however , many university students and even high-school students have traveled overseas . " This generation of students has had a more diverse array of experiences than the previous .  
Because the basic aptitude test is only one hurdle , rather than ( as with the previous exams ) a one-shot effort to survey everything the student learned in three years of junior high school or high school , it can place more emphasis on the overall capabilities of the child . Thus , the scope is much broader-no longer limited to school textbooks-while the questions can be framed in a much more lively and flexible way .  
Each jumbo lotto ticket costs NT $ 50 . If 10.4 million tickets are sold for every drawing , the jackpot is NT $ 45 million . The game has a rolling jackpot that grows on each drawing when the previous jackpot has not been won . The rolling jackpot can accumulate for a maximum of five weeks , and if 10.4 million tickets are sold each drawing , the top prize will build to NT $ 250 million .  
On his one previous visit in the winter of 1958 , accompanied by his mother , Taipei always seemed grayish and wet as it was raining most of the time . A child prodigy with a phenomenal memory , Joppert never forgot the rainy month he spent here .  
Through satellite observations , the fishing industry has gradually come to understand the waxing and waning of cold and warm currents . Noting the succession of warm winters in the 1990s , and a 1 �X C rise in sea temperatures around Taiwan , the Taiwan Fisheries Research Institute also began making fish catch forecasts based on sea temperatures . For instance , the temperature that best suits mullet is 21-23 �X C , but last year the institute predicted that sea temperatures around southern Taiwan would be 2-3 �X C warmer this winter than in previous years .  
This year , someone who had a lucky year over the previous year offered the temple 230 taels ( 8.6 kilos ) of gold . The temple decided to break up that amount and make a family of one large and three small golden turtles which would be open to qigui for the public . In front of the temple they even built a clever little landscape garden where the four golden turtles can live a leisurely existence .  
In order to resolve the controversy over the relative importance of " national security " and " economic development , " when I was minister of economic affairs I raised a new idea : " The internationalization of Taiwan 's economic position is the best guarantee of national security . " We have to depart from the previous conservative , defensive viewpoint of security , and instead adopt a viewpoint of actively strengthening our structural position .  
In 1992 , an international conference of members of the World Heritage Convention held in Japan produced the " Nara Document on Authenticity . " This declared that Japan 's maintenance and replacement of wooden structures help preserve traditional skills , so that the previous definition of authenticity was expanded to include " reliability of the sources of relevant information . "  
When the ROC 's Immigration Law was promulgated in 1999 , it offered foreign nationals the right of permanent residency for the first time . But the conditions were that at the time of applying , a foreigner had to have accumulated " seven years of continuous lawful residency , " during which time they had to have been in Taiwan for at least 270 days each year . In other words , an applicant could not have left Taiwan for more than three months in any of the previous seven years .  
Today , it 's nothing special to have the chance to go overseas to study , and a more diversified value system has overturned the previous tradition of invariably studying in the US . The opening up of travel for the purpose of tourism has also allowed many people from different social strata to have the ability to experience foreign cultures .  
In 1999 , the Japanese physician H . Takada isolated BPA from the umbilical cords of women giving birth at a clinic . In a previous incident , most primary and secondary schools in Nara , Japan stopped using melamine tableware after intense protests from parents , even though the manufacturer had established that the plates and bowls would not release BPA if the children did not scratch them with their cutlery .  
In a coffee shop smelling of stale cigarette smoke and pipe tobacco , Lin reflects on his new film . Not only was it the most expensive of all his previous works , but the actual filming was also the most painstaking . Each day , as work began , two to three hours were spent on setting up lighting alone , in an attempt to bring out the essence of middle-class urban life . The Cruise of Robinson portrays a real-estate agent who makes his home in a hotel .  
In visiting the area , IACT members found that the Tibetans , accustomed to living in a cool , dry climate at high altitudes , still maintained some of their previous customs even after moving to southern India , and these created a higher incidence of transmission of disease .  
Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon 's exquisite imagery and dramatic plot , and its rhythm which alternates between moments of understatement and boisterousness , have helped to inject new life into an ailing genre . However , Crouching Tiger 's success in breaking free of the previous martial arts mold must be viewed in light of its hybrid origins .  
Early this March , Tzu Chi branches from Singapore , Malaysia , Indonesia , and Taiwan joined together for Tzu Chi 's fourth free clinic on the Indonesian island of Batam . On each occasion so far , the number of local volunteers has grown , and patients and their families who have been helped in previous years have come forward on their own to lend a hand . At the clinic site , you can hear Mandarin Chinese , English , Indonesian , Malaysian , and Hokkien rising and falling .  
But the downside of having conquered these illnesses is that the number of patients is constantly falling , so most young doctors prefer to specialize in growth fields like illnesses of advanced industrial societies or problems of the elderly . Virology , bacteriology , and epidemiology are considered " sunset subjects . " The result is that there has been no one to take the baton from the previous generation , and gatherings of specialists in these fields can be mistaken for meetings of a senior citizens group .  
Comparing the economic effects of SARS to downturns in previous years , Jeng notes that the epidemic struck just as the world economy was bottoming out .

Noting also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space [ 5 ] and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
Recalling the long-standing determination of the international community to achieve the effective prohibition of the development , production , stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons as well as the continuing support for measures to uphold the authority of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating , Poisonous or Other Gases , and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare , signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 , [ 49 ] as expressed by consensus in many previous resolutions ,  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
As I pointed out in my previous report , it is in these areas that MICIVIH has placed emphasis since its redeployment in October 1994 and it is in these areas that the Mission , because of its extensive field experience and accumulated expertise , would be able to make a significant contribution to the consolidation of key structures charged with protection of human rights and to the deepening of the democratic process . 
In fact , the much needed international humanitarian and technical assistance to the Palestinian people remains hindered by the apparent non-cooperative attitude of the Israeli authorities , who continue to enforce upon the population of today 's Palestine the same restrictive bureaucratic formalities that they designed to deal with the people living under their military occupation in previous years . 
If the number of candidates obtaining such majority is less than the number of persons or members to be elected , there shall be additional ballots to fill the remaining places , the voting being restricted to the candidates obtaining the greatest number of votes in the previous ballot to a number not more than twice the places remaining to be filled , provided that , after the third inconclusive ballot , votes may be cast for any eligible person or member .  
In addition to the 62 locations provided for in the previous submission , UNMIBH will establish a subregional headquarters in Mostar in view of the new role of the International Police Task Force of monitoring the newly formed joint local police force of East and West Mostar , two transport workshops , located in Mostar and Tuzla , a transmission station , a car park and four station team sites located in remote areas considered to be politically sensitive ( Zivinice , Bosanska Krupa , Bosanski Petrovak and Novi Grad ) .  
Noting also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
It would appear that the views of the Inspectors in this report vary significantly from the conclusions and recommendations of two previous JIU reports on the subject of advancing the status of women , issued in June 19943 and October 1995.4 Both reports were fully supportive of the special measures introduced by the Secretary-General to improve the status of women in the Secretariat and called for increased accountability of programme managers , in particular those who did not demonstrate real efforts to improve the status and representation of women in their respective departments .  
His delegation supported in part the approach followed by the Commission in its previous sessions , namely , to retain only those crimes whose gravity could not easily be contested , as well as crimes of a clearly political nature which posed a threat to international peace and security and therefore to exclude crimes , such as piracy , trafficking in women and children , racial discrimination , recruitment of mercenaries and foreign intervention .  
A proposal for a zero or negative increase for the biennium 1998-1999 at the current stage would be arbitrary and unrealistic , and a proposal to set the general level of the contingency fund simply on the basis of the experience of the previous biennium would be of doubtful reliability and validity .  
His delegation , which fully associated itself with the views expressed at a previous meeting by the representative of Ireland on behalf of the European Union , was of the view that the court , though closely linked to the United Nations , should be an independent international institution established by a multilateral treaty .  
He had also dedicated a detailed analysis in his previous report to on the causes of the large number of women detainees in State prisons in northern Sudan and drew attention to the numerous deficiencies in the legal procedures and to abuses and violations of which convicted women had been victims during the previous five years : rape in police custody , malnourishment , enforced conversion to Islam , physical assault and other forms of harassment .  
At previous international conferences , Governments agreed upon a set of goals and objectives for national and international efforts in the area of education and literacy , and health , in particular for maternal and child health and the control of major communicable diseases .  
The signature of this most recent Agreement makes effective all the previous agreements signed by the parties , which cover complex political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public-security questions . 
Any specific agreements should take into account the special geographic , climatic , historical and hydrological characteristics of a given river , as well as previous bilateral and multilateral agreements and the customary uses of its water resources .  
In fact , the much-needed international humanitarian and technical assistance to the Palestinian people also remains hindered by the apparent non-cooperative attitude of the Israeli authorities , which still continue to enforce upon the population of today 's Palestine the same restrictive bureaucratic formalities that they had designed to deal with the people living under their military occupation in previous years .  
In themselves such weapons threaten an imbalance in nature , and many of the biological agents that can be used as weapons are capable of frustrating all the efforts made in previous decades to eradicate diseases that are highly contagious and extremely dangerous to human health worldwide .  
We are here to consolidate our collective efforts and to concentrate on developing a more pragmatic and mutually beneficial relationship so that in the years ahead we are better able to tackle the problems we have already identified at previous conferences and at the national level .  
Recalling the long-standing determination of the international community to achieve the effective prohibition of the development , production , stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons as well as the continuing support for measures to uphold the authority of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating , Poisonous or Other Gases , and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare , signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 , [ 48 ] as expressed by consensus in many previous resolutions ,  
Despite the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur in his previous reports , insufficient publicity is still given to laws and governmental acts , to such an extent that they are unknown not only to the general public , but also to sectors of the public administration _ especially the peripheral authorities responsible for public order , who take advantage of their ignorance to deny legally granted rights to applicants .  
As mentioned in his previous report , the Special Rapporteur continued to receive reports and information on grave and widespread violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms by government agents , and abuses and atrocities committed against the life , liberty and security of individuals by members of different parties to the armed conflict in the country other than the Government of the Sudan in the areas under their control .  
While the number of personnel requiring rations is lower than in the prior period , the increase is attributable to the higher cost of bottled water ( $ 0.57 ) than in the previous period ( $ 0.50 ) and the additional requirement for bottled water for the team sites for cooking purposes , consumption by visiting flight crews and its use for generators to prevent potential damage to the equipment by the high salt and mineral content of local water . ( e ) Daily allowance .  
In its decision 96 / 25 , the Executive Board decided , inter alia , to introduce an annual work plan and , in paragraph 5 of the same decision , requested that UNDP and UNFPA prepare , for the third regular session " an outline of issues that could be considered by the Board in 1997 , based on previous deliberations of the Board and the organizational priorities and objectives set for 1997 " .  
The Agreement brings into effect all the previous agreements encompassing military , political , social , economic and environmental issues and binds them into a comprehensive nationwide agenda for peace .  
He made it clear in his previous report to the General Assembly that those measures were beginning to have a real impact on the people in the towns , particularly the urban elite , and that they were adding to the suffering in rural areas , where people are often poor and where , owing to the violence and the civil war , regular access to , inter alia , health care , hygiene , various essential goods and primary and secondary education have become even more curtailed .  
Aggravated rape is rape accompanied by threat of murder or by serious injury or committed by a person with a record of previous rape conviction and especially aggravated rape is rape accomplished by a group of persons or by an especially dangerous recidivist or entailing especially grave consequences and also rape of a minor ;  
Noting with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,  
The Philippines - as expressed in previous comments - favoured the draft minimum rules and stated that the Department of Justice of the Philippines was developing several activities intended to improve the capabilities of prosecutors and enhance the working relations among law enforcers and trial court judges , in order to fulfil the desired goals set by the draft minimum rules .  
Reaffirming that activities to improve public knowledge in the field of human rights are essential to the fulfilment of the principles and purposes of the United Nations set out in Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter of the United Nations , and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , education and information are essential to the achievement of lasting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , Recalling previous General Assembly and its own resolutions on this subject ,  
He also noted that the Secretariat , as requested by the Subcommittee at its previous session in 1996 , had submitted a working paper entitled An analysis of the compatibility of the approach contained in the working paper entitled Some considerations concerning the utilization of the geostationary satellite orbit with the existing regulatory procedures of the International Telecommunication Union relating to the use of the geostationary orbit ( A / AC . 105 / C . 2 / L . 205 ) .  
As on previous occasions , the Polish delegation expresses its strong belief that only genuine national reconciliation and respect for the interests of all ethnic and religious population groups in Afghanistan , as well as the long-standing tradition of Afghan statehood , can provide a true basis for a peaceful settlement of the conflict .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit an in-depth evaluation and subsequent budgetary proposals that reflect as closely as possible the overall evolution of peacekeeping trends , including any relevant restructuring of the various divisions and units involved in backstopping activities , taking into account the lessons learned from previous years ' experience of operating the support account and the workload relating to closed and completed missions ;  
An extensive debate encompassing a wide range of secular and religious views was in fact under way concerning assisted reproduction ; the current restrictions had been introduced by the previous Government .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit an in-depth evaluation and subsequent budgetary proposals that reflect as closely as possible the overall evolution of peacekeeping trends , including any relevant restructuring of the various divisions and units involved in backstopping activities , taking into account the lessons learned from previous years ' experience of operating the support account and the workload relating to closed and completed missions ;  
It is based on the contributions requested by the Division for the Advancement of Women , which focused on additional action taken by the relevant entities in support of the implementation of the Platform for Action since the submission of the previous report of the Secretary-General on the subject ( A / 51 / 322 ) and on means of implementation , including new human resources , financial means and structural changes .  
Ukraine invited all States and international organizations , pursuant to resolution 50 / 134 adopted by the General Assembly at its previous session , to provide technical and financial assistance to the scientific and technological research programmes being conducted under the auspices of the International Scientific and Technological Centre recently established in Chernobyl .  
The Expert Meeting welcomed the initiative of the UNCTAD secretariat in arranging for the participation of a substantial number of actors from the business community in its deliberations , and encouraged UNCTAD to continue to involve private sector representatives in its future dialogues and to facilitate contacts and promote interaction among business people .  1 .  The Expert Meeting observed that the growth of international food trade had been high , at almost 7 per cent a year during the previous 10 years , not much lower than that of trade in manufactured goods .  
As noted in the previous annual report , rule 72 ( B ) was amended at the eleventh plenary session in order to allow interlocutory appeal , that is , provisional appeal before the end of the trial , from decisions rendered by Trial Chambers on parties ' preliminary motions .  
The Secretary-General had , in his previous report ( A / 50 / 480 ) , suggested that themes be selected in the light of the principal objectives of the dialogue ; that is , to promote broader and deeper understanding of issues of a global or transboundary nature that cut across individual , regional or group interests .  
VIII . 177 .  The Advisory Committee was informed that the arrangements for common and joint services in Vienna that had been in place since 1979 and were based on a tripartite agreement between IAEA , UNIDO and the United Nations , have changed to the extent that certain programmes have become increasingly difficult to maintain at the previous levels .  
Since my previous report on questions relating to information ( A / 51 / 406 ) , the Department of Public Information has continued to enhance its outreach efforts by strengthening its partnerships with influential media organizations , leaders of civil society , intellectual and educational groups , among others , and by utilizing information technology to its fullest capacity , while continuing to make gains in outreach through the traditional media : press , radio and television .  
That lack left the door open to different interpretations even of such generally recognized principles as the sovereign equality of States , non-discrimination , non-interference , negotiation in good faith , cooperation between States and the non-use of force , and experience showed how changing the agreed or implied rules of negotiation or backtracking on previous agreements complicated subsequent negotiations .  
Singapore believed , however , that the guiding principles which would allow for the application of international law without the exercise of political influence and afford States , large and small alike , a level playing field , should include those principles that prohibited discrimination , coercion and reneging on previous agreements as well as those that encouraged the open and candid exchange of information and discouraged misinformation and the introduction of irrelevant considerations .  
At previous international conferences , Governments agreed upon a set of goals and objectives for national and international efforts in the areas of education , literacy and health , in particular maternal and child health , and the control of major communicable diseases .  
At that time , the restructuring process was fully under way in both the private and public sectors , with the addition of new technologies and production , distribution and marketing processes , a significant increase in productivity resulting from the stability and with a change in the previous economy 's suffocating rules of the game , such as the cheapening of capital goods and the disappearance of inflation as an instantaneous means of relaxing labour costs .  
As in previous years , it is to be stressed that guidelines contained in General Assembly resolutions should be followed , in particular the desirability of using , as far as possible , the resources and facilities made available by Member States , international organizations and others ; as well as the need , in appointing lecturers for the seminars of the Fellowship Programme to secure representation of the major legal systems and to ensure balance among various geographical regions .  
As documented in the present report and in previous reports , these restrictions relate primarily to access by Operation Lifeline Sudan to needy populations , whether in the form of relief flights from the base at Lokichokio into southern Sudan , humanitarian action in favour of the over 2-million internally displaced persons living in and around greater Khartoum , or permission to assess the conditions of civilian populations in the Nuba Mountains or in new areas of need created as a result of a resurgence of hostilities .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
With regard to the Boards principal findings on the voluntary funds administered by UNHCR , he said that as far as previous recommendations not fully implemented were concerned the main persistent irregularities were the non-assessment of the capabilities of implementing partners ; delays in the submission of project-monitoring reports ; the selective basis on which work plans were prepared ; and the failure of implementing partners to maintain separate accounts for UNHCR funds .  
If the number of candidates obtaining such majority is less than the number of persons or delegations to be elected , there shall be additional ballots to fill the remaining places , the voting being restricted to the candidates obtaining the greatest number of votes in the previous ballot , to a number not more than twice the places remaining to be filled , provided that , after the third inconclusive ballot , votes may be cast for any eligible person or delegation .  
Recalling its previous relevant resolutions , as well as those of the Commission on Human Rights , in particular Commission resolution 1997 / 75 of 18 April 1997 , and the conclusions of the World Conference on Human Rights , [ 1 ] which recognized that gross violations of human rights , including in armed conflicts , are among the multiple and complex factors leading to displacement of people ,  
As was indicated at that time , budget implementation during the current biennium would be notably more challenging than in previous bienniums owing to the dynamic efforts required to manage the sharply reduced level of resources within a short budget cycle and within a budgetary structure with limited flexibility or requiring longer lead times to address the necessary savings other than through significant reductions in staff costs .  
With regard to earlier notification of Member States in danger of falling under Article 19 , requested in paragraph 12 of General Assembly resolution 50 / 207 B , the Committee was advised that uncertainty about the amounts and timing of assessments for peacekeeping and the international tribunals precluded accurate calculations for the application of Article 19 much before the end of the previous year .  
Indeed , with all of these trends and tendencies in the world economy , it was recognized by both developed and developing countries , States Members of the United Nations , that it was imperative to launch an endeavour of charting a framework of objectives and measures for national and international actions to address development more squarely and comprehensively than any other previous initiative undertaken by the United Nations .  
Recurrent drought in the southern Africa region this decade , the weak economic base of the country , which is almost exclusively agricultural , a rather unbalanced social infrastructure , which is partly due to the low literacy rate inherited from the previous regime , and the problem of disease , including HIV / AIDS , pose a serious threat to our nascent democracy .  
We support the Syrian position calling for the resumption of the negotiations with the current Israeli Government from where they ended with the previous Israeli Government , based on full and complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan to the boundaries prior to 4 June 1967 , with the concomitant mutual obligations to guarantee the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace between Syria and Israel and in the region at large .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
As recently as 1995 , all the CIS countries shared one basic feature : precipitous and sweeping economic decline ( the two notable exceptions in 1995 were Armenia and Georgia , where GDP had grown a little after the nearly catastrophic collapse of previous years ) .  
In its decision 96 / 25 , the Executive Board decided , inter alia , to introduce an annual work plan and , in paragraph 5 of the same decision , requested that UNDP and UNFPA prepare , for the third regular session " an outline of issues that could be considered by the Board in 1997 , based on previous deliberations of the Board and the organizational priorities and objectives set for 1997 " .  
As in previous years , the responses indicated that the major causal factors of mass exoduses are international and internal conflicts , as well as systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
Noting the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
As stated in his previous report , the Special Representative believes that the speedy creation of an independent electoral commission would send an unambiguous signal to the people of Cambodia that the Government of Cambodia is committed to free and fair elections .  
In previous reports the information and data available to the Special Rapporteur were grouped in chapters on specific categories of violations of human rights such as summary executions , arbitrary arrests , torture , violations of the rights of the child and the rights of women , freedom of expression and movement , etc . with additional paragraphs , whenever necessary , on special questions , such as incidents which prevented humanitarian activities or the situation in the Nuba Mountains .  
The Commission on Human Rights , in its decision 1996 / 112 of 23 April 1996 , decided to retain on its agenda item 10 ( a ) entitled Question of human rights in Cyprus , it being understood that action required by previous resolutions of the Commission on that subject would continue to remain operative , including the request to the Secretary-General to provide a report to the Commission regarding their implementation .  
Those documents contain many factual clarifications and rebuttals of the allegations and fabrications , totally unsubstantiated by any material proof , which the Special Rapporteur included in his previous reports and which he is still reiterating for political reasons the main aim of which is to besmirch the reputation of Iraq and its national leadership .  
Since 1968 , one of the Government 's priorities has been to put an end to all the manifestations of administrative corruption , which were widespread during previous eras , through the promulgation of numerous decrees and the adoption of effective measures to enable the Iraqi people to enjoy their economic , social and cultural rights .  
The net additional requirements of $ 536,400 for commercial communications were attributable to the satellite user charges from the previous mandate period ( $ 356,200 ) , recorded in the reporting period because of the late submission of invoices and the extensive use of satellite facilities by the military , civilian police and electoral observer components of the mission in November and December 1994 ( $ 626,000 ) . ( b ) Main trunking contract .  
As the Commission may recall , in its previous statement on the question , the Indonesian Government unequivocally stressed that ' one particular problem in this matter is that many of those who were involved in the violent demonstrations leading to the incident have not come forward or have left the country clandestinely ' .  
I am delighted to see you in the Chair of this distinguished assembly , as the representative of a country with which Italy has maintained , through centuries , deep relations of cooperation and cultural exchanges of which I , myself , had the privilege , in a previous professional experience , to be a witness and a promoter . 
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;  
Noting with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,  
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;  
At its 67th meeting , on 16 April 1997 , the Commission , taking into account its heavy schedule of work , as well as the need to give adequate consideration to all the items on the agenda , and recalling that in previous years the Economic and Social Council had approved the Commission 's request for additional meetings for its thirty _ seventh to fifty _ third sessions , decided , without a vote :  
At its 67th meeting , on 16 April 1997 , the Commission decided , without a vote , to retain on its agenda item 10 ( a ) , entitled Question of human rights in Cyprus , and to give it due priority at its fifty _ fourth session , it being understood that action required by previous resolutions of the Commission on the subject would continue to remain operative , including the request to the Secretary _ General to provide a report to the Commission regarding their implementation .  
General information on the Territorys offshore financial services industry is contained in the previous working paper prepared by the Secretariat ( A / AC . 109 / 2051 , paras . 12 and 13 ) .  15 .  Among the attractions for offshore companies are the use of the United States dollar as the official currency , the absence of direct taxation , a growing financial infrastructure , fast and straightforward company registration procedures , extensive financial freedom and confidentiality .  
UNDP assistance under the fifth cycle country programme ( 1992-1996 ) to the Caribbean dependent Territories which includes the Turks and Caicos Islands , had as its principal focus the provision of support for human resource development , capacity-building , institutional strengthening and environment and natural resources management .  With this in view , the proposed strategy of UNDP at the start of the current sixth cycle has been to continue its emphasis on providing support in those areas , building upon the outputs of its previous interventions .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit an in-depth evaluation and subsequent budgetary proposals that reflect as closely as possible the overall evolution of peacekeeping trends , including any relevant restructuring of the various divisions and units involved in backstopping activities , taking into account the lessons learned from previous years ' experience of operating the support account and the workload relating to closed and completed missions ;  
If the number of candidates obtaining such majority is less than the number of persons or delegations to be elected , there shall be additional ballots to fill the remaining places , the voting being restricted to the candidates obtaining the greatest number of votes in the previous ballot , to a number not more than twice the places remaining to be filled , provided that , after the third inconclusive ballot , votes may be cast for any eligible person or delegation .  
At previous international conferences , Governments agreed upon a set of goals and objectives for national and international efforts in the area of education and literacy , and health , in particular for maternal and child health and the control of major communicable diseases .  
During plenary meetings of the Conference , delegations reaffirmed or further elaborated their respective positions on the agenda item , the detailed descriptions of which were duly recorded in the plenary records of this session as well as in the previous annual reports of the Conference , in particular paragraphs 41-56 of the 1992 report to the General Assembly of the United Nations ( CD / 1173 ) and related official documents and working papers .  
During plenary meetings of the Conference , delegations reaffirmed or further elaborated their respective positions on the agenda item , the detailed descriptions of which were duly recorded in the previous annual reports of the Conference , in particular paragraphs 62-71 of the 1992 report to the General Assembly of the United Nations ( CD / 1173 ) , related official documents and working papers , as well as plenary records .  
During plenary meetings of the Conference , delegations reaffirmed or further elaborated their respective positions on the agenda item , the detailed descriptions of which were duly recorded in the plenary records of this session , as well as in the previous annual reports of the Conference , in particular paragraph 32 of the 1994 report to the General Assembly of the United Nations ( CD / 1281 ) and related official documents and working papers .

However , those various strategies had been no more than a palliative since , as indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on the developing country debt situation ( A / 51 / 294 ) , in 1995 the gross external debt of capital-importing developing countries had grown by 7.4 per cent compared with the previous year and , according to World Bank data , 16 of the 52 countries classified that year as heavily indebted countries were middle-income countries .  
The Government of the United States of America has not only deliberately ignored the opinion and decisions of the international community and the purposes and principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations , but has also decided to step up its economic , commercial and financial blockade against Cuba , in this case by means of the law known as the Helms-Burton Act , whose scope exceeds that of all previous legislation by grouping together , intensifying and conferring legal status on all earlier measures and provisions relating to the blockade . 
Even though there was a decrease of 1.8 per cent in the overall percentage of promotions of women in posts subject to geographical distribution , the percentage of promotions for women at the D-1 and P-5 levels has increased considerably as compared with the previous year , thus increasing the pool of women eligible for promotion to senior decision-making levels in the near future .  
Although his previous requests have remained unanswered , the Special Rapporteur is still waiting for the existing Government to carry out an independent , neutral , objective and complete investigation into the exact circumstances of the murder of three delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross on 4 June 1996 , near Mugina , Cibitoke province , to establish clearly who was responsible , and to publish the results without further delay .  
Having received no response to the request he made in his previous report , the Special Rapporteur reiterates the urgent request he made to the existing Government to provide , as promised earlier by Major Buyoya , the results of the investigation into allegations of the expulsion manu militari of 392 Burundian refugees in Rwanda to Cibitoke province , on 30 September 1996 , by soldiers of the Rwandan Patriotic Front , at a time when numerous violations of human rights were being reported in that region .  
The Special Rapporteur reiterates his solemn and urgent appeal to the Burundian authorities to defer the 38 death sentences and 19 sentences of life imprisonment handed down during the February-March , April-May and July-August sessions of the criminal chambers , as well as the previous 133 death sentences and 54 sentences of life imprisonment , at least until the peace negotiations have been completed and a reformed judicial system , capable of playing its role with complete independence and impartiality , has been established .  
Many countries acknowledged that the root causes of the continuing financial crisis were , on the one hand , a poorly thought out and excessive expansion of the scope of United Nations activities during the previous decade , which had had an adverse impact on the effectiveness of the activities of almost all the specialized agencies , funds and programmes of the United Nations , and , on the other hand , the unjust apportionment of the Organization 's expenses among its Member States .  
Despite the severe economic difficulties brought about by the unjust economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States against Cuba , her Government had paid the sum of $ 1.193-million to the Organization during the previous week ; that was a reflection of Cuba 's commitment to the Organization .  
We suggest that the 661 Committee should conduct an objective , professional and administrative review of the manner in which the previous phase of the procurement and distribution plan has been implemented , with a view to eliminating all the negative aspects and procedures that led to the delay and dilatoriness by which it was characterized , and which all but emptied Security Council resolution 986 ( 1995 ) and the memorandum of understanding of their content and turned them into something to be exploited for political purposes that bear no relation to any humanitarian objective . 
The passing of sentences and carrying out executions without previous judgement pronounced by a regularly constituted court , affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples .  
The passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgement pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples .  
It was now possible to face the future with a degree of realistic optimism , especially as the economic indicators during the current decade represented a clear improvement over previous decades in terms of growth , trade and direct foreign investment .  
The arsenals accumulated by some of the most repressive regimes in Africa in previous decades , with either ostensible or covert support from external Powers , had particularly deleterious consequences that stretched well into the nineties .  
Regrettably , he was bound to report that the situation of human rights in Iraq had not improved during the previous year , and that the Iraqi Government continued to commit massive and systematic violations of the basic rights of the population .  
Such information may relate to the size and type of previous projects carried out by the bidders ; the level of experience of the key personnel to be engaged in the project ; sufficient organizational capability , including minimum levels of construction , operation and maintenance equipment .  
We look forward to participating actively and constructively at the coming preparatory meeting for the 2000 Review Conference , which in our view should recoup the ground lost at previous meetings and resume the positive spirit and substantive role with which the strengthened review process started in 1995 .  
As the independent expert pointed out in her two previous reports , as long as the warlords , the militias and other irregular armed forces continue their fight in Somalia , and until a peaceful settlement is reached , international humanitarian law relating to non _ international armed conflict applies in the whole territory of Somalia , irrespective of whether a specific area is engulfed in active fighting or not .  
the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgement pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples .  
Upon instructions from my Government and further to my previous letters , the latest dated 5 October 1998 ( A / 53 / 460-S / 1998 / 917 ) I have the honour to bring to your attention the following additional documented information regarding the continuous and systematic plundering of the religious , historical and cultural identity of the Turkish-occupied part of Cyprus .  
Noting with grave concern , that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,  
In addition , removing pregnancy and maternity benefits from a social insurance scheme and placing them under the Law on Social Care at a level below the minimum standard of living was a major step backward from the previous arrangement .  
The Office 's background investigations of targeted violence further confirmed the observations expressed in my previous report that the nature of violent activity in Kosovo , which has now spread to urban areas , has increased the number of persons who live in fear of being directly affected by violence or arbitrary treatment .  
Ms . Cardoze ( Panama ) , speaking on behalf of the Rio Group , said that the consequences for the Rio Group region of the global financial crisis which had begun during the previous year had included a decrease of two percentage points in the growth rate of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) , a decline in imports and exports , particularly of raw materials and semi-manufactured products , an increase in the current account deficit and , in some cases , a decrease in international reserves .  
The 1998 report and the 1998 interim report ( memorandum ) of the previous Special Rapporteur referred to alleged massacres and summary executions , to outbursts of ethnic violence and other violations of human rights ranging from the infliction of inhuman and degrading punishment to systematic gender discrimination , including denial to women of access to medical care and employment .  
That figure , which was much lower than in any of the previous three years , could be attributed to two main factors : first , the major contributor had made a significantly larger regular budget payment during the final quarter of 1998 than in previous years , with less being deferred for payment in the year ; and , second , a record 117 Member States had paid their regular budget assessments in full by the end of 1998 , a continued upward trend which the Secretary-General wished to acknowledge .  
At its fifty-fourth session , the Commission on Human Rights decided to retain on its agenda the sub-item entitled Question of human rights in Cyprus , it being understood that action required pursuant to previous resolutions of the Commission on the subject would continue to remain operative , including the request to the Secretary-General to provide a report to the Commission regarding their implementation ( decision 1998 / 109 ) .  
In fact , contrary to expectations based on previous studies , the deep drilling survey brought to light unexpected geological problems regarding the thickness of the Quaternary filling in the subsoil of the strait .  
The most noteworthy aspect of the results of the survey ( March 1999 ) is that , despite progress in operational terms , which resulted in a near doubling of the maximum penetration achieved in the previous survey , the geological substratum sought in certain critical areas in the central part of the strait has still not been detected .  
As far as financing for the implementation of Agenda 21 from countries own public and private sectors is concerned , it may be useful to focus the discussion at the eighth session on the particular problems of developing countries in the current economic situation and continue the discussion held at previous sessions on new policy approaches in both developed and developing countries .  
The increase in the level of resources requested in 20002001 should be viewed in the context of the historically low levels of funding provided for programmes of preventive maintenance and repair and the significant reductions effected in this section during previous bienniums during periods of severe financial constraint in lieu of higher-priority substantive programme activities .  
At its 60th meeting , on 28 April 1999 , the Commission on Human Rights , taking into account its heavy schedule of work , as well as the need to give adequate consideration to all the items on its agenda , and recalling that in previous years the Economic and Social Council had approved the Commission 's requests for additional meetings for its thirty _ seventh to fifty _ fifth session , decided , without a vote : 
A unilateral act is also void if it is contrary to a States own previous norms or to a peremptory or jus cogens norm , the latter being understood as a norm accepted and recognized by the international community , as stated in the 1969 Convention .

She informed the Committee that the pre-session working group had before it draft lists of issues and questions prepared by the Secretariat in accordance with decision 19 / III of the Committee , based on an analytical comparison of current reports of States parties with previous reports , the Committees discussion thereon and other relevant information , including concluding observations of other treaty bodies .  
The present document is submitted pursuant to Executive Board decision 97 / 21 of 18 September 1997 , in which the Board requested the Executive Director to report biennially on the appropriateness of the level of the operational reserve of the United Nations Office of Project Services ( UNOPS ) , established in the same decision at 4 per cent of the combined expenditure on administrative and project budgets of the previous year .  
The Convention favours an integrated approach to those rights , avoiding the categorization of rights that , in previous decades , had separated civil and political rights on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights on the other .  
The Food and Agricultural Organization ( FAO ) reported that , based on its ongoing projections of production , trade and consumption to the year 2005 , the agricultural exports of developing countries could become more dynamic in the coming period than in the previous decade .  
While the previous decades left a negative heritage , as is summarized below , the political and financial commitment to investment in education that led to UPE in 1997 promises to remedy the inherited dissociation between political and economic governance and open the way towards defining the right to education within Ugandas specific international and domestic environment .  
Although this represents a slight increase over the previous year , FDI continues to be hampered by some characteristics shared by most of the LDCs , such as adverse climatic conditions , small domestic markets , export vulnerability , limited transport and communications infrastructure , insufficient domestic investment and lack of a skilled labour force , as well as lack of information on profitable business opportunities ( box 2 ) .  
Ecuador has stated on previous occasions that it has not adopted , nor will it adopt in future , any laws that run counter to freedom of international trade or violate the principle of non-interference in the internal and international policies of States , which is set forth in the Political Constitution of Ecuador and , accordingly , is reflected in each and every legal , political and economic action taken by Ecuador both domestically and internationally .  
Additionally , we would like to reiterate our suggestion contained in the previous written submission that the Working Group on Communications at its first meeting would be requested to ensure that 1503 submissions meet the following preconditions : ( a ) domestic remedies have been exhausted ; ( b ) the matter under consideration is demonstrably a gross and reliably attested violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms ; ( c ) the submissions are clearly devoid of politicization .  
That decision means that the Security Council will start to be involved in the protection of civilians in armed conflict as an implementation mechanism of the international community to enforce international humanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions , which until now , as stressed by previous speakers , have often been ignored , unsatisfactorily implemented , seriously violated and abused ; their violators have not really been brought to justice . 
The Department for Disarmament Affairs has continued consultations with international and regional organizations receiving reporting on military expenditures and has received their views and comments on the recommendations contained in the previous report of the Secretary-General ( A / 53 / 218 ) deriving from the consultations held on 23 April 1998 .  
Mr . Gbeho ( Ghana ) : I am happy and privileged to participate in this crucial Security Council debate on the situation in Africa , and I wish to begin by joining in the warm sentiments expressed to you , Sir , and to other members of the Council by previous speakers .  I must also highly commend the Secretary-General for the comprehensive progress report ( S / 1999 / 1008 ) on the implementation of the recommendations contained in his earlier report ( S / 1998 / 318 ) .  
Noting with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,  
As in previous years , it is to be stressed that guidelines contained in General Assembly resolutions should be followed , in particular , the desirability of using , as far as possible , the resources and facilities made available by Member States , international organizations and others ; as well as the need , in appointing lecturers for the seminars of the Fellowship Programme , to secure representation of the major legal systems and balance among various geographical regions .  
Noting with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,  
Under the terms of operative paragraph 12 , the General Assembly would , inter alia , request the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to convene expert meetings , as requested in previous General Assembly resolutions in the past , to study and update the international legislation in force and to propose recommendations for a clearer legal definition of mercenaries that would make for more efficient prevention and punishment of mercenary activities .  
It is , perhaps , ironic that this impasse in international commodity policy , which has continued throughout the 1990s , began just as the dominant feature of world commodity markets changed ( as explained in the previous Section ) from excessive short-term price volatility to a sharp downward trend in real commodity prices .  
The report showed that the human rights situation in the occupied territories had remained very much the same as in previous years : the Israeli authorities were continuing to pursue their repressive practices , with a heavy psychological impact on the Arabs living under Israeli occupation .  
Noting with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to the present day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination ,  
After intense negotiations and substantive progress in the definition of the text of the protocol , the meeting had been suspended without having achieved its final objective ; informal consultations had been held in Vienna the previous month , but no progress had been achieved .  
Further to my letter dated 17 November 1999 addressed to you ( S / 1999 / 1188 , annex ) , I should like to draw your attention to the fact that on 23 November 1999 units of the Turkish armed forces consisting of two brigades supported by armoured cars and the forces maintained in the area following previous hostile operations carried out a fresh act of aggression against the territory of northern Iraq .  
The overall quality of the proposals , as compared to proposals analysed in previous funding cycles by UNFIP and the Foundation , proved to be markedly superior , reflecting a solid understanding of the framework and a genuine willingness on the part of the United Nations system to work in a joint and cohesive manner .  
This new development , and the co-evolution that resulted between the two families of historical national economies the capitalist and the socialist deeply influenced and modified the three other dimensions ( intellectual , political and normative ) of socialism inherited from the previous century .  
Related to this assumption is the implicit association of this type of activity with organized crime , therefore conveying the notion that those engaged are full-time criminal entrepreneurs who have developed expertise and accumulated resources in previous illegal activities .  
The Working Group was informed by several non-governmental organizations that members of the armed and security forces accused of having committed enforced or involuntary disappearances and other grave human rights violations in previous decades had not been brought to court .  
The excesses of the so-called military justice , a regular cause of arbitrary detention and impunity for human rights violations , as demonstrated by cases brought before the Working Group , have prompted the Group , in its recommendations in previous reports , to underline the need for an international conference to analyse the subject and seek to limit the actual powers of the military justice system ;  
The increase in the level of resources requested in 20002001 should be viewed in the context of the historically low levels of funding provided for programmes of preventive maintenance and repair and the significant reductions effected in this section in previous bienniums during periods of severe financial constraint in lieu of higher-priority substantive programme activities .  
The report ( A 54-259 ) of the Secretary-General shows , as have his previous reports on the subject , the destructive results of the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba as a coercive and unilateral measure .  
By the same token , my delegation abstained in the separate vote on the third preambular paragraph , as we have done in corresponding cases in previous years , because it is our view that the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes is an inalienable right of all States and therefore can not be made conditional on whether or not one is a party to certain international treaties .  
Despite the economic growth that began under the influence of the structural adjustment programmes combined with the devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994 , the problems of survival experienced by poor and vulnerable households were aggravated and the harmful effects of the crisis have been very much felt in some social sectors education , employment and health and have to an extent compromised the major gains made in previous decades .  
The Committee is concerned that newly-introduced successive restrictions on unemployment insurance benefits have resulted in a dramatic drop in the proportion of unemployed workers receiving benefits to approximately half of previous coverage , in the lowering of benefit rates , in reductions in the length of time for which benefits are paid and in increasingly restricted access to benefits for part-time workers .  
In the final paragraph of the text , regret was expressed that a comprehensive review of the issues raised in the three previous resolutions on the item had not been carried out and the Secretary-General was requested to undertake that review and report on its conduct and on the implementation of the current resolution addressing a range of structural and management issues , including those raised by the Advisory Committee . 
Based on previous experience , member States closely involved in the preparations have worked hard to create a lean and efficient secretariat , which will be staffed by highly qualified professionals and will build on existing experience and technical expertise .  
The analysis of the main trends and features of movements of toxic waste and dangerous products in the Special Rapporteurs previous reports to the Commission on Human Rights showed that , over the last decade , the region of Latin America and the Caribbean was tending to become a favourite target area for the illegal traffic in these products and wastes .  
It was convinced that the members of the Committee would , as in previous years , support in large numbers the current years resolution on the situation of human rights in Kosovo , as a message that genocide and ethnic cleansing were unacceptable and as a sign of solidarity with the Albanian people .  
In the previous report he submitted to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ fourth session ( E CN . 4-1998-31 ) , the Special Rapporteur dealt fully with private companies operating in the international market offering security services and military assistance and advice , normally matters reserved for the State and for which the State must assume responsibility .  
The report importantly confirms the findings of a previous international review that underlines the merits of purchasing power parity ( PPP ) calculations . 1 The Bank agrees with the main conclusions of both the report and the above-mentioned review that PPPs the estimation of which is the primary objective of ICP are vital for a wide range of important policy-related economic analysis . 
The expectations and good wishes expressed in the Special Rapporteurs previous report that gradual progress would continue to be made towards a substantial change in the prevailing situation have unfortunately not been realized , since no significant advances are apparent in structural terms .  
The introduction to the Principles contains a refinement of previous working definitions : internally displaced persons are persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence , in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict , situations of generalized violence , violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters , and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border .  
That amendment also entitled any person , natural or juridical , to establish a periodical , a local radio station or a television studio , whereas the previous legislation recognized this right only for the State , social and economic organizations and for associations .  
Reviewing the achievements of the Committee at the current session , especially the addition of new elements to previous resolutions , he noted that , as far as the resolution on the establishment of an international criminal court was considered , there had been broad agreement on the historic significance of the adoption of the Rome Statute and on the need to embark upon the practical arrangements for the commencement of the functions of the Court .  
Regarding as a major task the work of meeting the needs of the future generations of their citizens and imbuing young people with a spirit of patriotism , devotion and loyalty to higher humanistic and moral values , respect for the achievements of previous generations , a sense of responsibility for the fate of the fatherland and fraternal , good-neighbourly relations between the peoples of the region directed towards the new century , Have declared the following :  
Furthermore , previous United Nations conferences had developed social rather than development agendas ; there could be no development agenda without full consideration of financial , monetary and trade issues at the national , international and systemic levels .  
The representative of China acknowledged that the previous Chairperson-Rapporteur of the working group , Mr . Jos Urrutia , had made a remarkable contribution in pushing forward the work of the working group , and had set a sound basis for reviewing the draft declaration in the future .  
It was also stated by governmental delegations that , in discussing these alternative texts , Governments had taken into account the guiding principles for standard-setting working groups in the field of human rights contained in General Assembly resolution 41-120 and had also borne in mind what had been said at the current and previous sessions on other principles that should be taken into consideration .  
I should like to draw your attention to the fact that on 23 November 1999 units of the Turkish armed forces consisting of two brigades supported by armoured cars and the forces maintained in the area following previous hostile operations carried out a fresh act of aggression against the territory of northern Iraq .  
At previous sessions of the Assembly , Bolivia has aired the historical , political and economic arguments on which it bases its absolute need to regain the maritime status that gave rise to its existence as an independent country .  
Therefore , as a personal wish , when the philosophical question of nuclear disarmament some day turns into a reality through the concerted efforts of the entire international community , again the mission will be complete , as in previous cases .

The new Plan takes into account the results achieved , lessons learned and gaps remaining from the previous Plan ( 19971999 ) , as well as changes in the larger social , economic , political and cultural contexts .  
The passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgement pronounced by a regularly constituted court , affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples ;  
Some delegations expressed the view that the brief historical summary on the consideration in the Legal Subcommittee of the question on the definition and delimitation of outer space , which the working group had requested the Secretariat to prepare , would be most useful for the continued discussions in 2002 , as it would assist in identifying positions that had developed over the years under the item and reduce the likelihood of a repetition of previous discussions .  
Secondly , clear definitions of terms loosely used in the previous report , such as illegal , legitimate , power and control , should be established in relation to the specific and unique political situation prevailing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in the region .  
In his previous report , the Special Representative had drawn attention to the considerable discrimination faced by women in Equatorial Guinea , as reflected in the fact that the gross national product produced by women is less than half that produced by men ; the illiteracy rate among women is three times greater than among men ; and the number of women reaching secondary school level is half that of men , among other factors .  
In light of its previous concluding observations and taking note of efforts by the State party to combat poverty and its negative effects on children , the Committee remains concerned at the large disparities in the enjoyment of economic and social rights , particularly health and education , by children living in rural areas and regions lagging behind in socio-economic development .  
As far as we , the Palestinian people , are concerned , we believe that this failure also means a failure to contribute to ending the tragedy that has been taking place in the occupied Palestinian territories because of the bloody and oppressive campaign waged against our people by Israel the occupying Power and by the leaders in charge and the current and previous Israeli Prime Ministers Messrs . Sharon and Barak through all their declared and expressed statements and positions that run counter to international law and that call for escalation and confrontation .  
Although the actual technology that will be used for some exploration activities , namely the one which will be embodied in the collecting systems and equipment , is not currently known , and current knowledge of the deep-sea environment is insufficient to predict the real impacts of tests of such technology , the environmental disturbances , based on the experience and knowledge gathered from previous activities carried out by the registered pioneer investors and by the scientific community , may be forecast to some extent .  
We request you to intervene and to designate a time and place for the handover of this property without reference to the mechanisms established by Security Council resolution 1284 ( 1999 ) , whose true objective , as has now become clear one and a half years after its adoption , is to deceive world public opinion , to impose a long series of conditions on the lifting of the unjust embargo being maintained against Iraq and to rewrite the previous Security Council resolutions in a tendentious and unlawful manner .  
The Committee requests that periodic reports are limited to significant new legislative , judicial , administrative and policy developments , subject matters raised in the Committees previous concluding observations and issues raised in the list of issues .

The Sub-Commission has already addressed impunity involving civil and political rights , as well as economic , social and cultural rights , in two excellent studies .  [ 175 ] While neither study directly addresses terrorist acts , terrorist acts viewed as impairing civil and political rights have been those drawing the most attention in the Commission and the Sub-Commission and on the part of the Special Rapporteur in her previous work and in the present report as well .

Noting with grave concern that despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination had not been attained , the General Assembly decided that the World Conference would be action-oriented and focus on practical measures to eradicate racism , including measures of prevention , education and protection and the provision of effective remedies , taking into full consideration the existing human rights instruments .  
Based on experience to date , the current funding level of the operational reserve , targeted at 4 per cent of the combined expenditure on administrative and project budgets of the previous year , appears sufficient to meet the requirements originally included in the definition of the operational reserve .  
The current political process might seem slow , but the sensitive nature of the issues involved and the far-reaching implications for the countrys future made it vitally important that the National Convention proceed slowly and systematically in order to safeguard the interests of all the national races and to avoid replicating the shortcomings of the two previous Constitutions .  
The previous report noted that the situation was worsening year by year , and described challenges in the area of sustainable human development resulting from the chronic instability of the countrys political , economic , social and security environment .  
Although by and large , these commitments are in the form of best endeavour , they mark a significant departure from the previous two programmes of action by clearly indicating complementary actions between least developed countries and their development partners in seven areas : fostering a people-centred policy framework ; good governance at national and international levels ; building human and institutional capacities ; building productive capacities to make globalization work for least developed countries ; enhancing the role of trade in development ; reducing vulnerability and protecting the environment ; and mobilizing financial resources .  
As noted in previous reports , the combination of war , weak and unrepresentative governance mechanisms and widespread and deep-rooted poverty coupled with the drought and profound underdevelopment is a deadly mixture for a growing number of Afghans .  
Addressing an informal meeting of the Working Group in New York on 14 September 2001 , the Commissioner-General of UNRWA said that , as in previous years , the Agency faced not only a budgetary deficit of $ 31-million , but also was concerned about a very low cash position which threatened the ability of UNRWA to meet its commitments in the remaining quarter of 2001 .  
The representative of Bangladesh , speaking on behalf of the Least Developed Countries ( LDCs ) , stated that although the economic concerns of the least developed countries had been at the forefront of the development debate for more than three decades , the results were not encouraging .

With respect to the claim of the Egyptian postal authority , the Panel recalls the conclusion in its previous report that the requirements of paragraph 11 were satisfied by telecommunication claimants who had established a regular course of dealing with Iraq and Kuwait under bilateral agreements that set forth basic obligations . 
As determined by the Panel in its previous reports , claims for funds held in Iraqi bank accounts are compensable if , prior to Iraqs invasion and occupation of Kuwait , the claimant had a reasonable expectation that it could transfer the funds outside Iraq , but such claims are not compensable if the funds were not exchangeable for foreign currency .
