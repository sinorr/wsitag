While existing rules prepared by organizations such as the Comit maritime international ( CMI ) could provide detailed guidance on the use of electronic messages to create bills of lading , they could not provide a legal basis for such bills since the rules were voluntary .  
In accordance with article III of the statute of the Institute , the Board of Trustees is composed of 11 members nominated by States and appointed by the Economic and Social Council , with due regard to the fact that the Institute and its work are funded from voluntary contributions and to the principle of equitable geographical distribution .  
Commit ourselves to securing the participation of all actors of civil society , in particular women , youth and children , and voluntary organizations , in the national efforts towards implementation of Agenda 21 , and decide to promote regional camps for schoolchildren and encourage their active participation in environmental protection and sustainable management of natural resources ;  
Two representatives from North and South America respectively complained about the role of the United Nations which was considered to be too weak ; one of them lamented the paternalistic approach of the United Nations towards indigenous issues ; the other stressed the need for the United Nations to take a more active role along with its speciliazed agencies , in particular as far as the voluntary funds were concerned .  
For example , consider the launching of programmes by Governments , United Nations agencies and other international organizations , and major groups , on which consensus was developed by IPF ; consider appropriate mechanisms for the mobilization of institutional , human and financial resources and capacity-building ; and encourage the development of voluntary codes of conduct for the private sector ;  
Following a comprehensive review of the structure of the Lessons Learned Unit , and a reassessment of its resource needs , the Secretary-General remains convinced that the functions of the Unit can not be met from the remaining two dedicated posts for the lessons learned function financed from the regular budget ( one-D-1 , one General Service level ) following the anticipated cessation on 31 December 1997 of voluntary funding for other extrabudgetary posts currently available to the Unit .  
It will reach out to different groups : the voluntary sector , social and health-care practitioners , professional and academic bodies , central and local government , industry and commerce , professionals , interested individuals , womens , youth and older peoples organizations , religious bodies , schools and colleges , cross-cultural and ethnic minority groups and many others .  
The latter two documents reviewed the principal features of a number of funding modalities , ranging from assessed contributions to negotiated pledges , and offered recommendations aimed primarily at placing voluntary pledges on a more secure and predictable basis by offering ideas on : multi-year pledges ( or some early indication of intentions to possibly reduce contributions from current levels ) ; dealing with currency fluctuations ; and linking funding to programmes endorsed by the relevant governing body .  
Among those policy parameters was that funding : be voluntary ; be focused on core resources , originating essentially from official sources ; be multilateral and neutral and remain universally accessible ; produce stable , secure and predictable levels of funding linked to programme requirements of the funds and programmes ; and contain elements leading to more burden-sharing .  
Welcomes Commission on Narcotic Drugs resolution 6 ( XL ) of 25 March 1997 concerning the revised budget for the biennium 1996-1997 and the proposed outline for the biennium 1998-1999 of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , and urges all Governments to provide the fullest possible financial and political support to the organization by widening the donor base of the Programme and increasing voluntary contributions , in particular general-purpose contributions , to enable it to continue , expand and strengthen its operational and technical cooperation activities ;  
The needs of the audiovisual library may be included in the annual circular note of the Secretary-General requesting financial assistance for different components of the Programme as one of the items for which States , their institutions or private individuals may wish to make voluntary contributions in monetary terms or in kind ( tapes , equipment , etc . ) .  
With regard to the Boards principal findings on the voluntary funds administered by UNHCR , he said that as far as previous recommendations not fully implemented were concerned the main persistent irregularities were the non-assessment of the capabilities of implementing partners ; delays in the submission of project-monitoring reports ; the selective basis on which work plans were prepared ; and the failure of implementing partners to maintain separate accounts for UNHCR funds .  
Regarding the preparation of interdisciplinary / joint publications with other regional commissions or entities , the Economic Commission for Europe would suggest that three criteria be met : the decision should be taken on a voluntary basis by interested agencies ; the objective of the publication should be to provide a variety of views and experiences on specific issues ; and the time-frame for publications should be realistic and agreed upon by the organizations involved .  
Encourages voluntary national and regional actions aimed at making available to the United Nations system , through the United Nations Volunteers , national volunteer corps such as the White Helmets on a standby basis , in accordance with accepted United Nations procedures and practices , in order to provide specialized human and technical resources for emergency relief and rehabilitation ;  
Expresses its appreciation for the commendable progress of the White Helmets initiative as another voluntary international effort to provide the United Nations system with volunteer expertise to respond , in a quick and coordinated manner , to humanitarian relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development , while preserving the non-political , neutral and impartial character of humanitarian action ;  
The quality of teaching and the modern technological infrastructure of education , including computers and access to the Internet , must be developed in schools , particularly in the poorest countries and neighbourhoods , with the help of government programmes , voluntary fund-raising and international assistance .  57 .  An educated citizenry is a precondition for fully effective democratic institutions .  
In accordance with the resolution and arrangements : voluntary contributions paid to the Fund are distributed , through established channels of assistance , as humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals who have been tortured and to their relatives ; the Fund is administered by the Secretary-General with the advice of a board of trustees authorized to promote and solicit contributions and pledges ; and an annual report is submitted by the Secretary-General to the Assembly and , as appropriate , to the Commission on Human Rights .  
The basic principles governing these programmes were to respect and preserve , through bicultural education , the ethnic identity of each of the seven Mayan language groups , guaranteeing their legal stay and security in Mexico , until such time as they individually expressed their preference for voluntary repatriation , and to offer them a standard of living and opportunities for development and work equivalent to those of the Mexican population living in the same area .  
This scepticism has sprung from a variety of sources : that high unemployment represents a voluntary economic equilibrium that is impossible to reduce without triggering off accelerating inflation ; that rapid labour-saving technological change has ushered in an era of " jobless growth " and " the end of work " ; and that heightened economic competition in the wake of the globalization of the world economy has emasculated the capacity of Governments to influence the level and quality of employment .  
In both developed and developing countries they are in need of support if they are to manage the growing sustainability challenge posed by national and international environmental regulations , standards and voluntary codes that are developed by large companies .  
If applicable , assists the Director in preparing methods and procedures for verification of human rights during internal armed confrontation , commitment to strengthening the system for the protection of human rights , commitment relating to security forces and the bearing of arms , military conscription and voluntary nature and behaviour of paramilitary forces ; assists also in following up the verification and evaluating the findings of regional offices . 
Others argue that environmental standards and technical regulations are different in that they comprise measures : ( i ) which are largely voluntary ; ( ii ) which may be based upon non-product related process and production methods ( PPMs ) ; ( iii ) for which channels of information dissemination are less clearly established ; and ( iv ) based on the precautionary principle . 
Everyone has the right [ is entitled ] , individually and in association with others , to solicit , receive and utilize voluntary financial or other contributions , for the purpose of promoting and protecting , through peaceful means , [ universally recognized ] human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The present document is an analytical summary of the main points to which ICRC attaches special importance and which it has endeavoured to address in recent years , namely , minimum age of recruitment , minimum age of participation in hostilities , the notions of direct and indirect participation , the notions of armed conflict and hostilities , compulsory recruitment and voluntary enlistment , and armed groups .  
FITDH urges the working group on a draft optional protocol to fix the minimum age for recruitment into armed forces at 18 in respect of compulsory service as well as voluntary enlistment , since in many cases a minor 's decision to enlist in the armed forces is anything but free , being dictated by various circumstances , such as poverty , coercion , insecurity , a broken home or lack of alternatives , and parental consent is not enough of a guarantee .  
The question of displaced persons was settled by agreement between the two sides at the third round of the intercommunal talks held at Vienna between 31 July and 2 August 1975 , whereby the two sides agreed on a voluntary ( not forcible expulsion , as the Greek Cypriot representative alleges ) regrouping of populations in their own respective territory , the Turkish Cypriots in the North and the Greek Cypriots in the South , paving the way for a bi-zonal settlement of the Cyprus question . 
The major tasks of UNTAES were to assist in the demilitarization of the region ; to facilitate , together with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , the voluntary and safe return of refugees and displaced persons ; to reintegrate civil administration and public services ; to establish a temporary police force ; to cooperate with the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ; to organize elections ; to monitor respect for the highest standards of human rights ; and to promote an atmosphere of confidence among all local residents .  
The adoption of this theme highlighted the emphasis given by the international community to voluntary repatriation as a durable solution and asserted that a natural extension of this emphasis is the increased importance attached to the prevention of forced displacement .  
This has been interpreted to mean that the resources approved by the Assembly must be used for staff and non-staff costs as indicated in the relevant budgets and that resources can not be spent from assessed budgets , whether from the regular budget or the budgets of the international tribunals , peacekeeping operations or the peacekeeping support account , in order to utilize voluntary contributions provided by a few donor Governments .  
The question of the applicability of administrative or programme support costs for type II gratis personnel has arisen because heretofore voluntary contributions have related primarily to supplementary or non-assessed activities , but in the context of type II gratis personnel , voluntary contributions are currently linked to activities that have been specified and approved by the General Assembly in the relevant assessed budgets , both regular and peacekeeping .  
The Committee noted that in his statement , the Director of the Office for Outer Space Affairs had invited Member States , space agencies and relevant national and international organizations to consider supporting the preparations for the UNISPACE III Conference by seconding experts to the Office at the junior or senior expert level , by co-sponsoring workshops related to the additional components of the Conference and through other voluntary contributions .  
The Commission 's work programme on indicators of sustainable development should result in a practicable and agreed set of indicators , suited to country-specific conditions , including a limited number of aggregated indicators , to be used at the national level , on a voluntary basis , by the year 2000 . 
Recommends that the Executive Boards of the United Nations funds and programmes review and monitor , as a matter of priority and within the context of their regular meetings , their funding schemes , particularly of core resources , with a view to meeting their agreed upon target , reflecting the priorities and needs of programme countries , and increasing the target for voluntary contributions from official sources from the developed countries as the main source for funding of operational activities for the programming cycles , including the present cycle ;  
The Croatian Government is now proceeding with a laborious , costly , delicate and time-consuming campaign to return to their pre-conflict homes the mostly non-Serb victims of ethnic cleansing and the mostly Serb persons who were displaced or became refugees because of their affiliation with the occupying authorities .  The returns are carefully managed , keeping in mind international conventions which state that they should be voluntary , safe and dignified .  
Another major component of that institutional framework was the Ministry of Women and Children 's Affairs , whose role included national policy formulation , implementation of special programmes , women 's legal and social rights , registration of voluntary organizations and dealing with international organizations .  
Recognizing the importance of prevention in order to achieve demand reduction , his Government had developed a strategy which accorded a major role to the family and also involved teachers , voluntary organizations , youth , media , parents , local councils and the leisure industry .  It had adopted a social model rather than a medical model in the treatment and rehabilitation field and was giving priority to community services .  
Over the next five years , Malta planned to further strengthen the administrative and legislative means available to it to combat drug trafficking , sustain its opposition to the legalization of drugs , both hard and soft , involve all the actors of civil society in a coordinated strategy of prevention and education , enhance the drug-related services available for the family and the community , if necessary calling on the voluntary sector for assistance , and establish a continuous systematic evaluation exercise of the services offered in the preventive and therapeutic field .  
While the Working Group had noted with satisfaction the valuable efforts to implement the recommendations of UNISPACE 82 , it had identified four priority areas where further efforts should be made to promote the applications of space science and technology for development : stimulation and support of the growth of indigenous nuclei and an autonomous technological base in space technology in developing countries ; promotion of a greater exchange of actual experiences in space applications ; and funding of the Programme of Space Applications and voluntary contributions for its activities .  
As a sign of Sweden 's continuing commitment to the work of the United Nations in the economic and social fields , the Swedish Government in its budget bill to the Parliament for 1997 - in spite of cuts in almost all other areas of government expenditure - was proposing a maintained total level of voluntary contributions to the Organization 's operational activities .  
The fund was established with a base level of $ 20-million and may extend up to an amount equivalent to 10 per cent of the total budgetary estimates for voluntary repatriation for the preceding year .  
The human rights treaty system , established under the six operative international human rights treaties , consists of a voluntary system of self-monitoring by way of reporting , supervised by six independent and expert international committees .  
While voluntary contributions continued to be sought for the RDMHQ , the contributions received so far fell far short of the total of nearly $ 3.2-million that had been identified as necessary for the first two years of the RDMHQ .  
Belgium accepted only a minimum age of 18 for ( a ) direct or indirect involvement in hostilities ; ( b ) voluntary or involuntary recruitment both by the armed forces and by non _ governmental armed groups .  
This is the concern of everyone , ranging from the communities where such diseases are endemic to the public , private and voluntary sectors at national and international level .  
While his delegation appreciated the contributions of States to voluntary funds and fellowships for indigenous populations , the overall amounts involved were wholly inadequate for the realization of their social , economic and political development needs . 
A critical element is the availability of public resources to finance and support publicly provided services and to stimulate and complement private and voluntary provision , as appropriate , and their more effective and efficient use to meet stated objectives .  
The fund was established with a base level of $ 20-million and may extend up to an amount equivalent to 10 per cent of the total budgetary estimates for voluntary repatriation for the preceding year .  
It recommends that the State party raise the legal minimum age of voluntary enlistment into the armed forces in the light of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
Calls upon States to consider additional voluntary contributions to meet the pressing human rights and humanitarian needs in the area , and underlines the need for continuing coordination among States , international organizations and non-governmental organizations of initiatives and programmes with the aim of avoiding duplication , overlap and working at cross-purposes ;  
In order to protect UNDP from the risk of unexpected downward fluctuations in voluntary contributions , a component of the Operational Reserve is to be calculated as the equivalent of 10 per cent of the average of the voluntary contributions received over the most recent three years , rounded to the nearest $ 1-million .  
In the light of the provisions and principles of the Convention , especially the principles of the best interests of the child ( art . 3 ) and the right to life , survival and development ( art . 6 ) , the Committee expressed its deep concern at the early legal minimum age of voluntary enlistment into the armed forces and recommended that the State party raise the age in the light of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
By the Governments decision , the National Council for Womens Affairs , headed by a Cabinet member , the Minister for Health and Social Welfare , was established at the end of 1996 , and its operational by-laws were accordingly adopted . the Council is made up of MPs , officials of ministries concerned , representatives of womens non-governmental organizations , voluntary movements , mass organizations , owners of private companies , business and cooperative entities . 
The General Assembly should take a position on the future pledging mechanism , either in a separate resolution or as part of its general decision on the triennial policy review ; Ukraine supported the establishment of such a mechanism provided that the universal , voluntary and grant nature of United Nations operational activities was maintained .  
The main topics discussed by the working group during the general discussion on questions relating to the draft optional protocol included the minimum age for participation in hostilities , the issue of direct or indirect involvement in hostilities , the age of recruitment , be it voluntary or compulsory , into armed forces , and the possibility of including a clause to prevent child recruitment by non-governmental armed groups .  
Any proposal must be examined in light of ( i ) a constrained United Nations budget which leaves no room for net growth in the organization ; ( ii ) the imperative to avoid duplication and to direct scarce United Nations system resources to activities having the greatest impact and benefits ; and ( iii ) the availability of voluntary funding . 
Those remaining are mostly territorial troops engaged in civil duties , such as voluntary public works in agriculture , construction , irrigation , fighting illiteracy , building churches , roads and bridges , helping the social welfare of villagers , etc .  
While promoting the uses of voluntary initiatives and agreements as positive instruments for sustainable development , trade unions will also promote the defining of minimum social , environmental and economic indicators that voluntary initiatives or agreements must never conflict with or undermine ( for example , minimum social indicators would include International Labour Organization ( ILO ) core labour standards , child and forced labour provisions , and employment equality requirements ) .  
The core programmatic actions which will be supported include youth education and mobilization , voluntary counselling and testing , interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission , strengthened action to prevent and treat sexually transmitted diseases , distribution of condoms , improved community standards of care , treatment of common opportunistic infections , and special services for families with orphans .

In accordance with article III of the statute of the Institute , the Board of Trustees is composed of 11 members nominated by States and appointed by the Economic and Social Council , with due regard to the fact that the Institute and its work are funded from voluntary contributions and to the principle of equitable geographical distribution .  
For operational reasons , in view of a substantial quantity of military-pattern equipment provided to the MINURCA military contingents by the Government of France as a voluntary contribution in kind , increased provisions are also made for the supply under letter-of-assist arrangements of essential required spare parts and other matriel required to maintain those assets .

To set up a voluntary fund designed to cover all aspects of the preparatory process for the World Conference and the participation of non-governmental organizations , especially from developing countries , and requested all Governments , international organizations , non-governmental organizations and private individuals to contribute to that Fund ;  
The most encouraging and productive of these measures appear to be those that are based on fair and voluntary negotiations between the State and the indigenous people , either at the national level or under the auspices of an international body .  
The fund was established with a base level of US $ 20-million and may extend up to an amount equivalent to 10 per cent of the total budgetary estimates for voluntary repatriation for the preceding year .  
The common set of rules for ensuring the effective and enhanced operational security of global networks is voluntary owing to the fact that countries have not adopted uniform legislation concerning the operation of information networks .  
Promoting South-South cooperation , particularly in terms of economic and technical cooperation , and supporting a triangular mechanism whereby donor countries would provide [ financial / appropriate United States ] support for South-South cooperation ; considering the establishment of a generalized trust fund [ supported by voluntary contributions United States ] for triangular economic technical cooperation among developing countries .  
Regarding the new method proposed by the Director-General for mobilizing funds for the implementation of UNIDO services , his delegation felt that the proposed approach would be helpful in raising the level of so-called voluntary contributions and it considered that mobilization efforts would be further assisted through the creation of an informal open-ended working group with the mandate of establishing more effective strategies to that end .  
In view of the low level of voluntary contributions , the small proportion of the regular budget allocated to technical cooperation , and a fluctuating and inadequate operational budget , additional resources were urgently needed .  
In its resolution 1999 / 78 , paragraph 53 , the Commission on Human Rights requested the High Commissioner to set up a voluntary fund designed specifically to cover all aspects of the preparatory process for the World Conference and the participation of non-governmental organizations , especially from developing countries , and requested all Governments , international organizations , non-governmental organizations and private individuals to contribute to that Fund .  
The Government is anxious to see the potential for voluntary repatriation maximized and would like to see the existing camps closed prior to the winter period and the remaining refugees transferred to alternative accommodation in collective centres and / or host families .  
My delegation participated in that debate , and therefore I will confine myself to repeating here that my country is convinced of the importance of raising to 18 years the minimum age for recruitment be it voluntary or mandatory , by regular armed forces or armed opposition groups and for direct or indirect participation in armed conflicts .  
Reaffirms that voluntary repatriation , local integration and resettlement are the traditional solutions for refugees , and that all remain viable and important responses to refugee situations ; reiterates that voluntary repatriation , where and when feasible , remains the preferred solution in the majority of refugee situations ; and notes that a combination of solutions , taking into account the specific circumstances of each refugee situation , can help achieve lasting solutions ;  
It is of considerable regret to us that some of the soldiers serving in Sierra Leone on behalf of the international community , the non-UNAMSIL ECOMOG contingents , will not be funded on this basis and will instead continue to rely on voluntary contributions , which have been desperately slow in coming and which are , at least on the basis of past practice , unlikely to relieve significantly the financial burden ECOMOG troop-contributors have assumed .  
It was even more concerned by the slow promotion and facilitation of self-government and by the fact that the utmost effort had not been made to ascertain the free and voluntary choice of the peoples on the political future of their Territories .  
Requests the Secretary-General , the specialized agencies and the regional economic commissions to provide financial and technical assistance for the organization of the regional preparatory meetings planned in the context of the World Conference and stresses that such assistance should be supplemented by voluntary contributions ;  
The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs encouraged citizens to establish voluntary organizations to meet the needs of individuals and groups at the local level , and there were 142 such charitable societies that received annual subsidies from the Government .  
The scale of the financing required ruled out the possibility of continuing the current practice of making voluntary contributions on an ad hoc basis ; a more reasonable and transparent formula for sharing the burden would be needed .  
Requests the Secretary-General , the specialized agencies and the regional economic commissions to provide financial and technical assistance for the organization of the regional preparatory meetings planned in the context of the World Conference and stresses that such assistance should be supplemented by voluntary contributions ;

Recognizing the need for continuing international assistance for the maintenance abroad and the voluntary repatriation and resettlement of refugees and internally displaced persons , and welcoming the voluntary return of refugees to rural districts in Afghanistan that are relatively stable and secure ,  
Each State Party shall review its declaration ( s ) under article 2 on an annual basis , with a view to the possibility of increasing the minimum age that it applies for the voluntary enlistment of persons into its national armed forces and for the participation of such persons in armed conflict , and shall deposit any declaration ( s ) accepting higher standards when applicable .

And all those conferences aimed to reach that goal through an organized , yet voluntary effort : a collective effort on a global scale ; an effort by sovereign States and civil society working together ; an effort guided by a common approach based on universal values and principles which we all could accept.So Cairo was not just a population conference .  
Initiatives in this area include safe delivery and neo-natal assistance , cervical and breast cancer prevention , voluntary access to contraceptive methods , regulation of surgical male and female sterilization , assistance within the public health system for legal abortion and adequate treatment of incomplete abortion.The number of free pre-natal care visits in Brazil increased almost threefold in the last four years .

The existing voluntary initiatives were identified as being complementary to national and local regulatory compliance efforts , as these initiatives are designed to be cost-effective means of surpassing existing regulatory requirements .  
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions , in paragraphs 37 and 44 of its report dated 3 April 1997 ( A 51-851 and Corr . 1 ) indicated that the actual amount to be approved by the General Assembly would depend on the decision it took on the financing of separation payments for locally employed civilians , bearing in mind that UNFICYP was funded on a voluntary basis prior to 16 June 1993 .  
The investigators must also establish the actual identity and nationality of the mercenary , go through the files , rule out altruistic voluntary enlistment , compile information on recruitment and training centres , follow the trail of covert operations , obtain reliable data on aspects relating to the payment and other benefits agreed upon and detect the simultaneous use of other nationalities and passports , etc .

The programme is expected to curb forcible returns by facilitating the voluntary departure of some 3,000 Afghans per week and increasing the level of international protection for those unable or unwilling to return . 
These options could further include voluntary measures regarding weaponsusable fissile material related to military inventories with a view to achieving increased transparency , which could prepare the ground for ultimately agreed irreversible net reductions .  
The most encouraging and productive of these measures appear to be those that are based on fair and voluntary negotiations between the State and the indigenous people , either at the national level or under the auspices of an international body .  
The idea of 100 per cent reduction of ODA debt and eligible credits for countries qualifying for HIPC debt reduction , as presented in the Palermo statement of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries .

Undertake a far-reaching and comprehensive initiative which includes : ( i ) suspending the excessive granting to individuals of licences to carry firearms while measures aimed at severely restricting such activity are being enacted ; ( ii ) stepping up the efforts to impede the illegal flow of arms across the borders ; and ( iii ) issuing strict instructions to monitor the weapons of disbanded and inactive voluntary civil defence committees so as to prevent their transfer to similar organizations ;  
Adopt measures , prior to the signing of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace , and without detriment to the legal dissolution of the voluntary civil defence committees , to eradicate and put a stop to the establishment of organizations of varying names and origins , including some of those established to replace disbanded voluntary civil defence committees , which carry out State functions , such as security or public order , outside the institutional framework of the State .  
A confession or admission by a suspect given during questioning by national authorities shall , provided the relevant requirements of the Statute and the Rules were strictly complied with , be presumed to have been free and voluntary unless the contrary is proved .  
A properly designed , voluntary and independently accredited certification scheme at the global level can be a means by which the various interested parties can hold producers accountable ; it can provide a market-based incentive to the individual producer to improve management ; it can meet consumer demands for wood from well-managed forests without creating trade discriminations ; and it can be a mechanism for monitoring multiple factors involved in forest use .  
The Advisory Committee was informed that voluntary contributions had been received in the amount of $ 12.3-million from the Governments of Canada ( $ 1.7-million ) and the United States of America ( $ 10.6-million ) to provide for all direct and indirect costs of 670 troops , including the standard troop cost reimbursement and allowances , contingent-owned equipment reimbursement , death and disability compensation , rations , fuel , miscellaneous supplies , logistics support services and civilian staff required for administrative purposes , for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1996 .  
One of the most important reforms has been the creation of the National Solidarity Fund , into which voluntary contributions by citizens and enterprises are channelled , and the purpose of which is to implement programmes to provide remote regions and areas with a standard of living allowing the inhabitants access to basic communal facilities such as decent housing , health and educational infrastructures , roads , electricity and drinking water .  
The Administrator , emphasizing the perpetual resource dilemma that UNDP faced of having to plan and programme project activities over several years , based on a system of annual voluntary contributions , provided his personal assurances of continuing to pay close attention to minimizing the balance of resources by maximizing delivery , without compromise to programme quality and focus . 
The practice of voluntary military recruitment shall be continued , until the Government of Guatemala , on the basis of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights , adopts the necessary administrative decisions , and the Guatemalan Congress approves a civil service law , which shall include military service and community service ; this law shall entail fulfilment of a duty and a constitutional right , which is neither compulsory nor a violation of human rights , is universal and non-discriminatory , and would reduce the length of service and offer options to citizens .  
With regard to the requirement for a certified copy of the decision opening the foreign proceeding , the concern was expressed that the use of such an expression might exclude those cases in which the foreign representative was appointed , or the proceedings were commenced , without an actual decision or order of the court ( e.g . , by right pursuant to statutory authority , such as in a debtor-initiated voluntary proceeding ) .  
Expressing her delegation 's strong interest in pursuing durable solutions , she cited the innovative and comprehensive approaches developed by UNHCR for addressing population movements and said that voluntary repatriation should combine the elements of sustainable development , a community-based approach and a focus on returnee communities .  
Strongly urges Member States , on an urgent and temporary basis and in cooperation with the Secretary-General and with the OAU , to prepare the necessary arrangements , in consultation with the States concerned , to allow the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire , and to help to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary , orderly and secure repatriation of refugees ;  
Strongly urges Member States , on an urgent and temporary basis and in cooperation with the Secretary-General and with the OAU , to prepare the necessary arrangements , in consultation with the States concerned , to allow the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire , and to help to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary , orderly and secure repatriation of refugees ;  
The IOM budget is composed of an administrative part , funded by assessed contributions from all member States according to an agreed percentage scale and an operational part funded wholly by voluntary contributions from Governments and multilateral and private sources .  
The Group of 77 and China attaches special importance to this item and considers that it should be emphasized that the subprogrammes under this programme represent an important component of United Nations technical cooperation , provided on the basis of its universal , voluntary and grant nature , to assist developing countries , especially those in Africa , and the least developed countries , in implementing international commitments derived from the conferences . 
The Security Council in resolution 1078 ( 1996 ) urged Member States on an urgent and temporary basis and in cooperation with the Secretary-General and with the Organization of African Unity , to prepare the necessary arrangements , in consultation with the States concerned , to allow the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire , and to help to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary orderly and secure repatriation of refugees .  
We appeal to the parties concerned to cease immediately all hostile actions , ensure the safety of the lives and property of refugees and innocent civilians and guarantee the smooth delivery out of international humanitarian assistance so as to create conditions for the voluntary and orderly repatriation of the refugees and lay the foundation for a political settlement in the Great Lakes region .  
My delegation highly appreciates the valiant and expeditious efforts of the Canadian Government in taking the lead and ensuring broad participation by the international community in the formation of a temporary multinational force to facilitate the effective delivery of humanitarian aid and the voluntary , orderly and safe repatriation of refugees .  
I refer here to the need to play a more effective role at the international level which means sending a multinational force and ensuring the flow of necessary humanitarian aid to facilitate the voluntary repatriation of refugees on the basis of full respect for the independence , sovereignty and territorial integrity of Zaire and to the need for a broad African participation in any multinational force .  
The question of displaced persons has been fundamentally settled between the two sides through the agreement on the exchange of populations reached between the two sides at the third round of the intercommunal talks held at Vienna from 31 July and 2 August 1975 , whereby the two sides agreed on a voluntary regrouping of populations , each in its own respective territory , the Turkish Cypriots in the north and the Greek Cypriots in the south ( see S / 11789 of 5 August 1975 ) . 
In response to invitations by the General Assembly , and its request that the Secretary-General approach Governments for voluntary contributions in cash or in kind , individual Governments have contributed the services of personnel to support activities in peacekeeping , disarmament , humanitarian assistance , international tribunals , economic and social research , internal oversight services , administration and management .  
Concerned about continuing deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers involved in Operation Lifeline Sudan and international private voluntary agencies ,  
In order to address these concerns and to reach the goal of economically efficient , socially balanced and ecologically sound sustainable forest management , the experts call upon the Governments , private sector and investment community , multilateral international organizations , non-governmental organizations and the voluntary sector to recognize their shared responsibility and to take urgent action as follows :  
Concerned about continuing deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers involved in Operation Lifeline Sudan and international private voluntary agencies ,  
Security Council resolution 1080 ( 1996 ) established a two-part mandate for the multinational force : facilitating the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the effective delivery by civilian relief organizations of humanitarian aid to alleviate the immediate suffering of displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire ; and facilitating the voluntary , orderly repatriation of refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as well as the voluntary return of displaced persons .  
With respect to the age of recruitment into the armed forces ( art . , UNHCR , consistent with the position stated above , insists that the minimum age for either compulsory or voluntary recruitment into the armed forces should be set at 18 years , and does not agree that earlier recruitment should be acceptable with parental consent . 
Encouraged [ countries to explore ] [ exploration of ] the feasibility of innovative financial packages , such as [ special ] [ voluntary ] [ partnerships for forests ] [ partnerships for SFM ] , [ based on pooled resources ] [ supporting [ comprehensive forest programmes ] [ national forest programmes ] ] , through further study and national pilot programmes ;  
Nonetheless , the ] [ The Panel was convinced of the necessity of having a set of criteria and indicators wide enough to be used at the global level , rather than a reduced core set that might prevent the mutual recognition of regional and national initiatives , the exchange of information and the further elaboration of the issues of best forest practices and voluntary codes .  
Governments should play an active role in the implementation of the programme of the Decade through the development of national plans of action for human rights education , the introduction or strengthening of national human rights curricula in their formal educational systems , the conducting of national information campaigns on human rights and the opening of public access to human rights resource , information and training centres , as well as through enhanced donor support for relevant voluntary funds and international and national human rights education programmes .  
The adoption of this theme highlighted the emphasis given by the international community to voluntary repatriation as a durable solution and asserted that a natural extension of that emphasis is the increased importance attached to the prevention of forced displacement .  
The Committee noted that in his statement , the Director of the Office for Outer Space Affairs had invited Member States , space agencies and relevant national and international organizations to consider supporting the preparations for the UNISPACE III Conference by seconding experts to the Office at the junior or senior expert level , by co-sponsoring workshops related to the additional components of the Conference and through other voluntary contributions .  
Noting that many of the persistent organic pollutants identified in Governing Council decision 18 / 32 are currently subject to the voluntary prior informed consent procedure as laid down in the Amended London Guidelines for the Exchange of Information on Chemicals in International Trade and the International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ,  
The fund was established with a base level of $ 20-million and may extend up to an amount equivalent to 10 per cent of the total budgetary estimates for voluntary repatriation for the preceding year .  
We therefore appeal from this rostrum for merging our efforts at the Government and organizational level , both inter-State and voluntary , to galvanize our will and generate our energies , both official and at the mass level , in order to provide material and technical resources to implement practical and well-considered programmes to achieve this end .  
UNHCR notes that involvement of local rather than international non-governmental organizations is likely to provide a closer link with the private sector at the country level and with institutions of civil society , such as voluntary agencies , human rights groups , cultural and academic associations , churches and other religious bodies , and refugee community groups .  
The Bank recommended three security pillars : ( a ) a mandatory tax-financed public pillar designed to alleviate poverty and coinsure against a multitude of risks ; ( b ) a mandatory fully funded but privately managed pillar ( based on personal savings accounts or occupational plans ) to handle people 's savings ; and ( c ) a supplementary voluntary pillar ( again based on personal savings or occupational plans ) for people who want more income and insurance .  
The basic principles of the negotiations are recognized as dialogue , mutual and continuing respect between the parties , voluntary resettlement of individuals , non _ discrimination , observance of the letter and spirit of the peace agreements , protection of the environment , maximum social benefit , preferential and special treatment of vulnerable groups , and community participation .  
Some of those concerns were raised in an input made by the Non-Governmental Organizations Caucus on Transnational Corporations , composed of 27 non-governmental organizations with a wide membership around the world , focusing on the growing dependence on voluntary corporate environmental practices at the expense of the diminishing role of Governments in overseeing and monitoring corporate responsibility .  
According to ICC , the private sector 's priorities for the next phase include increasing use of multilateral arrangements to resolve transboundary environmental issues ( instead of unilateral approaches ) ; incentive-based approaches , such as joint implementation ; greater involvement of business and industry in multilateral agreements and organizations through innovative consultative mechanisms ; and a more prominent role for international environmental technical and management standards and voluntary codes , as complements to regulatory frameworks .  
Provisional Order No . 4 / 1994 ( Miscellaneous Amendment of the Organization of Voluntary Work _ Societies Registration Act of 1957 and the Organization of Foreign Non _ Governmental Voluntary Work in the Sudan Act of 1988 ) , signed by the President of the Republic , defines a society as a voluntary organization of thirty or more persons established to carry out voluntary work of [ a ] social , scientific , educational , research , cultural and religious purpose ( art .  2.1 . a . 2 ) .  
According to article 2.2.2 , a voluntary organization means any foreign voluntary organization whose purpose is to carry out work the nature of which is social , scientific , educational , research based , cultural , technical or religious and which is registered under this Act .  
However , the ever-growing demand on the United Nations human rights programme to engage in such areas as confidence _ building measures , technical cooperation , education , monitoring , etc . makes it indispensable to establish an adequate and reliable mix of regular budget resources and voluntary contributions from Governments and private entities .  
Concerned about continuing deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers involved in Operation Lifeline Sudan and with international private voluntary agencies ,  
That resolution reaffirmed the priority of the Programme ( para . 3 ) , requested the Secretary-General to strengthen it further by providing it with the resources necessary for the full implementation of its mandate ( para . 6 ) , called upon States and United Nations and other international , regional and national funding agencies to make significant financial contributions for operational activities of the Programme , and encouraged all States to make voluntary contributions for that purpose to the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Fund .  
The topics discussed included the question of the minimum age of those participating in hostilities , the issue of direct or indirect involvement in hostilities , the age of recruitment , be it voluntary or compulsory , into the armed forces , and whether or not a clause should be included in the draft optional protocol preventing child recruitment by non-governmental armed groups .  
The Trust Fund so established is open to voluntary financial contributions from States , inter-governmental organizations , regional economic integration organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations as well as natural and juridical persons .  
While existing rules prepared by organizations such as the Comit maritime international ( CMI ) could provide detailed guidance on the use of electronic messages to create bills of lading , they could not provide a legal basis for such bills since the rules were voluntary .  
In accordance with article III of the statute of the Institute , the Board of Trustees is composed of 11 members nominated by States and appointed by the Economic and Social Council , with due regard to the fact that the Institute and its work are funded from voluntary contributions and to the principle of equitable geographical distribution .  
Commit ourselves to securing the participation of all actors of civil society , in particular women , youth and children , and voluntary organizations , in the national efforts towards implementation of Agenda 21 , and decide to promote regional camps for schoolchildren and encourage their active participation in environmental protection and sustainable management of natural resources ;  
Two representatives from North and South America respectively complained about the role of the United Nations which was considered to be too weak ; one of them lamented the paternalistic approach of the United Nations towards indigenous issues ; the other stressed the need for the United Nations to take a more active role along with its speciliazed agencies , in particular as far as the voluntary funds were concerned .  
For example , consider the launching of programmes by Governments , United Nations agencies and other international organizations , and major groups , on which consensus was developed by IPF ; consider appropriate mechanisms for the mobilization of institutional , human and financial resources and capacity-building ; and encourage the development of voluntary codes of conduct for the private sector ;  
Following a comprehensive review of the structure of the Lessons Learned Unit , and a reassessment of its resource needs , the Secretary-General remains convinced that the functions of the Unit can not be met from the remaining two dedicated posts for the lessons learned function financed from the regular budget ( one-D-1 , one General Service level ) following the anticipated cessation on 31 December 1997 of voluntary funding for other extrabudgetary posts currently available to the Unit .  
It will reach out to different groups : the voluntary sector , social and health-care practitioners , professional and academic bodies , central and local government , industry and commerce , professionals , interested individuals , womens , youth and older peoples organizations , religious bodies , schools and colleges , cross-cultural and ethnic minority groups and many others .  
The latter two documents reviewed the principal features of a number of funding modalities , ranging from assessed contributions to negotiated pledges , and offered recommendations aimed primarily at placing voluntary pledges on a more secure and predictable basis by offering ideas on : multi-year pledges ( or some early indication of intentions to possibly reduce contributions from current levels ) ; dealing with currency fluctuations ; and linking funding to programmes endorsed by the relevant governing body .  
Among those policy parameters was that funding : be voluntary ; be focused on core resources , originating essentially from official sources ; be multilateral and neutral and remain universally accessible ; produce stable , secure and predictable levels of funding linked to programme requirements of the funds and programmes ; and contain elements leading to more burden-sharing .  
Welcomes Commission on Narcotic Drugs resolution 6 ( XL ) of 25 March 1997 concerning the revised budget for the biennium 1996-1997 and the proposed outline for the biennium 1998-1999 of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , and urges all Governments to provide the fullest possible financial and political support to the organization by widening the donor base of the Programme and increasing voluntary contributions , in particular general-purpose contributions , to enable it to continue , expand and strengthen its operational and technical cooperation activities ;  
The needs of the audiovisual library may be included in the annual circular note of the Secretary-General requesting financial assistance for different components of the Programme as one of the items for which States , their institutions or private individuals may wish to make voluntary contributions in monetary terms or in kind ( tapes , equipment , etc . ) .  
With regard to the Boards principal findings on the voluntary funds administered by UNHCR , he said that as far as previous recommendations not fully implemented were concerned the main persistent irregularities were the non-assessment of the capabilities of implementing partners ; delays in the submission of project-monitoring reports ; the selective basis on which work plans were prepared ; and the failure of implementing partners to maintain separate accounts for UNHCR funds .  
Regarding the preparation of interdisciplinary / joint publications with other regional commissions or entities , the Economic Commission for Europe would suggest that three criteria be met : the decision should be taken on a voluntary basis by interested agencies ; the objective of the publication should be to provide a variety of views and experiences on specific issues ; and the time-frame for publications should be realistic and agreed upon by the organizations involved .  
Encourages voluntary national and regional actions aimed at making available to the United Nations system , through the United Nations Volunteers , national volunteer corps such as the White Helmets on a standby basis , in accordance with accepted United Nations procedures and practices , in order to provide specialized human and technical resources for emergency relief and rehabilitation ;  
Expresses its appreciation for the commendable progress of the White Helmets initiative as another voluntary international effort to provide the United Nations system with volunteer expertise to respond , in a quick and coordinated manner , to humanitarian relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development , while preserving the non-political , neutral and impartial character of humanitarian action ;  
The quality of teaching and the modern technological infrastructure of education , including computers and access to the Internet , must be developed in schools , particularly in the poorest countries and neighbourhoods , with the help of government programmes , voluntary fund-raising and international assistance .  57 .  An educated citizenry is a precondition for fully effective democratic institutions .  
In accordance with the resolution and arrangements : voluntary contributions paid to the Fund are distributed , through established channels of assistance , as humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals who have been tortured and to their relatives ; the Fund is administered by the Secretary-General with the advice of a board of trustees authorized to promote and solicit contributions and pledges ; and an annual report is submitted by the Secretary-General to the Assembly and , as appropriate , to the Commission on Human Rights .  
The basic principles governing these programmes were to respect and preserve , through bicultural education , the ethnic identity of each of the seven Mayan language groups , guaranteeing their legal stay and security in Mexico , until such time as they individually expressed their preference for voluntary repatriation , and to offer them a standard of living and opportunities for development and work equivalent to those of the Mexican population living in the same area .  
This scepticism has sprung from a variety of sources : that high unemployment represents a voluntary economic equilibrium that is impossible to reduce without triggering off accelerating inflation ; that rapid labour-saving technological change has ushered in an era of " jobless growth " and " the end of work " ; and that heightened economic competition in the wake of the globalization of the world economy has emasculated the capacity of Governments to influence the level and quality of employment .  
In both developed and developing countries they are in need of support if they are to manage the growing sustainability challenge posed by national and international environmental regulations , standards and voluntary codes that are developed by large companies .  
If applicable , assists the Director in preparing methods and procedures for verification of human rights during internal armed confrontation , commitment to strengthening the system for the protection of human rights , commitment relating to security forces and the bearing of arms , military conscription and voluntary nature and behaviour of paramilitary forces ; assists also in following up the verification and evaluating the findings of regional offices . 
Others argue that environmental standards and technical regulations are different in that they comprise measures : ( i ) which are largely voluntary ; ( ii ) which may be based upon non-product related process and production methods ( PPMs ) ; ( iii ) for which channels of information dissemination are less clearly established ; and ( iv ) based on the precautionary principle . 
Everyone has the right [ is entitled ] , individually and in association with others , to solicit , receive and utilize voluntary financial or other contributions , for the purpose of promoting and protecting , through peaceful means , [ universally recognized ] human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The present document is an analytical summary of the main points to which ICRC attaches special importance and which it has endeavoured to address in recent years , namely , minimum age of recruitment , minimum age of participation in hostilities , the notions of direct and indirect participation , the notions of armed conflict and hostilities , compulsory recruitment and voluntary enlistment , and armed groups .  
FITDH urges the working group on a draft optional protocol to fix the minimum age for recruitment into armed forces at 18 in respect of compulsory service as well as voluntary enlistment , since in many cases a minor 's decision to enlist in the armed forces is anything but free , being dictated by various circumstances , such as poverty , coercion , insecurity , a broken home or lack of alternatives , and parental consent is not enough of a guarantee .  
The question of displaced persons was settled by agreement between the two sides at the third round of the intercommunal talks held at Vienna between 31 July and 2 August 1975 , whereby the two sides agreed on a voluntary ( not forcible expulsion , as the Greek Cypriot representative alleges ) regrouping of populations in their own respective territory , the Turkish Cypriots in the North and the Greek Cypriots in the South , paving the way for a bi-zonal settlement of the Cyprus question . 
The major tasks of UNTAES were to assist in the demilitarization of the region ; to facilitate , together with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , the voluntary and safe return of refugees and displaced persons ; to reintegrate civil administration and public services ; to establish a temporary police force ; to cooperate with the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ; to organize elections ; to monitor respect for the highest standards of human rights ; and to promote an atmosphere of confidence among all local residents .  
The adoption of this theme highlighted the emphasis given by the international community to voluntary repatriation as a durable solution and asserted that a natural extension of this emphasis is the increased importance attached to the prevention of forced displacement .  
This has been interpreted to mean that the resources approved by the Assembly must be used for staff and non-staff costs as indicated in the relevant budgets and that resources can not be spent from assessed budgets , whether from the regular budget or the budgets of the international tribunals , peacekeeping operations or the peacekeeping support account , in order to utilize voluntary contributions provided by a few donor Governments .  
The question of the applicability of administrative or programme support costs for type II gratis personnel has arisen because heretofore voluntary contributions have related primarily to supplementary or non-assessed activities , but in the context of type II gratis personnel , voluntary contributions are currently linked to activities that have been specified and approved by the General Assembly in the relevant assessed budgets , both regular and peacekeeping .  
The Committee noted that in his statement , the Director of the Office for Outer Space Affairs had invited Member States , space agencies and relevant national and international organizations to consider supporting the preparations for the UNISPACE III Conference by seconding experts to the Office at the junior or senior expert level , by co-sponsoring workshops related to the additional components of the Conference and through other voluntary contributions .  
The Commission 's work programme on indicators of sustainable development should result in a practicable and agreed set of indicators , suited to country-specific conditions , including a limited number of aggregated indicators , to be used at the national level , on a voluntary basis , by the year 2000 . 
Recommends that the Executive Boards of the United Nations funds and programmes review and monitor , as a matter of priority and within the context of their regular meetings , their funding schemes , particularly of core resources , with a view to meeting their agreed upon target , reflecting the priorities and needs of programme countries , and increasing the target for voluntary contributions from official sources from the developed countries as the main source for funding of operational activities for the programming cycles , including the present cycle ;  
The Croatian Government is now proceeding with a laborious , costly , delicate and time-consuming campaign to return to their pre-conflict homes the mostly non-Serb victims of ethnic cleansing and the mostly Serb persons who were displaced or became refugees because of their affiliation with the occupying authorities .  The returns are carefully managed , keeping in mind international conventions which state that they should be voluntary , safe and dignified .  
Another major component of that institutional framework was the Ministry of Women and Children 's Affairs , whose role included national policy formulation , implementation of special programmes , women 's legal and social rights , registration of voluntary organizations and dealing with international organizations .  
Recognizing the importance of prevention in order to achieve demand reduction , his Government had developed a strategy which accorded a major role to the family and also involved teachers , voluntary organizations , youth , media , parents , local councils and the leisure industry .  It had adopted a social model rather than a medical model in the treatment and rehabilitation field and was giving priority to community services .  
Over the next five years , Malta planned to further strengthen the administrative and legislative means available to it to combat drug trafficking , sustain its opposition to the legalization of drugs , both hard and soft , involve all the actors of civil society in a coordinated strategy of prevention and education , enhance the drug-related services available for the family and the community , if necessary calling on the voluntary sector for assistance , and establish a continuous systematic evaluation exercise of the services offered in the preventive and therapeutic field .  
While the Working Group had noted with satisfaction the valuable efforts to implement the recommendations of UNISPACE 82 , it had identified four priority areas where further efforts should be made to promote the applications of space science and technology for development : stimulation and support of the growth of indigenous nuclei and an autonomous technological base in space technology in developing countries ; promotion of a greater exchange of actual experiences in space applications ; and funding of the Programme of Space Applications and voluntary contributions for its activities .  
As a sign of Sweden 's continuing commitment to the work of the United Nations in the economic and social fields , the Swedish Government in its budget bill to the Parliament for 1997 - in spite of cuts in almost all other areas of government expenditure - was proposing a maintained total level of voluntary contributions to the Organization 's operational activities .  
The fund was established with a base level of $ 20-million and may extend up to an amount equivalent to 10 per cent of the total budgetary estimates for voluntary repatriation for the preceding year .  
The human rights treaty system , established under the six operative international human rights treaties , consists of a voluntary system of self-monitoring by way of reporting , supervised by six independent and expert international committees .  
While voluntary contributions continued to be sought for the RDMHQ , the contributions received so far fell far short of the total of nearly $ 3.2-million that had been identified as necessary for the first two years of the RDMHQ .  
Belgium accepted only a minimum age of 18 for ( a ) direct or indirect involvement in hostilities ; ( b ) voluntary or involuntary recruitment both by the armed forces and by non _ governmental armed groups .  
This is the concern of everyone , ranging from the communities where such diseases are endemic to the public , private and voluntary sectors at national and international level .  
While his delegation appreciated the contributions of States to voluntary funds and fellowships for indigenous populations , the overall amounts involved were wholly inadequate for the realization of their social , economic and political development needs . 
A critical element is the availability of public resources to finance and support publicly provided services and to stimulate and complement private and voluntary provision , as appropriate , and their more effective and efficient use to meet stated objectives .  
The fund was established with a base level of $ 20-million and may extend up to an amount equivalent to 10 per cent of the total budgetary estimates for voluntary repatriation for the preceding year .  
It recommends that the State party raise the legal minimum age of voluntary enlistment into the armed forces in the light of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
Calls upon States to consider additional voluntary contributions to meet the pressing human rights and humanitarian needs in the area , and underlines the need for continuing coordination among States , international organizations and non-governmental organizations of initiatives and programmes with the aim of avoiding duplication , overlap and working at cross-purposes ;  
In order to protect UNDP from the risk of unexpected downward fluctuations in voluntary contributions , a component of the Operational Reserve is to be calculated as the equivalent of 10 per cent of the average of the voluntary contributions received over the most recent three years , rounded to the nearest $ 1-million .  
In the light of the provisions and principles of the Convention , especially the principles of the best interests of the child ( art . 3 ) and the right to life , survival and development ( art . 6 ) , the Committee expressed its deep concern at the early legal minimum age of voluntary enlistment into the armed forces and recommended that the State party raise the age in the light of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
By the Governments decision , the National Council for Womens Affairs , headed by a Cabinet member , the Minister for Health and Social Welfare , was established at the end of 1996 , and its operational by-laws were accordingly adopted . the Council is made up of MPs , officials of ministries concerned , representatives of womens non-governmental organizations , voluntary movements , mass organizations , owners of private companies , business and cooperative entities . 
The General Assembly should take a position on the future pledging mechanism , either in a separate resolution or as part of its general decision on the triennial policy review ; Ukraine supported the establishment of such a mechanism provided that the universal , voluntary and grant nature of United Nations operational activities was maintained .  
The main topics discussed by the working group during the general discussion on questions relating to the draft optional protocol included the minimum age for participation in hostilities , the issue of direct or indirect involvement in hostilities , the age of recruitment , be it voluntary or compulsory , into armed forces , and the possibility of including a clause to prevent child recruitment by non-governmental armed groups .  
Any proposal must be examined in light of ( i ) a constrained United Nations budget which leaves no room for net growth in the organization ; ( ii ) the imperative to avoid duplication and to direct scarce United Nations system resources to activities having the greatest impact and benefits ; and ( iii ) the availability of voluntary funding . 
Those remaining are mostly territorial troops engaged in civil duties , such as voluntary public works in agriculture , construction , irrigation , fighting illiteracy , building churches , roads and bridges , helping the social welfare of villagers , etc .  
While promoting the uses of voluntary initiatives and agreements as positive instruments for sustainable development , trade unions will also promote the defining of minimum social , environmental and economic indicators that voluntary initiatives or agreements must never conflict with or undermine ( for example , minimum social indicators would include International Labour Organization ( ILO ) core labour standards , child and forced labour provisions , and employment equality requirements ) .  
The core programmatic actions which will be supported include youth education and mobilization , voluntary counselling and testing , interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission , strengthened action to prevent and treat sexually transmitted diseases , distribution of condoms , improved community standards of care , treatment of common opportunistic infections , and special services for families with orphans .  
To end the enforced displacement of persons and other causes of refugee flows to neighbouring countries and to create conditions conducive to their voluntary return and full reintegration in safety and dignity , including returnees who have not been granted rights of full citizenship , in close cooperation with the international community , through the United Nations system and its specialized agencies , governmental and intergovernmental organizations , as well as non-governmental organizations ;  
Requests the High Commissioner to set up a voluntary fund designed specifically to cover all aspects of the preparatory process for the Conference and the participation of non _ governmental organizations , especially from developing countries , and requests all Governments , international organizations , non _ governmental organizations and private individuals to contribute to this Fund ;  
Requests the Secretary _ General , the United Nations specialized agencies and the regional economic commissions to provide financial and technical assistance for the organization of the regional preparatory meetings planned in the context of the World Conference and stresses that such assistance should be supplemented by voluntary contributions ;  
To end the enforced displacement of persons and other causes of refugee flows to neighbouring countries and to create conditions conducive to their voluntary return and full reintegration in safety and dignity , including returnees who have not been granted rights of full citizenship , in close cooperation with the international community , through the United Nations system and its specialized agencies , governmental and intergovernmental organizations , as well as non-governmental organizations ;  
The existing voluntary initiatives were identified as being complementary to national and local regulatory compliance efforts , as these initiatives are designed to be cost-effective means of surpassing existing regulatory requirements .  
Requests the High Commissioner to set up a voluntary fund designed specifically to cover all aspects of the preparatory process for the Conference and the participation of non _ governmental organizations , especially from developing countries , and requests all Governments , international organizations , non _ governmental organizations and private individuals to contribute to this Fund ;

It is of considerable regret to us that some of the soldiers serving in Sierra Leone on behalf of the international community , the non-UNAMSIL ECOMOG contingents , will not be funded on this basis and will instead continue to rely on voluntary contributions , which have been desperately slow in coming and which are , at least on the basis of past practice , unlikely to relieve significantly the financial burden ECOMOG troop-contributors have assumed .
