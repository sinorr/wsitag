The exceptional cases of the alleged limitations of the human rights and freedoms of individual members of the Albanian national minority in Kosovo and Metohija are the exclusive consequence of the endangering of the constitutional order of the country and the breach of public peace and order through decades-long aggressive activities of the separatist movement in this autonomous province .  
The most drastic examples of abuse of the members of the Albanian national minority are placing of children in the front rows of separatist demonstrations , spreading rumour about alleged mass poisoning of Albanian children and the forcibly preventing the young generation from acquiring compulsory elementary education and other levels of education in their mother tongue for which Serbia and Yugoslavia have provided all necessary material , financial and personnel conditions .

The obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all alleged extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , to identify and to bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions should be considered of the utmost importance in the context of the protection of the fundamental right to life .

As for the alleged emigration of Turkish Cypriots from Northern Cyprus , this is both an exaggeration and the epitome of hypocrisy on the part of the Greek Cypriot side , because the economic and other hardships being faced by the people of Northern Cyprus are the direct result of the inhuman economic , social , cultural and political embargo being imposed on our people by the usurper Greek Cypriot regime in Southern Cyprus .

I hope the Turkish side will respond positively to my proposal , otherwise the only logical inference to be drawn will be that the massive presence of Turkish forces is not for the alleged safety of the Turkish Cypriot community , but for the perpetuation of the status quo , which , as stated in your report , has been created by military force and is sustained by military strength and which the Security Council has deemed unacceptable .  
Moreover , there is no permanent international judicial body that could ensure that the alleged perpetrators will be brought to justice , even where both the political will and a functioning judiciary are absent at the national level .

The attacks are alleged to result from the central Government 's official policy imposing " its truth regarding Islam on an erroneous local version of Islam " and therefore to have religious legitimacy , as demonstrated by , inter alia , the fatwa of April 1992 ( see para .  122 ) .  
Regrettably , where alleged violations of minority rights occurred , political means were frequently resorted to and there was an insufficient use of judicial protection mechanisms at the national level , which should be exhausted before any recourse was had to the relevant international organizations .  
The use of alleged human rights violations as a pretext for interfering in the internal affairs of States must cease , and progress in the human rights field must be accompanied by tangible advances in economic and social development .

The observation of the Special Rapporteur in paragraph 68 that " a great reluctance of the international community to use the term ' genocide ' " is not rooted , as the Special Rapporteur would like it , in the alleged " reluctance " but in the fact that such a position is contrary to international law , while the prevailing practice of certain political bodies and some United Nations Special Rapporteurs to invest genocide with arbitrary definitions has been politically motivated .  
As regards the sources which reported alleged cases of arbitrary detention to the Working Group , it may be noted that of the 205 individual cases submitted by the Working Group to Governments during the period under consideration , 10 were based on information communicated by members of the families or relatives of the detained persons , 91 on information communicated by local or regional non _ governmental organizations , and 104 on information provided by international non _ governmental organizations enjoying consultative status with the Economic and Social Council .

While the Tribunal conducts an exhumation at an alleged grave site only to obtain evidence in support of indictments , which might often be limited to a certain number of mortal remains , the expert aims at the total exhumation of a given site for the sole and purely humanitarian purpose of identifying as many missing persons as possible .  
In possession of considerable information relating to alleged serious violations of human rights in Nigeria , and in the absence either of a substantive response from the Government concerning specific allegations transmitted during the year or of the opportunity to visit the country , the Special Rapporteurs were thus required at least to inform the General Assembly about the substance of allegations received and to draw such preliminary conclusions as may be possible by reference to , e.g . , declared laws and acknowledged practices .  
Accusations contained in this paragraph , concerning alleged discriminatory laws , are inaccurate , never having been articulated in this manner by any international body dealing with the Yugoslav legal system - either CERD or the many special rapporteurs of the Commission .  
In most cases , the Committee determined that merely to report the adoption of urgent security measures ( implying severe restrictions on the functioning of institutions and the exercise of human rights ) , on the ground of the alleged existence of a state of emergency , was not sufficient , in conformity with the terms of article 4 of the Covenant , to invoke the right of derogation provided for in strictly defined cases .  
In such cases , it is also common for the majority of the members of the judiciary to be removed from office and for the ordinary courts to be replaced by military courts to try people for alleged political offences , culminating in a Supreme Court of Justice that legalizes institutional acts or their equivalent , or confers a supra _ constitutional status on emergency rules adopted by the regime .

Nevertheless , it is unfortunate that , regardless of the Iraqi Government 's numerous affirmations , the most recent of which was made at the discussions held with the Chairman of the Special Commission from 3 to 5 April 1997 , that there are no concealed proscribed weapons , components or capabilities and that events which took place in the past were merely isolated and exceptional actions taken by Hussein Kamal and his group , not State-directed policy , the Special Commission continues to circulate claims of alleged concealment .  
I would like to refer to my announcement to the Security Council on 8 July 1997 that I intended to appoint an investigative team in order to investigate alleged grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo committed since 1 March 1993 , and to the briefing the Council received on the subject on 30 July .

While the Government of Croatia has publicly stated that it no longer possesses a " war crimes list " of persons in the region whose alleged criminal acts fall outside the Amnesty Law , this statement falls short of the obligation to reduce public anxieties by concluding investigations of alleged serious crimes against international humanitarian law with the participation of the United Nations and local Serbs .

In most of the cases reported to the Working Group , the sources alleged that the individuals are being held incommunicado and they express a fear that the victims may be subjected to torture or extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions .

With regard to the alleged suppression of freedom of thought , expression and information mentioned in paragraph 5 , his Government actually promoted the development of culture in all its forms by encouraging the work of scientific and cultural institutions , although it prohibited the publication of anything that might undermine its relations with other countries or that might be contrary to the moral and religious values of society .  
Likewise , when we are aware of the zeal with which alleged terrorists are tracked down , in every corner of the globe , it is difficult to understand why , despite the tireless appeals launched by the overwhelming majority of States , nothing significant has ever been carried out at the national level to prevent the recruitment and use of mercenaries , which , as has been proved , contributes to the flouting of the rules of international humanitarian law . 
The 1952 Convention establishes a formal regulatory system which can permit the arrest of a ship to secure the satisfaction of any judgment that may eventually be pronounced because the holder of a maritime lien can not , sometimes in a matter of hours , fulfil the standard procedural requirements ( likelihood of the claim alleged , valid title , precise value of the claim and risks of delay ) under formal national or domestic regulations for his application to proceed ;  
Accordingly , as underlined in no uncertain terms by its Prime Minister , the demand that Eritrea must withdraw from all occupied Ethiopian territories for peace to be achieved between Ethiopia and Eritrea has been a firm Ethiopian position and a fundamental and irreducible minimum condition and not , as alleged by Eritrea , a new element injected by Ethiopia at the eleventh hour .  
Thirdly , the provisions of article 4 , especially those exempting from the scope of the draft convention activities of armed forces [ of a State ] during an armed conflict , were used to sustain a questionable exception which had the effect of recognizing an alleged right of such forces to use and traffic in nuclear or radioactive material , on the pretext of the exercise of official duties and inasmuch as [ such activities ] are governed by ( . . . ) international law .  
It keeps the statistical records of complaints received , the types of human rights violated , the acts of violation and those alleged to be responsible for the violations , whether at the national level or for each of the departments in which there are area offices .  
The 1998 report and the 1998 interim report ( memorandum ) of the previous Special Rapporteur referred to alleged massacres and summary executions , to outbursts of ethnic violence and other violations of human rights ranging from the infliction of inhuman and degrading punishment to systematic gender discrimination , including denial to women of access to medical care and employment .

The methodology of the report is accountable for another obfuscation : in an effort to scale down their size and significance , the human rights abuses evident in the use of cluster bombs and depleted uranium , the ethnic cleansing of Serbs after the aggression and the destruction of civilian infrastructure are immediately referenced to alleged violations of human rights by the Yugoslav side .  
It further rejects outright the pretexts advanced by Turkey to justify these acts of aggression against northern Iraq , given that the alleged pursuit of elements that pose a threat to Turkish national security does not make it legitimate for Turkey to adopt policies that are entirely at variance with its declared commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq .  
Any consideration of the Iraq sanctions regime should not be artificially forced or hurried if we are to achieve the twin goals of alleviating the grave humanitarian situation in Iraq and ensuring Iraqi compliance with the requirements in respect of its alleged remaining weapons of mass destruction .  
It is further alleged that , in contrast to the improved situation in the north of Uganda , armed clashes in the west of Uganda between the UPDF and the insurgent Allied Democratic Front ( ADF ) , which have also involved the abduction and forcible recruitment of children , have intensified since June 1997 .  
The Working Group is deeply concerned about the continuing de facto discriminatory treatment of certain social groups , including women , reflected by limitations on their full participation in public life , educational choices and employment opportunities and by alleged child slavery and prostitution .  
If the Government of a State were to distribute letters in which an ethnic or minority group alleged that it was the victim of repressive measures or that its fundamental human rights were not recognized in the sovereign territory of another State , the Government of Cyprus reserved the right to act in the same way if that practice continued .

As for the alleged emigration of Turkish Cypriots from Northern Cyprus , this is both an exaggeration and the epitome of hypocrisy on the part of the Greek Cypriot side , because the economic and other hardships being faced by the people of Northern Cyprus are the direct result of the inhuman economic , social , cultural and political embargo being imposed on our people by the usurper Greek Cypriot regime in Southern Cyprus .

I hope the Turkish side will respond positively to my proposal , otherwise the only logical inference to be drawn will be that the massive presence of Turkish forces is not for the alleged safety of the Turkish Cypriot community , but for the perpetuation of the status quo , which , as stated in your report , has been created by military force and is sustained by military strength and which the Security Council has deemed unacceptable .  
Moreover , there is no permanent international judicial body that could ensure that the alleged perpetrators will be brought to justice , even where both the political will and a functioning judiciary are absent at the national level .

The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , Mr . Bacre Waly Ndiaye , in his report ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 4 ) referred to a number of cases that had come before him in 1995 , in which it was alleged that the victims subjected to death threats or extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions belonged to national , ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities .

The attacks are alleged to result from the central Government 's official policy imposing " its truth regarding Islam on an erroneous local version of Islam " and therefore to have religious legitimacy , as demonstrated by , inter alia , the fatwa of April 1992 ( see para .  122 ) .  
Regrettably , where alleged violations of minority rights occurred , political means were frequently resorted to and there was an insufficient use of judicial protection mechanisms at the national level , which should be exhausted before any recourse was had to the relevant international organizations .  
The use of alleged human rights violations as a pretext for interfering in the internal affairs of States must cease , and progress in the human rights field must be accompanied by tangible advances in economic and social development .

Welcomes the statement by the Government of the Sudan , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , [ 68 ] in which it pledged its logistical support to national , regional and international organizations to join the investigations of alleged cases of involuntary disappearance and slavery , and , accordingly , calls upon the Government to grant international human rights and humanitarian organizations and independent observers free and unimpeded access to all areas where these violations have been reported ;  
The observation of the Special Rapporteur in paragraph 68 that " a great reluctance of the international community to use the term ' genocide ' " is not rooted , as the Special Rapporteur would like it , in the alleged " reluctance " but in the fact that such a position is contrary to international law , while the prevailing practice of certain political bodies and some United Nations Special Rapporteurs to invest genocide with arbitrary definitions has been politically motivated .  
As regards the sources which reported alleged cases of arbitrary detention to the Working Group , it may be noted that of the 205 individual cases submitted by the Working Group to Governments during the period under consideration , 10 were based on information communicated by members of the families or relatives of the detained persons , 91 on information communicated by local or regional non _ governmental organizations , and 104 on information provided by international non _ governmental organizations enjoying consultative status with the Economic and Social Council .

While the Tribunal conducts an exhumation at an alleged grave site only to obtain evidence in support of indictments , which might often be limited to a certain number of mortal remains , the expert aims at the total exhumation of a given site for the sole and purely humanitarian purpose of identifying as many missing persons as possible .  
In possession of considerable information relating to alleged serious violations of human rights in Nigeria , and in the absence either of a substantive response from the Government concerning specific allegations transmitted during the year or of the opportunity to visit the country , the Special Rapporteurs were thus required at least to inform the General Assembly about the substance of allegations received and to draw such preliminary conclusions as may be possible by reference to , e.g . , declared laws and acknowledged practices .

In most cases , the Committee determined that merely to report the adoption of urgent security measures ( implying severe restrictions on the functioning of institutions and the exercise of human rights ) , on the ground of the alleged existence of a state of emergency , was not sufficient , in conformity with the terms of article 4 of the Covenant , to invoke the right of derogation provided for in strictly defined cases .  
In such cases , it is also common for the majority of the members of the judiciary to be removed from office and for the ordinary courts to be replaced by military courts to try people for alleged political offences , culminating in a Supreme Court of Justice that legalizes institutional acts or their equivalent , or confers a supra _ constitutional status on emergency rules adopted by the regime .

Panama continued that the foregoing provisions would not apply where the domestic legislation of the State did not provide for due process of law with regard to the protection of the right or rights which had allegedly been violated ; the alleged victim of a violation had not been allowed access to domestic remedies , or had been impeded in exhausting such remedies ; there had been unreasonable delay in a decision with regard to domestic remedies .  
Presidential commissions of inquiry have in recent years been appointed to investigate and report on alleged contraventions of laws and other control measures based on international conventions designed to combat such activities as the smuggling of and illegal trade in ivory and rhinoceros horn , the import and disposal of hazardous waste containing mercury and the import of hazardous waste containing cupric arsenic .  
Nevertheless , it is unfortunate that , regardless of the Iraqi Government 's numerous affirmations , the most recent of which was made at the discussions held with the Chairman of the Special Commission from 3 to 5 April 1997 , that there are no concealed proscribed weapons , components or capabilities and that events which took place in the past were merely isolated and exceptional actions taken by Hussein Kamal and his group , not State-directed policy , the Special Commission continues to circulate claims of alleged concealment .  
I would like to refer to my announcement to the Security Council on 8 July 1997 that I intended to appoint an investigative team in order to investigate alleged grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo committed since 1 March 1993 , and to the briefing the Council received on the subject on 30 July .

While the Government of Croatia has publicly stated that it no longer possesses a " war crimes list " of persons in the region whose alleged criminal acts fall outside the Amnesty Law , this statement falls short of the obligation to reduce public anxieties by concluding investigations of alleged serious crimes against international humanitarian law with the participation of the United Nations and local Serbs . 
Although such measures may be imposed not only by individual States , but also by a group of States , the determination or judgement of alleged wrongful or objectionable policies of target States subject to coercive economic measures is made by sender State ( s ) largely on a unilateral or narrow-group basis .  
In most of the cases reported to the Working Group , the sources alleged that the individuals are being held incommunicado and they express a fear that the victims may be subjected to torture or extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions .  
The Principles also provide that persons alleged to have committed these grave human rights violations should be suspended from any official duties during the investigation and removed from any position of control or power , whether direct or indirect .  
Each State Party may consider ensuring that the onus of proof is reversed regarding the lawful origin of alleged proceeds of crime or other property liable to confiscation , to the extent that such action is consistent with the principles of its domestic law and with the nature of the judicial and other proceedings .  
With regard to the alleged suppression of freedom of thought , expression and information mentioned in paragraph 5 , his Government actually promoted the development of culture in all its forms by encouraging the work of scientific and cultural institutions , although it prohibited the publication of anything that might undermine its relations with other countries or that might be contrary to the moral and religious values of society .  
Likewise , when we are aware of the zeal with which alleged terrorists are tracked down , in every corner of the globe , it is difficult to understand why , despite the tireless appeals launched by the overwhelming majority of States , nothing significant has ever been carried out at the national level to prevent the recruitment and use of mercenaries , which , as has been proved , contributes to the flouting of the rules of international humanitarian law .
