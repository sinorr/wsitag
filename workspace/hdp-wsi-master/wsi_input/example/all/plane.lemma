Li Peng hoped that the leading group and cadres in Zhangjiagang City will , from the high plane of laying emphasis on politics , identify problems from the development and dialectical viewpoint , adhere to the high standard and strict demands , exert pressure on themselves , go all out to forge ahead , and conscientiously investigate , look for , and resolve the existing outstanding problems , as well as lead the people throughout the city to open up new prospects in the reform and opening up and modernization construction in Zhangjiagang City .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's remarks have , from a high plane of historical materialism , revealed the fundamental nature of our party ; pointed out the party 's basic tasks ; and are of an important theoretical and practical significance to our efforts to further maintain the advancement of the party , retain the vigor and vitality of the party , lead the whole party and the people of the entire country to carry out struggles in unity , and build our country into a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized modern socialist power .  
In view of such a situation , the party committees at all levels in enterprises administered by central authorities should approach the matter from the high plane of stressing on politics , gain a thoroughgoing understanding on the extreme importance of the principle of " paying attention to two types of work , attaching equal importance to both , " adopt earnest and effective measures , strengthen leadership , and enhance the building of a sound party style and a clean administration in state enterprises to a new level .  
At the turn of the century , the party Central Committee put forward the strategy of extensively developing the western areas .  This is a major policy decision made by the party 's leadership collective of the third generation who look far ahead from a high plane , take the overall situation into account , judge the hour and size up the situation , and serve the new century .  
The " Proposal " elevates science and technology progress to the same high plane as reform and opening up and puts it forward as an impetus to national economic and social development .  This is a new improvement to the understanding of the impetus to the development of socialism , as well as an innovation and development in Deng Xiaoping Theory made by the third-generation central leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
The promulgation of the " Regulations on the Operation of the Anti-chemical Warfare Corps " of the new generation marked an important breakthrough made by our armed forces in their research on the characteristics and objective laws of operation under the threats of nuclear and chemical weapons , and marked a change from emphasizing protection on the same plane in the combined operation of the ground force to three-dimension protection in the joint operation of different armed services .  
We must , from the political high plane of " consolidating the ruling position of our party and guaranteeing the lengthy and peaceful reign of our country " gain a correct understanding of the great importance that lies in our effort to uphold the fundamental principle that the party commands the gun ; and must see to it that the awareness of the army soul can strike deep roots in the hearts of every officer and man .  
This former government official , who is unwilling to disclose his name , believes that because their military aircraft crashed in the incident , the Chinese communists will certainly take advantage of this incident to force the United States to apologize , despite the fact that the US Armed Forces Pacific Command announced that the EP-3 plane was performing its mission over the international open sea and did not intrude the Chinese communists ' territorial airspace .  
Some analyses say that the PRC fighter intentionally struck the American craft , thinking to force the US plane to land on Chinese soil .  Some people also say that the American plane made a sudden turn toward the Jian-8 as though it were a bicycle moving forward of its own volition .  It is difficult to grasp the distances at which fighter planes pass at high speeds , where a tiny slip can mean a crash and death to the crew .  
" Hong Kong Shang Pao " pointed out in its editorial : The pernicious incident of US military reconnaissance plane colliding with and crashing our military plane has caused an extremely great concern in the international community and particularly in Asia , and it has also aroused a strong indignation among the Chinese people .  
- - US officials are not at all concerned about the missing Chinese pilot and the destroyed Chinese fighter , endlessly stressing instead : The EP-3 electronic reconnaisance plant is covered by US sovereignty , and the Chinese side can not send people to board the plane and still less carry out a search .  They also demand that China provide assistance for repairing the plane as soon as possible , so that the crew can fly back to base as soon as possible .  
In answering questions from reporters at a press conference today , Zhu Bangzao stressed that the US aircraft that caused the incident was no ordinary plane , but was a military reconnaissance aircraft which , after crashing into the Chinese military aircraft , illegally entered Chinese airspace without the consent of the Chinese and landed at a Chinese airfield .  
After causing the incident , the US plane intruded into China 's territory and landed at a Chinese airport without permission from the Chinese side , which further violated relevant provisions of international laws and Chinese laws , thereby constituting a violation of China 's sovereign right and territorial air space .  
He said , international law applies to every country , and this US plane we are speaking of is not an ordinary plane but a military reconnaisance plane which entered China 's airspace without permission after colliding with and destroying a Chinese plane due to carrying out maneuvers contrary to regulations over China 's coastal waters , and landed at a Chinese military airfield .  
Fu Dunchun , associate professor of Hainan University , said : a US military reconnaissance plane gathered intelligence in air space over the South China Sea , bumped and damaged our military aircraft , and illegally landed on our territory .  The US side has felt no regret at all , made false countercharges and claimed that " China should be held responsible for the incident . "  The United States has totally exposed its hegemonism .  
Obviously , the whole plane collision incident took place in China 's exclusive economic zone .  The US side smashed the airplane of the Chinese side , and illegally entered Chinese territory .  As the victim country , the country where the incident took place , and the country where the aircraft that caused the incident landed , the Chinese side enjoys jurisdiction over the whole incident , including rights to conduct investigations on the incident , according to relevant international laws and regulations and Chinese laws .  
In the China-US military aircraft collision accident that took place in the airspace over the coastal area of Hainan Island , the US military surveillance plane in China 's Hainan airspace bumped into and damaged a Chinese fighter and illegally landed on Chinese territory .  The United States did not feel slightly ashamed and uneasy for this but shifted the blame to China . It claimed that " China should be responsible for the accident " and that " China 's fighters should not monitor US surveillance planes that came to spy on China . "  
Instead of giving sincere and friendly remarks , the United States couched in harsh terms and stressed with an intransigent attitude that the plane was US property and territory .  Moreover , it demanded the Chinese Government return the crew and the surveillance plane as quickly as possible .  This is absolutely a hegemonic act which is not only not in conformity with the relevant provisions outlined in international law but is also the logic of a bandit , without any reasons .  
Military sources in Beijing have revealed that the military exercise under way in the South China Sea has been affected by the collision incident and been forced to make a major readjustment ; a number of scheduled maneuvers have been cancelled and the focus has switched to dealing with the aftermath , including the order to the exercise units to repeatedly search for the missing pilot and recover the plane .  
It was impossible for the bumped pilot to respond in a flash .  Assuming the pilot could respond in an instant , it would be impossible for him to complete the whole process of changing the plane 's flying position from the moment he began to act .  Under this situation , the collision was inevitable .  
The unexpected collision of US and PRC military aircraft at a point 140 km southeast of Hainan , leading to the PRC F-8 fighter plane crashing , and the US EP-3 reconnaissance plane making a forced landing at Lingshui Airbase , is a test of the crisis management ability of both the PRC and the US . It also makes it clear that the strategic partnership relationship is finished , and determines even more how the two regard each other as strategic competitors .  
During the meeting , relevant consular officials of the Chinese Foreign Ministry pointed out to the US Embassy and Consulate officials mentioned above that after the US military reconnaissance plane bumped against and destroyed a Chinese military plane in the airspace over the coastal waters of China , it , without the permission of the Chinese side , intruded into China 's territorial airspace and landed on an airport in China . This has violated relevant provisions of the international law and relevant Chinese laws .  China has the right to investigate the entire incident .  
A vast ocean separates China and the United States . China has never sent a single soldier to areas near the US continent , nor has China dispatched a reconnaissance plane to US coastal areas .  The United States , on the contrary , has never stopped conducting hostile surveillance , probing flights and harassing activities toward China since the founding of New China .  
Certain people in the United States disregarded the basic norm of international relations and common knowledge of international law , and unilaterally demanded the Chinese side return crew members of the US plane and urged the Chinese side to return the US plane under the condition of " no further damage and contact " to the plane .  Such arrogant and unreasonable attitude has aroused great and righteous indignation in the Chinese people .  
The editorial says : The United States claims to be a country being most respectful to democracy and legal system in the world and always talks about human rights and law .  However , its military plane wantonly violated international law and paid no attention to the territories and sovereignty of another country .  
Evidently , it was the US reconnaissance plane that violated flying rules , bumped against and destroyed a Chinese military plane , and illegally intruded into China 's airspace and landed on an airport of the Chinese side , thus constituting a serious violation of China 's sovereignty and territory and threatening China 's national security .  
The US military reconnaissance plane 's spying activities in the airspace over China 's exclusive economic waters actually overran the scope of " free over-flight " allowed by international law , and violated the relevant stipulations of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea .  
After the collision incident , the US surveillance plane intruded China 's airspace and landed at a Chinese airport without permission from the Chinese side , and this was a move that further violated the regulations set forth by international and Chinese law , thus constituting a gross encroachment upon China 's sovereignty and territorial airspace .  
It was reported that before the Chinese personnel entered the landed aircraft at Hainan airfield , many electronic equipment inside the aircraft had already been destroyed .  However , before the US surveillance aircraft bumped against and damaged the Chinese fighter plane and landed at the airfield on Hainan Island , the Chinese side had already intercepted the frequency and signals used by this US surveillance aircraft to communicate with its rear during the process .  Reportedly , these signals are very valuable .  
The reconnaissance behavior of the US military surveillance plane violated the provisions of the " UN Convention on the Law of the Seas " concerning the necessity of respecting the rights of respective coastal nations in overflight of exclusive economic zones , thus posing a serious threat to China 's national security .  
In the past few days officers and men of the PLA units and armed police stationed in Hainan have expressed strong indignation at the incident in which a US military reconnaisance plane collided with and destroyed one of our military planes , intruded into Chinese airspace without permission , and landed at Lingshui airfield .  They have resolutely supported the Chinese Government 's solemn and just stance and directed their fervent patriotism into training and execution of duties .  
In the last incident , the United States used warships to follow the tracks of the " Yinhe " freighter , sent aircraft to circle over it , and created all kinds of difficulties for thefreighter .  In the current incident , the United States is rude and unreasonableand has put forth unreasonable demands , such as not allowing to conducton-board inspection of the plane and returning the plane at once , after itsplane violated China 's territorial airspace and territory .  
It has been learned that , in his recent statement issued to the press inWashington , US Secretary of State Colin Powell for the first time expressed hisregret over an incident in which a US military reconnaissance airplane collidedand damaged a Chinese fighter plane , resulting in a missing pilot whose destinyis still unknown .  
The economic and trade commissions at all levels must fullyunderstand the important significance of rectifying and standardizing marketeconomic order from the high plane of intensifying the work of public order , solidifying and developing the good momentum of national economic development , heightening the overall quality and competitiveness of the national economy , further opening wider to the outside world , and establishing and perfecting thesocialist market economic structure .  They should further enhance their senseof responsibility and sense of mission , and ceaselessly strengthen theirinitiative and consciousness in work .  
The Chinese Government and people have the right to know why the US sidefrequently dispatched military surveillance planes to China 's coastal waters tocarry out activities , why the US plane violated operational rules and suddenlyveered , bumped into , and destroyed the Chinese plane , and why the US planeintruded into China 's territorial airspace and landed at a Chinese airportwithout permission . 
The entire officers and men of Hainan 's publicsecurity and border defense units , who are shouldered with the security task ofguarding the 1,700-km coastline and 2.1-million square km of ocean , are filledwith righteous indignation at the incident in which a US militaryreconnaissance plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese military plane inmidair over the South China sea and entered China 's airspace withoutauthorization .  One after another , they indignantly condemned the US hegemonicacts .  
Reporters Li Kun and Wang Weiping report : Ma Man Kay , president of theMacao China Chamber of Commerce , pointed out that the incident in which the USmilitary reconnaissance plane ramming and damaging China 's military aircraft inairspace above China 's exclusive economic zone and entering China 's territorialairspace and landing at a Chinese airport without permission is a serious onethat has violated international law and violated China 's sovereignty andterritorial airspace .  
The Chinese planes ' surveillance was a normal act ofsafeguarding national security .  The US plane , which violated flight rules andwhich rammed and damaged the Chinese aircraft , causing its pilot missing , mustbe held accountable for all the consequences .  
Ignoring the international law , the US plane had intruded intothe special economic zone in China 's coastal area , and made a turn to bump anddestroy a Chinese military aircraft .  This is an ironclad fact and can not bedenied .  However , what has been hard for people to understand is that after theincident , the US side has refused to admit its fault .  
The United States has for many years kept conducting military reconnaissance activities along China 's southeast coastal areas , and US military planes have repeatedly appeared in the skies of China 's coastal areas and have even intruded into the line of China 's territorial waters for reconnaissance .  The US plane that bombed into and destroyed China 's fighter this time is a US military reconnaissance plane equipped with sophisticated electronic reconnaissance devices as well as military intelligence gathering professionals .  
China 's military plane tailed after and conducted surveillance over the US military reconnaissance plane , which intruded into the airspace of our coastal exclusive economic zone to conduct military reconnaissance activities , according to the international law and China 's law .  Exercising sovereign right in the exclusive economic zone , and safeguarding the national defense security is just and legal behavior .  
It is a serious violation of the international law that the US military reconnaissance plane conducted military reconnaissance activities in the airspace above China 's exclusive economic zone , bombed into and destroyed China 's military plane that was carrying out the regular surveillance task , intruded into China 's territorial airspace , and infringed on China 's territorial sovereignty .  
From his election campaign , Bush was bent on pursuing a foreign policy different from that of the Clinton administration , and behaved in a hawkish style on many events to win support from the American public .  This time , shortly after the occurrence of the plane collision incident , he immediately selected the option of making a tough-worded statement on an open occasion , rather than dialing a phone call to Beijing .  
The plane collision incident was the first trial of strength in the diplomatic field with the Chinese Communists after Bush took power , but so far , various signs showed that Bush was still short of savvy and proficiency in playing such diplomatic games , and his policy toward Beijing remained unstable .  This gave Beijing an opportunity of criticizing the United States ' usual reconnaissance activities in the South China Sea , and the US side was left with a justifiable argument .  
Jin Chanrong said : Currently , the political and diplomatic channels remain the main channels for solving the plane collision incident .  The denunciations made by the Chinese Communist side against the US side 's violation of international law and the mainland 's domestic laws were mainly aimed at supporting its own position , not aimed at taking any legal action .  
Sino-US diplomatic contacts are now in their 10th day regarding the incident in which a US spy plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese fighter and arbitrarily landed at a Chinese airfield , but the problem can hardly be resolved because the United States , sticking to its high-handed stance , is unwilling to bear the responsibility , and is unwilling to apologize to China .  
Overseas Chinese leaders expressed indignation at the hegemonic act of the U.S . spy plane 's collision with a Chinese military aircraft and the illegal invasion by the American plane of Chinese territorial air space and territory .  They reproached the United States one after another , saying that overseas Chinese and the Chinese people commonly consider this incident to wholly be the legal and moral responsibility of the United States , that the attitude of the United States is unreasonable , and its way of handling the situation inferior .  
It is precisely for the strategic needs of maintaining the party 's advanced nature from beginning to end and comprehensively promoting party building and the modernization drive that Comrade Jiang Zemin , standing on the high plane of the times and history , grasping the overall situation of development at home and abroad , and summing up the experience and lessons of political party building at home and abroad , has put forward the important idea of the " three represents . "  
The US plane 's actions violated international law and relevant Chinese laws and regulations , damaged the consensus reached by China and the United States last May on avoiding dangerous military activities at sea , infringed China 's airspace and sovereignty , and threatened China 's national security .  
Tang Jiaxuan emphasized that ever since the US reconnaisance plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese military plane , the Chinese side has all along handled this incident with calmness and restraint and in accordance with international law and the provisions of relevant laws of China .  
He said the US plane intruded into China 's territorial airspace and encroached upon China 's sovereignty in violation of international law and the provisions of relevant laws of China , as well as the consensus that China and the US reached last May on avoiding dangerous maritime military activities .  Its act has thus constituted a threat to China 's national security .  
Chen Ci held that ever since the US military reconnaissance plane rammed into and destroyed a Chinese military plane , the Chinese side has all along handled this incident with calmness and restraint and in accordance with international law and the provisions of relevant laws of China .  
The spokesman said : In accordance with international law and China 's relevant law , the Chinese side absolutely has the right to carry out an overall investigation on the foreign military reconnaissance plane that damaged the Chinese plane , illegally intruded into China 's territorial airspace , and landed at China 's airport .  
Tang Jiaxuan emphasized that ever since the US reconnaissance plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese military plane , the Chinese side has all along handled this incident with calmness and restraint and in accordance with international law and the provisions of relevant laws of China .  
According to international law and the relevant laws of China , the Chinese side has every right to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the foreign military reconnaissance plane , which has rammed into and destroyed a Chinese plane and illegally intruded into China 's airspace and landed at a Chinese airport .  
After the Chinese Government announced the release of the plane crew , raging public feelings immediately appeared on the Internet . Many Internet users posted articles to express their dissatisfaction over the government for " making a concession " to the United States . Some users even posted strong words on the " Renminwang , " such as " Li Hongzhang returns from the grave ; " " Ah Q style of victory ; " " The government is too weak , it has brought disgrace upon us . "  
It was a serious incident that the United States sent a military surveillance plane to conduct spying activities over the exclusive economic zone of China 's Hainan , bumped into and destroyed a Chinese military plane , leaving the Chinese pilot missing , and then entered China 's territorial airspace and landed at Chinese airport .  
The act of the US plane violated international law and provisions of relevant Chinese laws , jeopardized the consensus on avoiding dangerous maritime military activities reached between China and the United States in May last year , infringed on China 's territorial airspace and sovereignty , and threatened China 's national security .  
The key reason is that the plane is equipped with some expensive and most advanced wide-band and fully digitized receivers instead of ordinary electronic surveillance equipment , and its all-frequency and all-band receivers are capable of intercepting or monitoring signals transmitted by the Chinese Communist forces through all frequencies .  
The incident where the US surveillance plane repeatedly infringed on our coastal waters , and rammed and destroyed the Chinese military aircraft , made the Chinese people further understand that hegemonism truly exist in the world , and aroused their fighting will to make China strong and their determination to seize the opportunity to accelerate economic development .  
Zhang Qiyue said : The US plane rammed into and destroyed a Chinese plane , resulting in the missing of a Chinese pilot , intruded into China 's airspace , and landed at a Chinese airfield without permission .  The incident has not fully concluded .  The Chinese side asks the US side to provide convincing explanations to the Chinese people , stop sending its airplanes to conduct reconnaissance activities above the Chinese coast , and take effective measures to prevent the recurrence of such incidents .  
In one way or another , overseas Chinese and Chinese nationals living in different parts of the world condemned the conduct of the US military reconnaissance plane of ramming into and destroying the Chinese aircraft .  They firmly supported the Chinese Government 's just stand , and they extended their respects to heroic pilot Wang Wei , whose whereabouts were still unknown .  
Observers believe that the Chinese government carried out a reasonable , beneficial , and moral struggle in the process of handling this matter , and forced the downright hegemonic United States government to capitulate and admit that the American spy plane had encroached upon Chinese air space leading to the collision with a Chinese fighter plane and subsequent loss of its pilot .  The US government was compelled to make multiple expressions of regret , sadness , and apology , thereby strongly protecting China 's national dignity and the country 's sovereignty .  
First they were confusing right and wrong , taking bites and demanding that China release the crew and the airplane .  Moreover , they absurdly claimed that the forced landing of the American spy plane at the Hainan Island airport was " US territory , " and that the United States had " sovereign exemption , " and China was not permitted to board the aircraft for inspection .  They completely disregarded the fact that the Chinese fighter plane had crashed and the pilot was lost , causing a tragedy for fellow Chinese officials and a Chinese household .  
After the news of the US Government 's apology to our nation for the " plane collision incident " was announced , cadres and the masses everywhere believe that this is an interim accomplishment in our government 's and people 's reasonable , beneficial , and restrained struggle against US hegemony .  The people have expressed firm support for the correct decisions adopted by our government regarding this incident and have strenuously requested that the United States immediately stop conducting surveillance activities along our coast and take practical measures to prevent this kind of incident from happening again .  
The plane collision incident provided an opportunity for the military and the hardliners inside the regime to affect the transfer of power with the impact of the people 's nationalist sentiments .  Jiang did not want to see that the incident developed to a degree that might seriously harm the Chinese Communists ' diplomatic relations with the United States , but neither could he openly show a sign of weakness and be outdone by the US side , because this would affect the legitimacy of his power status at home .  
When the news reached Huzhou that the US Government had offered an apology to the Chinese people for the incident in which a US military surveillance plane caused the crash of a Chinese military aircraft , the parents of missing Chinese pilot Wang Wei felt relieved ; meanwhile , they voiced their resolute support for the way the Chinese Government had handled the incident as well as the stand clearly stated by Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan when he accepted the US apology-giving letter .  
Xu Xinghu 's and Wang Wei 's families agreed that our government has upheld state sovereignty and national dignity in its handling of the plane collision incident , expressed firm support for our government 's correct decision , and demanded that the United States accept all responsibility for the incident and come clean with the Chinese people .  
We have ample evidence to prove that it was the US plane that violated flight rules by suddenly veering in a wide angle at the Chinese plane in normal flight , rammed into and damaged it , resulting in a missing Chinese pilot .  After the collision , the US plane intruded into China 's airspace and landed at a Chinese airport without permission from the Chinese side .  
We have ample evidence to prove that it was the US plane that violated flight rules by suddenly veering in a wide angle at the Chinese plane in normal flight , rammed into and damaged it , resulting in a missing Chinese pilot .  After the collision , the US plane intruded into China 's airspace and landed at a Chinese airport without permission from the Chinese side .  
The Chinese side absolutely could have taken necessary coercive measures in accordance with the right for self-protection stipulated in international law against such a foreign military plane that illegally entered China 's territorial airspace and landed on an airfield inside a military prohibited zone in China .  
In order to legalize this rude and unreasonable demand , the US side even made up the absurd argument that the US military plane causing the incident was a part of its territory and US state property and therefore , was eligible for sovereign immunity .  
As mentioned above , the US military reconnaissance plane abused free overflight in airspace over China 's coastal waters , violated flying rules , bumped against and destroyed a Chinese plane , and entered China 's territorial airspace and landed on China 's military airfield without authorization .  That already constituted an incident of serious violation of international law .  
Then , Wang Wei disclosed his secret to me : " There are many electronic instruments on a plane .  I come here not for the purpose of looking for a stable job after I graduate , but to lay a foundation for my future flying career . "  
The entire process of the incident was connected to historical , legal , cultural , language , and religious issues , and the only thing that was conspicuously absent was its military aspect .  US Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld did not even appear in public during the development of the incident .  It was not until 13 April that he held a news conference at which he complained that it was only the Chinese Communist plane 's provocative act that was the underlying cause of the collision .  
While performing the flying duty of tracking and monitoring the US military electronic reconnaissance plane this time , he displayed determination , courage , calmness , cool-headedness , heroism , and tenacity .  By sacrificing his life , he composed a glorious victorious song of patriotism and revolutionary heroism .  
Persistent and courageous , calm and composed , brave and unyielding , he offered his precious life in defending the country 's sovereignty and the nation 's dignity when carrying out the latest task of tracking and monitoring the US reconnaissance plane .  With an undaunted spirit of valor , he realized our army 's purpose and composed a magnificent song of patriotism and revolutionary heroism .  
However , the US military plane , disregarding the international rules for flight safety that flying vehicles must not fly in opposite directions and must not cross each other , changed course abruptly , causing the collision .  
The former official said the debriefings of the 24 crew members after their return to the United States conform to the information disclosed by the US military when the incident first broke out .  Both indicated that the US aircraft was on autopilot , and a fighter of Communist China made a quick forging ahead and pulled up from beneath the US plane , which led to the collision .  
At the end of the first round of talks between China and the United States , Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhang Qiyue held a press conference .  Besides introducing the situation of the current talks , he showed video tape recordings on a large screen and photos of the collision incident collected by the Chinese side and simulated course of the plane collision incident prepared by the Chinese side .  
Because when the US plane crew left Hainan Dao and before they arrive in Hawaii , US leaders immediately changed their attitude .  They publicly denied that they had made apologies to the Chinese side for their mistake , attempted to save face for having sent a letter to express sorry for the incident , and tried to create favorable opinions for the subsequent talks between the two sides .  
And then he heard a heaven-shocking and earth-shaking roar .  Although he was in a hurry , he still bid farewell in a leisurely manner .  Wang Wei departed from his beloved fighter plane as if a meteor painted a magnificent rainbow between the ocean and sky with his last light .  
They said : Following the plane collision incident , the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country worried about Wang Wei and shared a bitter hatred of the hegemonic act , thereby fully demonstrating the strong cohesive force of the Chinese nation .  
In Wang Wei 's home , there is an unfinished oil painting : A future Chinese Navy air force pilot flies a fighting eagle fighter plane and soars into the blue sky of the motherland while a warship of a new model cleaves a boundless expanse of blue water and cruises in the territorial waters of the motherland . . .  
When he learned that there was no more hope for Wang Wei to return alive , elder Chen Yingming , chief senior aviation industrial artist of the China Aviation Museum who is over 70 years of age , decided to make with his own hands for Wang Wei a fighter plane model named the " Blood-and-Iron Fighter Plane , " and the model would look exactly the same as the fighting eagle piloted by Wang Wei before his death .  
while undertaking this flying mission of tracking and watching this US reconnaisance plane , he flew with outstanding determination and courage , kept composed and calm , displayed heroic and stubborn spirit , and wrote with his life a stirring song of victory of patriotism and revolutionary heroism .  
" It has always been my dream to wear the green military uniform .  I want to fly a fighter plane and take to the wild blue yonder .  
The editorial emphasized that with the question of the US surveillance plane crashing with the Chinese warplane and violating China 's territorial integrity still unsolved , the United States is creating further troubles before the ones before have been resolved in deciding to sell arms to Taiwan , saying that this is not conducive to the development of Sino-US relations .  
The top level of the CPC believes , however , that Bush 's remarks represent the hawkish forces in the United States ; since the collision involving the US plane on 1 April , these forces have consistently dominated the new President 's China policy ; the hardline stance of hawkish figures at Bush 's side such as Vice President Cheney , National Security Assistant Rice , and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld in handling the collision incident has been profoundly appreciated by Bush , and so the tough US line on China will be continued .  
US President George W . Bush had made clear long before during his election campaign : China and the United States are not " strategic partners " but " strategic competitors . "  Soon after taking office , George W . Bush handled a mid-air collision incident involving a US reconnaissance aircraft and a Chinese fighter plane by persisting in being unreasonable and acting shamelessly , which has fully laid bare his hegemonistic face and sent the Sino-US relations downhill by a large margin .  
While China and the United States were entangled in a diplomatic stalemate due to the plane collision incident , a play was put on the stage in Washington : Jasuwant Singh , Indian minister of external affairs and concurrently defense minister , was visiting the United States at the invitation of US Secretary of State Colin Powell . The Pentagon also held a grand welcoming ceremony for him , including the reviewing of honor guards .  
and it is also feasible to cooperate with the electronic confrontation squad of our side to mock an SOS sent by the pilot of the enemy plane in such a way that the enemy can not distinguish whether the signal is genuine or fake , and once the enemy 's military strength is dispersed , our side can annihilate the enemy .  
The incident which occurred on 1 April in which a US military reconnaissance plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese fighter plane and then landed on Chinese territory - - the Lingshui Airport on Hainan Island - - had its first phase settled after US President Bush expressed " deep regret " and US Ambassador Preuher delivered a " letter of apology " to the Chinese foreign minister , and then the Chinese government allowed the American crew members to leave for home before Easter because of humanitarian considerations after completing some necessary procedures .  
While conducting a search operation , search and rescue teams may be shielded by a number of planes , including an early warning plane , an electronic jamming plane , an assault plane , and a fighter plane , and some warplanes conducting a search operation may also be armed with high-speed anti-radiation missiles in light of actual conditions so as to suppress an enemy surface-to-air missile base and guard against a sudden attack by the enemy .  
Since ours are modernized compound armed forces formed by various services and arms and supported by some space technology , if the commanders of our ground divisions have never seen a warship , a fighter plane , a campaign missile , or a tactical missile , and if the commanders of our naval and air units have never learned about the characteristics of a modern ground campaign , we will definitely lose the most basic knowledge support in cultivating such a concept as joint operations .  
The cunning small plane continued to climb lower in altitude and tried to shake off our planes by flying at low altitude .  Deputy group chief Li therefore circled the small plane at a low altitude in order to prevent the small plane from " slipping through the net " and to avoid a midair collision .  
With three radar operating at each radar station under normal circumstances , including a long-range surveillance radar , a long-range air route surveillance radar , and a altitude surveillance radar , the JSS system is capable of monitoring the air space under its control round the clock , detecting , tracking , and identifying an incoming enemy plane or a cruise missile , and directing and guiding air defense weapons to intercept an incoming threat as well . 
In the organizational system of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the position of Chinese Ambassador to the United States Yang Jiechi is higher than Zhou Wenzhong . However , Zhou Wenzhong 's current visit to the United States is in the capacity of a special envoy of the Chinese Government and also at a time when the final solution of the plane collision incident has been reached between the two countries .  Therefore , diplomatic circles here have paid high attention to Zhou Wenzhong 's visit to the United States .  
It is not a special case .  With the many favorable conditions , the Chen Shui-bian administration has speedily entered a stage of good diplomatic relations with the United States . On the contrary , the new politically powerful in Washington had a poor opinion of the Chinese Communists , which greatly deteriorated further after the Chinese Communists ' handling of the military plane collision incident caused ill feelings among the American people .  
in addition to displaying in highly concise language a winding yet majestic , and vigorous yet resplendent and multicolored scroll of history , the speech also stood at the plane of the era and applied " three enlightenments " to sum up and encapsulate the party 's basic experiences over 80 years and propose the great historic undertakings of two 100-year periods . 
Zhang Wannian said that General Secretary Jiang 's important speech stands at a historical , epochal , and strategic high plane , and uses a proletarian politician 's grand boldness of vision and daring combined with superior judgment - - as well as using the profound insight and enormous theoretical courage of a brilliant Marxist - - to carry out a systematic , scientific , and incisive exposition toward a series of significant questions regarding the future prospects and fate of the party and the nation .  
Analyzing the issue in the context of international strategy , how could the United States guarantee that the reconnaissance plane with sophisticated equipment would not take pictures of important military facilities along the coast and carry out " legal espionage mission " once it was permitted to cross China 's territorial airspace ?  Moreover , without regard to China 's strong objection , the United States had resumed its spying mission in the air space of South China and said that it would continue to do so .  
As disclosed by an informed source , US Secretary of State Colin Powell will be visiting Beijing around 20 July to repair the battered bilateral relations after the military plane collision incident and the US arms sales to Taiwan and to pave the way for President Bush 's official visit to China this October . He will establish with the Chinese side the general direction and main agenda of the summit meeting , and the Chinese side will recommend to the US side Bush 's specific itinerary at the request of the United States . 
Beijing 's top hierarchy recently stated its formulation on the relaxation of Sino-US relations .  It noted that as proven by facts , the Chinese government is becoming more and more mature in its handling of major international affairs , as in its crossing of swords with the United States over the military plane collision , stressing that the Chinese government has maintained national sovereignty , dignity and interests while preventing a serious impact and damage on Sino-US relations as a whole .  
After the plane collision incident , China coolly observed development of the incident and calmly dealt with it , firmly ensuring China 's sovereignty and national dignity , and did its best to take care of the general interests of Sino-US relations .  China 's attitude was neither humble nor arrogant , enabling China to very well maneuver the complicated and tense situation .  
More than 500 people from various social circles in the national capital came to the south terminal for special airplanes tonight , waiting for the arrival of the plane carrying the delegation .  
At 20:30 , the plane carrying the Beijing Olympic Games bidding delegation moved slowing into the parking apron and stopped in front of the red carpet .  Grinning from ear to ear , Li Lanqing stepped down the gangway ladder .  At this moment , the welcoming crowds rejoiced by cheering and waving colorful flags and flowers , and people expressed by excitement and elation by all means .  
After the plane collision incident in early April this year , the Chinese Government actively resolved the incident in reasonable and moderate fashion , but after the US aircrewhad returned home the US side turned around and would not admit that it was in the wrong , and the US military announced the temporary suspension of military exchanges with China .  
On 12 February , Renmin Ribao carried a commentator 's article entitled " All Members of Society Should Concern Themselves With and Give Support to Education Undertakings . " The article discussed the situation from the strategic high plane of national destiny and reinvigoration .  It said that correctly guiding young students and helping them grow up healthy and sound and enabling them to develop in an all-round way - - morally , intellectually , physically , and aesthetically - - is a major issue that has a bearing on the direction of China 's education development .  
However , relevant media personalities have totally not seriously and sincerely considered whether or not his remarks are reasonable and whether or not they are based on certain facts .  Instead , they have bludgeoned him saying he has " interfered in freedom of the press . "  They have even raised the matter to the high plane of principle and said the Central Government wants Hong Kong to practice " uniformity of public opinion " and has violated the principle " one country , two systems .

refines and summarizes anew the Marxist points on the communist party 's advanced nature ; unveils the substance and implication of the communist party 's advanced nature from the high plane of the law of social development as well as the communist party 's intrinsic progressive quality .  In his exposition , Jiang Zemin makes it clear that : only when the party clearly understands the movement of the contradiction between productive forces and production relations , firmly acting as the representative of the development requirement of China 's advanced productive forces ;  
Wen Jiabao called for the governments at all levels and pertinent departments in the disaster areas to firmly bear in mind the party 's fundamental aim of serving the people wholeheartedly , deepen their understanding of the anti-drought work from the high plane of stressing political awareness , be eager to meet the needs of the masses , think about what the masses are thinking about , and do a good job of providing relief to the disaster areas with warmth and enthusiasm in a solid manner .  
( 14 ) All levels of local Party committees and people 's governments , relevant departments of the central and state organs , and mass organizations have to take teenage students ' extracurricular education work and the building and management work of venues for teenage students ' activities as an important matter , and approach it from the high plane of implementing the strategy of rejuvenating the country with science , technology and education and pushing ahead with the building of two civilizations , and with the attitude of being highly responsible for the Party and the people .  
Moreover , the planes ' main components and parts , equipment , airborne weapons , and maintenance technology are highly dependent on foreign countries .  Once a war breaks out in the Taiwan Strait , supply for the planes will become difficult and the number of such planes owned by the Taiwan Air Force will decrease with each plane shut down .  
The " three stresses " education has been conducting at party committees above regiment level and grass-roots party organizations , the cohesive and combat forces of party committees at all levels have been generally strengthened , the ideological and political level of the vast number of party members have been raised to a new plane , troops of the whole army have been conducting mass scientific and technological training activities in a down-to-earth way and their capability for defensive battles under modern conditions has been further intensified ;  
summed up the great practice in more than 20 years of reform and opening up ; and from the high plane of history and breadth of the world 's scope , profoundly analyzed the opportunities and challenges China faces at the turn of the century and put forward the strategic tasks and guiding principles for China 's economic and social development in the next 5 to 10 years .  It is a programmatic document that will guide us in advancing socialist modernization .  
Our double-support work should meet the demand of the important thinking on the " three represents , " take the development of our social productive forces and the enhancement of our troops ' combat effectiveness as our fundamental starting point and standpoint .  We should follow the important principle of treating well the relations involving our army , government and civilians from the high plane of stressing politics , so that their unity will constantly consolidate and develop and make a still greater contribution to our reform , opening up and socialist modernization .  
Zeng : The implementation of the large-scale western development strategy to accelerate the development in the central and western regions is a major policy decision made by the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core as it looked far ahead from a high plane , took the entire situation into consideration , and oriented the development toward the 21st century , which is of momentous economic and political significance .  
Taking into consideration the country 's overall interest , basing on its correct assessment of the situation , and showing its keen determination to carry out reform , the party 's leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has put forward strategic tasks and guidelines for China 's economic and social development in the coming five to 10 years , thus drawing up a magnificent blueprint for China 's development in the new century from the high plane of history and from the angle of the entire world .  
Li Tieying pointed out in his speech , at the historic moment of the turn of the century , standing at the plane of historical materialism , Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " has made a new and scientific summation of our party 's nature , purpose , and tasks , and embodied the innovative spirit of making efforts to open up new realms in Marxism geared to the 21st century .  
In a training preview , after a new-model fighter plane took off , the weather suddenly turned nasty , and soon , the base was covered with thunder and lightning .  For the sake of safety , the fighting eagle turned to another airfield on the southeast coast and landed there .  
Lu Ming spoke on behalf of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association : From the high plane of the modernization program , we should reexamine the importance of the question of agriculture , rural areas , and peasants at the current stage , draft agricultural policies , and coordinate other policies in light of the requirements of laying stress on , supporting , and developing agriculture .  
Cadets learn the manipulation of the complex set of plane instruments in preparation for their solo flight tests . During this test an expert examiner goes up with the student , carefully observing his every motion . Successful candidates , who pass the test , are tossed into the school swimming pool as a symbolic gesture of making the grade .  
Maintenance in the ROC follows the standard operating procedures of the U . S . Federal Aviation Administration adapted for Taiwan 's island climate , in which metals more easily rust . Every plane is thoroughly maintained and inspected by licensed technicians at regular intervals and before takeoff .  
Although political considerations have held them back from making any aggressive move so far , from a purely military perspective our success during the 1958 Kinmen bombardment in downing 31 MiGs against one plane lost and gaining air supremacy over the Taiwan Strait , together with our subsequent vigilant posture , have actually made them weigh the cost of attacking Taiwan by force , " is how assemblyman Ting Shou-chung of the Legislative Yuan 's defense committee sees it . "  
As far back as the time of the prehistoric matriarchal society , the primitive people living in the Yellow River valley had begun to keep dogs . Dogs were the first domestic animals to be reared by humans , and were not only intimately involved in people 's daily lives on a prac tical level , but were also an indispensable part of life on the spiritual plane .  
But happily , since the lifting of martial law , the shackles of censorship have been removed from the written word , and politicians too have escaped the extremes of " deification " and " vilification , " to be brought back down to the plane of humanity and the ordinary citizen . And as it is no longer taboo to talk freely about politics , many people are happy to speak and readers are happy to read , and this has generated the current wave of political biographies .  
Yet , however minute the design may get , there can not be any shortcomings , or the result will be great controversy . The stamp commemorating the DGP 's 90th anniversary featured an airplane with the ROC flag on the tail . The designer depicted the plane as seen from its left side . Faithful to reality , he placed the white sun symbol of the ROC flag in the upper right-hand corner of the flag ( it is ordinarily in the upper left hand corner ) .  
It took only half the anticipated amount of time to get from initial design to mass production , greatly increasing efficiency . When this plane came onto the market , many people remained skeptical , and there was quite a controversy when some defects came to light after formal flying had begun . However , it turned out that the cause was a loose door , and there was no threat to flight safety .  
Ho Chien-min , a thirty-year-old in direct sales who grew up in a Catholic family , says that he felt less and less able to identify with Catholicism as he grew older . He had n't been to church in more than 10 years , until a few years ago , when he heard the album of Catholic Gregorian chants , and was deeply moved . " It transcends the busy mundane world , raising the listener to a higher plane and drawing people to search for their spiritual source . "  
Lee and other economy class travelers heard passengers from other airlines being taken to hotels , and saw arrangements being made for food and accomodations for the first-class passengers on the Malaysian Airlines flight . However , the sky was already lightening in the east when the elderly and infirm passengers from economy class were taken to a hotel , and the young , strong male passengers in the main cabin were left in the airport right up until the plane returned to Taipei .  
Various parties have speculated on different possible causes , including engine stoppage and hijacking . Others have even suggested that the plane was victim of an artillery shot fired during recent military exercises . However , on the day of the crash the military called off area exercises due to rain , ruling out this last possibility . But until the aircraft 's black box is recovered , there is no way of really knowing what happened .  
He continues : " Actually he was talking about things on the spiritual plane , but who 'd have thought that so soon afterwards Puli would be left in such an appalling state by an earthquake , as if it really was sunk . So we all joked that he has ' second sight . ' " " In fact he had been extremely despondent , and that 's why he was eager to turn from mere thinking and observation to action , by doing some concrete community work .  
Recalling how hard it was back then , just she and four students in a lumbering old military transport plane , the always hearty Chou laughs and relates : " The thing we were most afraid of was landing on the wrong side . As we were coming in on our approach , a student said to me , ' We 're OK . The sign says Recover the Mainland ! , not Liberate Taiwan ! ' "  
Taiwan , on the other hand , has strict laws restricting flying and has yet to issue hot-air balloon licenses , not to mention licenses for nine-seater aircraft , the most common type of recreational plane . If any engineers addicted to flying do make it to Taiwan , where can they give their passion free rein ?  
For example , he divided each wing into three equal parts and made a downward fold so that a triangular " air channel " was formed where the wings attached to the body . From here he went on to develop various designs of this " air channel plane " that extended and enlarged the channel , creating a plane with a delta-shaped wing similar to a hang glider .  
These " financial monsters " can certainly rely on the synergy of large scale and cross-financial industry operations to be more competitive worldwide . But an enterprise that 's like an octopus with intertwining tentacles everywhere can of course easily hide its evil ways . It must be overseen by a more professional , more authoritative financial organization with special regulatory responsibilities that can operate on a higher moral plane .  
It also suggests an approach that consists of a careful selection of specific activities within the sector , followed by interactions among developing countries on the conceptual plane in the first instance , moving on to detailed technical work involving programme / project preparation , analysis and implementation .  
Given the deep and glaring involvement of the Government of the Sudan , as established by incontrovertible evidence presented on the international plane , in the entire conspiracy to assassinate the Egyptian Head of State , the latest smokescreen created by the Sudan defies all logic and borders on being so farcical that the Sudan will once again fail in its futile attempt to hoodwink international opinion .  
" Run out " ( out-of-true-running ) : radial displacement in one revolution of the main spindle measured in a plane perpendicular to the spindle axis at a point on the external or internal revolving surface to be tested ( reference : " ISO " 230 Part 1-1986 , para .  NULL  
However , internal acts that may have effects on the international plane , such as fixing the extent of the various kinds of maritime jurisdiction ( territorial sea , contiguous zone , economic zone , baselines , etc . ) , should be included to the extent that such unilateral acts create legal situations which are opposable in conformity with international law .  
However , internal acts that may have effects on the international plane , such as fixing the extent of the various kinds of maritime jurisdiction ( territorial sea , contiguous zone , economic zone , baselines , etc . ) , should be included to the extent that such unilateral acts create legal situations which are opposable to other States and are permitted by international law .  
Environmental issues particularly the management of transboundary water resources , environmental pollution and the greenhouse effect long ago moved from the social and economic plane to the political one , and have acquired truly global significance .  
Li Peng hoped that the leading group and cadres in Zhangjiagang City will , from the high plane of laying emphasis on politics , identify problems from the development and dialectical viewpoint , adhere to the high standard and strict demands , exert pressure on themselves , go all out to forge ahead , and conscientiously investigate , look for , and resolve the existing outstanding problems , as well as lead the people throughout the city to open up new prospects in the reform and opening up and modernization construction in Zhangjiagang City .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's remarks have , from a high plane of historical materialism , revealed the fundamental nature of our party ; pointed out the party 's basic tasks ; and are of an important theoretical and practical significance to our efforts to further maintain the advancement of the party , retain the vigor and vitality of the party , lead the whole party and the people of the entire country to carry out struggles in unity , and build our country into a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized modern socialist power .  
In view of such a situation , the party committees at all levels in enterprises administered by central authorities should approach the matter from the high plane of stressing on politics , gain a thoroughgoing understanding on the extreme importance of the principle of " paying attention to two types of work , attaching equal importance to both , " adopt earnest and effective measures , strengthen leadership , and enhance the building of a sound party style and a clean administration in state enterprises to a new level .  
At the turn of the century , the party Central Committee put forward the strategy of extensively developing the western areas .  This is a major policy decision made by the party 's leadership collective of the third generation who look far ahead from a high plane , take the overall situation into account , judge the hour and size up the situation , and serve the new century .  
The " Proposal " elevates science and technology progress to the same high plane as reform and opening up and puts it forward as an impetus to national economic and social development .  This is a new improvement to the understanding of the impetus to the development of socialism , as well as an innovation and development in Deng Xiaoping Theory made by the third-generation central leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
The promulgation of the " Regulations on the Operation of the Anti-chemical Warfare Corps " of the new generation marked an important breakthrough made by our armed forces in their research on the characteristics and objective laws of operation under the threats of nuclear and chemical weapons , and marked a change from emphasizing protection on the same plane in the combined operation of the ground force to three-dimension protection in the joint operation of different armed services .  
We must , from the political high plane of " consolidating the ruling position of our party and guaranteeing the lengthy and peaceful reign of our country " gain a correct understanding of the great importance that lies in our effort to uphold the fundamental principle that the party commands the gun ; and must see to it that the awareness of the army soul can strike deep roots in the hearts of every officer and man .  
This former government official , who is unwilling to disclose his name , believes that because their military aircraft crashed in the incident , the Chinese communists will certainly take advantage of this incident to force the United States to apologize , despite the fact that the US Armed Forces Pacific Command announced that the EP-3 plane was performing its mission over the international open sea and did not intrude the Chinese communists ' territorial airspace .  
Some analyses say that the PRC fighter intentionally struck the American craft , thinking to force the US plane to land on Chinese soil .  Some people also say that the American plane made a sudden turn toward the Jian-8 as though it were a bicycle moving forward of its own volition .  It is difficult to grasp the distances at which fighter planes pass at high speeds , where a tiny slip can mean a crash and death to the crew .  
" Hong Kong Shang Pao " pointed out in its editorial : The pernicious incident of US military reconnaissance plane colliding with and crashing our military plane has caused an extremely great concern in the international community and particularly in Asia , and it has also aroused a strong indignation among the Chinese people .  
- - US officials are not at all concerned about the missing Chinese pilot and the destroyed Chinese fighter , endlessly stressing instead : The EP-3 electronic reconnaisance plant is covered by US sovereignty , and the Chinese side can not send people to board the plane and still less carry out a search .  They also demand that China provide assistance for repairing the plane as soon as possible , so that the crew can fly back to base as soon as possible .  
In answering questions from reporters at a press conference today , Zhu Bangzao stressed that the US aircraft that caused the incident was no ordinary plane , but was a military reconnaissance aircraft which , after crashing into the Chinese military aircraft , illegally entered Chinese airspace without the consent of the Chinese and landed at a Chinese airfield .  
After causing the incident , the US plane intruded into China 's territory and landed at a Chinese airport without permission from the Chinese side , which further violated relevant provisions of international laws and Chinese laws , thereby constituting a violation of China 's sovereign right and territorial air space .  
He said , international law applies to every country , and this US plane we are speaking of is not an ordinary plane but a military reconnaisance plane which entered China 's airspace without permission after colliding with and destroying a Chinese plane due to carrying out maneuvers contrary to regulations over China 's coastal waters , and landed at a Chinese military airfield .  
Fu Dunchun , associate professor of Hainan University , said : a US military reconnaissance plane gathered intelligence in air space over the South China Sea , bumped and damaged our military aircraft , and illegally landed on our territory .  The US side has felt no regret at all , made false countercharges and claimed that " China should be held responsible for the incident . "  The United States has totally exposed its hegemonism .  
Obviously , the whole plane collision incident took place in China 's exclusive economic zone .  The US side smashed the airplane of the Chinese side , and illegally entered Chinese territory .  As the victim country , the country where the incident took place , and the country where the aircraft that caused the incident landed , the Chinese side enjoys jurisdiction over the whole incident , including rights to conduct investigations on the incident , according to relevant international laws and regulations and Chinese laws .  
In the China-US military aircraft collision accident that took place in the airspace over the coastal area of Hainan Island , the US military surveillance plane in China 's Hainan airspace bumped into and damaged a Chinese fighter and illegally landed on Chinese territory .  The United States did not feel slightly ashamed and uneasy for this but shifted the blame to China . It claimed that " China should be responsible for the accident " and that " China 's fighters should not monitor US surveillance planes that came to spy on China . "  
Instead of giving sincere and friendly remarks , the United States couched in harsh terms and stressed with an intransigent attitude that the plane was US property and territory .  Moreover , it demanded the Chinese Government return the crew and the surveillance plane as quickly as possible .  This is absolutely a hegemonic act which is not only not in conformity with the relevant provisions outlined in international law but is also the logic of a bandit , without any reasons .  
Military sources in Beijing have revealed that the military exercise under way in the South China Sea has been affected by the collision incident and been forced to make a major readjustment ; a number of scheduled maneuvers have been cancelled and the focus has switched to dealing with the aftermath , including the order to the exercise units to repeatedly search for the missing pilot and recover the plane .  
It was impossible for the bumped pilot to respond in a flash .  Assuming the pilot could respond in an instant , it would be impossible for him to complete the whole process of changing the plane 's flying position from the moment he began to act .  Under this situation , the collision was inevitable .  
The unexpected collision of US and PRC military aircraft at a point 140 km southeast of Hainan , leading to the PRC F-8 fighter plane crashing , and the US EP-3 reconnaissance plane making a forced landing at Lingshui Airbase , is a test of the crisis management ability of both the PRC and the US . It also makes it clear that the strategic partnership relationship is finished , and determines even more how the two regard each other as strategic competitors .  
During the meeting , relevant consular officials of the Chinese Foreign Ministry pointed out to the US Embassy and Consulate officials mentioned above that after the US military reconnaissance plane bumped against and destroyed a Chinese military plane in the airspace over the coastal waters of China , it , without the permission of the Chinese side , intruded into China 's territorial airspace and landed on an airport in China . This has violated relevant provisions of the international law and relevant Chinese laws .  China has the right to investigate the entire incident .  
A vast ocean separates China and the United States . China has never sent a single soldier to areas near the US continent , nor has China dispatched a reconnaissance plane to US coastal areas .  The United States , on the contrary , has never stopped conducting hostile surveillance , probing flights and harassing activities toward China since the founding of New China .  
Certain people in the United States disregarded the basic norm of international relations and common knowledge of international law , and unilaterally demanded the Chinese side return crew members of the US plane and urged the Chinese side to return the US plane under the condition of " no further damage and contact " to the plane .  Such arrogant and unreasonable attitude has aroused great and righteous indignation in the Chinese people .  
The editorial says : The United States claims to be a country being most respectful to democracy and legal system in the world and always talks about human rights and law .  However , its military plane wantonly violated international law and paid no attention to the territories and sovereignty of another country .  
Evidently , it was the US reconnaissance plane that violated flying rules , bumped against and destroyed a Chinese military plane , and illegally intruded into China 's airspace and landed on an airport of the Chinese side , thus constituting a serious violation of China 's sovereignty and territory and threatening China 's national security .  
The US military reconnaissance plane 's spying activities in the airspace over China 's exclusive economic waters actually overran the scope of " free over-flight " allowed by international law , and violated the relevant stipulations of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea .  
After the collision incident , the US surveillance plane intruded China 's airspace and landed at a Chinese airport without permission from the Chinese side , and this was a move that further violated the regulations set forth by international and Chinese law , thus constituting a gross encroachment upon China 's sovereignty and territorial airspace .  
It was reported that before the Chinese personnel entered the landed aircraft at Hainan airfield , many electronic equipment inside the aircraft had already been destroyed .  However , before the US surveillance aircraft bumped against and damaged the Chinese fighter plane and landed at the airfield on Hainan Island , the Chinese side had already intercepted the frequency and signals used by this US surveillance aircraft to communicate with its rear during the process .  Reportedly , these signals are very valuable .  
The reconnaissance behavior of the US military surveillance plane violated the provisions of the " UN Convention on the Law of the Seas " concerning the necessity of respecting the rights of respective coastal nations in overflight of exclusive economic zones , thus posing a serious threat to China 's national security .  
In the past few days officers and men of the PLA units and armed police stationed in Hainan have expressed strong indignation at the incident in which a US military reconnaisance plane collided with and destroyed one of our military planes , intruded into Chinese airspace without permission , and landed at Lingshui airfield .  They have resolutely supported the Chinese Government 's solemn and just stance and directed their fervent patriotism into training and execution of duties .  
In the last incident , the United States used warships to follow the tracks of the " Yinhe " freighter , sent aircraft to circle over it , and created all kinds of difficulties for thefreighter .  In the current incident , the United States is rude and unreasonableand has put forth unreasonable demands , such as not allowing to conducton-board inspection of the plane and returning the plane at once , after itsplane violated China 's territorial airspace and territory .  
It has been learned that , in his recent statement issued to the press inWashington , US Secretary of State Colin Powell for the first time expressed hisregret over an incident in which a US military reconnaissance airplane collidedand damaged a Chinese fighter plane , resulting in a missing pilot whose destinyis still unknown .  
The economic and trade commissions at all levels must fullyunderstand the important significance of rectifying and standardizing marketeconomic order from the high plane of intensifying the work of public order , solidifying and developing the good momentum of national economic development , heightening the overall quality and competitiveness of the national economy , further opening wider to the outside world , and establishing and perfecting thesocialist market economic structure .  They should further enhance their senseof responsibility and sense of mission , and ceaselessly strengthen theirinitiative and consciousness in work .  
The Chinese Government and people have the right to know why the US sidefrequently dispatched military surveillance planes to China 's coastal waters tocarry out activities , why the US plane violated operational rules and suddenlyveered , bumped into , and destroyed the Chinese plane , and why the US planeintruded into China 's territorial airspace and landed at a Chinese airportwithout permission . 
The entire officers and men of Hainan 's publicsecurity and border defense units , who are shouldered with the security task ofguarding the 1,700-km coastline and 2.1-million square km of ocean , are filledwith righteous indignation at the incident in which a US militaryreconnaissance plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese military plane inmidair over the South China sea and entered China 's airspace withoutauthorization .  One after another , they indignantly condemned the US hegemonicacts .  
Reporters Li Kun and Wang Weiping report : Ma Man Kay , president of theMacao China Chamber of Commerce , pointed out that the incident in which the USmilitary reconnaissance plane ramming and damaging China 's military aircraft inairspace above China 's exclusive economic zone and entering China 's territorialairspace and landing at a Chinese airport without permission is a serious onethat has violated international law and violated China 's sovereignty andterritorial airspace .  
The Chinese planes ' surveillance was a normal act ofsafeguarding national security .  The US plane , which violated flight rules andwhich rammed and damaged the Chinese aircraft , causing its pilot missing , mustbe held accountable for all the consequences .  
Ignoring the international law , the US plane had intruded intothe special economic zone in China 's coastal area , and made a turn to bump anddestroy a Chinese military aircraft .  This is an ironclad fact and can not bedenied .  However , what has been hard for people to understand is that after theincident , the US side has refused to admit its fault .  
The United States has for many years kept conducting military reconnaissance activities along China 's southeast coastal areas , and US military planes have repeatedly appeared in the skies of China 's coastal areas and have even intruded into the line of China 's territorial waters for reconnaissance .  The US plane that bombed into and destroyed China 's fighter this time is a US military reconnaissance plane equipped with sophisticated electronic reconnaissance devices as well as military intelligence gathering professionals .  
China 's military plane tailed after and conducted surveillance over the US military reconnaissance plane , which intruded into the airspace of our coastal exclusive economic zone to conduct military reconnaissance activities , according to the international law and China 's law .  Exercising sovereign right in the exclusive economic zone , and safeguarding the national defense security is just and legal behavior .  
It is a serious violation of the international law that the US military reconnaissance plane conducted military reconnaissance activities in the airspace above China 's exclusive economic zone , bombed into and destroyed China 's military plane that was carrying out the regular surveillance task , intruded into China 's territorial airspace , and infringed on China 's territorial sovereignty .  
From his election campaign , Bush was bent on pursuing a foreign policy different from that of the Clinton administration , and behaved in a hawkish style on many events to win support from the American public .  This time , shortly after the occurrence of the plane collision incident , he immediately selected the option of making a tough-worded statement on an open occasion , rather than dialing a phone call to Beijing .  
The plane collision incident was the first trial of strength in the diplomatic field with the Chinese Communists after Bush took power , but so far , various signs showed that Bush was still short of savvy and proficiency in playing such diplomatic games , and his policy toward Beijing remained unstable .  This gave Beijing an opportunity of criticizing the United States ' usual reconnaissance activities in the South China Sea , and the US side was left with a justifiable argument .  
Jin Chanrong said : Currently , the political and diplomatic channels remain the main channels for solving the plane collision incident .  The denunciations made by the Chinese Communist side against the US side 's violation of international law and the mainland 's domestic laws were mainly aimed at supporting its own position , not aimed at taking any legal action .  
Sino-US diplomatic contacts are now in their 10th day regarding the incident in which a US spy plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese fighter and arbitrarily landed at a Chinese airfield , but the problem can hardly be resolved because the United States , sticking to its high-handed stance , is unwilling to bear the responsibility , and is unwilling to apologize to China .  
Overseas Chinese leaders expressed indignation at the hegemonic act of the U.S . spy plane 's collision with a Chinese military aircraft and the illegal invasion by the American plane of Chinese territorial air space and territory .  They reproached the United States one after another , saying that overseas Chinese and the Chinese people commonly consider this incident to wholly be the legal and moral responsibility of the United States , that the attitude of the United States is unreasonable , and its way of handling the situation inferior .  
It is precisely for the strategic needs of maintaining the party 's advanced nature from beginning to end and comprehensively promoting party building and the modernization drive that Comrade Jiang Zemin , standing on the high plane of the times and history , grasping the overall situation of development at home and abroad , and summing up the experience and lessons of political party building at home and abroad , has put forward the important idea of the " three represents . "  
The US plane 's actions violated international law and relevant Chinese laws and regulations , damaged the consensus reached by China and the United States last May on avoiding dangerous military activities at sea , infringed China 's airspace and sovereignty , and threatened China 's national security .  
Tang Jiaxuan emphasized that ever since the US reconnaisance plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese military plane , the Chinese side has all along handled this incident with calmness and restraint and in accordance with international law and the provisions of relevant laws of China .  
He said the US plane intruded into China 's territorial airspace and encroached upon China 's sovereignty in violation of international law and the provisions of relevant laws of China , as well as the consensus that China and the US reached last May on avoiding dangerous maritime military activities .  Its act has thus constituted a threat to China 's national security .  
Chen Ci held that ever since the US military reconnaissance plane rammed into and destroyed a Chinese military plane , the Chinese side has all along handled this incident with calmness and restraint and in accordance with international law and the provisions of relevant laws of China .  
The spokesman said : In accordance with international law and China 's relevant law , the Chinese side absolutely has the right to carry out an overall investigation on the foreign military reconnaissance plane that damaged the Chinese plane , illegally intruded into China 's territorial airspace , and landed at China 's airport .  
Tang Jiaxuan emphasized that ever since the US reconnaissance plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese military plane , the Chinese side has all along handled this incident with calmness and restraint and in accordance with international law and the provisions of relevant laws of China .  
According to international law and the relevant laws of China , the Chinese side has every right to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the foreign military reconnaissance plane , which has rammed into and destroyed a Chinese plane and illegally intruded into China 's airspace and landed at a Chinese airport .  
After the Chinese Government announced the release of the plane crew , raging public feelings immediately appeared on the Internet . Many Internet users posted articles to express their dissatisfaction over the government for " making a concession " to the United States . Some users even posted strong words on the " Renminwang , " such as " Li Hongzhang returns from the grave ; " " Ah Q style of victory ; " " The government is too weak , it has brought disgrace upon us . "  
It was a serious incident that the United States sent a military surveillance plane to conduct spying activities over the exclusive economic zone of China 's Hainan , bumped into and destroyed a Chinese military plane , leaving the Chinese pilot missing , and then entered China 's territorial airspace and landed at Chinese airport .  
The act of the US plane violated international law and provisions of relevant Chinese laws , jeopardized the consensus on avoiding dangerous maritime military activities reached between China and the United States in May last year , infringed on China 's territorial airspace and sovereignty , and threatened China 's national security .  
The key reason is that the plane is equipped with some expensive and most advanced wide-band and fully digitized receivers instead of ordinary electronic surveillance equipment , and its all-frequency and all-band receivers are capable of intercepting or monitoring signals transmitted by the Chinese Communist forces through all frequencies .  
The incident where the US surveillance plane repeatedly infringed on our coastal waters , and rammed and destroyed the Chinese military aircraft , made the Chinese people further understand that hegemonism truly exist in the world , and aroused their fighting will to make China strong and their determination to seize the opportunity to accelerate economic development .  
Zhang Qiyue said : The US plane rammed into and destroyed a Chinese plane , resulting in the missing of a Chinese pilot , intruded into China 's airspace , and landed at a Chinese airfield without permission .  The incident has not fully concluded .  The Chinese side asks the US side to provide convincing explanations to the Chinese people , stop sending its airplanes to conduct reconnaissance activities above the Chinese coast , and take effective measures to prevent the recurrence of such incidents .  
In one way or another , overseas Chinese and Chinese nationals living in different parts of the world condemned the conduct of the US military reconnaissance plane of ramming into and destroying the Chinese aircraft .  They firmly supported the Chinese Government 's just stand , and they extended their respects to heroic pilot Wang Wei , whose whereabouts were still unknown .  
Observers believe that the Chinese government carried out a reasonable , beneficial , and moral struggle in the process of handling this matter , and forced the downright hegemonic United States government to capitulate and admit that the American spy plane had encroached upon Chinese air space leading to the collision with a Chinese fighter plane and subsequent loss of its pilot .  The US government was compelled to make multiple expressions of regret , sadness , and apology , thereby strongly protecting China 's national dignity and the country 's sovereignty .  
First they were confusing right and wrong , taking bites and demanding that China release the crew and the airplane .  Moreover , they absurdly claimed that the forced landing of the American spy plane at the Hainan Island airport was " US territory , " and that the United States had " sovereign exemption , " and China was not permitted to board the aircraft for inspection .  They completely disregarded the fact that the Chinese fighter plane had crashed and the pilot was lost , causing a tragedy for fellow Chinese officials and a Chinese household .  
After the news of the US Government 's apology to our nation for the " plane collision incident " was announced , cadres and the masses everywhere believe that this is an interim accomplishment in our government 's and people 's reasonable , beneficial , and restrained struggle against US hegemony .  The people have expressed firm support for the correct decisions adopted by our government regarding this incident and have strenuously requested that the United States immediately stop conducting surveillance activities along our coast and take practical measures to prevent this kind of incident from happening again .  
The plane collision incident provided an opportunity for the military and the hardliners inside the regime to affect the transfer of power with the impact of the people 's nationalist sentiments .  Jiang did not want to see that the incident developed to a degree that might seriously harm the Chinese Communists ' diplomatic relations with the United States , but neither could he openly show a sign of weakness and be outdone by the US side , because this would affect the legitimacy of his power status at home .  
When the news reached Huzhou that the US Government had offered an apology to the Chinese people for the incident in which a US military surveillance plane caused the crash of a Chinese military aircraft , the parents of missing Chinese pilot Wang Wei felt relieved ; meanwhile , they voiced their resolute support for the way the Chinese Government had handled the incident as well as the stand clearly stated by Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan when he accepted the US apology-giving letter .  
Xu Xinghu 's and Wang Wei 's families agreed that our government has upheld state sovereignty and national dignity in its handling of the plane collision incident , expressed firm support for our government 's correct decision , and demanded that the United States accept all responsibility for the incident and come clean with the Chinese people .  
We have ample evidence to prove that it was the US plane that violated flight rules by suddenly veering in a wide angle at the Chinese plane in normal flight , rammed into and damaged it , resulting in a missing Chinese pilot .  After the collision , the US plane intruded into China 's airspace and landed at a Chinese airport without permission from the Chinese side .  
We have ample evidence to prove that it was the US plane that violated flight rules by suddenly veering in a wide angle at the Chinese plane in normal flight , rammed into and damaged it , resulting in a missing Chinese pilot .  After the collision , the US plane intruded into China 's airspace and landed at a Chinese airport without permission from the Chinese side .  
The Chinese side absolutely could have taken necessary coercive measures in accordance with the right for self-protection stipulated in international law against such a foreign military plane that illegally entered China 's territorial airspace and landed on an airfield inside a military prohibited zone in China .  
In order to legalize this rude and unreasonable demand , the US side even made up the absurd argument that the US military plane causing the incident was a part of its territory and US state property and therefore , was eligible for sovereign immunity .  
As mentioned above , the US military reconnaissance plane abused free overflight in airspace over China 's coastal waters , violated flying rules , bumped against and destroyed a Chinese plane , and entered China 's territorial airspace and landed on China 's military airfield without authorization .  That already constituted an incident of serious violation of international law .  
Then , Wang Wei disclosed his secret to me : " There are many electronic instruments on a plane .  I come here not for the purpose of looking for a stable job after I graduate , but to lay a foundation for my future flying career . "  
The entire process of the incident was connected to historical , legal , cultural , language , and religious issues , and the only thing that was conspicuously absent was its military aspect .  US Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld did not even appear in public during the development of the incident .  It was not until 13 April that he held a news conference at which he complained that it was only the Chinese Communist plane 's provocative act that was the underlying cause of the collision .  
While performing the flying duty of tracking and monitoring the US military electronic reconnaissance plane this time , he displayed determination , courage , calmness , cool-headedness , heroism , and tenacity .  By sacrificing his life , he composed a glorious victorious song of patriotism and revolutionary heroism .  
Persistent and courageous , calm and composed , brave and unyielding , he offered his precious life in defending the country 's sovereignty and the nation 's dignity when carrying out the latest task of tracking and monitoring the US reconnaissance plane .  With an undaunted spirit of valor , he realized our army 's purpose and composed a magnificent song of patriotism and revolutionary heroism .  
However , the US military plane , disregarding the international rules for flight safety that flying vehicles must not fly in opposite directions and must not cross each other , changed course abruptly , causing the collision .  
The former official said the debriefings of the 24 crew members after their return to the United States conform to the information disclosed by the US military when the incident first broke out .  Both indicated that the US aircraft was on autopilot , and a fighter of Communist China made a quick forging ahead and pulled up from beneath the US plane , which led to the collision .  
At the end of the first round of talks between China and the United States , Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhang Qiyue held a press conference .  Besides introducing the situation of the current talks , he showed video tape recordings on a large screen and photos of the collision incident collected by the Chinese side and simulated course of the plane collision incident prepared by the Chinese side .  
Because when the US plane crew left Hainan Dao and before they arrive in Hawaii , US leaders immediately changed their attitude .  They publicly denied that they had made apologies to the Chinese side for their mistake , attempted to save face for having sent a letter to express sorry for the incident , and tried to create favorable opinions for the subsequent talks between the two sides .  
And then he heard a heaven-shocking and earth-shaking roar .  Although he was in a hurry , he still bid farewell in a leisurely manner .  Wang Wei departed from his beloved fighter plane as if a meteor painted a magnificent rainbow between the ocean and sky with his last light .  
They said : Following the plane collision incident , the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country worried about Wang Wei and shared a bitter hatred of the hegemonic act , thereby fully demonstrating the strong cohesive force of the Chinese nation .  
In Wang Wei 's home , there is an unfinished oil painting : A future Chinese Navy air force pilot flies a fighting eagle fighter plane and soars into the blue sky of the motherland while a warship of a new model cleaves a boundless expanse of blue water and cruises in the territorial waters of the motherland . . .  
When he learned that there was no more hope for Wang Wei to return alive , elder Chen Yingming , chief senior aviation industrial artist of the China Aviation Museum who is over 70 years of age , decided to make with his own hands for Wang Wei a fighter plane model named the " Blood-and-Iron Fighter Plane , " and the model would look exactly the same as the fighting eagle piloted by Wang Wei before his death .  
while undertaking this flying mission of tracking and watching this US reconnaisance plane , he flew with outstanding determination and courage , kept composed and calm , displayed heroic and stubborn spirit , and wrote with his life a stirring song of victory of patriotism and revolutionary heroism .  
" It has always been my dream to wear the green military uniform .  I want to fly a fighter plane and take to the wild blue yonder .  
The editorial emphasized that with the question of the US surveillance plane crashing with the Chinese warplane and violating China 's territorial integrity still unsolved , the United States is creating further troubles before the ones before have been resolved in deciding to sell arms to Taiwan , saying that this is not conducive to the development of Sino-US relations .  
The top level of the CPC believes , however , that Bush 's remarks represent the hawkish forces in the United States ; since the collision involving the US plane on 1 April , these forces have consistently dominated the new President 's China policy ; the hardline stance of hawkish figures at Bush 's side such as Vice President Cheney , National Security Assistant Rice , and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld in handling the collision incident has been profoundly appreciated by Bush , and so the tough US line on China will be continued .  
US President George W . Bush had made clear long before during his election campaign : China and the United States are not " strategic partners " but " strategic competitors . "  Soon after taking office , George W . Bush handled a mid-air collision incident involving a US reconnaissance aircraft and a Chinese fighter plane by persisting in being unreasonable and acting shamelessly , which has fully laid bare his hegemonistic face and sent the Sino-US relations downhill by a large margin .  
While China and the United States were entangled in a diplomatic stalemate due to the plane collision incident , a play was put on the stage in Washington : Jasuwant Singh , Indian minister of external affairs and concurrently defense minister , was visiting the United States at the invitation of US Secretary of State Colin Powell . The Pentagon also held a grand welcoming ceremony for him , including the reviewing of honor guards .  
and it is also feasible to cooperate with the electronic confrontation squad of our side to mock an SOS sent by the pilot of the enemy plane in such a way that the enemy can not distinguish whether the signal is genuine or fake , and once the enemy 's military strength is dispersed , our side can annihilate the enemy .  
The incident which occurred on 1 April in which a US military reconnaissance plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese fighter plane and then landed on Chinese territory - - the Lingshui Airport on Hainan Island - - had its first phase settled after US President Bush expressed " deep regret " and US Ambassador Preuher delivered a " letter of apology " to the Chinese foreign minister , and then the Chinese government allowed the American crew members to leave for home before Easter because of humanitarian considerations after completing some necessary procedures .  
While conducting a search operation , search and rescue teams may be shielded by a number of planes , including an early warning plane , an electronic jamming plane , an assault plane , and a fighter plane , and some warplanes conducting a search operation may also be armed with high-speed anti-radiation missiles in light of actual conditions so as to suppress an enemy surface-to-air missile base and guard against a sudden attack by the enemy .  
Since ours are modernized compound armed forces formed by various services and arms and supported by some space technology , if the commanders of our ground divisions have never seen a warship , a fighter plane , a campaign missile , or a tactical missile , and if the commanders of our naval and air units have never learned about the characteristics of a modern ground campaign , we will definitely lose the most basic knowledge support in cultivating such a concept as joint operations .  
The cunning small plane continued to climb lower in altitude and tried to shake off our planes by flying at low altitude .  Deputy group chief Li therefore circled the small plane at a low altitude in order to prevent the small plane from " slipping through the net " and to avoid a midair collision .  
With three radar operating at each radar station under normal circumstances , including a long-range surveillance radar , a long-range air route surveillance radar , and a altitude surveillance radar , the JSS system is capable of monitoring the air space under its control round the clock , detecting , tracking , and identifying an incoming enemy plane or a cruise missile , and directing and guiding air defense weapons to intercept an incoming threat as well . 
In the organizational system of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the position of Chinese Ambassador to the United States Yang Jiechi is higher than Zhou Wenzhong . However , Zhou Wenzhong 's current visit to the United States is in the capacity of a special envoy of the Chinese Government and also at a time when the final solution of the plane collision incident has been reached between the two countries .  Therefore , diplomatic circles here have paid high attention to Zhou Wenzhong 's visit to the United States .  
It is not a special case .  With the many favorable conditions , the Chen Shui-bian administration has speedily entered a stage of good diplomatic relations with the United States . On the contrary , the new politically powerful in Washington had a poor opinion of the Chinese Communists , which greatly deteriorated further after the Chinese Communists ' handling of the military plane collision incident caused ill feelings among the American people .  
in addition to displaying in highly concise language a winding yet majestic , and vigorous yet resplendent and multicolored scroll of history , the speech also stood at the plane of the era and applied " three enlightenments " to sum up and encapsulate the party 's basic experiences over 80 years and propose the great historic undertakings of two 100-year periods . 
Zhang Wannian said that General Secretary Jiang 's important speech stands at a historical , epochal , and strategic high plane , and uses a proletarian politician 's grand boldness of vision and daring combined with superior judgment - - as well as using the profound insight and enormous theoretical courage of a brilliant Marxist - - to carry out a systematic , scientific , and incisive exposition toward a series of significant questions regarding the future prospects and fate of the party and the nation .  
Analyzing the issue in the context of international strategy , how could the United States guarantee that the reconnaissance plane with sophisticated equipment would not take pictures of important military facilities along the coast and carry out " legal espionage mission " once it was permitted to cross China 's territorial airspace ?  Moreover , without regard to China 's strong objection , the United States had resumed its spying mission in the air space of South China and said that it would continue to do so .  
As disclosed by an informed source , US Secretary of State Colin Powell will be visiting Beijing around 20 July to repair the battered bilateral relations after the military plane collision incident and the US arms sales to Taiwan and to pave the way for President Bush 's official visit to China this October . He will establish with the Chinese side the general direction and main agenda of the summit meeting , and the Chinese side will recommend to the US side Bush 's specific itinerary at the request of the United States . 
Beijing 's top hierarchy recently stated its formulation on the relaxation of Sino-US relations .  It noted that as proven by facts , the Chinese government is becoming more and more mature in its handling of major international affairs , as in its crossing of swords with the United States over the military plane collision , stressing that the Chinese government has maintained national sovereignty , dignity and interests while preventing a serious impact and damage on Sino-US relations as a whole .  
After the plane collision incident , China coolly observed development of the incident and calmly dealt with it , firmly ensuring China 's sovereignty and national dignity , and did its best to take care of the general interests of Sino-US relations .  China 's attitude was neither humble nor arrogant , enabling China to very well maneuver the complicated and tense situation .  
More than 500 people from various social circles in the national capital came to the south terminal for special airplanes tonight , waiting for the arrival of the plane carrying the delegation .  
At 20:30 , the plane carrying the Beijing Olympic Games bidding delegation moved slowing into the parking apron and stopped in front of the red carpet .  Grinning from ear to ear , Li Lanqing stepped down the gangway ladder .  At this moment , the welcoming crowds rejoiced by cheering and waving colorful flags and flowers , and people expressed by excitement and elation by all means .  
After the plane collision incident in early April this year , the Chinese Government actively resolved the incident in reasonable and moderate fashion , but after the US aircrewhad returned home the US side turned around and would not admit that it was in the wrong , and the US military announced the temporary suspension of military exchanges with China .  
On 12 February , Renmin Ribao carried a commentator 's article entitled " All Members of Society Should Concern Themselves With and Give Support to Education Undertakings . " The article discussed the situation from the strategic high plane of national destiny and reinvigoration .  It said that correctly guiding young students and helping them grow up healthy and sound and enabling them to develop in an all-round way - - morally , intellectually , physically , and aesthetically - - is a major issue that has a bearing on the direction of China 's education development .  
However , relevant media personalities have totally not seriously and sincerely considered whether or not his remarks are reasonable and whether or not they are based on certain facts .  Instead , they have bludgeoned him saying he has " interfered in freedom of the press . "  They have even raised the matter to the high plane of principle and said the Central Government wants Hong Kong to practice " uniformity of public opinion " and has violated the principle " one country , two systems . "

refines and summarizes anew the Marxist points on the communist party 's advanced nature ; unveils the substance and implication of the communist party 's advanced nature from the high plane of the law of social development as well as the communist party 's intrinsic progressive quality .  In his exposition , Jiang Zemin makes it clear that : only when the party clearly understands the movement of the contradiction between productive forces and production relations , firmly acting as the representative of the development requirement of China 's advanced productive forces ;  
Wen Jiabao called for the governments at all levels and pertinent departments in the disaster areas to firmly bear in mind the party 's fundamental aim of serving the people wholeheartedly , deepen their understanding of the anti-drought work from the high plane of stressing political awareness , be eager to meet the needs of the masses , think about what the masses are thinking about , and do a good job of providing relief to the disaster areas with warmth and enthusiasm in a solid manner .  
( 14 ) All levels of local Party committees and people 's governments , relevant departments of the central and state organs , and mass organizations have to take teenage students ' extracurricular education work and the building and management work of venues for teenage students ' activities as an important matter , and approach it from the high plane of implementing the strategy of rejuvenating the country with science , technology and education and pushing ahead with the building of two civilizations , and with the attitude of being highly responsible for the Party and the people .  
Moreover , the planes ' main components and parts , equipment , airborne weapons , and maintenance technology are highly dependent on foreign countries .  Once a war breaks out in the Taiwan Strait , supply for the planes will become difficult and the number of such planes owned by the Taiwan Air Force will decrease with each plane shut down .  
The " three stresses " education has been conducting at party committees above regiment level and grass-roots party organizations , the cohesive and combat forces of party committees at all levels have been generally strengthened , the ideological and political level of the vast number of party members have been raised to a new plane , troops of the whole army have been conducting mass scientific and technological training activities in a down-to-earth way and their capability for defensive battles under modern conditions has been further intensified ;  
summed up the great practice in more than 20 years of reform and opening up ; and from the high plane of history and breadth of the world 's scope , profoundly analyzed the opportunities and challenges China faces at the turn of the century and put forward the strategic tasks and guiding principles for China 's economic and social development in the next 5 to 10 years .  It is a programmatic document that will guide us in advancing socialist modernization .  
Our double-support work should meet the demand of the important thinking on the " three represents , " take the development of our social productive forces and the enhancement of our troops ' combat effectiveness as our fundamental starting point and standpoint .  We should follow the important principle of treating well the relations involving our army , government and civilians from the high plane of stressing politics , so that their unity will constantly consolidate and develop and make a still greater contribution to our reform , opening up and socialist modernization .  
Zeng : The implementation of the large-scale western development strategy to accelerate the development in the central and western regions is a major policy decision made by the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core as it looked far ahead from a high plane , took the entire situation into consideration , and oriented the development toward the 21st century , which is of momentous economic and political significance .  
Taking into consideration the country 's overall interest , basing on its correct assessment of the situation , and showing its keen determination to carry out reform , the party 's leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has put forward strategic tasks and guidelines for China 's economic and social development in the coming five to 10 years , thus drawing up a magnificent blueprint for China 's development in the new century from the high plane of history and from the angle of the entire world .  
Li Tieying pointed out in his speech , at the historic moment of the turn of the century , standing at the plane of historical materialism , Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " has made a new and scientific summation of our party 's nature , purpose , and tasks , and embodied the innovative spirit of making efforts to open up new realms in Marxism geared to the 21st century .  
In a training preview , after a new-model fighter plane took off , the weather suddenly turned nasty , and soon , the base was covered with thunder and lightning .  For the sake of safety , the fighting eagle turned to another airfield on the southeast coast and landed there .  
Lu Ming spoke on behalf of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association : From the high plane of the modernization program , we should reexamine the importance of the question of agriculture , rural areas , and peasants at the current stage , draft agricultural policies , and coordinate other policies in light of the requirements of laying stress on , supporting , and developing agriculture .  
Cadets learn the manipulation of the complex set of plane instruments in preparation for their solo flight tests . During this test an expert examiner goes up with the student , carefully observing his every motion . Successful candidates , who pass the test , are tossed into the school swimming pool as a symbolic gesture of making the grade .  
Maintenance in the ROC follows the standard operating procedures of the U . S . Federal Aviation Administration adapted for Taiwan 's island climate , in which metals more easily rust . Every plane is thoroughly maintained and inspected by licensed technicians at regular intervals and before takeoff .  
Although political considerations have held them back from making any aggressive move so far , from a purely military perspective our success during the 1958 Kinmen bombardment in downing 31 MiGs against one plane lost and gaining air supremacy over the Taiwan Strait , together with our subsequent vigilant posture , have actually made them weigh the cost of attacking Taiwan by force , " is how assemblyman Ting Shou-chung of the Legislative Yuan 's defense committee sees it . "  
As far back as the time of the prehistoric matriarchal society , the primitive people living in the Yellow River valley had begun to keep dogs . Dogs were the first domestic animals to be reared by humans , and were not only intimately involved in people 's daily lives on a prac tical level , but were also an indispensable part of life on the spiritual plane .  
But happily , since the lifting of martial law , the shackles of censorship have been removed from the written word , and politicians too have escaped the extremes of " deification " and " vilification , " to be brought back down to the plane of humanity and the ordinary citizen . And as it is no longer taboo to talk freely about politics , many people are happy to speak and readers are happy to read , and this has generated the current wave of political biographies .  
Yet , however minute the design may get , there can not be any shortcomings , or the result will be great controversy . The stamp commemorating the DGP 's 90th anniversary featured an airplane with the ROC flag on the tail . The designer depicted the plane as seen from its left side . Faithful to reality , he placed the white sun symbol of the ROC flag in the upper right-hand corner of the flag ( it is ordinarily in the upper left hand corner ) .  
It took only half the anticipated amount of time to get from initial design to mass production , greatly increasing efficiency . When this plane came onto the market , many people remained skeptical , and there was quite a controversy when some defects came to light after formal flying had begun . However , it turned out that the cause was a loose door , and there was no threat to flight safety .  
Ho Chien-min , a thirty-year-old in direct sales who grew up in a Catholic family , says that he felt less and less able to identify with Catholicism as he grew older . He had n't been to church in more than 10 years , until a few years ago , when he heard the album of Catholic Gregorian chants , and was deeply moved . " It transcends the busy mundane world , raising the listener to a higher plane and drawing people to search for their spiritual source . "  
Lee and other economy class travelers heard passengers from other airlines being taken to hotels , and saw arrangements being made for food and accomodations for the first-class passengers on the Malaysian Airlines flight . However , the sky was already lightening in the east when the elderly and infirm passengers from economy class were taken to a hotel , and the young , strong male passengers in the main cabin were left in the airport right up until the plane returned to Taipei .  
Various parties have speculated on different possible causes , including engine stoppage and hijacking . Others have even suggested that the plane was victim of an artillery shot fired during recent military exercises . However , on the day of the crash the military called off area exercises due to rain , ruling out this last possibility . But until the aircraft 's black box is recovered , there is no way of really knowing what happened .  
He continues : " Actually he was talking about things on the spiritual plane , but who 'd have thought that so soon afterwards Puli would be left in such an appalling state by an earthquake , as if it really was sunk . So we all joked that he has ' second sight . ' " " In fact he had been extremely despondent , and that 's why he was eager to turn from mere thinking and observation to action , by doing some concrete community work .  
Recalling how hard it was back then , just she and four students in a lumbering old military transport plane , the always hearty Chou laughs and relates : " The thing we were most afraid of was landing on the wrong side . As we were coming in on our approach , a student said to me , ' We 're OK . The sign says Recover the Mainland ! , not Liberate Taiwan ! ' "  
Taiwan , on the other hand , has strict laws restricting flying and has yet to issue hot-air balloon licenses , not to mention licenses for nine-seater aircraft , the most common type of recreational plane . If any engineers addicted to flying do make it to Taiwan , where can they give their passion free rein ?  
For example , he divided each wing into three equal parts and made a downward fold so that a triangular " air channel " was formed where the wings attached to the body . From here he went on to develop various designs of this " air channel plane " that extended and enlarged the channel , creating a plane with a delta-shaped wing similar to a hang glider .  
These " financial monsters " can certainly rely on the synergy of large scale and cross-financial industry operations to be more competitive worldwide . But an enterprise that 's like an octopus with intertwining tentacles everywhere can of course easily hide its evil ways . It must be overseen by a more professional , more authoritative financial organization with special regulatory responsibilities that can operate on a higher moral plane .  
It also suggests an approach that consists of a careful selection of specific activities within the sector , followed by interactions among developing countries on the conceptual plane in the first instance , moving on to detailed technical work involving programme / project preparation , analysis and implementation .  
Given the deep and glaring involvement of the Government of the Sudan , as established by incontrovertible evidence presented on the international plane , in the entire conspiracy to assassinate the Egyptian Head of State , the latest smokescreen created by the Sudan defies all logic and borders on being so farcical that the Sudan will once again fail in its futile attempt to hoodwink international opinion .  
" Run out " ( out-of-true-running ) : radial displacement in one revolution of the main spindle measured in a plane perpendicular to the spindle axis at a point on the external or internal revolving surface to be tested ( reference : " ISO " 230 Part 1-1986 , para .  NULL  
However , internal acts that may have effects on the international plane , such as fixing the extent of the various kinds of maritime jurisdiction ( territorial sea , contiguous zone , economic zone , baselines , etc . ) , should be included to the extent that such unilateral acts create legal situations which are opposable in conformity with international law .  
However , internal acts that may have effects on the international plane , such as fixing the extent of the various kinds of maritime jurisdiction ( territorial sea , contiguous zone , economic zone , baselines , etc . ) , should be included to the extent that such unilateral acts create legal situations which are opposable to other States and are permitted by international law .  
Environmental issues particularly the management of transboundary water resources , environmental pollution and the greenhouse effect long ago moved from the social and economic plane to the political one , and have acquired truly global significance .
