It is incumbent upon the Security Council to adopt specific measures to deal with Israeli intransigence in its non-compliance with Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) .  
The perpetration of acts of terrorism and the imposition of inhumane measures by the Israeli military are neither surprising nor a new phenomenon - for they are integral to the expansionist and aggressive nature of this regime , which has disregarded the will of the international community and violated numerous General Assembly resolutions and Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) with impunity .
